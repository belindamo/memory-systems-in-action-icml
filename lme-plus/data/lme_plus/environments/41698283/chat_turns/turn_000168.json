  "content": "**Number of workout days per week:**\n\nThe American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week. Additionally, they suggest 2-3 days of strength training per week.\n\nFor a beginner, 3-4 days of exercise per week is a good starting point. This allows for some consistency while also giving your body time to recover. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase the frequency and intensity of your workouts.\n\n**Cardio to strength training ratio:**\n\nAim for a balance between cardio and strength training. Here's a general guideline:\n\n* For weight loss: 2-3 cardio days and 2 strength training days per week\n* For overall fitness and maintenance: 2 cardio days and 3 strength training days per week\n* For building muscle: 1-2 cardio days and 3-4 strength training days per week\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point, and you can adjust the ratio based on your goals and progress.\n\n**Example workout split:**\n\nHere's an example workout split for a 4-day per week routine:\n\n* Monday: Cardio day (30-45 minutes)\n* Tuesday: Upper body strength training (30-45 minutes)\n* Thursday: Cardio day (30-45 minutes)\n* Friday: Lower body strength training (30-45 minutes)\n\nThis split allows for two cardio days, one upper body strength training day, and one lower body strength training day. You can adjust the specific exercises, intensity, and duration based on your goals and fitness level.\n\n**Tips for beginners:**\n\n* Start with shorter workouts (20-30 minutes) and gradually increase the duration as you build endurance.\n* Begin with lighter weights and higher reps (12-15) for strength training, and gradually increase the weight and lower the reps as you build strength.\n* Rest days are essential for recovery, so make sure to include at least one or two rest days per week.\n\nRemember, consistency and patience are key. It's better to start with a manageable schedule and gradually increase the intensity and frequency than to try to do too much too soon and risk burnout or injury.\n\nHow does this help? Do you have any other questions or would you like to discuss your specific goals and schedule further?",
