Logical matrices, also known as logical matrices of Ryszard W\u00f3jcicki, are a mathematical model used in non-classical logics to describe the truth values of propositions in different states of a system. Here is a possible way to give a formal semantics for the scenario using logical matrices:\n\nFirst, let's define the following terms:\n\n* M: the man\n* B: the bartender\n* ID: the man's identification\n* T: the man's age\n* S: the set of possible states of the system\n* walk(bar): the action of walking into a bar\n* ask(beer): the action of asking for a beer\n* ask(ID, M): the action of asking M for ID\n* claim(not(have(ID))): the action of claiming not to have ID\n* ask(T, M): the action of asking M how old he is\n* reply(T=21): the action of replying that T is equal to 21\n* ask(T=21, not(have(ID)), M): the action of asking M how he can be 21 years old if he does not have any ID\n* respond(time\\_traveler(future)): the action of responding that he is a time traveler from the future\n* exist(ID, time\\_period(M)): the existence of ID in the time period of M\n\nNow, we can define a logical matrix as a matrix M with rows representing different states in S and columns representing different atomic propositions. Each entry in the matrix M[i, j] is a truth value representing the truth value of the proposition represented by the jth column in the ith state.\n\nFor example, we might define a logical matrix M for the scenario as follows:\n\n|  | M(walk(bar)) | M(ask(beer)) | B(ask(ID, M)) | M(claim(not(have(ID)))) | B(ask(T, M)) | M(reply(T=21)) | B(ask(T=21, not(have(ID)), M)) | M(respond(time\\_traveler(future))) | not(exist(ID, time\\_period(M))) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| state 1 | true | true | true | false | true | true | false | false | false |\n| state 2 | false | false | false | true | false | false | true | true | true |\n\nIn this logical matrix, the first row represents the state {M: \"time traveler\", B: \"bartender\", ID: \"none\", T: 21}, and the second row represents the state {M: \"bartender\", B: \"time traveler\", ID: \"none\", T: 21}.
