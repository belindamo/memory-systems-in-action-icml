  "content": "The skewness and kurtosis values for the 'rejection rate' column also suggest that the data is not normally distributed. A skewness value of 1.82 is significantly different from 0, which indicates that the data is not symmetrical and likely has a positive skew. Similarly, a kurtosis value of 4.92 is significantly different from 3 (Fisher's kurtosis), suggesting that the shape of the distribution deviates from a normal distribution, possibly with heavier tails or a more peaked distribution.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the 'rejection rate' column is not normally distributed. In this case, using a rank-based correlation method like Spearman's correlation is appropriate for your analysis, as it is more robust to outliers and does not assume normality.",
