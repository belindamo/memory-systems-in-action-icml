  "content": "Sure! Here is the rest of the description of the formal semantics for the scenario using logical matrices with three truth-values:\n\nThen, we need to define an interpretation function for the logical connectives. For example, we might define the interpretation function as follows:\n\n* \u00ac: if the input is 1, the output is -1; if the input is -1, the output is 1; if the input is 0, the output is 0.\n* \u2227: if both inputs are 1, the output is 1; if both inputs are -1, the output is -1; otherwise, the output is 0.\n* \u2228: if either input is 1, the output is 1; if either input is -1, the output is -1; otherwise, the output is 0.\n* \u2192: if the first input is 0 or the second input is 1, the output is 1; if the first input is -1 or the second input is -1, the output is -1; otherwise, the output is 0.\n\nWith these definitions, we can use the interpretation function to assign truth-values to the propositions in the scenario. For example, we might assign the truth-value 1 to the proposition \"M(walk(bar))\" in one state and the truth-value 0 to the proposition \"M(walk(bar))\" in another state, depending on whether M is walking into a bar in those states.\n\nI hope this revised version of the formal semantics helps to illustrate how logical matrices can be used to give a formal semantics for a scenario in which the strings \"M\" and \"walk\" are interpreted as logical connectives. Please let me know if you have any further questions!",
