I'll describe how I shared their promotional post on my story and got a 10% discount on my first purchase. Then, I'll talk about how I posted a picture wearing their jeans and they liked and commented on my post. I might also mention how that made me feel, like I was part of a community or something. Do you think I should include the part about my friend Rachel who messaged me after seeing my post about the charity organization? It's not directly related to the clothing brand, but it shows how social media can lead to unexpected connections.",
