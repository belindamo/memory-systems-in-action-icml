Specifically, I am able to work a maximum of 15 hours per week.\n\nThis means that for long-time work, I would need to plan and manage my time carefully to ensure that I am able to deliver high-quality work within the available time frame. I am also open to discussing and adjusting my availability on a case-by-case basis to accommodate the specific needs of the project and the client.\n\nOverall, while I do have some constraints on the number of hours I can work each week, I am available for long-time work and am willing to be flexible to meet the needs of my clients.",
