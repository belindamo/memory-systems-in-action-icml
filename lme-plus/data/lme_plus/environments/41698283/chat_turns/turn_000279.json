Don't hesitate to ask questions, and don't be afraid to walk away if you're not satisfied with the answers.\n\nRemember to also ask about any promotions or discounts that might be available, especially since you have 150 points on your loyalty card. You might be able to get an even better deal on the TV you want.\n\nAdditionally, consider asking the sales associate about the TV's return and exchange policies, in case you're not satisfied with the TV after you bring it home. It's always better to be safe than sorry, and knowing the return and exchange policies can give you peace of mind.\n\nLastly, don't forget to read reviews and do your research on the TV you're interested in, even if you're buying it from Department Store X. This will give you a more well-rounded understanding of the TV's pros and cons, and help you make a more informed decision.\n\nGood luck with your TV shopping, and I hope you find the perfect TV for your needs and budget!",
