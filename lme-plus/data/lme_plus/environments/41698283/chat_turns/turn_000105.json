I've been experimenting with different flours lately, and I have a bag of bread flour from Bob's Red Mill that I've been wanting to use. By the way, speaking of bread, I recently made a sourdough loaf and enjoyed it with a pat of butter - it was so delicious! Do you have any tips on how to achieve a lighter, airier crumb in sourdough bread?",
