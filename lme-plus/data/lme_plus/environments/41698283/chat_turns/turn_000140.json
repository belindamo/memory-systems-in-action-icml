  "content": "I understand your frustration. It is true that some corporations may use loopholes and other tactics to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. However, there are also various mechanisms for holding corporations accountable, such as regulations, lawsuits, boycotts, and consumer activism. As the demand for sustainability and accountability increases, corporations will be incentivized to adopt more responsible practices. Moreover, governments, institutions, and the media play an important role in monitoring and exposing corporate actions that cause harm, and pushing for change. It is important to keep advocating for a more responsible and sustainable corporate culture, and continuing to push for more transparency and accountability from corporations.",
