  "content": "As a freelance designer, I am open to working on a wide range of UI/UX projects, including small projects such as designing 3 mobile screens. However, I do have some constraints on the minimum size of the project that I am able to take on.\n\nSpecifically, I am not able to take on projects that are very small or have a very limited scope, such as a single mobile screen or a simple website redesign. This is because I have a high hourly rate and very small projects may not be financially viable for me to work on.\n\nIn cases where the client has a very small project, I may be able to refer them to other designers who may be better suited to handle their needs. Alternatively, I may be able to suggest ways to expand the scope of the project to make it more feasible for me to work on.\n\nOverall, while I am open to working on small UI/UX projects, I do have some constraints on the minimum size of the project that I am able to take on.",
