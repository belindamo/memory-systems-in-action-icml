  "content": "Working with fresh rosemary can be a bit tricky, but with some tips, you'll be a pro in no time!\n\n**Handling Fresh Rosemary:**\n\n1. **Choose fresh, fragrant sprigs**: Select rosemary sprigs with a vibrant green color and a potent, piney aroma. Avoid wilted or brownish sprigs, as they can be bitter.\n2. **Store rosemary properly**: Keep fresh rosemary in a plastic bag or wrap it in plastic wrap in the refrigerator to maintain its flavor and aroma. It can last up to 1 week.\n3. **Chop rosemary just before using**: Chop the rosemary leaves just before adding them to the dough to release their oils and flavors.\n\n**Using Fresh Rosemary in Bread:**\n\n1. **Use the right amount**: For the Rosemary and Olive Oil Focaccia recipe, use about 2-3 sprigs of fresh rosemary, chopped to release about 2-3 tablespoons of leaves. You can adjust the amount to your taste, but start with this as a guideline.\n2. **Distribute rosemary evenly**: Mix the chopped rosemary into the dough during the initial mixing phase, so it's evenly distributed throughout the dough.\n3. **Be mindful of rosemary's potency**: Rosemary can be overpowering, so start with a smaller amount and taste the dough as you go. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess rosemary flavor.\n4. **Consider using a combination of rosemary and other herbs**: Pairing rosemary with other herbs like thyme, oregano, or parsley can create a more complex, balanced flavor profile.\n\n**Tips for the Rosemary and Olive Oil Focaccia Recipe:**\n\n1. **Don't overmix the dough**: Mix the ingredients just until they come together in a shaggy mass. Overmixing can lead to a dense, tough focaccia.\n2. **Let the dough rest**: Allow the dough to rest for 10-15 minutes after the initial mixing phase. This helps the flour absorb the liquid and the yeast to activate.\n3. **Don't over-proof the dough**: Focaccia is best when it's lightly proofed, so keep an eye on the dough's progress and bake it when it's just slightly puffed.\n4. **Use high-quality olive oil**: Choose a good-quality, extra-virgin olive oil for the best flavor.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a delicious, fragrant Rosemary and Olive Oil Focaccia that's sure to impress!",
