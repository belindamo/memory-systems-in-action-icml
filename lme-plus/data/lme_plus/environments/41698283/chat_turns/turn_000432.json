While I don't have real-time access to their exact tour dates, I can suggest some festivals where they might make an appearance:\n\n1. **Rock festivals**: Imagine Dragons are known for their high-energy live performances, so they're a great fit for rock and alternative festivals. Keep an eye on lineups for festivals like:\n\t* Rock on the Range (Columbus, OH)\n\t* Carolina Rebellion (Concord, NC)\n\t* Welcome to Rockville (Jacksonville, FL)\n\t* Aftershock Festival (Sacramento, CA)\n2. **Multi-genre festivals**: Imagine Dragons have a broad appeal, so they might be booked for larger, multi-genre festivals like:\n\t* Lollapalooza (Chicago, IL)\n\t* Austin City Limits Music Festival (Austin, TX)\n\t* Kaaboo Del Mar (Del Mar, CA)\n\t* Music Midtown (Atlanta, GA)\n3. **European festivals**: Imagine Dragons are popular worldwide, so they might perform at European festivals like:\n\t* Rock am Ring (N\u00fcrburgring, Germany)\n\t* Rock im Park (Nuremberg, Germany)\n\t* Download Festival (UK)\n\t* Sziget Festival (Budapest, Hungary)\n\nKeep an eye on these festivals' websites and lineups, as well as Imagine Dragons' social media and Songkick page, for any updates on their summer festival appearances.\n\nRemember to stay tuned for festival lineup announcements, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need more recommendations or have any other questions!",
