Here is a revised version of the formal semantics for the scenario using logical matrices with three truth-values:\n\nFirst, let's define the following terms:\n\n* M: the man\n* B: the bartender\n* ID: the man's identification\n* T: the man's age\n* walk(bar): the action of walking into a bar\n* ask(beer): the action of asking for a beer\n* ask(ID, M): the action of asking M for ID\n* claim(not(have(ID))): the action of claiming not to have ID\n* ask(T, M): the action of asking M how old he is\n* reply(T=21): the action of replying that T is equal to 21\n* ask(T=21, not(have(ID)), M): the action of asking M how he can be 21 years old if he does not have any ID\n* respond(time\\_traveler(future)): the action of responding that he is a time traveler from the future\n* exist(ID, time\\_period(M)): the existence of ID in the time period of M\n\nNext, we need to define a set of truth-values and a subset of those values called designated truth-values. For example, we might define the set of truth-values as {-1, 0, 1}, where -1 represents \"neither true nor false\", 0 represents \"false\", and 1 represents \"true\". We might then define the set of designated truth-values as {1, -1}, meaning that the values 1 and -",
