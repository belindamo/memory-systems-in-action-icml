Bread flour will produce a slightly different texture and flavor compared to all-purpose flour, so let's explore what you can expect:\n\n**Using Bread Flour in the King Arthur Flour's Classic Sourdough Recipe:**\n\n1. **Chewier crumb**: Bread flour has a higher protein content than all-purpose flour, which will result in a chewier, more robust crumb. This can be a great feature in a sourdough bread, especially if you prefer a heartier texture.\n2. **Better gluten development**: The higher protein content in bread flour will also help develop a stronger gluten network, which can lead to a more open, airy crumb and a more tender crust.\n3. **Slightly sweeter flavor**: Bread flour can impart a slightly sweeter flavor to the bread, which might balance out the tanginess of the sourdough starter.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that bread flour can also:\n\n1. **Require more water**: Bread flour tends to absorb more water than all-purpose flour, so you might need to adjust the water content in the recipe. Start with the same amount of water and add more as needed to achieve the right consistency.\n2. **Produce a denser dough**: The higher protein content in bread flour can lead to a denser dough, which might require a bit more effort to shape and proof.\n\nTo make the most of using bread flour in this recipe, I recommend:\n\n1. **Start with a smaller amount of water**: Begin with the same amount of water as the recipe calls for, and then add more as needed to achieve a shaggy dough.\n2. **Monitor the dough's progress**: Keep an eye on the dough's progress during fermentation and proofing, and adjust the recipe as needed.\n3. **Be gentle when shaping**: Bread flour can make the dough more delicate, so handle it gently when shaping the loaf to avoid developing too much tension.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a delicious sourdough bread using bread flour. Remember, it's all about experimentation and adjusting the recipe to your liking. Happy baking!",
