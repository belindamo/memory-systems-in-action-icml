  "content": "That's awesome! Imagine Dragons are known for their high-energy live performances, and I'm sure it was an unforgettable experience! The Wells Fargo Center is a great venue, too - the atmosphere must have been electric!\n\nWhat was your favorite part of the show? Did they play any of their new songs or focus on their older hits? And how was the crowd energy? I'd love to hear more about your experience!",
