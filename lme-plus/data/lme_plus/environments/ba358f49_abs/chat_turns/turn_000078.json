I want to make it a habit, but I also don't want to feel too pressured or stressed about it. I'd like to approach it as a relaxing and enjoyable activity, where I can just let my thoughts and ideas flow onto the page. I'm also thinking about dedicating a specific section of my journal to my new watercolor painting, where I can record my thoughts and feelings about the piece, as well as any inspiration or ideas I get from it. What do you think?",
