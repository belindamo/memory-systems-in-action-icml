  "content": "The Paris Agreement outlines a framework in which countries commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The main goal of the agreement is to reduce carbon emissions to achieve this global temperature target. The Paris Agreement uses a bottom-up approach where countries set individual targets, also known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), based on their domestic circumstances, capabilities, and priorities. \n\nHere's how the Paris Agreement will reduce carbon emissions from participating countries:\n\n1. Increasing ambition: The Paris Agreement requires countries to update their NDCs every five years and to reflect increasing ambition. This means that countries are expected to increase their climate targets over time, making their climate efforts more stringent.\n\n2. Reporting and transparency: Under the Paris Agreement, countries are required to regularly report on their emissions and progress towards meeting their climate targets. This reporting allows for greater transparency and accountability, which is essential for ensuring that countries are taking significant and meaningful action to reduce emissions.\n\n3. International cooperation: The Paris Agreement promotes international cooperation to address climate change, including cooperation on developing and sharing technologies, knowledge, and best practices to address climate change.\n\n4. Financial support: The Paris Agreement also includes provisions for financial support to help developing countries transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. Developed countries have committed to providing financial resources to support developing countries in their efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy and to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn summary, the Paris Agreement provides a framework for countries to take ambitious action on climate change by setting national targets, regularly reporting on progress, promoting international cooperation, and providing financial support for developing countries. By doing so, it aims to significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and limit the impact of climate change on communities and ecosystems across the world.",
