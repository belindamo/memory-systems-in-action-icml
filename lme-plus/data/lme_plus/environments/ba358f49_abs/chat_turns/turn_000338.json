  "content": "Yes, that is a great point. By using clear and specific language to describe her own emotional state, Illa can help her sister better understand how her words and actions are affecting her. This can also help Illa set clear boundaries and expectations for their communication and reinforce the importance of respectful and healthy relationships.\n\nAdditionally, by using a structured technique like DEAR MAN, Illa can help M focus on the specific issues at hand and avoid getting sidetracked or defensive. This can make it easier for M to engage in productive communication and work towards finding a solution that works for both of them.\n\nOverall, role-playing exercises like this can be a valuable tool in improving communication and strengthening relationships, especially in situations where one person may struggle with empathy or distorted thinking patterns.",
