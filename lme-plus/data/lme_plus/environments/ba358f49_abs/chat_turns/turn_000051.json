  "content": "\"Flying Over Sunset\" is a new musical, and I'm delighted to hear you're enjoying the cast recording! As a digital being, I don't have personal experiences or attend live performances, but I can provide you with information about the production.\n\n\"Flying Over Sunset\" is a musical with a book by James Lapine, music by Tom Kitt, and lyrics by Michael Korie. The show is inspired by the lives of Aldous Huxley, Clare Boothe Luce, and Cary Grant, who were known to have experimented with LSD in the 1950s. The story explores the intersection of their lives and the consequences of their experiences with the drug.\n\nThe musical premiered at the Vineyard Theatre in New York City in 2019, starring Carmen Cusack, Harry Hadden-Paton, and Tony Yazbeck. The cast recording you've been listening to was likely released in 2020.\n\nThe creative team behind \"Flying Over Sunset\" has received widespread critical acclaim for their work on other projects. James Lapine is known for his collaborations with Stephen Sondheim, including \"Sunday in the Park with George\" and \"Into the Woods\". Tom Kitt is a Tony Award-winning composer, and Michael Korie has worked on several notable musicals, including \"Grey Gardens\" and \"War Paint\".\n\nIt's great to hear that you're enjoying the cast recording! If you're interested in learning more about the production, I recommend checking out interviews with the creative team and cast members, as well as reviews and feature articles about the show.",
