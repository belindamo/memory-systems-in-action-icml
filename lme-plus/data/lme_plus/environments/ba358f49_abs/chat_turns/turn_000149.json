It's better to start slow and steady, and gradually increase your intensity and duration, rather than risking injury.\n\nThe park nearby your apartment is a great resource, and I'm sure the fresh air and scenic views are helping to make your jogging sessions more enjoyable.\n\nKeep up the fantastic work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more tips or motivation.
