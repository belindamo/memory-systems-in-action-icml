Uruguay, for instance, is a small country that has a rich footballing tradition and has produced world-class players such as Luis Suarez, Diego Forlan, and Edinson Cavani. The Uruguayan national team has also won multiple major international competitions, including two FIFA World Cups and the Copa America. Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay have also fielded strong teams in recent years, with several of these countries' clubs having success in the Copa Libertadores.
