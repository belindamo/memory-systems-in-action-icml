  "content": "Early European contact had a significant impact on the Nez Perce people's religion and spiritual beliefs. The introduction of Christianity by European missionaries led to the adoption of new religious practices and beliefs by some Nez Perce individuals. However, many Nez Perce people also retained their traditional spiritual beliefs and practices, leading to a blend of Christian and traditional Nez Perce spiritual beliefs in modern Nez Perce culture. Additionally, the forced removal of the Nez Perce from their ancestral lands and the loss of their traditional way of life also had a significant impact on their spiritual beliefs, leading to a re-evaluation and reinterpretation of traditional beliefs to reflect their changing cultural context.",
