Speaking of which, I've been collecting vintage cameras for about three months now, and I've managed to snag some amazing deals. I've got a 1960s-era Yashica MG-1 rangefinder, a 1980s Olympus OM-10 SLR, and a few others. Do you have any tips on how to properly store and maintain my cameras to keep them in good condition?",
