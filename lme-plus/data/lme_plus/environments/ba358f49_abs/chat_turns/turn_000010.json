  "content": "I did catch a particularly nice striper during that trip, one that really put up a fight. It was a big one, too - I'd say around 30 pounds or so. The captain said it was one of the bigger ones he'd seen that season. And yeah, I've definitely applied some of the techniques I learned on that trip to my lake fishing. For example, I've found that using a slower, more deliberate retrieve when fishing for striped bass on Lake Norman can be really effective, especially when the water is calm. And paying attention to the structure and looking for areas with baitfish activity has also helped me catch more stripers on the lake.",
