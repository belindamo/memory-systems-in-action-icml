However, there are several Nez Perce tribal organizations, community centers, and cultural centers where you can learn more about Nez Perce culture and history, and possibly find information about upcoming events. \n\nFor example, the Nez Perce National Historical Park, located in Lapwai, Idaho, offers educational programs and cultural events throughout the year, and the Nez Perce Tribe Cultural Resources Committee also hosts a variety of cultural events, including powwows, each year. These events often feature traditional Nez Perce dances, drumming, and other cultural activities, as well as arts and crafts vendors, food, and other activities.\n\nAdditionally, many other Indigenous communities across the United States also host powwows and cultural events that feature Nez Perce dancers and singers, as well as dancers and singers from other tribes. Attending one of these events can provide a unique opportunity to experience Indigenous culture and traditions firsthand.",
