Get back on track as soon as possible and don't let guilt or shame discourage you.\n9. **Make It Convenient**: Find ways to incorporate physical activity into your daily routine, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or doing a quick 10-minute workout at home.\n10. **Celebrate Milestones**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may seem. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue.\n\nRemember, consistency is key, but it's also important to listen to your body and rest when needed.
