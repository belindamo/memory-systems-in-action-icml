  "content": "now do step by step for this: Monthly Subscription Program\n\nIntroducing a monthly subscription program for a bagel each day at a slight discount can be an effective way to retain customers and encourage repeat business. By offering customers a subscription program, Coffee Rock Bagel can incentivize customers to visit the store regularly and build a habit around purchasing its products. Additionally, by offering a discount, the program can provide customers with added value and reduce the perceived cost of purchasing a bagel each day. To encourage new customers to sign up for the subscription program, Coffee Rock Bagel could also offer two free bagels each month for the first few months of the subscription. This would provide added value to new customers and incentivize them to try the products, which could lead to increased customer loyalty and retention. Ultimately, by introducing a monthly subscription program, Coffee Rock Bagel can create a regular revenue stream and build a loyal customer base, which can support successful expansion into new locations.",
