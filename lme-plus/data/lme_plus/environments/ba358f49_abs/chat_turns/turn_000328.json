  "content": "Yes, the Nez Perce people still perform traditional dances, which are an important part of their cultural heritage and spiritual practices. One of the most well-known dances is the Friendship Dance, which is a social dance performed at many gatherings and events. This dance is meant to celebrate friendship and unity among Nez Perce people and other Indigenous communities. It involves singing, drumming, and a circle dance, in which dancers move in a counterclockwise direction around a central drum.\n\nOther traditional Nez Perce dances include the War Dance, which is a ceremonial dance that honors veterans and ancestral warriors, and the Butterfly Dance, which is performed by young women and is associated with the transition from childhood to womanhood. Each dance has its own unique meaning and purpose, and all are considered important parts of Nez Perce culture and spiritual life.\n\nIn addition to traditional dances, the Nez Perce people also perform modern powwow dances, which are Native American social dances that have evolved from the intertribal gatherings that took place in the late 19th century. These dances include the Fancy Dance, Grass Dance, and Jingle Dress Dance, among others. Powwows are an important part of contemporary Nez Perce culture, providing a space for Indigenous people from different communities to come together, share their cultural heritage, and celebrate their traditions in a modern context.",
