They are also known for casting actors who can handle the low-budget, tight schedule, and rapid turnaround times that the company is known for.\n\nThe Asylum tends to give opportunities to actors who are starting out in the industry or who are looking to build up their experience. They also scout talent through online submissions, open auditions, and referrals from agents.\n\nThere are also instances where The Asylum will cast established actors in lead roles to draw in audiences and increase the film's marketability. However, these instances are rare and often depend on the budget and production schedule.\n\nOverall, The Asylum's casting approach focuses on finding actors who can bring the desired characters to life while also keeping in mind the realities of low-budget filmmaking.",
