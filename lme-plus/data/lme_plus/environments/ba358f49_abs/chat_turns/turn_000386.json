  "content": "The changes in Hulme have had a significant impact on neighboring suburbs and districts. One of the most obvious impacts is the gentrification of the area that has led to an increase in property prices and rents, making it less affordable for low-income families. As a result, many families have been forced to move to cheaper areas, such as nearby suburbs.\n\nAdditionally, the regeneration of Hulme has improved transportation infrastructure and access to public transport, which has also impacted neighboring areas. For example, the Metrolink tram system, which serves Hulme, has been extended to other areas and suburbs, improving connectivity and accessibility.\n\nFurthermore, the new housing developments and cultural centers that have emerged in Hulme have attracted businesses, investors, and visitors to the area, which has had a spillover effect on neighboring areas. This has led to the development of new businesses and commercial areas, as well as improved infrastructure and services in other nearby suburbs and districts. However, it has also led to concerns about displacement and the loss of the distinct identity and character of the nearby areas.",
