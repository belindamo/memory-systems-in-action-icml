  "content": "Snake Plants and Pothos are both excellent choices for a Mid-Century Modern living room. Here are some styling tips to help you incorporate them into your space:\n\n**Snake Plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata)**\n\n1. **Use a sleek planter**: Choose a planter with clean lines, minimal ornamentation, and a focus on function over form. A simple, white or black ceramic planter would work well.\n2. **Place it on a side table or shelf**: Snake Plants can grow quite tall, so place it on a side table or shelf to create a striking visual display.\n3. **Pair it with a sculptural vase**: Combine your Snake Plant with a sculptural vase or a geometric-shaped decorative object to create a visually appealing vignette.\n4. **Add some negative space**: Don't overcrowd the area around your Snake Plant. Leave some negative space to create a sense of breathability and visual calm.\n\n**Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)**\n\n1. **Train it to climb**: Pothos is a great climber, so train it to climb up a trellis or a wall-mounted planter to add a touch of greenery to your space.\n2. **Use a macram\u00e9 hanger**: Macram\u00e9 plant hangers were popular during the Mid-Century Modern era, so consider using one to add a retro touch to your space.\n3. **Place it near a window**: Pothos loves bright, indirect light, so place it near a window to create a beautiful, natural display.\n4. **Add some natural elements**: Combine your Pothos with other natural elements like a woven basket, a vintage wood side table, or a natural fiber rug to create a cozy, organic vibe.\n\n**General Tips**\n\n1. **Keep it simple**: Avoid over-accessorizing your plants. Keep the focus on the plant itself and a simple, stylish planter.\n2. **Play with textures**: Combine different textures like wood, ceramic, and metal to add depth and visual interest to your space.\n3. **Balance with negative space**: Don't overcrowd your space with too many plants or decorative objects. Leave some negative space to create a sense of calm and visual balance.\n4. **Experiment with heights**: Play with different heights and levels to create a visually appealing display. Use side tables, shelves, or plant stands to create a layered look.\n\nBy following these styling tips, you'll be able to incorporate your Snake Plant or Pothos into your Mid-Century Modern living room in a way that complements your decor and adds a touch of natural elegance to your space.",
