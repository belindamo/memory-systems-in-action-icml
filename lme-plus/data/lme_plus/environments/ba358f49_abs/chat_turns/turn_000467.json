  "content": "Tablet Ordering\n\nIncorporating tablets with ordering capabilities into the Coffee Rock Bagel business model can offer several benefits that can support successful expansion. One of the main advantages is that it can lead to shorter line times, as customers can place their orders in advance or on the spot without the need to stand in line, reducing wait times and improving the overall customer experience. Additionally, with tablets handling orders, employees can focus more on the bagel-making process, leading to a more efficient and streamlined production process. This can lead to cost savings and improved profitability as more units can be produced with the same number of employees. Moreover, incorporating tablets can also lead to more revenue per unit of cost, as the automated ordering process can help to reduce the number of errors and increase the speed of service, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty. By incorporating tablets with ordering capabilities, Coffee Rock Bagel can improve operational efficiency, reduce wait times, and increase revenue, all of which are critical for successful expansion.",
