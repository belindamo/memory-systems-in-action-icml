However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal schedule or memories, so I don't know about your regular coffee break with Sarah.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you remember:\n\n1. Check your calendar: Look at your digital or physical calendar to see if you've scheduled a recurring coffee break with Sarah.\n2. Ask Sarah: Reach out to Sarah directly and ask her when your next coffee break is scheduled.\n3. Check your reminders: If you've set a reminder on your phone or computer, check to see if it's listed.\n4. Create a routine: Consider setting a regular schedule for your coffee breaks with Sarah, so you can both plan ahead and make it a habit.\n\nI hope this helps!",
