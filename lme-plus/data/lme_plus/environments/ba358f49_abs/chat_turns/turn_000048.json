  "content": "I'm excited to check out these contemporary productions. By the way, I've been on a roll with watching plays and musicals online lately. I think it started about two months ago when I stumbled upon the National Theatre Live YouTube channel, and since then I've been hooked. I've also been listening to the podcast \"The Ensemblist\" which has been really insightful. Do you think there are any other podcasts like that which might interest me?",
