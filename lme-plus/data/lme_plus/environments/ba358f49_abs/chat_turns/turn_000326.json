  "content": "Yes, there are several traditional spiritual practices that are still widely used in modern Nez Perce culture. Some of these include:\n\n1. The Sweat Lodge Ceremony: This is a traditional purification ceremony used to cleanse the mind, body, and spirit. It involves entering a small, enclosed structure made of willow branches and canvas, where water is poured over hot rocks to produce steam.\n\n2. Dreaming and Vision Quests: These are traditional ways of seeking guidance and spiritual insight through dreams and visions. Nez Perce individuals will often fast and pray in isolated locations, seeking guidance from the Creator.\n\n3. Smudging: This is the practice of burning sage, sweetgrass, or other herbs to purify and cleanse the surrounding area and the individuals within it. This is often done before ceremonies or other spiritual practices.\n\n4. Drumming and Singing: This is an important aspect of spiritual practices and ceremonies, with songs being passed down through generations.\n\n5. Storytelling: This is a traditional way of passing down cultural knowledge and spiritual teachings, with Nez Perce elders sharing stories that carry important moral and spiritual lessons.\n\nThese practices vary between different Nez Perce communities and individuals, but they remain an important part of Nez Perce culture and spiritual life, connecting modern Nez Perce people to their ancestors and cultural heritage.",
