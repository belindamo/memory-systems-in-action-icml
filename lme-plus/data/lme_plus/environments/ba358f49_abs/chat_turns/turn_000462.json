However, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself from the constant bombardment of social media:\n\n1. Use social media mindfully: Practice self-awareness when using social media and be mindful of how often and for how long you consume content. You can set limits for the time you spend on these platforms, and avoid checking them first thing in the morning or before bed.\n\n2. Unfollow or block negative accounts: If there are accounts or people on social media that consistently evoke negative emotions, you can unfollow or block those accounts to reduce your exposure to them.\n\n3. Prioritize real-life social interactions: Make it a point to spend time offline and connect with people in real life. Reach out to friends and family and plan in-person meetings, outings or phone calls.\n\n4. Focus on self-care: Make self-care a priority, engage in activities that bring you joy or make you feel good. This could consist of exercise, meditation, journaling or hobbies.\n\n5. Seek professional help if needed: If social media usage continues to negatively impact your mental health or if you are finding it difficult to manage your social media use, it is important to seek professional help or counseling.\n\nRemember, it is essential to give yourself permission to take breaks and establish boundaries for social media use. By reducing social media exposure, you may feel more empowered and motivated to engage in activities that truly nourish your mental health and wellbeing.",
