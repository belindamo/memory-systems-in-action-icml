  "content": "I've been thinking about setting up a dedicated art space in my apartment, and I'm considering using a corner of my living room. I've been looking at those adjustable easels and comfy stools online, and I think it would make a huge difference in my productivity and enthusiasm for painting. Since my third painting project was a portrait of an animal, I'm thinking of setting up a space that's conducive to portrait painting, with good lighting and storage for my paints and brushes. Do you have any specific tips on how to set up an efficient and comfortable art space for portrait painting?",
