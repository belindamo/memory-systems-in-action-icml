I'd say I'm an intermediate birder - I've got some experience, but I'm still learning. And yeah, trails and parking would be great, but I'm not too picky."

I've been trying to focus on the distinctive characteristics of each species, like the White-throated Sparrow's sweet, whistled song or the Song Sparrow's series of descending notes. But it's still a work in progress!\n\nI've had a few memorable birding experiences, though. One that stands out was when I spotted a Ruby-throated Hummingbird in my backyard a few days ago. It was only the second time I've seen one in my yard, and it was a real treat. I've also had some great experiences on guided bird walks, where I've met other birders and learned so much from them."
