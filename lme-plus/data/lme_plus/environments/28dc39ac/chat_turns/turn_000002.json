I've also been meaning to check out The Haunting of Hill House, since I've seen a lot of people raving about it. Do you have any recommendations for podcasts that might scratch that same sci-fi itch? I've been listening to a lot of true-crime podcasts lately, like \"Last Seen\", but I'm open to exploring other genres.",
