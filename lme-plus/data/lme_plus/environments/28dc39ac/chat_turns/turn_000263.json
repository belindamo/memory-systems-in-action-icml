You'll investigate patients, uncover secrets, and make choices that affect the story and its multiple endings.\n\nThese games all share a strong focus on storytelling, character development, and exploration, similar to Ori and the Blind Forest. However, they often have a more intimate, narrative-driven approach, with a greater emphasis on character development and emotional resonance.\n\nKeep in mind that playtimes may vary depending on your pace and playstyle, but these games are all relatively shorter than Ori and the Blind Forest.",
