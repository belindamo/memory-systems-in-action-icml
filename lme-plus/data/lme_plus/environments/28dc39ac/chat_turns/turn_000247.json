It's great that you're thinking about your reproductive health and making informed decisions about your body.\n\nNatural family planning (NFP) refers to methods that help individuals and couples understand their fertility and make intentional decisions about pregnancy. There are several methods, each with its own approach and effectiveness. Here's an overview of some popular methods:\n\n1. **Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method**: This method involves tracking your basal body temperature daily to identify ovulation. Women's body temperature rises slightly after ovulation, making it a good indicator of fertility. Effectiveness: 80-90% with perfect use, 70-80% with typical use.\n2. **Cervical Mucus Method (CMM)**: This method involves tracking changes in cervical mucus to identify ovulation. As estrogen levels increase, cervical mucus becomes more abundant and slippery, indicating fertility. Effectiveness: 80-90% with perfect use, 70-80% with typical use.\n3. **Fertility Awareness Method (FAM)**: This method combines BBT and CMM to identify ovulation and fertile windows. Effectiveness: 90-95% with perfect use, 80-90% with typical use.\n4. **Sympto-Thermal Method (STM)**: This method combines BBT, CMM, and other physical symptoms (like breast tenderness or mood changes) to identify ovulation and fertile windows. Effectiveness: 95-98% with perfect use, 90-95% with typical use.\n5. **Billings Ovulation Method (BOM)**: This method involves tracking cervical mucus to identify ovulation and fertile windows. Effectiveness: 90-95% with perfect use, 80-90% with typical use.\n6. **Creighton Model FertilityCare System (CrMS)**: This method involves tracking cervical mucus and other physical symptoms to identify ovulation and fertile windows. Effectiveness: 95-98% with perfect use, 90-95% with typical use.\n7. **Natural Cycles**: This is a digital fertility awareness method that uses a mobile app to track BBT and other symptoms to identify ovulation and fertile windows. Effectiveness: 93-99% with perfect use, 80-90% with typical use.\n\nKeep in mind that effectiveness rates vary depending on the individual's ability to accurately track their fertility signs and follow the method correctly. It's essential to learn about each method and choose the one that best fits your lifestyle and needs.\n\nAs you explore NFP, remember that it's not just about avoiding pregnancy; it's also about understanding your body, promoting reproductive health, and having open communication with your partner.\n\nHow did you find your meeting with Ava?
