  "content": "I usually use the whisk attachment when making caramel, I find it helps to incorporate the cream more evenly. I haven't tried using different types of sugar yet, but that's a great idea - I'll have to experiment with that soon. As for using the caramel sauce, I've been using it mostly as a topping for my baked goods, like the apple tart I mentioned earlier. But I've also been thinking of using it to make some caramel macchiatos - have you got any tips on how to do that?",
