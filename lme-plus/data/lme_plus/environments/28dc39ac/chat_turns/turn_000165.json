Look for a section that says \"Expiring Miles\" or \"Mileage Expiration Date.\" This should show you any miles that are set to expire soon.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check your \"Account Activity\" or \"Transaction History\" to see if there are any miles that are approaching their expiration date.\n\nAs for your Southwest Airlines voucher, you can log in to your Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards account to check on its status. Once you're logged in, click on \"My Account\" and then \"My Vouchers\" or \"My Certificates.\" This should show you a list of any active vouchers you have, including the $200 voucher you mentioned, along with their expiration dates.\n\nMake sure to note the expiration date and plan to use it before it expires. You might consider setting a reminder for yourself, like a calendar event or a note on your phone, to ensure you don't forget to use it.\n\nIf you have vouchers or miles with other airlines or loyalty programs, I recommend checking those accounts as well to ensure you're not missing any expiring rewards.\n\nIt's always a good idea to regularly review your loyalty program accounts to stay on top of your rewards and make the most of them!",
