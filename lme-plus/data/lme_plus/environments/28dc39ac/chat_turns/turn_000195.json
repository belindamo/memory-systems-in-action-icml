  "content": "Yes, there are a couple of upcoming missions that are planned to explore the Kuiper Belt further.\n\nOne of them is the Lucy mission by NASA, scheduled for launch in October 2021. The mission will visit various asteroids and a main-belt comet, but its prime target is the Jupiter Trojan asteroids, which are believed to be remnants from the early solar system. Lucy will showcase the diversity of the small bodies that inhabit the outer solar system, and provide crucial insights into the early history of our solar system.\n\nAnother mission is the ESA's JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) mission, which will be launched in 2022 and is scheduled to reach Jupiter in 2029. Along with studying the icy moons of Jupiter, JUICE will also conduct detailed observations of several Kuiper Belt objects as it travels towards Jupiter.\n\nBoth missions will significantly contribute to our understanding of the Kuiper Belt and its many intriguing objects, offering new insights into the origin and evolution of our solar system.",
