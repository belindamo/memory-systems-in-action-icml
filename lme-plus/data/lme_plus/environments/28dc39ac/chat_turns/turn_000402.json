  "content": "Here's a sample code in Python using the scikit-learn library to build a machine learning model that predicts the crime rate of a given area based on the average income of the residents:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n\n# Load the data into a pandas dataframe\ndf = pd.read_csv('real_estate_data.csv')\n\n# Split the data into training and test sets\nX = df[['average_income']]\ny = df['crime_rate']\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n\n# Train a linear regression model on the training data\nregressor = LinearRegression()\nregressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Use the model to make predictions on the test data\ny_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)\n\n# Calculate the mean squared error of the predictions\nmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\nprint('Mean Squared Error:', mse)\n```\nThis code loads the real estate data into a pandas dataframe, splits it into training and test sets, trains a linear regression model on the training data, uses the model to make predictions on the test data, and calculates the mean squared error of the predictions.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example to give you an idea of how to build a machine learning model using scikit-learn. The actual code required to solve your problem might be different depending on the complexity of the problem and the amount and quality of the data available.",
