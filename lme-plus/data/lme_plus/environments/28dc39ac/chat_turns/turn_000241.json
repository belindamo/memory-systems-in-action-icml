  "content": "Yes, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) bus system that serves the John Wayne Airport and Disneyland is generally reliable and easy to navigate. The airport is serviced by route 76, which connects to major tourist destinations including Disneyland. The bus fare costs around $2 per person, and you can purchase tickets onboard with cash or with a stored value OCTA Wave card. Bus schedules can be found on the OCTA website, and you can use the Google Maps app or the Transit app to check schedules and plan your trip. It's always a good idea to double-check schedules and plan ahead to ensure a smooth trip. Do keep in mind that the bus route may not be direct, and transfers may be required, so make sure to plan accordingly.",
