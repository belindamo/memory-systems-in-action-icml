  "content": "Scrambled eggs are a classic quick breakfast option that can be made in no time. With 30 minutes to get dressed and have breakfast, you should be able to fit it in comfortably.\n\nHere's a quick tip to make the most of your scrambled eggs:\n\n* Crack 2-3 eggs into a bowl and whisk them together with a fork. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.\n* Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil.\n* Once the butter has melted or the oil is hot, pour in the eggs. Let them cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the edges start to set.\n* Use a spatula to gently scramble the eggs, breaking them up into small curds. Don't overmix!\n* Cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the eggs are cooked through.\n* Serve hot and enjoy!\n\nYou can also add some diced veggies like bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms to the eggs if you have a little extra time. They'll add some extra flavor and nutrients to your breakfast.\n\nRemember, the key is to keep it simple and quick. You can always add some toast or hash browns on the side if you have a little extra time, but scrambled eggs on their own are a great way to start your day.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you make it out the door on time!",
