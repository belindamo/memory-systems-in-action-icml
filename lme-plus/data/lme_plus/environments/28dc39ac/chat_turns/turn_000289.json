Here's what you can expect:\n\n* **Diaper offers**: Fetch Rewards occasionally features offers on diaper brands like Pampers, Huggies, and Luvs. These offers usually provide a certain number of points for purchasing a specific quantity of diapers.\n* **Baby food and formula**: You might find offers on baby food brands like Gerber, Enfamil, or Similac, as well as on formula.\n* **Baby care products**: Fetch Rewards sometimes offers points on baby care products like baby wash, lotion, and oil from brands like Johnson's or Pampers.\n\nKeep in mind that Fetch Rewards' offers change frequently, so it's essential to regularly check the app for new deals. You can also use the app's search function to look for specific brands or products.\n\nTo give you a better idea, I've seen Fetch Rewards offers like:\n\n* 500 points (worth $0.50) for buying a pack of Pampers diapers\n* 200 points (worth $0.20) for purchasing a container of Gerber baby food\n* 300 points (worth $0.30) for buying a bottle of Johnson's baby wash\n\nWhile these offers might not be extremely high-value, they can add up over time, especially if you're already buying these products regularly.\n\nRemember to always check the app for available offers before you shop, and make sure to scan your receipts to earn those points!\n\nIf you have any more questions about Fetch Rewards or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
