I'll try some of the meal ideas you suggested, like the peanut butter banana toast or the Greek yogurt with berries and honey. I'll also experiment with different carb-protein combos to see what works best for me. Thanks for the tips! By the way, I've been thinking about planning another theme park visit soon. Do you have any recommendations for must-try attractions or experiences at Disneyland?",
