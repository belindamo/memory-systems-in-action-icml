Here are some points to keep in mind:\n\n* **Polaris business class**: United's Polaris business class features a 1-2-1 configuration, which means you'll have a lie-flat bed, plenty of personal space, and direct aisle access. The seat converts into a 78-inch bed, and you'll get a comfortable duvet and pillows.\n* **Improved amenities**: Polaris business class passengers enjoy a more extensive meal menu, designed by renowned chefs, and a wide selection of wines and cocktails. You'll also get a amenity kit with high-end skincare products and a pair of noise-cancelling headphones.\n* **Priority check-in and boarding**: As a business class passenger, you'll get priority check-in, security screening, and boarding, which can save you time and hassle.\n* **Lounge access**: You'll have access to United's Polaris Lounges, which offer a more premium lounge experience with hot food, signature cocktails, and shower suites.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that United's Polaris business class is a more expensive product, and prices can vary greatly depending on the route, travel dates, and availability.\n\nIf you're considering United's business class, I recommend setting up price alerts on Google Flights or other fare comparison tools to track prices and look for deals. You can also consider using your miles or credit card points to book a business class ticket or upgrade.\n\nUltimately, the decision to book business class on United depends on your budget, travel preferences, and priorities. If you value the extra comfort, amenities, and convenience, it might be worth splurging on Polaris business class for your London trip.",
