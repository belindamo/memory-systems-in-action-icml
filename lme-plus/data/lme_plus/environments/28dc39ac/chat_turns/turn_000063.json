  "content": "Yes, that is correct. Russia has been developing a new rocket called the Soyuz-5, which is intended to be used for manned missions to the Moon and Mars. The rocket is being developed by RSC Energia, a Russian space company, and is part of Russia's long-term space exploration plans.\n\nThe Soyuz-5 rocket is designed to carry up to four crew members and their equipment to deep space destinations, including Mars. It is expected to have a lifting capacity of up to 17 tons to low Earth orbit and up to 10 tons to geostationary transfer orbit.\n\nIn addition to the Soyuz-5 rocket, Russia is also working on other key technologies that are needed for manned missions to Mars, such as habitats, life support systems, and advanced propulsion systems. These efforts are part of Russia's broader space exploration program, which aims to establish a permanent presence on the Moon and explore other parts of the solar system.\n\nWhile there is still much work to be done before a manned mission to Mars becomes a reality, Russia's ongoing efforts and advancements in rocket technology are a significant step in that direction.",
