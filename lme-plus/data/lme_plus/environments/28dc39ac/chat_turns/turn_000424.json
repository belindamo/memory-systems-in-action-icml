  "content": "Rosemary syrup is a wonderful ingredient to have in your cocktail arsenal, and it's surprisingly easy to make. Here are some tips to help you create a great rosemary syrup:\n\n**Tips for making rosemary syrup:**\n\n1. **Freshness matters**: Use fresh rosemary leaves for the best flavor. You can use either fresh or dried rosemary, but fresh will give you a more vibrant flavor.\n2. **Ratio**: A 1:1 ratio of water to sugar is a good starting point, but you can adjust to taste. Some people prefer a stronger or weaker syrup, so feel free to experiment.\n3. **Steeping time**: Steep the rosemary leaves in the syrup for at least 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. You can steep for up to 30 minutes or even overnight in the fridge for a stronger flavor.\n4. **Strain carefully**: Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the rosemary leaves and any sediment. You can also use a coffee filter or paper towels for a clearer syrup.\n5. **Store in the fridge**: Store the rosemary syrup in an airtight container in the fridge to preserve the flavor and prevent spoilage.\n\n**Shelf life of rosemary syrup:**\n\nRosemary syrup can be stored in the fridge for several weeks to a few months, depending on factors like the ratio of water to sugar, storage conditions, and personal preference. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* **2-4 weeks**: This is a good shelf life for a 1:1 ratio syrup. The flavor will start to fade after 2 weeks, but it's still safe to use.\n* **4-6 weeks**: A 2:1 or 3:1 ratio syrup (more sugar) can last longer, up to 4-6 weeks, as the higher sugar content acts as a natural preservative.\n* **2-3 months**: If you make a stronger syrup with a higher sugar content (e.g., 4:1 or 5:1), it can last up to 2-3 months in the fridge.\n\nRemember to always check the syrup for signs of spoilage before using it, such as an off smell, slimy texture, or mold growth. If in doubt, it's better to err on the side of caution and make a fresh batch.\n\nNow that you have the tips and guidelines, go ahead and make your rosemary syrup to enjoy in your Rosemary's Sunset cocktail!",
