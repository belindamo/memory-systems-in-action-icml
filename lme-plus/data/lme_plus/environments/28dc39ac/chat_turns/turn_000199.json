  "content": "Bhutan's biodiversity is considered to be among the highest in the world, with over 10,000 species of plants and animals documented. Compared to other countries in the region, Bhutan's biodiversity is relatively high, particularly for its size. For example, Bhutan has more than twice the number of bird species found in neighboring countries like Nepal and Bangladesh.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to Bhutan's abundance of biodiversity, including its location in the Eastern Himalayas, which is known as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. Additionally, Bhutan's topography ranges from high mountains to subtropical forests, providing a diverse range of habitats that support a variety of species. Bhutan's government also places a high value on environmental conservation and has implemented policies such as maintaining 60% of its forest cover, which helps to sustain the country's biodiversity. Similarly, Bhutan has set aside protected areas, such as Jigme Dorji National Park, which cover over 50% of its land area, providing essential habitats and corridors for wildlife to thrive.",
