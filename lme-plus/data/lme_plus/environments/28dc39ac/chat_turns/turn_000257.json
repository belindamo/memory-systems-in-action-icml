  "content": "I'd love to learn more about international adoption! I've had some experience with domestic adoption, but I'm not as familiar with the international adoption process. What are some of the unique challenges and considerations that come with adopting a child from another country?\n\nAlso, I've heard that international adoption can be a complex and time-consuming process. Can you walk me through the general steps involved in international adoption, and what kind of support systems are available for families going through this process?\n\nLastly, I'm curious about the cultural and language considerations that come with international adoption. How do adoptive parents typically handle these issues, and what kind of resources are available to help families navigate these challenges?",
