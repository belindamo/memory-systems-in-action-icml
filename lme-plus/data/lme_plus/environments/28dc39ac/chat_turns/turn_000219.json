  "content": "Let me give you a brief rundown on the difficulty levels of Horizon Zero Dawn and God of War (2018) compared to Uncharted 4 and The Last of Us Part II:\n\n**Horizon Zero Dawn:**\n\n* Horizon Zero Dawn's difficulty level is generally considered to be more challenging than Uncharted 4, but less punishing than The Last of Us Part II.\n* The game's combat encounters can be tough, especially against the more powerful machines, but the game offers a variety of strategies and tools to help you overcome them.\n* The game's open-world design and RPG elements mean that you can approach challenges in different ways, using stealth, combat, or exploration to overcome obstacles.\n* The game's difficulty spikes are often tied to specific encounters or boss fights, but overall, the game is well-paced and provides a sense of progression and accomplishment.\n\n**God of War (2018):**\n\n* God of War's difficulty level is generally considered to be more challenging than Uncharted 4, and on par with The Last of Us Part II's hard mode.\n* The game's combat encounters are intense and require strategy, timing, and skill to overcome. Enemies are aggressive and can be relentless, especially on higher difficulty levels.\n* The game's combat mechanics are deep and complex, with a focus on strategy and defense. You'll need to master Kratos' abilities and use them effectively to take down enemies.\n* The game's difficulty spikes can be significant, especially in certain areas or against certain enemies, but the game provides a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when you overcome them.\n\nIn general, both Horizon Zero Dawn and God of War (2018) offer a more challenging experience than Uncharted 4, but in different ways. Horizon Zero Dawn's challenge comes from its open-world design and varied combat encounters, while God of War's challenge comes from its intense, strategic combat and punishing difficulty spikes.\n\nIf you enjoyed the challenge of The Last of Us Part II's hard mode, you may find God of War (2018) to be similarly engaging and rewarding. If you're looking for a more open-world, RPG-like experience with a challenging combat system, Horizon Zero Dawn might be the better fit.",
