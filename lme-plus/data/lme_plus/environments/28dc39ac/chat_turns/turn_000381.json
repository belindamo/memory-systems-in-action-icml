Generally, the early morning hours (around 6-8 am) are ideal for spotting birds, as they are most active during this time. However, if you're looking for shorebirds, the late morning to early afternoon (around 10 am-2 pm) can be better, as they tend to be more active during this time.\n\n**Trails and Areas to Focus On:**\nThe Aspen Valley Wildlife Area consists of approximately 1,500 acres of wetlands, grasslands, and forests. Here are some specific areas and trails to focus on:\n\n1. **Wetlands Trail:** This 1.5-mile trail takes you through a variety of wetland habitats, including marshes, ponds, and streams.
