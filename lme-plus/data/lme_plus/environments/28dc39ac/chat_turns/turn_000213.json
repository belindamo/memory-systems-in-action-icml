He's still a brutal warrior, but he's also a father, struggling to come to terms with his past and connect with his son. Atreus is a great addition to the series, bringing a fresh perspective and emotional depth to the story. The supporting cast, including the World Serpent and the dwarves, add to the game's rich lore and world-building.\n* **Storytelling:** The story is well-paced, with a mix of action, exploration, and character-driven moments.
