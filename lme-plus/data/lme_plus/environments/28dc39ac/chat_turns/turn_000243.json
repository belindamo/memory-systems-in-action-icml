  "content": "The OCTA buses do have some space for luggage, but it is limited. Each passenger is allowed to bring one carry-on bag and one personal item such as a purse or backpack. Larger suitcases, strollers, or other items may need to be stored in the designated area in the front of the bus. However, this area is often limited, so there's no guarantee that there will be enough space for all the passengers' belongings. If you have a lot of luggage, you may want to consider other transportation options or pack a bit lighter.",
