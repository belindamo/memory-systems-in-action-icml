For a spider plant, you can use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer that's specifically formulated for indoor plants. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Miracle-Gro Indoor Plant Food**: A popular and well-reviewed option that's easy to find in most gardening stores. It's a balanced fertilizer (24-8-16 N-P-K) that's gentle on plants and promotes healthy growth.\n2. **Schultz All Purpose Plant Food**: Another trusted brand that offers a balanced fertilizer (20-20-20 N-P-K) suitable for spider plants. It's also water-soluble and easy to use.\n3. **Espoma Organic Indoor Plant Fertilizer**: If you prefer an organic option, this fertilizer is made from natural ingredients and is gentle on plants. It's a bit more expensive than the other two, but it's a great choice for those who prefer organic gardening.\n\nWhen to fertilize: Feed your spider plant during the growing season (spring and summer) once a month. Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning your plant's roots.\n\nAs for your snake plant, pruning dead leaves is an essential part of its care. Snake plants are known for their ability to purify the air and thrive in low-light conditions, making them a great addition to any indoor space. Keep up the good work with regular pruning to maintain its health and appearance!\n\nRemember to fertilize your snake plant as well, but you can do so less frequently than your spider plant. A balanced fertilizer applied every 2-3 months during the growing season should be sufficient.\n\nHappy planting!",
