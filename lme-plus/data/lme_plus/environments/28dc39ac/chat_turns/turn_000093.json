Opt for wild-caught or sustainably sourced options.\n4. **Tofu and tempeh**: Plant-based protein sources made from soybeans, rich in protein and isoflavones.\n5. **Legumes**: Lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans are all high in protein, fiber, and complex carbohydrates.\n6. **Greek yogurt**: High in protein and calcium, Greek yogurt is an excellent snack or post-workout recovery option.\n7. **Eggs**: Rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, eggs are a convenient and versatile protein source.\n8. **Lean beef**: Opt for grass-fed, lean cuts like sirloin, tenderloin, or round.\n9. **Pork tenderloin**: A leaner cut of pork, rich in protein and B vitamins.\n10. **Protein powder**: Whey protein, casein protein, or plant-based options like pea or rice protein can be a convenient supplement to your diet.\n\n**Portion Sizes:**\n\nAim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily, spread across 3-5 main meals and 2-3 snacks.
