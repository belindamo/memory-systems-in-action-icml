  "content": "The Spicy Mango Mule is a great twist on the classic Moscow Mule! The addition of smoky mezcal must have added a fantastic depth to the drink. I'm sure it was a hit at your BBQ!\n\nAnd yes, I'm familiar with the Paper Plane cocktail! It's a modern classic created by Sam Ross, a well-known bartender from New York. The combination of bourbon, Aperol, and Amaro Nonino creates a complex and intriguing flavor profile. The bitterness of the Aperol and Amaro Nonino balances the sweetness of the bourbon, while the citrus notes bring everything together.\n\nIf you're trying to recreate the Paper Plane at home, here's a recipe you can follow:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 oz bourbon\n* 1/2 oz Aperol\n* 1/2 oz Amaro Nonino\n* 1/2 oz freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 1/2 oz honey syrup (1:1 honey and water, dissolved)\n* Orange twist, for garnish\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice.\n2. Add the bourbon, Aperol, Amaro Nonino, lemon juice, and honey syrup to the shaker.\n3. Shake vigorously for about 10-12 seconds to combine and chill the ingredients.\n4. Strain the mixture into a coupe or cocktail glass.\n5. Garnish with an orange twist, expressing the oils over the drink.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a high-quality bourbon with a rich, complex flavor profile to balance the bitter and sweet elements.\n* Adjust the amount of Aperol and Amaro Nonino to your taste, as they can be quite bitter.\n* Don't over-shake the drink, as it can become too diluted and lose its flavor.\n* Experiment with different types of citrus fruits, like grapefruit or orange, to change the flavor profile.\n\nI hope this helps you recreate the Paper Plane at home!
