  "content": "What a thoughtful gesture! Offering to meet up before the class to grab a coffee or chat can be a great way to help John feel more comfortable and relaxed about trying out Zumba with you. This can help in several ways:\n\n1. **Break the ice:** Grabbing a coffee or chatting before the class can help you both relax and get to know each other better in a more casual setting. This can make the experience feel less intimidating and more enjoyable.\n2. **Answer questions:** You can use this opportunity to answer any questions John might have about the class, the instructor, or what to expect. This can help alleviate any concerns or anxiety he might have.\n3. **Build camaraderie:** Meeting up before the class can help create a sense of teamwork and camaraderie, which can make the experience more enjoyable and help you both feel more motivated to work out together.\n4. **Reduce anxiety:** For someone who's new to Zumba or exercise in general, walking into a new class can be intimidating. Meeting up beforehand can help John feel more at ease and reduce any anxiety he might have about trying something new.\n\nJust make sure to keep the pre-class meetup brief and low-key, so you both have enough time to get to the class on schedule. You might say something like:\n\n\"Hey John, I'm really excited to have you join me for Zumba on Friday! Would you like to grab a coffee or chat for a bit before the class? It'll be a great way for us to catch up and go over any questions you might have about the class. Plus, it'll make it feel less intimidating to walk in together.\"\n\nBy offering to meet up beforehand, you're showing John that you're considerate of his feelings and willing to make the experience as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.",
