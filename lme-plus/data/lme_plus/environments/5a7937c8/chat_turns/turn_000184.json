  "content": "I like the idea of designating a \"touch once\" zone on my desk. I think it would really help me stay focused and avoid procrastination. I've been doing something similar with my cleaning routine, like when I clean the bathroom, I make sure to put everything back in its place, like the cleaning supplies under the sink, so it's ready for next time. I'd like to apply that same mindset to my desk organization. Do you have any suggestions on how to set up a paper filing system that would work well with the \"touch once\" rule?",
