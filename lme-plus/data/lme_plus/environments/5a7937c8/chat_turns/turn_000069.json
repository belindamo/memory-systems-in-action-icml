Mixing the High Flow Gel with blue or purple paint can be a fantastic way to create a sense of depth and coolness in the night sky of your cityscape.\n\n**Why Blue or Purple?**\n\nBlue and purple are both cool colors that can help create a sense of distance and depth in your night sky. Blue is often associated with the color of the sky during the day, so using a blue-toned gel mixture can help create a sense of continuity between the sky and the cityscape below. Purple, on the other hand, can add a sense of mystery and luxury to your painting, and its darker, richer tone can help create a sense of depth and atmosphere in the night sky.\n\n**Tips for Mixing the Gel with Paint**\n\nWhen mixing the High Flow Gel with paint, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n1. **Start with a Small Amount of Paint**: Begin by adding a small amount of paint to the gel and mixing well. You can always add more paint, but it's harder to remove excess paint from the gel.\n2. **Choose a Paint with Good Flow**: Select a paint that has good flow and blending characteristics, as this will help you achieve a smooth, even consistency in your gel mixture.\n3. **Adjust the Ratio**: Experiment with different ratios of gel to paint to achieve the desired consistency and color intensity. A higher ratio of gel to paint will result in a more transparent, subtle effect, while a higher ratio of paint to gel will create a more opaque, vibrant effect.\n4. **Test the Mixture**: Before applying the gel mixture to your canvas, test it on a scrap piece of paper or a palette to ensure the desired consistency and color.\n\n**Applying the Gel Mixture**\n\nWhen applying the gel mixture to your night sky, use a palette knife or a soft brush to create soft, feathery strokes. You can also use a spray bottle to create a subtle, mottled effect by spraying water onto the gel mixture as you apply it.\n\nBy mixing the High Flow Gel with blue or purple paint, you can create a beautiful, atmospheric effect in the night sky of your cityscape. The gel will add a sense of texture and dimensionality to the sky, while the paint will provide color and depth. Happy painting!",
