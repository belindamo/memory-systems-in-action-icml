I've been doing something similar with my cleaning routine, like when I clean the bathroom, I make sure to put everything back in its place, like the cleaning supplies under the sink, so it's ready for next time. I'd like to apply that same mindset to my desk organization. I like the idea of categorizing and purging my papers, and then creating a filing system that works for me. I think it would really help me stay organized and focused. Do you have any suggestions on how to manage digital files and documents, such as emails and electronic documents?",
