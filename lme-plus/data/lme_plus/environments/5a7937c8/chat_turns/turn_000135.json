Here are some tips to help you keep your Korean-Style Fried Chicken crispy:\n\n1. **Cooling:** Let the fried chicken cool completely on a wire rack or paper towels before storing. This helps excess moisture evaporate, making it easier to store and reheat.\n2. **Air-tight containers:** Store the cooled fried chicken in an air-tight container, such as a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. You can also use ziplock bags or airtight storage bags.\n3. **Refrigeration:** Refrigerate the fried chicken within 2 hours of cooking. Keep it in the refrigerator at 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below.\n4. **Freezing:** If you don't plan to consume the fried chicken within 3-4 days, consider freezing it. Place the cooled fried chicken in an air-tight container or freezer bag, making sure to press out as much air as possible before sealing. Frozen fried chicken can be stored for up to 3-4 months.\n5. **Reheating:** To reheat, preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Place the fried chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until crispy and heated through. You can also reheat in a toaster oven or air fryer.\n6. **Crisping up:** To add extra crispiness, try broiling the reheated fried chicken for 1-2 minutes, watching closely to prevent burning.\n\nSome additional tips to maintain crispiness:\n\n* Avoid stacking the fried chicken pieces on top of each other, as this can cause them to become soggy.\n* If you need to store fried chicken for an extended period, consider freezing it in smaller portions to prevent moisture from accumulating.\n* When reheating, try not to overcrowd the baking sheet, as this can cause the fried chicken to steam instead of crisp up.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to enjoy your Korean-Style Fried Chicken with a crispy coating even after reheating!\n\nDo you have any other questions about storing or reheating fried chicken, or would you like more recipe suggestions?",
