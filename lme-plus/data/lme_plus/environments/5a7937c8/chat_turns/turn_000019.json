Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Layered lighting**: Using a combination of light sources, like table lamps, floor lamps, and overhead lighting, can create a layered lighting effect. This approach allows you to control the amount of light in the room and creates a more inviting atmosphere.\n2. **Task lighting**: Floor lamps can provide task lighting, which is perfect for reading, watching TV, or playing games. Place them in areas where you'll be engaging in these activities to create pools of light.\n3. **Ambient lighting**: Floor lamps can also contribute to the overall ambiance of the room by providing soft, warm light. Look for lamps with shades that diffuse the light, creating a cozy glow.\n4. **Balance and symmetry**: Consider the layout of your room and the placement of your furniture. Adding a floor lamp on one side of the room can create a sense of balance if you have a similar element on the other side (e.g., a chair or console table).\n5. **Scale and proportion**: Choose floor lamps that are proportional to the size of your room and furniture. A large lamp in a small room can overwhelm the space, while a small lamp in a large room may get lost.\n6. **Style and design**: Select floor lamps that complement your existing d\u00e9cor and style. This will help create a cohesive look and ensure the lamps blend in with the rest of your furniture.\n7. **Dimmer switches**: Installing dimmer switches can give you more control over the light levels in your room, allowing you to adjust the ambiance to your liking.\n\nRegarding the pendant light above your dining table, covering it with a linen shade was a great idea! Linen shades can soften the light and create a warm, cozy glow. If you're still finding the light too harsh, you could also consider replacing the bulb with a warmer, lower-wattage option.\n\nRemember, lighting is all about creating a balance and finding the right mix of light sources to achieve the atmosphere you want. Experiment with different lighting options, and don't be afraid to move things around until you find the perfect combination for your living room.",
