Here's a suggested routine for you:\n\n**6:30 AM - Wake-up Time**\n\n* Start with a gentle wake-up, 1.5 hours before you need to begin your day. This will give you ample time to relax and enjoy your morning routine.\n\n**6:40 AM - Hydration and Refreshment (10 minutes)**\n\n* Drink a full glass of water to rehydrate after a night of sleep.\n* Consider having a warm beverage like tea or coffee, or a refreshing drink like coconut water or a citrus-infused water.\n\n**6:50 AM - Yoga (30 minutes)**\n\n* Find a quiet and comfortable spot for your yoga practice. You can follow along with a video, an app, or create your own sequence.\n* Focus on gentle stretches and flows to increase blood flow and energy. You can also incorporate some gentle inversions, like downward-facing dog or shoulder stands, to help increase energy and circulation.\n\n**7:20 AM - Journaling (20 minutes)**\n\n* Find a quiet and comfortable spot to sit with your journal.\n* Write down your thoughts, reflections, and gratitudes. You can write about your goals, what you're looking forward to, or simply reflect on the present moment.\n* Consider using prompts or questions to guide your journaling, such as:\n\t+ What am I grateful for today?\n\t+ What are my top three goals for the day?\n\t+ What can I do to make today amazing?\n\n**7:40 AM - Meditation (20 minutes)**\n\n* Find a quiet and comfortable spot to sit or lie down for meditation.\n* Use a guided meditation app, like Headspace or Calm, or simply focus on your breath.\n* Aim for a gentle, relaxing meditation to calm your mind and set a positive tone for the day.\n\n**8:00 AM - Get Ready for the Day**\n\n* Take a few minutes to freshen up, get dressed, and prepare for your day.\n\nThis routine allows you to gently wake up, rehydrate, and then move into your yoga practice to increase energy and circulation. Journaling helps you reflect and set intentions, while meditation calms your mind and sets a positive tone for the day. Feel free to adjust the timing or activities to suit your needs and preferences.\n\nRemember, consistency is key, so try to stick to this routine as closely as possible, even on weekends or days off. Good luck, and enjoy your new morning routine!",
