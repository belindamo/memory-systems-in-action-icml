I'm looking forward to exploring the area and trying out some of the restaurants and bars you mentioned. Since I finished all my tasks by 4:00 PM and left the office early on Friday, I'm feeling pretty relaxed and ready to take on the weekend. Can you give me some tips on how to get around San Francisco, especially from the hotel to other popular attractions like Union Square and Golden Gate Park?",
