  "content": "What a lovely gesture! A 6-month-old baby shower is a great way to celebrate Olivia's growth and milestones. Here are some adorable theme ideas and game suggestions that are perfect for a baby girl:\n\n**Theme Ideas:**\n\n1. **Enchanted Garden**: Create a whimsical setting with a garden theme, complete with floral arrangements, greenery, and pastel colors.\n2. **Princess Party**: Invite guests to a royal celebration with a princess theme, featuring tiara centerpieces, pink and gold balloons, and a \"Princess Olivia\" banner.\n3. **Floral Fantasy**: Welcome spring with a floral-inspired theme, featuring a mix of vibrant flowers, soft pastels, and feminine touches.\n4. **Sweet Treats**: Celebrate Olivia's sweetness with a baking-inspired theme, featuring cupcakes, candy, and dessert-themed decorations.\n5. **Woodland Wonder**: Bring the outdoors in with a woodland theme, featuring earthy tones, forest creatures, and natural elements.\n\n**Games and Activities:**\n\n1. **Guess the Baby Food**: Prepare several different baby food jars with identical labels. Have guests guess the flavors and the one who guesses the most correctly wins.\n2. **Baby Bingo**: Create bingo cards with words related to babies or baby showers. As the host opens gifts, players mark off the words they see. The first to get five in a row wins.\n3. **Pin the Pacifier on the Baby**: A baby shower twist on the classic game. Create a large picture of a baby, and have guests take turns blindfolded and try to pin a pacifier on the baby's mouth.\n4. **Baby Shower Charades**: Write down baby-related words or phrases (e.g., \"changing a diaper,\" \"rocking a baby to sleep\") on slips of paper, and have guests act them out for the other players to guess.\n5. **Guess the Baby Picture**: Gather baby pictures of Emma and other family members. Have guests guess which picture is Olivia's mom.\n6. **Onesie Decorating**: Provide onesies, fabric paint, and other craft supplies. Have guests decorate their own onesies with cute designs and messages for Olivia.\n7. **Word Scramble**: Create a list of baby-related words (e.g., \"baby,\" \"onesie,\" \"nursery\") and scramble the letters. Give each guest a copy of the scrambled words and see who can unscramble them all first.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider a smaller, intimate gathering since Olivia is still young.\n* Keep the games and activities short and sweet to accommodate a 6-month-old's attention span.\n* Make sure to have plenty of comfortable seating and refreshments for your guests.\n* Have a \"Wishes for Olivia\" card or book for guests to write notes and advice for Emma and Olivia.\n\nI hope these ideas help you plan a beautiful and fun celebration for Olivia's baby shower!",
