However, I have to clarify that Christmas Eve is on December 24th every year, so it's not possible for you to have already attended a midnight mass on Christmas Eve on December 24th. Perhaps you're thinking of a different date or event?\n\nPutting that aside, I'd be delighted to suggest some fun and festive activities for your family outing:\n\n1. **Ice Skating**: Many cities and towns have outdoor or indoor ice skating rinks during the holiday season. It's a great way to get some exercise and enjoy quality time together.\n2. **Gingerbread House Making**: Get creative and make your own gingerbread houses or decorate pre-made ones with candies and icing. This activity is perfect for kids and adults alike!\n3. **Holiday Light Displays**: Many neighborhoods, parks, or zoos have stunning holiday light displays. Take a drive or walk around to enjoy the festive atmosphere.\n4. **Sledding or Tubing**: If you live in an area with snow, grab your sleds or tubes and hit the nearest hill for some fun and laughter.\n5. **Hot Chocolate and Cookie Decorating**: Host a hot chocolate bar with different toppings and have a cookie decorating station with festive sprinkles and icings.\n6. **Scavenger Hunt**: Create a holiday-themed scavenger hunt around the house or neighborhood with clues and small prizes at the end.\n7. **Volunteer Work**: Give back to the community by volunteering at a local soup kitchen, toy drive, or other organization that needs help during the holiday season.\n8. **Movie Marathon**: Have a cozy movie marathon with classic holiday films, complete with blankets, pillows, and snacks.\n9. **Indoor Games**: Host a game night with board games, card games, or video games that fit the holiday theme.\n10. **Sleigh Ride or Horse-Drawn Carriage**: If available in your area, take a festive horse-drawn carriage or sleigh ride through the snowy landscape.\n\nChoose one or more activities that fit your family's interests and preferences, and make it a special and memorable holiday season together!",
