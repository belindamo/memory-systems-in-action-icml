It's normal to feel a bit unusual at first, but as you continue to practice, you'll become more comfortable with the sensation.\n\nRemember to focus on the sensation of your belly rising and falling, and try to let go of any tension in your chest or shoulders. You can also try to relax your jaw and facial muscles, letting your face feel soft and relaxed.\n\nAs you continue to breathe, bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Feel the sensation of the breath in your nostrils, the sensation of your lungs expanding and contracting, and the sensation of your belly rising and falling.\n\nIf your mind starts to wander (and it probably will!), gently bring your attention back to your breath. Don't try to control your breathing or change it in any way; just observe it and allow it to be.\n\nKeep going for a few more minutes, and see how you feel. You might start to feel a sense of relaxation spreading through your body, or a sense of calmness in your mind. Just allow yourself to experience it, and don't worry too much about doing it \"right\" or \"wrong\".\n\nHow are you feeling now?",
