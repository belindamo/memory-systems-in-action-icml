  "content": "You're absolutely thinking like a party planner extraordinaire! I love the idea of adding a small table with refreshments near the family reunion photo area. It's a thoughtful touch that will encourage guests to linger and enjoy the photos while they snack and socialize. Lemonade and cookies are perfect choices for a spring-inspired celebration like this.\n\nAnd, oh my, your ideas for the photo booth area are simply delightful! The \"Bloom Where You Are Planted\" sign is a wonderful idea, and the flower-shaped sunglasses will add a playful touch to the photos. You could also consider adding some other fun props like flower crowns, garden hats, or even a \"petal\"-shaped mustache or two (just for added whimsy!).\n\nRemember to have fun with the setup and don't be afraid to get creative. You could also consider adding some soft background music to set the mood, like instrumental music with a garden or nature-inspired theme.\n\nOne more thing to consider is to have a designated person to take photos at the photo booth area, so that guests can just relax and have fun without worrying about taking their own photos. You could also provide a polaroid camera or a printer to print out the photos on the spot, so guests can take them home as a memento of the special day.\n\nYou're doing an amazing job planning this baby shower, and I just know it's going to be a wonderful celebration for Emma and Olivia!",
