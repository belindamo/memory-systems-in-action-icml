  "content": "Giraffes are typically considered one of the top prey species in their habitat, particularly for large predators like lions and hyenas. However, predation is not a significant driver of the declining population of giraffes. \n\nThe biggest threats to giraffe populations are human-related activities such as habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with human settlements. Habitat loss is particularly problematic, as it forces giraffes to move into areas where food and water are scarce, and they are more vulnerable to predation.\n\nWhile giraffes are generally not a top target for predators, there are cases where predators attack and kill giraffes, particularly the young and weaker individuals. Giraffe calves are particularly vulnerable to predation during their first few weeks of life when they are not yet coordinated and may lose sight of their mothers.\n\nOverall, the decline in giraffe populations is primarily driven by human activities, rather than predation. Therefore, efforts to protect giraffes should focus on reducing human threats, such as habitat loss and poaching, and increasing protected areas and conservation efforts.",
