  "content": "As Jinju lay in her special spot in the village, she thought back on all the years she had spent carrying water for the villagers. She had done her best to serve them, but in the end, even a clay pot like Jinju will break if it is struck often.\n\nJinju knew that she had been used and carried water for the villagers every day, and it was only natural that she would eventually break. But she also knew that she had done her best to serve the villagers, and she was grateful for the time she had spent with them.\n\nAs she looked back on her life, Jinju knew that she had served as a reminder of the importance of taking care of oneself and not overworking. And even though she was no longer able to carry water, Jinju remained a beloved and valued part of the village, serving as a testament to the wise words of the old Korean proverb: \"Even a clay pot will break if it is struck often.\"",
