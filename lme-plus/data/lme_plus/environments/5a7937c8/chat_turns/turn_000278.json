  "content": "As Jinju was used and carried water for the villagers every day, she began to show signs of wear and tear. Over time, small cracks began to form in her surface, gradually spreading and deepening. These cracks were caused by the constant pressure of the water inside Jinju, as well as the rough handling and frequent bumps and jolts she experienced as she was carried from place to place.\n\nAt first, the cracks were small and barely noticeable, but as Jinju continued to be used, they grew larger and more numerous. Eventually, one of the cracks became so large that it threatened to split Jinju in two. The villagers knew that they had to do something to repair Jinju before it was too late.\n\nThey tried filling in the cracks with clay and other materials, but no matter what they did, the cracks always seemed to come back. It was clear that Jinju was no longer able to hold water, and she would have to be retired.\n\nThe villagers were sad to see Jinju go, but they knew that she had served them well for many years. They took care to mend her cracks as best they could, and placed her in a special spot in the village where she could be remembered and admired for all that she had done.",
