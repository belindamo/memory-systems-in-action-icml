Creating a separate area for the family reunion photos and a photo booth area with props and backdrops will provide a nice contrast and give your guests two different ways to engage with the celebration.\n\nHere's a possible layout to consider:\n\n**Family Reunion Photo Area:**\n\n* Set up a designated area with a table, easel, or wall display for the family reunion photos.\n* Organize the photos in a timeline format, as I mentioned earlier, to showcase Olivia's growth and milestones.\n* Add some decorative elements, such as flowers, greenery, or balloons, to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n* Consider adding a few comfortable chairs or a bench for guests to sit and reminisce while viewing the photos.\n\n**Photo Booth Area:**\n\n* Set up a separate area with a backdrop, props, and a camera or smartphone with a tripod.\n* Choose a fun and festive backdrop that fits the Enchanted Garden theme, such as a floral wall, a garden trellis, or a whimsical forest scene.\n* Provide a variety of props, such as flower crowns, garden hats, and silly accessories, to encourage guests to get creative and playful.\n* Consider setting up a designated area for guests to leave their photos, such as a photo album or a \"Photo Booth\" sign with a slot for guests to insert their photos.\n\nBy separating the two areas, you'll create a nice flow and give your guests the opportunity to enjoy both the heartwarming family reunion photos and the fun, playful photo booth experience. This will also encourage guests to mingle and interact with each other, making the baby shower a more memorable and enjoyable event.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with the setup and design!",
