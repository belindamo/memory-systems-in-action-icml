Here are some factors to consider:\n\nEcommerce marketers:\n\n* Ecommerce marketers are primarily focused on driving traffic, increasing engagement, and improving conversion rates. They are often responsible for managing online advertising campaigns, email marketing, social media, and other digital marketing channels.\n* Eko's software could be particularly useful for ecommerce marketers who want to create more engaging and interactive experiences for their customers. For example, interactive product demos, personalized product recommendations, and virtual try-ons could help to increase engagement and conversion rates.\n* However, ecommerce marketers may not have as much influence over the product development process or the overall user experience on the website. They may be more focused on short-term marketing goals rather than longer-term product development and optimization.\n\nEcommerce product managers:\n\n* Ecommerce product managers are responsible for managing the product development process, overseeing the user experience on the website, and ensuring that the products are meeting customer needs and expectations.\n* Eko's software could be particularly useful for ecommerce product managers who want to create more intuitive and user-friendly experiences for their customers. For example, interactive assembly guides, 360-degree product views, and customization options could help to improve the overall user experience and reduce the number of returns.\n* However, ecommerce product managers may not have as much control over the marketing and advertising campaigns. They may be more focused on longer-term product development and optimization rather than short-term marketing goals.\n\nOverall, both ecommerce marketers and ecommerce product managers could benefit from Eko's software, but the ideal customer would depend on the company's goals and priorities. If the company's primary goal is to increase engagement and conversion rates, then ecommerce marketers may be the ideal customer. If the company's primary goal is to improve the user experience and reduce returns, then ecommerce product managers may be the ideal customer.",
