  "content": "I'm intrigued by the Korean-Style Fried Chicken and the Peruvian-Style Roasted Chicken. I've never tried making Korean chili flake before, so that sounds like a fun experiment. Also, I've had Peruvian food before and loved it, so I'm curious to try making it at home. Do you have any tips on where to find aji amarillo peppers or can I substitute with something else?",
