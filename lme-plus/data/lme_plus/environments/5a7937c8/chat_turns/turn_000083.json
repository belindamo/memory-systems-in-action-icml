  "content": "I'd be happy to help you create a morning routine that fits your schedule.\n\nSince you've been waking up at 7:00 am for a few weeks, we can build upon that habit. To create a personalized morning routine, I'll need to know a bit more about your preferences and goals. Please answer the following questions:\n\n1. What time do you need to start your day (e.g., when do you need to leave for work, school, or other commitments)?\n2. How much time do you want to dedicate to your morning routine (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours)?\n3. What activities would you like to include in your morning routine (e.g., exercise, meditation, journaling, breakfast, reading, responding to emails)?\n4. Are there any specific goals or habits you want to prioritize in your morning routine (e.g., increasing energy, improving mental clarity, setting daily intentions)?\n5. Do you have any constraints or limitations that might impact your morning routine (e.g., young children, pets, limited mobility)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a tailored morning routine that suits your needs and schedule.",
