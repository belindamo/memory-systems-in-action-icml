  "content": "The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain, becoming the United States of America. They defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War in alliance with France and others. Members of American colonial society argued the position of \"no taxation without representation,\" starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. This became the slogan for the Revolution. The war took place primarily in the modern-day United States. The American Revolution included boycotts, protests, and riots. The Continental Army was formed after the outbreak of the war and the Patriots' victory at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The Patriots suffered a series of defeats in the following months, but they captured two key British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. In July 1776, the Second Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies as the United States of America. The American Revolution ended in 1783, with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power.",
