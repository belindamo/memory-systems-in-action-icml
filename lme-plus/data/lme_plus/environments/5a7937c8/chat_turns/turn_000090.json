  "content": "I think I'll start by exploring different yoga styles, maybe trying out vinyasa or yin yoga to mix things up. I've also been interested in using props, like blocks or straps, to help with alignment and flexibility. And I like the idea of creating a theme-based practice, focusing on core strength or flexibility. Do you have any recommendations for finding online resources or yoga apps that can help me get started with these new styles and techniques?",
