If you're looking for a more laid-back vibe, visit during the day and explore the vintage shops and cafes. If you're looking for a more lively atmosphere, visit in the evening and check out the bars and live music venues.\n\n**Events and festivals:**\n\n* North Beach:\n\t+ North Beach Festival (June): A two-day festival celebrating Italian-American culture, with live music, food, and drinks.\n\t+ North Beach Jazz Festival (July): A free jazz festival featuring live music performances in various venues throughout the neighborhood.\n* Haight-Ashbury:\n\t+ Haight-Ashbury Street Fair (June): A celebration of the neighborhood's history and culture, with live music, food, and drinks.\n\t+ Outside Lands Music Festival (August): A three-day music festival featuring a variety of genres and performers.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Be sure to check the neighborhoods' event calendars to see if any festivals or events coincide with your trip.\n* If you're visiting during peak tourist season (June to August), be prepared for larger crowds and longer lines at popular spots.\n* Consider visiting during the shoulder season (April to May or September to October) for smaller crowds and more relaxed atmosphere.\n\nSince you have some extra time to plan your trip, you might want to check out the official websites of North Beach and Haight-Ashbury to see what's happening during your visit.
