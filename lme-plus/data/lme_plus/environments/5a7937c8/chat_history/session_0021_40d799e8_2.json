You'll have someone to chat with, motivate, and hold accountable.\n2. **Accountability:** When you know someone is counting on you to attend, you're more likely to show up and make it a priority.\n3. **Moral Support:** Having a workout buddy can provide an added boost of motivation and encouragement, especially on days when you might not feel like going.\n4. **Team Building:** Sharing a fun experience like Zumba can help strengthen your professional relationship with John and create a more positive work environment.\n5. **New Experience:** John might not have tried Zumba before, so you'll be introducing him to a new activity and helping him discover a potential new passion.\n\nBefore inviting John, consider the following:\n\n1. **Make sure John is interested:** Before extending the invitation, casually ask John if he's interested in trying Zumba or if he's already into fitness activities.
