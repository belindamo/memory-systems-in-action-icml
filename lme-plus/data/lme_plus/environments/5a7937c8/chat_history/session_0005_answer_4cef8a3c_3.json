Be prepared to wear comfortable clothing and shoes.\n* **Time commitment**: Shifts can vary, but typically range from 2-4 hours. You may be able to choose a regular schedule or volunteer on an as-needed basis.\n* **Teamwork**: You'll work alongside other volunteers, so be prepared to collaborate and communicate effectively.\n* **Flexibility**: Be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances, such as unexpected donations or shifts in client needs.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* **Dress code**: Wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes and clothes that can get dusty or dirty.\n* **Hygiene**: Wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or hair while handling food.\n* **Attention to detail**: Pay close attention to expiration dates, packaging, and contents to ensure safe and suitable food distribution.\n* **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance if you're unsure about a particular item or process.\n\nBy volunteering in a food bank or pantry, you'll be making a tangible difference in your community.
