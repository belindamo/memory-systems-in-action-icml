Have guests guess the flavors and the one who guesses the most correctly wins.\n2. **Baby Bingo**: Create bingo cards with words related to babies or baby showers. As the host opens gifts, players mark off the words they see. The first to get five in a row wins.\n3. **Pin the Pacifier on the Baby**: A baby shower twist on the classic game. Create a large picture of a baby, and have guests take turns blindfolded and try to pin a pacifier on the baby's mouth.\n4. **Baby Shower Charades**: Write down baby-related words or phrases (e.g., \"changing a diaper,\" \"rocking a baby to sleep\") on slips of paper, and have guests act them out for the other players to guess.\n5. **Guess the Baby Picture**: Gather baby pictures of Emma and other family members. Have guests guess which picture is Olivia's mom.\n6. **Onesie Decorating**: Provide onesies, fabric paint, and other craft supplies. Have guests decorate their own onesies with cute designs and messages for Olivia.\n7. **Word Scramble**: Create a list of baby-related words (e.g., \"baby,\" \"onesie,\" \"nursery\") and scramble the letters. Give each guest a copy of the scrambled words and see who can unscramble them all first.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider a smaller, intimate gathering since Olivia is still young.\n* Keep the games and activities short and sweet to accommodate a 6-month-old's attention span.\n* Make sure to have plenty of comfortable seating and refreshments for your guests.\n* Have a \"Wishes for Olivia\" card or book for guests to write notes and advice for Emma and Olivia.\n\nI hope these ideas help you plan a beautiful and fun celebration for Olivia's baby shower!"

I'm thinking of creating a small photo booth area with props and backdrops, and then having a separate area with the family reunion photos. Do you think that would work well?"

      "content": "I love that idea! Creating a separate area for the family reunion photos and a photo booth area with props and backdrops will provide a nice contrast and give your guests two different ways to engage with the celebration.\n\nHere's a possible layout to consider:\n\n**Family Reunion Photo Area:**\n\n* Set up a designated area with a table, easel, or wall display for the family reunion photos.\n* Organize the photos in a timeline format, as I mentioned earlier, to showcase Olivia's growth and milestones.\n* Add some decorative elements, such as flowers, greenery, or balloons, to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n* Consider adding a few comfortable chairs or a bench for guests to sit and reminisce while viewing the photos.\n\n**Photo Booth Area:**\n\n* Set up a separate area with a backdrop, props, and a camera or smartphone with a tripod.\n* Choose a fun and festive backdrop that fits the Enchanted Garden theme, such as a floral wall, a garden trellis, or a whimsical forest scene.\n* Provide a variety of props, such as flower crowns, garden hats, and silly accessories, to encourage guests to get creative and playful.\n* Consider setting up a designated area for guests to leave their photos, such as a photo album or a \"Photo Booth\" sign with a slot for guests to insert their photos.\n\nBy separating the two areas, you'll create a nice flow and give your guests the opportunity to enjoy both the heartwarming family reunion photos and the fun, playful photo booth experience. This will also encourage guests to mingle and interact with each other, making the baby shower a more memorable and enjoyable event.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with the setup and design!"

That way, guests can take a break, grab a snack, and enjoy the photos while they're there.

It's a thoughtful touch that will encourage guests to linger and enjoy the photos while they snack and socialize. Lemonade and cookies are perfect choices for a spring-inspired celebration like this.\n\nAnd, oh my, your ideas for the photo booth area are simply delightful!

You could also consider adding some other fun props like flower crowns, garden hats, or even a \"petal\"-shaped mustache or two (just for added whimsy!).\n\nRemember to have fun with the setup and don't be afraid to get creative. You could also consider adding some soft background music to set the mood, like instrumental music with a garden or nature-inspired theme.\n\nOne more thing to consider is to have a designated person to take photos at the photo booth area, so that guests can just relax and have fun without worrying about taking their own photos. You could also provide a polaroid camera or a printer to print out the photos on the spot, so guests can take them home as a memento of the special day.\n\nYou're doing an amazing job planning this baby shower, and I just know it's going to be a wonderful celebration for Emma and Olivia!"
