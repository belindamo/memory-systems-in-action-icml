  "content": "Portland is a fantastic city for androgynous fashion, with a thriving community that celebrates individuality and self-expression. Here are some stores and resources you might want to check out:\n\n**Androgynous Fashion Stores in Portland:**\n\n1. **Wildfang**: A Portland-based fashion brand that offers androgynous clothing, accessories, and beauty products. They have a physical store in the Pearl District.\n2. **Lizard Lounge**: A vintage and second-hand store with a curated selection of androgynous clothing items.\n3. **Red Light Clothing Exchange**: A vintage and second-hand store with a large selection of clothing, including androgynous pieces.\n4. **Crossroads Trading Co.**: As I mentioned earlier, this US-based vintage and second-hand store chain has a location in Portland and often carries androgynous clothing items.\n5. **Powell's City of Books**: While not exclusively a fashion store, Powell's has an excellent selection of books on gender studies, fashion, and self-expression that might interest you.\n\n**Psychology of Gendered Perceptions:**\n\nThe psychology of gendered perceptions is a complex and multifaceted topic. Here are some key concepts to consider:\n\n1. **Gender Socialization**: From a young age, we're socialized to conform to traditional gender norms, which can influence how we perceive ourselves and others. This socialization can be both explicit (e.g., gendered toys and clothes) and implicit (e.g., gender stereotypes in media).\n2. **Gender Schemas**: Our brains use mental frameworks or schemas to categorize people into male or female based on cues like appearance, behavior, and mannerisms. These schemas can be influenced by our upbringing, culture, and personal experiences.\n3. **Gender Binary**: The gender binary is the concept that there are only two genders: male and female. This binary can lead to the erasure of non-binary individuals and reinforce harmful gender stereotypes.\n4. **Gender Performance**: Gender is not just something we are, but also something we do. We perform our gender through our behavior, appearance, and interactions, which can be influenced by societal expectations and personal identity.\n5. **Intersectionality**: Gender is not the only factor that influences how we're perceived; race, class, sexuality, ability, and other aspects of our identity intersect and impact how we're perceived and treated.\n\nSome recommended readings on the psychology of gendered perceptions include:\n\n* **\"Gender Trouble\" by Judith Butler**: A foundational work that challenges traditional notions of gender and explores the concept of gender performativity.\n* **\"The Gendered Brain\" by Gina Rippon**: A scientific exploration of how gender influences our brains and behavior.\n* **\"Sissy: A Coming-of-Gender Story\" by Jacob Tobia**: A memoir that explores the author's experiences with gender identity and expression.\n\nRemember, gender identity and expression are complex and personal aspects of our lives. It's essential to approach these topics with respect, empathy, and an open mind.\n\nI hope this information helps you navigate Portland's androgynous fashion scene and provides a starting point for exploring the psychology of gendered perceptions!",
