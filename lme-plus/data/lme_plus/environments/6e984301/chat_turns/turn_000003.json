  "content": "If someone robbed you, that would typically be considered a criminal case as robbery is a crime that violates the law. The police would investigate and the prosecutor would bring charges against the defendant. The defendant could face jail time, fines, or other penalties if found guilty. However, you may also have the option to pursue a civil lawsuit against the defendant to recover damages or compensation for any harm or losses you suffered as a result of the robbery.",
