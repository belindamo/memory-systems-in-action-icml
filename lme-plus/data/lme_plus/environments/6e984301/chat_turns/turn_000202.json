I was trying to help you with a hypothetical scenario, but I don't have any information about your specific city or train station.\n\nIf you'd like to get coffee shop recommendations, you can try searching online for \"best coffee shops near [your city/neighborhood]\" or \"coffee shops near [your office address]\". You can also ask your colleagues or friends for recommendations!\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with, such as calculating the cost of a train pass or anything else. I'm here to assist you!",
