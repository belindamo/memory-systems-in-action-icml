They're there to help you enjoy your meal, and it's always better to ask than to assume.\n\nRemember to also take your time, relax, and enjoy the atmosphere of the cafe. People-watching and soaking up the local vibe are all part of the fun when exploring a new city!\n\nHave a wonderful time at the cafe, and I hope you discover some delicious and satisfying options that meet your healthy and vegetarian requirements.
