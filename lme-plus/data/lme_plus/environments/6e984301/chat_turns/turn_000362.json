  "content": "Thank you for the concern and advice on taking care of my ankle! I appreciate it, and I'm glad to report that my ankle is feeling much better now.\n\nRegarding the Cross-Body Lead, I think the most challenging part for me is the timing and coordination. I sometimes struggle to execute the move smoothly and in time with the music. I feel like I'm getting better with practice, but I still need to work on refining my technique and developing a stronger connection with my partner.\n\nI've been practicing the Cross-Body Lead in front of a mirror, which has helped me improve my footwork and overall technique. However, I think I need to work on my timing and coordination with a partner to really master the move.\n\nDo you have any tips on how to improve my timing and coordination with a partner? Should I practice with a metronome or focus on developing a stronger connection with my partner through leading and following exercises?",
