However, I can suggest some ways to find great restaurants near the hotel:\n\n1. **Google Maps**: Type in the hotel's address and search for \"restaurants near me\" or \"lunch near me.\" Google Maps will show you a list of nearby restaurants, along with their ratings and reviews.\n2. **Yelp**: Use Yelp's search function to find restaurants near the hotel's address. You can filter the results by rating, price range, and cuisine to find the perfect spot.\n3. **TripAdvisor**: Similar to Yelp, TripAdvisor allows you to search for restaurants near a specific location. You can also read reviews and check ratings to make an informed decision.\n4. **Ask the hotel staff**: If you're staying at the hotel or attending the conference, you can ask the hotel staff for recommendations on nearby restaurants. They might have some insider knowledge on the best spots!\n5. **Check review websites and blogs**: Look up review websites like Eater, Zagat, or local food blogs that cover the downtown area. They often have lists of recommended restaurants and cafes.\n\nRemember to check reviews, menus, and prices before heading out to ensure you find a spot that fits your taste and budget.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a great lunch and a successful conference!",
