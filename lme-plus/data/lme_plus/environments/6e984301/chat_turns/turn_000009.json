  "content": "If the person who robbed you doesn\u2019t have the means to pay for the damages awarded in the civil lawsuit, you may still be able to recover compensation through other means. For example, if the defendant has insurance coverage, the insurance company may be responsible for paying the damages up to the policy limit. If the defendant does not have insurance or assets to cover the judgement, you may have to pursue other options such as wage garnishment, installment payments or other legal remedies. However, it's important to note that collection of the judgement amount can be difficult, and you may need to consult a lawyer to discuss your options.",
