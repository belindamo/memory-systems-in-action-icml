How many times do you take the train per month?\n2. What is the cost of a single ticket each time you take the train?\n3. What is the cost of a monthly train pass?\n\nOnce we have this information, we can calculate your current monthly spend on individual tickets and compare it to the cost of a monthly pass.\n\nLet me know your answers to these questions and I can help you crunch the numbers!",
