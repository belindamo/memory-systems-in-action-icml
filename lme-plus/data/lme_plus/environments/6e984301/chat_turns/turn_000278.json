Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to specific information about yoga studios or classes near your office or downtown. However, I can suggest some ways to find great yoga classes in your area:\n\n1. **Google search**: Type in \"yoga classes near me\" or \"yoga studios near my office\" and Google will show you a list of nearby studios along with their addresses, phone numbers, and reviews.\n2. **Yoga apps and websites**: Websites like ClassPass, MindBody, or YogaGlo allow you to search for yoga classes and studios in your area. You can filter by location, style, and time to find a class that fits your schedule.\n3. **Yelp**: Yelp is a great resource to find yoga studios and read reviews from other users. You can filter by rating, price, and location to find a studio that suits your needs.\n4. **Ask around**: Ask your colleagues, friends, or family members if they know of any good yoga studios in the area. Word of mouth is a great way to find a studio that's a good fit for you.\n5. **Check with local gyms**: Many gyms offer yoga classes as part of their group fitness programs. Check with gyms near your office or downtown to see if they offer yoga classes and what their schedules are.\n\nRemember to check the studio's schedule, pricing, and style of yoga before heading to a class. It's always a good idea to try out a few different studios and classes to find one that resonates with you.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a great yoga practice!",
