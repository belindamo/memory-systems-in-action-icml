  "content": "Yes, you may be able to claim damages for emotional distress caused by the robbery in a civil lawsuit, depending on the specific facts and circumstances of your case. Emotional distress damages, also known as \"pain and suffering,\" are intended to compensate a victim for the emotional harm and trauma caused by the incident. However, proving emotional distress can be challenging, as it is a subjective and personal experience. You may need to provide evidence such as testimony from mental health professionals, friends or family, or the plaintiff's own testimony to support your claim. It is recommended that you speak to an attorney experienced in personal injury or civil litigation to discuss whether you may be eligible to claim damages for emotional distress.",
