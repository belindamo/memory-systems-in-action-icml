  "content": "Yes, physical therapy can help increase muscle mass and improve muscular tone, as it involves exercises and activities that target specific muscle groups to improve strength and function. However, building muscle and achieving a toned physique often requires a combination of strength training, cardiovascular exercise, and proper nutrition.\n\nWhile physical therapists may provide guidance on appropriate exercise routines to improve muscle mass and tone, they typically do not provide recommendations for supplements or vitamins to support muscle building specifically. Any recommendations related to supplements or vitamins should be made by a licensed healthcare professional, such as a physician or registered dietitian, who can take into account your overall health and any medical conditions you may have.\n\nThat being said, if you are interested in building muscle and achieving a toned physique, it may be beneficial to work with a personal trainer or strength and conditioning specialist in addition to a physical therapist. These professionals can help to design an exercise program that is specifically tailored to your needs and goals, with a focus on increasing muscle mass, improving strength, and achieving the physique you desire.\n\nIt is important to approach muscle building and toning in a safe and healthy manner, with a focus on proper form and technique to minimize the risk of injury. Always consult with a licensed healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program or taking any supplements or vitamins.",
