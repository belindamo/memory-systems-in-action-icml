  "content": "Forbidden Sky is a great choice! It's the third installment in the Forbidden series, and it looks like it's going to be just as exciting as the first two games.\n\nAccording to Gamewright, the publisher, Forbidden Sky is scheduled to be released in August 2018. However, it's always a good idea to check with your local game store or online retailers for the most up-to-date release information, as dates can sometimes change.\n\nForbidden Sky seems to offer a fresh twist on the cooperative gameplay of the series, with the added challenge of building a platform to escape a stormy sky. The demo you saw must have left a great impression on you!\n\nIf you're excited about Forbidden Sky, you might also want to consider checking out the other games in the series: Forbidden Island and Forbidden Desert. They're both excellent cooperative games that offer a similar experience, but with different themes and challenges.\n\nAre you planning on playing Forbidden Sky with the same group of friends and family who enjoy Ticket to Ride, or do you think you'll be introducing it to a new group of gamers?",
