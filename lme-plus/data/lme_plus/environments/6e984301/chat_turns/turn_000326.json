  "content": "Caltech values research experience and considers it to be an essential component of a student's application. Demonstrated research experience shows that a student is intellectually curious, has a strong interest in their field of study, and can think critically and independently. However, it is important to note that having research experience is not a prerequisite for admission to Caltech, and there are many other qualities that the university looks for in a successful applicant. Caltech seeks students who are passionate about their academic pursuits, have a strong work ethic, are driven to excel, and have the potential to make significant contributions to their field and the wider scientific community. The admissions committee evaluates each applicant holistically and makes decisions based on a variety of factors, including academic performance, test scores, extracurricular activities, essays, and letters of recommendation, in addition to research experience.",
