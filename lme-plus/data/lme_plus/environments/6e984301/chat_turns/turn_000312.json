For one, they can serve as a constant reminder of societal and political issues, creating awareness and sparking conversation within the local community. Additionally, these murals may empower those who feel marginalized or oppressed and inspire them to take action towards creating positive change.\n\nHowever, the impact of political murals may not always be positive.
