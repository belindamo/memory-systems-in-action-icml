This will help you practice your technique while still getting a good workout.\n3. **Focus on one drill per session**: Choose one drill to focus on per swim session, and dedicate 10-15 minutes to it. This will help you master the drill before moving on to the next one.\n4. **Start slow and build up**: Begin with shorter distances and gradually increase the length of your drills as you build endurance and confidence.\n5. **Make it a habit**: Try to incorporate drills into your swim routine 2-3 times a week, so it becomes a regular part of your swimming routine.\n\n**Tips for the Rotation Drill with a Kickboard:**\n\n1. **Start with a short distance**: Begin with 25-50 meters and gradually increase the distance as you build endurance.\n2. **Focus on your hips**: Remember to rotate your hips with each stroke, keeping your shoulders and head still.\n3. **Keep your kickboard close**: Hold the kickboard close to your body to maintain a streamlined position.\n4. **Use a slow and controlled pace**: Focus on a slow and controlled pace to ensure you're rotating your body correctly.\n\nBy incorporating these drills into your swim routine, you'll be able to improve your body position and rotation, making your freestyle stroke more efficient and effective.\n\nDo you have any other questions about incorporating drills into your swim routine, or would you like more tips on how to improve your freestyle technique?",
