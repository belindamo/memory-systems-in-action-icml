Here are some general guidelines:\n\n**Maintenance-related issues:**\n\n* Providers typically consider an issue maintenance-related if it's caused by:\n\t+ Lack of regular maintenance, such as failure to replace air filters, clean gutters, or inspect and replace worn-out parts.\n\t+ Neglect, such as ignoring warning signs or symptoms of a potential problem.\n\t+ Failure to follow manufacturer instructions or recommended maintenance schedules.\n* Providers may request maintenance records or proof of regular upkeep to determine if the issue is maintenance-related.\n\n**How providers investigate maintenance-related issues:**\n\n* When you file a claim, the provider will typically send a contractor to assess the issue.\n* The contractor will inspect the affected system or appliance and look for signs of neglect, lack of maintenance, or other contributing factors.\n* The provider may also review your maintenance records, if available, to determine if you've been keeping up with regular maintenance tasks.\n* Based on the investigation, the provider will decide whether the issue is maintenance-related or not.\n\n**Prioritizing maintenance tasks to avoid voiding your warranty:**\n\n* **Regularly inspect and replace air filters:** Failing to replace air filters can cause HVAC systems to work harder, leading to premature wear and tear.\n* **Clean and inspect gutters:** Clogged gutters can cause water damage, foundation issues, and pest infestations.\n* **Maintain your plumbing:** Inspect and replace worn-out washers, check for leaks, and ensure proper water pressure to avoid pipe damage.\n* **Keep your appliances in good working order:** Regularly clean and inspect appliances, replace worn-out parts, and follow manufacturer instructions for maintenance and upkeep.\n* **Inspect and replace smoke detector batteries:** Ensure your smoke detectors are functioning properly to avoid potential fire hazards.\n* **Keep your HVAC system tuned up:** Regularly schedule HVAC maintenance to ensure your system is running efficiently and effectively.\n* **Inspect your roof:** Regularly inspect your roof for damaged, missing, or loose shingles, and ensure proper flashing around chimneys and vents.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Keep a maintenance log or calendar to track your maintenance activities.\n* Follow manufacturer instructions for maintenance and upkeep.\n* Address minor issues promptly to prevent them from becoming major problems.\n* Consider hiring a professional for maintenance tasks you're not comfortable performing yourself.\n\nBy prioritizing these maintenance tasks, you can help prevent maintenance-related issues and reduce the risk of voiding your warranty. However, even with regular maintenance, unexpected issues can still arise. That's where your home warranty can provide protection and peace of mind.\n\nRemember to carefully review your warranty contract and understand what's included, excluded, and limited. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your provider.",
