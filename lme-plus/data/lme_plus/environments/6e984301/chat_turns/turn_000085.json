Since I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information or your exact location, but I can guide you on how to find the information you need.\n\n**Finding the Closest Train Station and Schedule**\n\n1. Open a web browser and search for the website of your local train operator or transit agency. You can also use online trip planners like Google Maps, Transit, or Rome2rio.\n2. Enter your home address or a nearby landmark in the \"From\" field and the city center or downtown area in the \"To\" field.\n3. Select the \"Train\" or \"Rail\" option, and the website will show you the nearest train stations to your home and the schedule for the day.\n4. Take note of the train station closest to your home, the train line or route number, and the schedule for the day. You can also plan your return trip using the same website.\n\n**Recommended Cafes and Shops in the Downtown Area**\n\nSince I don't know the specific city you're visiting, I'll provide some general recommendations that are often popular in downtown areas:\n\n**Cafes:**\n\n1. Look for independent coffee shops or local chains that source their beans from local roasters.\n2. Check out cafes with a cozy atmosphere, outdoor seating, or a great view of the city.\n3. Consider visiting cafes that serve specialty coffee drinks, like pour-overs or lattes.\n\n**Shops:**\n\n1. Boutique stores featuring local designers or artisans are often a great find.\n2. Visit independent bookstores, which often host author readings or book clubs.\n3. Explore vintage or second-hand shops for unique finds and souvenirs.\n4. Check out local markets or food halls for a variety of vendors selling everything from artisanal foods to handmade jewelry.\n\nSome popular downtown areas often have a \"Main Street\" or a pedestrian-friendly zone with a concentration of shops, cafes, and restaurants. You can also ask locals or fellow travelers for recommendations on the best spots to visit.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Be sure to check the train schedule in advance to plan your day accordingly.\n* Consider purchasing a day pass or all-day ticket for unlimited travel on the train.\n* Pack a refillable water bottle and snacks to keep you energized throughout the day.\n* Wear comfortable shoes and dress in layers, as the downtown area might be more crowded and warm.\n\nI hope this helps!
