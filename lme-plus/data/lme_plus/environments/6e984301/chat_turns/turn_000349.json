Why? Sports are among the most difficult events to watch live without cable because of the limits placed on regional sports markets. \n\nIn this case, the surest way to watch [TEAM] is with a VPN. It\u2019s not very complicated. You simply need to join a server in a region where [TEAM] games are available on [STREAMER 1] and sign up for a [STREAMER 1] account if you don\u2019t already have one. Then you can watch to your heart\u2019s content \u2014 wherever you are in the world. \n\n### Best VPN Servers to Connect To:\n- If you're located outside the US: [SPECIFIC REGION RECOMMENDATION]\n- If you're located in [TEAM's HOME TOWN] and have regional restrictions: [SPECIFIC REGION RECOMMENDATION]\n\nThe most premium VPN is ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN isn\u2019t the cheapest VPN on the market, but it is the option that makes watching [TEAM] the easiest \u2014 with servers in nearly 100 countries. But if you\u2019d like to consider other VPN options, read about our [top VPN picks](http://flixed.io/us/en/best-vpn).\n\nInstruction:\nYou are a Flixed writer writing a paragraph that uses the data to incorporate a suggestion of which VPN. Also recommend a specific VPN region to connect to keeping in mind the the TEAM's location while avoiding blackouts or any issues like that. Use abbreviations for the team name when it makes sense e.g. instead of the San Francisco 49ers, sometimes it makes sense to just say 49ers. Markdown link relevant words or phrases e.g. the [VPN](https://example.com).\n\nStick to the template closely.\n\nTone:\nInformative, not salesy, expert, friendly",
