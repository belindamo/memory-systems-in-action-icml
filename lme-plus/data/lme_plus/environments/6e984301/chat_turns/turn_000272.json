However, I can suggest a few options to help you find healthy lunch options near your office:\n\n1. **Check their website or social media**: Look up the caf\u00e9's website, Facebook page, or Instagram account to see if they have posted their menu online. You can also check for reviews or comments from customers to get an idea of their healthy options.\n2. **Use online review platforms**: Websites like Yelp, Google Reviews, or TripAdvisor often have menus and reviews from customers that can give you an idea of the caf\u00e9's offerings.\n3. **Give them a call**: If you're short on time, you can quickly call the caf\u00e9 and ask about their healthy options. They might be able to provide you with some recommendations or describe their menu items.\n\nAs for the conference at the hotel downtown, you can:\n\n1. **Check the hotel's website**: Look up the hotel's website to see if they have a restaurant or caf\u00e9 on site, and if they post their menus online.\n2. **Ask the conference organizers**: Reach out to the conference organizers or check the conference website to see if they have any information about lunch options available at the hotel.\n3. **Plan ahead**: If you're unsure about the hotel's options, consider packing a lunch or researching healthy restaurants near the hotel in advance.\n\nI hope these suggestions help, and I wish you a great lunch and a productive conference!",
