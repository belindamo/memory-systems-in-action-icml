While certain supplements can be helpful to support heart health, they cannot replace a healthy diet and exercise. \n\nDiet and physical activity are critical components to improving cardiovascular health. Consuming a well-balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats can help reduce the risk of heart disease. Physical activity can also help improve heart health by improving circulation, reducing blood pressure, and strengthening the heart muscle.\n\nWhile supplements can provide additional support, they should be used as part of an overall plan that includes lifestyle changes such as healthy eating habits and regular exercise. Consulting a healthcare professional can help determine the most effective plan for improving cardiovascular health.",
