Listening to a daily French podcast during your commute is an excellent way to improve your listening comprehension and get a feel for the rhythm and pronunciation of the language.\n\nTo take it to the next level, you might consider supplementing your podcast listening with some speaking and writing practice. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Find a language exchange partner**: Look for a colleague or a language exchange app (like Tandem or HelloTalk) to practice speaking with a native French speaker.\n2. **Use language learning apps**: Apps like Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone can help you practice reading, writing, and speaking in French.\n3. **Watch French videos or TV shows**: Watching French videos or TV shows with English subtitles can help you improve your listening and comprehension skills.\n4. **Practice writing in French**: Try writing short journal entries or even social media posts in French to practice your writing skills.\n\nRemember, the key is to be consistent and make language learning a part of your daily routine. You can also try to use French in your daily conversations with your colleagues, even if it's just a few words or phrases. Bonne chance (good luck), and I'm sure your colleagues will appreciate your efforts!\n\nWhat's been the most challenging part of learning French for you so far?",
