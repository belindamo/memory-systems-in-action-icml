What is the name of the city you're planning to visit?\n2. Where are you starting from (your current location or a specific transit hub)?\n3. What are your interests in the city? Are you looking to visit specific attractions, shop, or explore a particular neighborhood?\n4. What time of day are you planning to leave and return?\n5. Do you have a preferred mode of transportation (bus, train, or a combination of both)?\n6. Are there any specific transit agencies or routes you're familiar with or would like to use?\n\nRegarding your small cross-body bag, don't worry \u2013 you'll be just fine with a compact bag. You can easily carry the essentials like your wallet, phone, keys, snacks, and a water bottle.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you plan a convenient and efficient route using public transportation.",
