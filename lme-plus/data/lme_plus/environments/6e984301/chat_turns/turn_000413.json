  "content": "While supplements can be helpful for improving cardiovascular health, they are not a replacement for a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Supplements work best when they are used to complement a healthy lifestyle, not as a substitute for it. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that you make dietary and lifestyle changes in combination with taking any supplements. Aim to consume a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources, and engage in regular physical activity or exercise. \n\nBy incorporating a healthy diet and exercise, along with the use of certain supplements under the guidance of a healthcare professional, you can potentially improve your cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of heart disease.",
