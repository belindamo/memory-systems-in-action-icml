Avocados are a great addition to the Quinoa and Black Bean Bowl, and there are a few ways to prepare them. Here are some suggestions:\n\n**1. Diced Avocado**: Simply dice the avocado into small pieces and sprinkle them on top of the quinoa and black bean mixture. This is a great way to add creaminess and freshness to the dish.\n\n**2. Mashed Avocado**: Mash the avocado in a bowl with a fork until it's mostly smooth. Add a squeeze of lime juice, salt, and pepper to taste. This adds a rich, creamy element to the dish.\n\n**3. Avocado Slices**: Slice the avocado into thin pieces and arrange them on top of the quinoa and black bean mixture. This adds a nice visual appeal to the dish and provides a refreshing contrast in texture.\n\n**4. Guacamole**: If you want to get a bit fancier, you can make a simple guacamole by mashing the avocado with lime juice, salt, and your desired spices (e.g., cumin, chili powder). Then, spoon the guacamole on top of the quinoa and black bean mixture.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to handle the avocados gently to avoid bruising or browning.\n* If you're not using the avocado immediately, sprinkle some lime juice on top to prevent browning.\n* You can also add some diced red onion, cilantro, or tomato to the avocado for added flavor and texture.\n\nChoose your preferred avocado preparation method, and you're ready to assemble the Quinoa and Black Bean Bowl! Enjoy your delicious and nutritious meal before your yoga practice.",
