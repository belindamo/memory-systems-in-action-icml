Here are some quick and easy-to-prepare ideas:\n\n1. **Fresh Fruits**: Apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, or any other fruits you like are a nutritious and convenient snack.\n2. **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or sunflower seeds are rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber.\n3. **Energy Balls**: Make your own energy balls with rolled oats, peanut butter, honey, and chia seeds. They're no-bake, easy to prepare, and packed with nutrients.\n4. **Yogurt and Granola**: Mix together Greek yogurt, granola, and some fresh fruits for a protein-rich snack.\n5. **Veggie Sticks with Hummus**: Carrot, celery, and cucumber sticks with a side of hummus make for a crunchy and healthy snack.\n6. **Hard-Boiled Eggs**: Boil some eggs and keep them in the fridge for a quick protein-rich snack.\n7. **Avocado Toast**: Toast some whole-grain bread, mash an avocado, and sprinkle some salt and pepper for a healthy and filling snack.\n8. **Trail Mix**: Mix together nuts, seeds, and dried fruits for a healthy and convenient snack that's easy to take on-the-go.\n9. **Protein Smoothie**: Blend together your favorite fruits, yogurt, and milk for a quick and nutritious snack.\n10. **Dark Chocolate**: Dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content is a healthy and satisfying snack option.\n\nRemember, the key is to choose snacks that are nutrient-dense, easy to prepare, and can be taken on-the-go.
