Uncommon - Ninja warriors with slightly unique gear or uniform design, or with a specific weapon.\n3. Rare - Ninja warriors with rare and unique gear or uniform design, or with a powerful or exotic weapon.\n4. Epic - Ninja warriors with legendary status or exceptional abilities, such as a master swordsman or an expert in stealth.\n5. Legendary - The rarest and most coveted of all, representing the greatest ninja warriors in history, with legendary gear or abilities, or representing a specific historical figure.\n\nOf course, these are just suggestions and can be adjusted based on the specific characteristics and attributes of the NFT collection."
