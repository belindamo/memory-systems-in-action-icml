Shaping the dough into bagels can be a bit tricky, but with some tips and practice, you'll get the hang of it.\n\nHere are some tips to help you shape the dough into beautiful bagels:\n\n1. **Use the right dough:** Make sure your dough is at the right consistency. It should be slightly sticky, but not too sticky. If it's too dry, it will be difficult to shape.\n2. **Divide the dough evenly:** Divide the dough into 8-10 equal pieces. You can use a kitchen scale to ensure they're all the same weight.\n3. **Roll out each piece:** Roll out each piece of dough into a ball and then use your thumbs to create a hole in the center, making a bagel shape. Try to make the hole about 1-2 inches in diameter.\n4. **Stretch and shape:** Hold the dough by the hole and use your fingers to stretch and shape the dough into a bagel shape. You can use a gentle pulling and folding motion to create the characteristic bagel shape.\n5. **Don't overwork the dough:** Be gentle when shaping the dough, as overworking it can lead to a dense bagel. Try to shape each bagel in about 30 seconds to 1 minute.\n6. **Use a reference:** If you're new to shaping bagels, it can be helpful to use a reference, such as a bagel shape cutter or a picture of a bagel, to get an idea of the desired shape.\n7. **Practice makes perfect:** Don't be discouraged if your first few bagels don't turn out perfectly. It takes practice to get the hang of shaping bagels, so keep trying and you'll get better with each one.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Make sure your work surface is lightly floured to prevent the dough from sticking.\n* Use a gentle touch when shaping the dough, as it can be delicate.\n* If you find that your bagels are coming out too dense or heavy, try adjusting your yeast amount or proofing time.\n* Don't overcrowd your baking sheet, as this can cause the bagels to stick together.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and be patient with yourself. Making bagels from scratch can be a process, but it's rewarding and delicious!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'm here to help. Good luck, and I hope your bagels turn out amazing!",
