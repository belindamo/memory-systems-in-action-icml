  "content": "Yes, there are ongoing infrastructure projects in Scotland that have been successful in involving local communities in the planning process.\n\nOne example is the Glasgow City Region City Deal, which is a \u00a31.13 billion investment programme aimed at stimulating economic growth and improving infrastructure across the Glasgow City Region. The project has involved extensive consultation with local communities and stakeholders, including the creation of a Citizen's Panel to engage with members of the public.\n\nAnother example is the ongoing redevelopment of the former St Rollox railway works in Springburn, Glasgow. The project has involved collaboration with local stakeholders, including community groups, to repurpose the site for social housing, a new railway training centre, and other community uses.\n\nLastly, the new Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route/Balmedie-Tipperty project is another example of a successful infrastructure project. The project involved significant community consultation and engagement, including the creation of a Community Liaison Group that provided a forum for local residents and businesses to voice concerns and provide feedback on the project.\n\nOverall, involving local communities in the planning and decision-making process for infrastructure projects is crucial for ensuring that projects are sustainable and responsive to the needs of communities. The success of the projects mentioned above highlights the value of community involvement and consultation in infrastructure planning.",
