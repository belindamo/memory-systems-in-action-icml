I'll also try to create lists to categorize the accounts I follow, so I can quickly find the content that's most relevant to me. Additionally, I'll make an effort to avoid getting sucked into arguments or debates, and take breaks from Twitter every now and then. Do you have any tips on how to stay informed about news and current events without relying too heavily on social media? I've been thinking about subscribing to some online news publications or podcasts to stay up-to-date.",
