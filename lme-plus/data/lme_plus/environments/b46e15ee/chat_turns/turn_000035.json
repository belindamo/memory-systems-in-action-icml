From there, they can browse through the list of changes, compare different versions of the article, and see any comments or edit summaries left by other users.\n\nPage history is a useful tool for tracking changes made to an article and for identifying areas where conflicting information may have been added. It allows users to see how an article has evolved over time and provides them with the context they need to understand any differences of opinion that may exist.",
