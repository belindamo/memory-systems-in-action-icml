  "content": "Economy Plus on United still offers standard economy meals, but with a few tweaks. While they're not gourmet meals like in first class, United has made efforts to improve their economy food options in recent years.\n\n**United's Economy Meal Options:**\n\n* **Buy-on-Board**: On most flights, you can purchase snacks and meals from United's buy-on-board menu, which includes items like sandwiches, salads, and snacks.\n* **Complimentary Meals**: On longer flights (typically over 2 hours), United offers complimentary meals, which are usually a choice between two options, such as a sandwich or a salad.\n* **Pre-Order Meals**: On some flights, you can pre-order meals up to 24 hours before departure, which guarantees you'll get your preferred option.\n\nThe quality of United's economy meals can vary, but they're generally decent. You might not find anything as delicious as that chicken shawarma wrap from The Original Farmers Market, but they're edible and will fill you up.\n\n**Tips for Economy Meal Options:**\n\n* **Pre-order meals**: If you have a specific dietary restriction or preference, pre-ordering a meal can ensure you get something you like.\n* **Choose wisely**: Opt for meals that are less likely to be affected by food quality, such as sandwiches or salads, instead of hot meals.\n* **Bring your own snacks**: If you have specific snack preferences or dietary needs, consider bringing your own snacks on board.\n\nKeep in mind that food options might be limited, especially on shorter flights. If you're particular about your meals, you might want to consider bringing your own food or purchasing something at the airport before your flight.\n\nNow, I'm curious - what made that chicken shawarma wrap at The Original Farmers Market so great? Was it the flavors, the texture, or something else?",
