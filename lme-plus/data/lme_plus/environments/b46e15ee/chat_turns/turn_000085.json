  "content": "Certainly! Here are some examples of movies that effectively use framing and composition to create a disorienting subterranean environment:\n\n1. The Descent (2005) - This horror film follows a group of women who venture into an unexplored cave system. The filmmakers use tight shots of the characters' faces and the surrounding darkness to create a sense of claustrophobia and disorientation.\n\n2. The Cave (2005) - This creature feature follows a team of researchers who venture into an underground cave system. The filmmakers use low-angle shots of the expansive caves and close-up shots of the characters to create a sense of awe and disorientation.\n\n3. As Above, So Below (2014) - This found-footage horror film follows a team of explorers who venture into the catacombs beneath Paris. The filmmakers use shaky point-of-view shots and negative space to create a sense of disorientation and confusion.\n\n4. The Tunnel (2011) - This thriller follows a journalist who investigates a government cover-up involving a subterranean water system. The filmmakers use close-up shots of the characters' faces and negative space to create a sense of claustrophobia and anxiety.\n\n5. Crawl (2019) - This disaster horror film follows a woman and her father who become trapped in their home's crawl space during a Category 5 hurricane. The filmmakers use tight shots of the characters and negative space to create a sense of drowning and disorientation.\n\nI hope these examples provide some inspiration for your own film!",
