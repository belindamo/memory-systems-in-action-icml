  "content": "That's fantastic to hear! It's great that you're making progress with your language classes and that you have a wonderful teacher like Yumi-sensei to guide you. Learning a language takes time and practice, but it's clear that you're dedicated and motivated.\n\nBeing able to navigate menus, ask for directions, and hold simple conversations with locals can make a huge difference in your daily life in Tokyo. It's amazing how much more enjoyable and fulfilling your experience can be when you can communicate effectively with the people around you.\n\nThree times a week is a great frequency for language classes, and I'm sure you'll continue to see improvement with consistent practice. Don't hesitate to ask Yumi-sensei or other language learners for help or feedback when you need it.\n\nKeep up the good work, and I'm sure you'll be speaking like a native in no time! What's been the most challenging part of learning Japanese for you so far, and what's been the most rewarding?",
