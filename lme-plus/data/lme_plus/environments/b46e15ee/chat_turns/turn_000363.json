  "content": "As an AI language model, I can provide some historical context. Illuminated manuscripts were mainly produced during the medieval and Renaissance periods, a time when the production and distribution of books were limited by the high cost of materials, the lack of printing presses, and low literacy rates. The creation of illuminated manuscripts was a labor-intensive craft that involved highly skilled scribes, painters, and craftsmen who employed a range of expensive materials and techniques to produce these works of art. As such, illuminated manuscripts were generally commissioned by wealthy patrons, such as the church, nobility, and monarchs, who could afford to pay for their production. These patrons viewed illuminated manuscripts as valuable symbols of their status and commissioned them to either glorify religious texts, preserve literary works or commemorate important events.\n\nMoreover, during this period, the idea of mass production of books for the general public was not yet a reality. The lack of printing presses and the low literacy rates, meant that production of books was a slow and expensive process. Thus, the use of gold and silver leaf in illuminated manuscripts was seen as a way to elevate the spiritual value of the text, and to create visually striking works of art that would be treasured by generations of people who could not afford to commission such works. Overall, while the use of such costly materials might seem extravagant or wasteful, it was seen as an appropriate way to commemorate religious or secular texts, and to preserve them for future generations.",
