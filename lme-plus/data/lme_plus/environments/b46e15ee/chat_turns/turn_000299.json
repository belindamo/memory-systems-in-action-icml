This will help you stay focused and motivated.\n2. **Create a budget**: Review your income and expenses to see where you can cut back on unnecessary spending. Allocate a certain amount each month towards saving for the boots.\n3. **Start a separate savings account**: Open a separate savings account specifically for your boots fund.

This way, you can earn points or cash that can be redeemed towards your boots.\n9. **Avoid impulse purchases**: Be mindful of your spending habits and avoid making impulse purchases, especially on items that aren't essential. Remember, your goal is to save for the boots!\n10. **Visualize your goal**: Keep a picture of the boots as your phone wallpaper or put it on your fridge as a reminder of your goal.
