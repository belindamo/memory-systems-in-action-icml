The Princess card is a single card with a specific set of attributes and abilities.\nMy apologies for any confusion, I made a mistake on previous message.\n\nAs a reminder the Princess is a Ranged troop card that targets both air and ground. She will attack the closest building or enemy unit and have a moderate amount of hitpoints.\nYou can find more details on the card and other cards, as well as strategy tips, on the official Clash Royale website or community forums.",
