It's definitely made a big difference in my daily life here in Tokyo - I can navigate menus, ask for directions, and even hold simple conversations with locals. My teacher, Yumi-sensei, is great too - she's very patient and explains things clearly. I've been attending classes three times a week, and I feel like I'm making good progress.",
