Finding reliable sources is one of the most important things you can do when editing articles on Wikipedia, as it helps to ensure that the information you are adding is accurate and verifiable. Here are some tips for finding reliable sources:\n\n1. Use scholarly sources: Scholarly sources, such as academic papers or books written by experts in a particular field, are often considered to be the most reliable sources of information. You can find scholarly sources by searching academic databases, such as JSTOR or Google Scholar. 2. Check reputable news sources: Well-known news sources, such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, or BBC News, are generally considered to be reliable sources of information. However, it's important to verify that the specific article or report you are citing is accurate and trustworthy. 3. Avoid unreliable sources: Be careful about using sources that are not well-regarded or that have a reputation for spreading false information. These might include blogs, social media posts, or anonymous websites. 4. Look for multiple sources: Whenever possible, try to find multiple sources that agree on a particular piece of information. This can help you to ensure that the information is accurate and to avoid relying on a single, potentially biased source. 5. Check the citations of existing articles: If you are editing an existing article, take a look at the sources that are already cited in the article. These can be a good starting point for finding additional sources that support your edits. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to sourcing information on Wikipedia. By using reliable sources and taking the time to verify information, you can help ensure that the platform remains a trusted source of information for users around the world.",
