Here are some recommendations that are particularly well-suited for 5-6 players:\n\n1. **Codenames**: This game is excellent for larger groups, as it can be played in teams or as individuals. With 5-6 players, you can divide into two teams of 2-3 players each.\n2. **Taboo**: This fast-paced word-guessing game is perfect for larger groups. With 5-6 players, you can play in teams or as individuals, and the game will still be plenty engaging.\n3. **Monikers**: This party game is designed for larger groups and is an excellent choice for 5-6 players. It's a great way to get everyone laughing and engaged.\n4. **Wits & Wagers**: This game is also suitable for larger groups and can be played with 5-6 players. It's a great way to encourage creative thinking and humor.\n5. **Debatable**: This game can be played with 5-6 players, and its debatable answers will likely lead to lively discussions and debates.\n\nGames that might not be as suitable for 5-6 players include:\n\n* **Quelf**: While it can be played with 5-6 players, the game's complexity and scoring system might make it less enjoyable with a larger group.\n* **Dixit**: While it can be played with 5-6 players, the game's voting mechanism might become less effective with a larger group, making it less engaging.\n* **Word Chain**: This game is best played with 2-4 players, as it can become too chaotic with 5-6 players.\n\nKeep in mind that some games may require adjustments to the rules or gameplay to accommodate a larger group. Always check the game's instructions or online resources for guidance on playing with larger groups.\n\nIf you're looking for more games that specifically cater to 5-6 players, I can provide additional recommendations!",
