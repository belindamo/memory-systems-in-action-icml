Layers: The weather in Machu Picchu can be unpredictable, so it's important to pack clothes that can be layered as needed. This includes a light jacket, a warm sweater or fleece, and a waterproof jacket or poncho. 2. Comfortable shoes: You will be doing a lot of walking and climbing on uneven terrain, so it's important to wear comfortable and sturdy shoes. Make sure to break them in before the trip to avoid blisters. 3. Sun protection: The sun can be strong at high altitudes, so pack a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen to protect your skin and eyes. 4. Insect repellent: There may be mosquitoes and other insects around Machu Picchu, especially during the rainy season. Bring insect repellent to protect yourself from bites. 5. Cash and ID: You will need your passport to enter Machu Picchu and some sites around it. Bring local currency to pay for meals, souvenirs, and other expenses. 6.
