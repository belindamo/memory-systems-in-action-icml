It requires the ability to think and react quickly, adapt to new information, and come up with creative solutions to problems.\n\nSalespeople who can think on their feet are able to handle objections, answer difficult questions, and pivot their sales pitch in response to the needs and interests of the customer. They are able to stay focused and in control even when the conversation takes an unexpected turn.\n\nThinking on your feet is a valuable skill for salespeople because it allows them to build trust with the customer, demonstrate their expertise, and ultimately close more deals. It requires a combination of product knowledge, communication skills, and the ability to stay calm under pressure.",
