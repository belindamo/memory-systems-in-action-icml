(boots, part of $350 ASOS purchase)\n* Accessories: $250 (Coach handbag)\n* Electronics:\n\t+ Smartwatch and wireless charging pad: $150\n* Home Goods: $50 (kitchen utensils)\n* Clothing:\n\t+ Dresses (3): $? (part of $350 ASOS purchase)\n\t+ Boots: $? (part of $350 ASOS purchase)\n\nSince the boots are part of the Footwear category, let's allocate the cost accordingly. Let's assume the boots cost around $100 (you can adjust this amount if you know the exact price). That leaves $250 for the three dresses.\n\nHere's the updated list:\n\n* Footwear: $120 (Adidas sneakers) + $100 (boots) = $220\n* Accessories: $250 (Coach handbag)\n* Electronics:\n\t+ Smartwatch and wireless charging pad: $150\n* Home Goods: $50 (kitchen utensils)\n* Clothing: $250 (3 dresses)\n\nYou've got a good start on tracking your expenses! Do you have any other purchases you'd like to add to the list?",
