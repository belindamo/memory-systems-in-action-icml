(part of ASOS purchase)\n\t+ Boots: $? (part of ASOS purchase)\n\nCan you tell me how much you spent on the ASOS purchase in total? That way, we can allocate the cost to the dresses and boots.\n\nAlso, I'll assume the boots go under Footwear, so we can update that category:\n\n* Footwear: $120 (Adidas sneakers) + $? (boots)\n\nLet me know the total ASOS purchase amount, and we'll sort it out!",
