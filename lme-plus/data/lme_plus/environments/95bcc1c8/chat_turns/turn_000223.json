  "content": "Tsukiji Fish Market is a must-visit destination in Tokyo! While the inner market has moved to a new location called Toyosu Market, the outer market at Tsukiji still offers a fascinating glimpse into Tokyo's seafood culture.\n\nGetting to Tsukiji Fish Market from Shibuya is relatively easy. Here are the best ways to do so:\n\n**Option 1: Subway**\n\n* Take the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line from Shibuya Station to Shimbashi Station (10 minutes, \u00a5240).\n* At Shimbashi, transfer to the Tokyo Metro Toei Asakusa Line and take the train to Tsukiji-shijo Station (5 minutes, \u00a5240).\n* From Tsukiji-shijo Station, follow the signs to the Tsukiji Outer Market (about a 5-minute walk).\n\n**Option 2: JR Train**\n\n* Take the JR Yamanote Line from Shibuya Station to Shimbashi Station (10 minutes, \u00a5240).\n* At Shimbashi, walk to the Tokyo Metro Toei Asakusa Line and take the train to Tsukiji-shijo Station (5 minutes, \u00a5240).\n* From Tsukiji-shijo Station, follow the signs to the Tsukiji Outer Market (about a 5-minute walk).\n\n**Option 3: Taxi**\n\n* Take a taxi from Shibuya Station to Tsukiji Fish Market (about 20-30 minutes, depending on traffic, around \u00a52,500-3,500).\n\nNote: Be aware that traffic in Tokyo can be unpredictable, so plan your trip accordingly. If you're planning to visit the Tsukiji Outer Market early in the morning to see the fish auction (which is still held at Toyosu Market), you may want to consider taking a taxi or leaving Shibuya very early to account for potential traffic delays.\n\nOnce you arrive at Tsukiji, you can explore the outer market, try some fresh sushi or seafood, and visit the nearby Tsukiji Hongan-ji Temple.\n\nTips:\n\n* Tsukiji Fish Market is open from around 5:00 AM to 1:00 PM, but the busiest time is usually between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM.\n* Be prepared for crowds and long lines, especially if you want to try popular sushi restaurants like Sushi Dai or Daiwa Sushi.\n* Don't forget to try some fresh seafood, such as sushi, sashimi, or grilled fish.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time at Tsukiji Fish Market!",
