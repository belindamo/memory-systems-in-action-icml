Super Bowl LVII (57) was played on February 12, 2023, and it was indeed between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. But I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences, and I don't know anything about your personal life or social events.\n\nIt's possible that you're thinking of a different event or mixing up details. Don't worry, it happens to the best of us! If you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!",
