Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n**Commercial Break Challenges:**\n\n1. **March Madness Trivia**: Create a quick trivia game with questions about college basketball, the NCAA tournament, or the teams playing.\n2. **Bracket Bingo**: Distribute bingo cards with different basketball-related terms (e.g., \"slam dunk,\" \"three-pointer,\" \"timeout\"). Guests mark off the terms as they're called during the game.\n3. **Commercial Break Challenges**: Set up a series of quick challenges, such as \"Who can do the most jumping jacks during the commercial break?\" or \"Who can eat a snack the fastest?\"\n4. **Predict the Score**: Have guests predict the score at the end of the next quarter or half. The person closest to the actual score wins.\n5. **Word Scramble**: Create a word scramble with basketball-related terms (e.g., \"TEAM,\" \"HOOP,\" \"COURT\"). Guests unscramble the words during the commercial break.\n\n**Interactive Games:**\n\n1. **March Madness Charades**: Divide guests into two teams. Write down basketball-related terms or phrases (e.g., \"dunk contest,\" \"full-court press\") on slips of paper and have team members act them out for their teammates to guess.\n2. **Basketball-themed Karaoke**: Create a playlist of basketball-themed songs (e.g., \"Space Jam,\" \"I Believe I Can Fly\") or popular sports anthems. Guests can sing along during commercial breaks.\n3. **March Madness-themed Pictionary**: Draw a basketball-themed picture (e.g., a basketball hoop, a player dunking) and have guests guess what it is.\n\n**Social Media Integration:**\n\n1. **Social Media Challenge**: Encourage guests to share photos or videos of their game-day experience on social media using a branded hashtag. The guest with the most creative post wins a prize.\n2. **Live Tweeting**: Set up a live tweet station where guests can share their thoughts and reactions to the game in real-time.\n\n**Prizes and Incentives:**\n\n1. **Game-Day Prizes**: Offer prizes for the winners of the games and challenges, such as gift cards, snacks, or team-themed merchandise.\n2. **MVP Award**: Give an \"MVP\" (Most Valuable Partygoer) award to the guest who participates the most or has the most spirit during the party.\n\nRemember to keep the games and activities short, fun, and easy to understand. You want to make sure they don't distract from the main event \u2013 the game itself!",
