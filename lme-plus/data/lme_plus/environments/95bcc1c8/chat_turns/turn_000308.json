  "content": "TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, which is a numerical statistic used in NLP to reflect the importance of a word in a document or corpus. TF-IDF involves two main components: term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).\n\nTF refers to the frequency of a term (i.e., a word) in a document, normalized by the total number of words in that document. In other words, it measures how frequently a term appears in a specific document.\n\nIDF, on the other hand, measures how important a term is across the entire corpus, by calculating the logarithm of the total number of documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents that contain that term. The idea is that rare words that appear in only a few documents are more important than words that appear frequently in many documents.\n\nThe TF-IDF score for a term in a document is calculated by multiplying the term frequency by the inverse document frequency.\n\nTF-IDF is used as a feature extraction technique in many NLP tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and document clustering. It is a way of representing text data numerically, and it is often used as input to machine learning algorithms.\n\nTF-IDF is not a topic modeling technique, but rather a technique for feature extraction and text representation.",
