  "content": "The Ted Bundy case is one of the most infamous true crime stories in American history. There are several documentaries and films about Ted Bundy, and I'd be happy to recommend a few:\n\n1. **Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes** (2019) - This is a Netflix original documentary series that features exclusive interviews with Ted Bundy during his time on death row. The series explores Bundy's childhood, his crimes, and his motivations, and offers a unique glimpse into the mind of a serial killer.\n2. **Ted Bundy: Falling for a Killer** (2020) - This Amazon Prime documentary series is a more recent release, and it focuses on Bundy's relationships with women, including his girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall and her daughter Molly. The series features interviews with people who knew Bundy and offers a fresh perspective on his crimes.\n3. **The Ted Bundy Story** (2004) - This documentary is a more traditional, straightforward retelling of Bundy's crimes and capture. It features interviews with investigators, witnesses, and experts, and provides a detailed account of Bundy's life and crimes.\n4. **Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile** (2019) - This is a biographical crime drama film that stars Zac Efron as Ted Bundy. While not a traditional documentary, the film is based on the memoir \"The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy\" by Elizabeth Kendall, and offers a dramatized account of Bundy's life and crimes.\n\nAll of these documentaries and films offer a unique perspective on the Ted Bundy case, and are worth watching if you're interested in true crime. However, keep in mind that some of the content may be disturbing or triggering, so viewer discretion is advised.",
