  "content": "Here's a revised paragraph:\n\nSince 2020, we have recruited children aged three to seven years from a local Latine community in the Western USA, with the majority identifying as Hispanic/Latine. Data collection has been conducted both in-home and in-lab settings, and has yielded over 400 watching sessions thus far. This project involves ongoing data collection, and we anticipate collecting more data over the next few years. By recruiting a diverse sample from an underrepresented community, we aim to contribute to a more inclusive understanding of children's science learning through guided conversations with conversational agents.",
