  "content": "I'm particularly interested in learning more about the cultural traditions and customs of India that are relevant to my own family's heritage. Since I was born in New York City and I've always considered myself an Indian American, I'm curious to learn more about the cultural practices that my parents brought with them when they immigrated to the US in the 1980s. Can you recommend some resources or books that would help me understand more about the cultural traditions and customs of India that are specific to my family's region or community?",
