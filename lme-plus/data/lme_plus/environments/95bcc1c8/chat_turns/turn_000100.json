  "content": "I've been trying to get more comfortable with improvising and thinking on my feet. I recently took an improv class and it was really helpful. We did some exercises where we had to think on our feet and respond to unexpected situations. It was actually really fun and I felt like I was able to be more spontaneous and creative. I've also been trying to incorporate more improv into my daily life, like when I'm talking to friends or family. It's helping me to be more present in the moment and not overthink things as much.",
