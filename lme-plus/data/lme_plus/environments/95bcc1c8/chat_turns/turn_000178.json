  "content": "I've been thinking about how I consume books, and I realized that I've been switching between audiobooks and e-books depending on my mood and schedule. If I have a lot of driving or chores to do, I'll opt for an audiobook. But if I have some dedicated time to sit and read, I'll usually choose an e-book. It's been interesting to see how my preferences have evolved over time. By the way, my daily commute is about 45 minutes each way, so audiobooks have been a great way to make the most of that time.",
