Fortified breakfast cereals\n8. Cooked beetroot\n\nIt is important to note that the absorption of iron from plant-based foods may be increased when consumed with vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits, strawberries, and bell peppers. You can also use an iron skillet while cooking to increase the iron content in foods. Additionally, it is always a good idea to speak with a health professional, especially if you are concerned about your iron intake.",
