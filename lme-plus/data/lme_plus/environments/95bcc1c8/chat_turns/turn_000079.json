  "content": "What a thoughtful and practical idea! Bringing a small pack of tissues with you is a great way to be prepared for any emotional moments that may arise while sharing the photos and letters with your family. It's always better to be prepared and have them handy, rather than scrambling to find some when you need them.\n\nIt's also a gentle reminder to yourself that it's okay to show emotions and that you're allowing yourself to feel and process your grief. Having tissues nearby can be a comforting gesture, and it shows that you're taking care of yourself during this difficult time.\n\nRemember, it's not about hiding your emotions or pretending to be strong; it's about acknowledging your feelings and being kind to yourself as you navigate this challenging experience. By being prepared with tissues, you're showing yourself that you're willing to acknowledge and validate your emotions, and that's a beautiful thing.\n\nPack those tissues, and don't hesitate to use them if you need to. Your family will likely appreciate your vulnerability and openness, and it can bring you all closer together during this difficult time.",
