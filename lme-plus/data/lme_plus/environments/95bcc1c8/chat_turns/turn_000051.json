I'm sure you'll love the Transport Tote and Mini Transport Crossbody.\n\n**Caring for Canvas:**\n\nCanvas is a relatively low-maintenance material, but here are some tips to help you keep your Transport Tote looking its best:\n\n1. **Spot clean stains immediately**: Use a damp cloth to blot any spills or stains. Avoid rubbing the stain as it can damage the canvas.\n2. **Avoid harsh chemicals**: Never use harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or conditioners on canvas, as they can damage the material or discolor it.\n3. **Condition occasionally**: You can use a fabric conditioner or a canvas-specific cleaner to condition the canvas every 2-3 months. This will help maintain the material's texture and prevent it from becoming brittle.\n4. **Store properly**: When not in use, store your Transport Tote in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. You can also stuff the bag with paper or cloth to maintain its shape.\n\n**Caring for Pebbled Leather:**\n\nPebbled leather requires a bit more care than canvas, but it's still relatively easy to maintain. Here are some tips to help you keep your Mini Transport Crossbody looking its best:\n\n1. **Condition regularly**: Use a leather conditioner or leather oil specifically designed for pebbled leather. Apply a small amount to a soft cloth and gently rub it into the leather. This will help keep the leather soft and supple.\n2. **Avoid harsh chemicals**: Never use harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or conditioners on pebbled leather, as they can damage the material or discolor it.\n3. **Protect from water**: While pebbled leather is somewhat water-resistant, it's still important to avoid exposing it to excessive water or moisture. If your bag gets wet, let it air dry naturally. Avoid using heat to speed up the drying process.\n4. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Avoid leaving your Mini Transport Crossbody in extreme temperatures (very hot or cold) for extended periods, as this can cause the leather to crack or become brittle.\n5. **Handle with care**: Be gentle when handling your Mini Transport Crossbody, as pebbled leather can scratch or scuff easily.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Avoid overloading**: Don't overload your bag with too many items, as this can cause the straps or handles to stretch or break.\n2. **Avoid exposure to direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause colors to fade or materials to degrade over time.\n3. **Clean your bag regularly**: Regular cleaning can help prevent dirt and stains from building up and causing damage to the material.\n\nBy following these care tips, you'll be able to enjoy your Transport Tote and Mini Transport Crossbody for a long time.\n\nI hope that helps!
