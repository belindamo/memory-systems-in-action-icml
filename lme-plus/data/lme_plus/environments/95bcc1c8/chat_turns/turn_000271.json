Paris can be quite pricey, but I'd be happy to help you find some options that fit your budget.\n\nHere are a few tips to get you started:\n\n1. Consider staying in a boutique hotel or a smaller, family-run establishment. These often offer a more personalized experience and can be more affordable than larger, chain hotels.\n2. Look for hotels that are located in up-and-coming neighborhoods or areas that are a bit further from the city center. These can offer a more local experience and often have lower rates.\n3. Keep an eye out for special deals and packages. Many hotels offer discounts for longer stays, off-peak bookings, or packages that include extras like breakfast or a romantic dinner.\n4. Consider staying in an apartment or suite instead of a traditional hotel room. This can often be more cost-effective, especially if you're traveling with a group or planning a longer stay.\n\nWith those tips in mind, here are a few affordable luxury options to consider:\n\n1. Hotel Le Walt (approx. $250 per night) - This boutique hotel is located in the 9th arrondissement and offers stylish rooms with a vintage twist.\n2.
