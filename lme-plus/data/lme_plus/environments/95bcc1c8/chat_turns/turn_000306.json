  "content": "Topic modeling is an NLP technique that involves identifying latent topics or themes in a collection of texts. The most commonly used technique for topic modeling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is a generative probabilistic model that assumes that each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a distribution over words. The algorithm identifies the most probable topic for each word in each document, and then estimates the distribution of topics across the entire corpus. This process allows for the identification of underlying themes or topics that are present in the corpus, even if they are not explicitly stated. Other topic modeling techniques include Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), and Correlated Topic Model (CTM).",
