  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I'll definitely keep those care tips in mind. Speaking of handbags, I've been thinking about my shopping habits lately and I realized that I've been making some impulse purchases that haven't been the best value in the long run. Like that $100 face cream I mentioned earlier - it feels great on my skin, but I'm not sure if it's really worth the price tag. And then there was that \"high-end\" handbag I bought for $500 that turned out to be subpar quality. I'm trying to be more mindful of my spending and focus on finding better value for my money. Do you have any advice on how to avoid making impulse purchases and find more affordable options that still meet my quality standards?",
