However, it's fair to say that some of the Beatles' most popular songs, such as \"Hey Jude,\" \"Let It Be,\" and \"Twist and Shout,\" are played frequently on the radio and in other media. These songs have become classics for a reason, but it's understandable that some listeners may feel they are overplayed. That being said, the Beatles have a vast catalog of music, and some of their lesser-known songs are just as deserving of attention and appreciation. Exploration of their different albums could lead to a discovery of interesting gems one may not have heard before.",
