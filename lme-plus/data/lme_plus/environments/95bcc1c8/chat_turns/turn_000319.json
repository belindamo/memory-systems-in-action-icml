  "content": "Those are some great ideas! I especially like the March Madness Trivia and Commercial Break Challenges. I think they'll really get everyone engaged and excited during the party. By the way, speaking of excitement, I remember watching that Duke vs. North Carolina game with my roommate, and we were both on the edge of our seats the whole time. The atmosphere at that location was really electric, and I think these games and activities will help recreate that energy at my party.",
