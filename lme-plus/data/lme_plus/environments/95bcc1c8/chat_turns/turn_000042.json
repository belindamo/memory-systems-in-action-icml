This region tends to have a more moderate climate, with colder winters and warmer springs, which fits with your description.\n\nAm I getting warmer?\n\nIf I'm correct, I can suggest some amazing scenic drives and hiking trails in the eastern Sierra Nevada range, including the Mammoth Lakes area, Mono Lake, and the June Lake Loop. Let me know if I'm on the right track!",
