I'd be happy to help you categorize your recent purchases, including your new Adidas sneakers.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me how much you spent on the sneakers?

Do you have a list of recent expenses you'd like to categorize? I'm here to help you organize them!"

As for other purchases, I've been buying a lot of stuff online recently, like a handbag from Coach last week, and some stuff from Amazon during Prime Day. Can you help me make a list of categories and we can start sorting them out?"

(Coach handbag)\n\nCan you tell me how much you spent on the Coach handbag? And what about your Amazon Prime Day purchases? What kind of items did you buy, and how much did you spend in total?"

(kitchen utensils, part of the $200 total)\n\nCan you tell me how much you spent on the kitchen utensils specifically? That way, we can allocate the $200 accurately.\n\nAlso, do you have any other purchases you'd like to add to the list?"
