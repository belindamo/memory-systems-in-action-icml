      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal preferences, but based on the general information available, workout clothes are typically available in a wider range of sizes than athleisure wear. This is because workout clothes are designed for physical activity and need to fit comfortably and flexibly, whereas athleisure wear is often designed more for fashion and style, and may be less concerned with a perfect fit. Workout clothes are generally available in XS through XXL sizes, while athleisure wear may only be available in S to L sizes, although some brands do offer extended sizes. Ultimately, the range of sizes available will depend on the brand and specific product in question."
