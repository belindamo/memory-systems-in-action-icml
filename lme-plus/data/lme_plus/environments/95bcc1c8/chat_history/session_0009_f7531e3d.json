      "content": "Private guided tours can be a fantastic way to experience Paris, especially if you want to make the most of your time and get insider knowledge from a local expert.\n\nAs for Explore Earth, I've done some research, and it appears to be a legitimate company that offers customized private tours in several European cities, including Paris. However, I couldn't find much information about them online, and they don't seem to have a strong online presence.\n\nHere are a few things I was able to find out:\n\n* Explore Earth is a UK-based company that offers private guided tours in various European cities, including Paris, Rome, Barcelona, and Amsterdam.\n* They claim to provide customized tours tailored to individual interests, with experienced local guides who are knowledgeable about the history, culture, and hidden gems of each city.\n* Their website is basic, and it doesn't provide much information about their tours, prices, or guides. You'll need to contact them directly to inquire about their services and get a quote.\n\nBefore booking a tour with Explore Earth, I would recommend doing some due diligence to ensure they're a good fit for your needs:\n\n1. **Check online reviews**: Look for reviews on independent review platforms like TripAdvisor, Yelp, or Google Reviews. Be cautious of fake reviews, and look for red flags like multiple reviews with similar language or suspiciously glowing praise.\n2. **Ask for references**: Request references from previous clients or ask to speak with someone who has taken a tour with them. This can give you a better idea of their service quality and guide expertise.\n3. **Get a detailed itinerary**: Ask Explore Earth to provide a detailed itinerary for your customized tour, including the specific sights, attractions, and activities they plan to include.\n4. **Check their guide credentials**: Ensure that their guides are licensed, experienced, and knowledgeable about Paris and its history.\n5. **Compare prices**: Research other private tour companies in Paris and compare prices to ensure you're getting a fair deal.\n6. **Verify their licenses and insurance**: Make sure Explore Earth has the necessary licenses and insurance to operate tours in Paris.\n\nBy doing your research and asking the right questions, you can increase your chances of having a great experience with Explore Earth or any other private tour company.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to be cautious when booking a tour with a company you're not familiar with. If you're unsure or uncomfortable with any aspect of the booking process, consider looking into more established companies with a stronger online presence and reputation."
