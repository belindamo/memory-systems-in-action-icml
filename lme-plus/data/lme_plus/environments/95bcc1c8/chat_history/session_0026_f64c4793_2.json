Paris can be quite pricey, but I'd be happy to help you find some options that fit your budget.\n\nHere are a few tips to get you started:\n\n1. Consider staying in a boutique hotel or a smaller, family-run establishment. These often offer a more personalized experience and can be more affordable than larger, chain hotels.\n2. Look for hotels that are located in up-and-coming neighborhoods or areas that are a bit further from the city center. These can offer a more local experience and often have lower rates.\n3. Keep an eye out for special deals and packages. Many hotels offer discounts for longer stays, off-peak bookings, or packages that include extras like breakfast or a romantic dinner.\n4. Consider staying in an apartment or suite instead of a traditional hotel room. This can often be more cost-effective, especially if you're traveling with a group or planning a longer stay.\n\nWith those tips in mind, here are a few affordable luxury options to consider:\n\n1. Hotel Le Walt (approx. $250 per night) - This boutique hotel is located in the 9th arrondissement and offers stylish rooms with a vintage twist.\n2. Hotel Le Pigalle (approx. $300 per night) - This stylish hotel is located in the heart of the 9th arrondissement and features a rooftop bar with stunning views of the city.\n3. Hotel des Grands Boulevards (approx. $220 per night) - This luxurious hotel is located in the 2nd arrondissement and offers elegant rooms with a touch of Art Deco flair.\n4. La R\u00e9serve Hotel and Spa (approx. $350 per night) - This luxurious hotel is located in the 8th arrondissement and features a spa, fitness center, and elegant rooms with a focus on comfort and relaxation.\n5. Apartement-H\u00f4tel Adagio Paris Op\u00e9ra (approx. $200 per night) - This apartment-hotel offers spacious rooms with kitchenettes and is located in the heart of the 9th arrondissement.\n\nThese are just a few examples to get you started. I recommend doing some research and reading reviews to find the perfect fit for your budget and preferences.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time in Paris with your new wallet by your side!"
