      "content": "Robert Graves (1895-1985) was a British poet, novelist, critic, and scholar. He is best known for his poetry, particularly his work during World War I, which included the collections \"Fairies and Fusiliers\" (1917) and \"Over the Brazier\" (1916). He is also well known for his historical novel \"I, Claudius\" (1934), which was adapted into a successful BBC television series in 1976.\n\nGraves served as an officer in the British Army during World War I and was severely injured in the Battle of the Somme. His experiences during the war deeply influenced his writing and led him to become a pacifist.\n\nIn addition to his poetry and fiction, Graves was also a respected scholar and translator. He translated works from various languages, including \"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" from Persian and \"The Golden Ass\" from Latin.\n\nGraves was awarded numerous honors during his lifetime, including the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction. He was also appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1955."
