Only some of them may be interested in health. I don't want to insult these people by promoting health if they are not interested. So the email will need to address this. But since some of them may be interested in health and wellness and fitness, help me write and email to announce the launch of my new company fitclass, and ask them to join fitclass where they get 1 year of no fees. Address them as \"GrooveSters\" and write it from me, Mike FIlsaime. Make it fun and conversational."
