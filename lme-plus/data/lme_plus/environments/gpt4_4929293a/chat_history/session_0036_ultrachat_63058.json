    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "For a protein-packed breakfast, here are the options that have the most protein:\n\n1. Egg muffins: One large egg contains about 6 grams of protein, and most muffin cups hold about 2 eggs. So, two egg muffins can give you about 12 grams of protein. 2. Yogurt parfait: Greek yogurt is a great source of protein, and adding a few tablespoons of granola will provide additional protein. A standard serving of Greek yogurt contains around 17 grams of protein. 3. Smoothie bowl: Adding a scoop of protein powder or using Greek yogurt in your smoothie bowl can boost the protein content. A cup of Greek yogurt alone can contain up to 23 grams of protein. 4. Peanut butter banana sandwich: One tablespoon of peanut butter contains about 4 grams of protein, and a slice of whole wheat bread contains about 3-4 grams of protein. So, a peanut butter banana sandwich can provide around 8 grams of protein. Hope this helps!"

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, you can definitely make the egg muffins ahead of time and reheat them in the morning. You can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. To reheat, simply place them in the microwave for 30-60 seconds, or until heated through. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months if you want to make a larger batch. To reheat from frozen, microwave them for 1-2 minutes or bake them in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 350\u00b0F."
