  "content": "If you plant 'Charlotte' new potatoes on the 16th of January, you can expect to harvest them in around 12 weeks. This would put your harvest date around April 21st - April 30th. Keep in mind that this is an estimate and actual harvest date can vary depending on factors such as weather, soil conditions, and the specific growing conditions in your area.\n\nIt is also important to keep an eye on your plants and harvest them as soon as they reach the size you desire, as they will start to grow larger and less tender. It's a good idea to start checking for maturity about 2-3 weeks before the estimated harvest date.\n\nPlease keep in mind that planting potatoes in January might not be the best idea since the soil could be too wet and the weather too cold. If the soil is waterlogged or frozen, it will be difficult to plant the seed potatoes and it is better to wait until the soil is in better condition.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.",
