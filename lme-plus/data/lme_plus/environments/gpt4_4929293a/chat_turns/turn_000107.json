  "content": "\"Futura Free\" is a song that features conversations and interactions with different people. According to an interview with Frank Ocean, he recorded most of the conversations on the song on his iPhone, and then transferred these conversations to the studio where he incorporated them into the track. \n\nHe also mentioned that the song was originally just a rap verse without any conversations, but he decided to include the conversations to give the song a more personal touch. The song was written and recorded over the course of several years, with some elements of the song being recorded as early as 2013.\n\nOverall, it seems that the writing process for \"Futura Free\" was a much more experimental process than more traditional songwriting. Rather than focusing on crafting a cohesive narrative or melody, the song was assembled gradually with various different sound elements until it took its final form.",
