I'd be happy to share some examples of vendors I've worked with in the countryside and city.\n\n\"In the countryside, I've had the pleasure of working with some incredible vendors who really understand the unique needs of a rural wedding. For catering, I highly recommend Green Meadow Farm Catering, who offer farm-to-table cuisine and can accommodate a wide range of dietary needs. They're based in the countryside and have a deep understanding of the local food scene.\n\n\"For photography, I've worked with Emily May Photography, who has a beautiful, rustic style that's perfect for capturing the charm of a countryside wedding. She's based in the nearby town and knows the area like the back of her hand.\n\n\"For florals, I've worked with Petal & Twig, who source their flowers from local farms and create stunning, whimsical arrangements that are perfect for a countryside wedding. They're based in the countryside and have a deep understanding of the local flora and fauna.\n\n\"In the city, I've worked with a wide range of vendors who offer a more modern, urban aesthetic. For catering, I recommend City Bites Catering, who offer a range of cuisines and can accommodate large groups. They're based in the city and have a team of experienced chefs and event coordinators.\n\n\"For photography, I've worked with Urban Lens Photography, who have a sleek, modern style that's perfect for capturing the energy of a city wedding. They're based in the city and have a deep understanding of the urban landscape.\n\n\"For florals, I've worked with Blooming Beauty, who offer a range of styles and can create everything from modern, structural arrangements to lush, romantic bouquets. They're based in the city and have a team of experienced florists who can handle large events.\n\n\"Of course, these are just a few examples of the many talented vendors I've worked with in both the countryside and city. But I think they give you a sense of the types of vendors I've worked with and the level of quality and service you can expect.\"\n\nThis response gives you a better sense of the planner's experience working with vendors in both the countryside and city, and provides specific examples of vendors they've worked with in the past. It also gives you a sense of the planner's taste and style, and helps you determine whether they're a good fit for your wedding.",
