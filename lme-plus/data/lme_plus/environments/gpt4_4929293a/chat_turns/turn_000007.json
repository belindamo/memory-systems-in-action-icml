  "content": "I think there might be some misunderstanding again. Unfortunately, it's not possible to get from Narita Airport to a hotel in Shinjuku for $10 by train.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the cheapest train option from Narita Airport to Shinjuku Station is around \u00a51,000-1,200 (around $9-11 USD) one way, but that's not directly to your hotel. You would need to take a taxi or walk from Shinjuku Station to your hotel, which would add to the overall cost.\n\nIt's possible that your friend might have gotten the information from an outdated source or misunderstood the pricing. Alternatively, it's also possible that your friend was referring to a different airport, route, or mode of transportation.\n\nIf you're looking for a budget-friendly option, I can suggest exploring bus services or private car services that might be more affordable. However, keep in mind that prices can vary depending on the time of day, traffic, and other factors.\n\nTo give you a better estimate, could you please tell me the name of your hotel in Shinjuku? I can try to provide you with more accurate information on the best way to get to your hotel from Narita Airport.",
