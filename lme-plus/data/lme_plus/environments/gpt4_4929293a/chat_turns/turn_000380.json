The expiration period varies depending on the program, and some programs may allow you to extend the validity of your points by taking certain actions such as earning more points within a specific period or making a qualifying purchase. You should check the specific program's terms and conditions to know the rules and expiration date of your loyalty points.\n\nThere may also be restrictions on redeeming loyalty points, such as blackout dates or limitations on using points for certain room categories or services. Some programs may also limit the amount of points you can redeem at once or require you to have a minimum balance of points.\n\nIn most cases, you won't be able to transfer loyalty points to someone else. However, some programs allow you to use your points to book a room for someone else or to redeem points for gift certificates or other rewards that you can give as gifts. You should check the specific program's rules to know more about the transfer of loyalty points.",
