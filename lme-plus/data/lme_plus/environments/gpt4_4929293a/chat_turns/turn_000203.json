I've got some excellent recommendations for you:\n\n1. **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice** - This is a natural next step, as it's also developed by FromSoftware, the creators of Dark Souls. Sekiro is a more focused, narrative-driven game with a greater emphasis on stealth and strategy. It's a bit more accessible than Dark Souls, but still challenging and rewarding.\n2. **Bloodborne** - Another FromSoftware game, Bloodborne is often considered the \"spiritual successor\" to Dark Souls. It's faster-paced and more aggressive, with a dark, Victorian-era Gothic setting. Be prepared for a steep learning curve, but the payoff is well worth it.\n3. **Monster Hunter: World** - While not as overtly dark as Dark Souls, Monster Hunter: World shares a similar sense of scale and challenge. This action RPG tasks you with hunting massive monsters in a vast open world, with a deep crafting and combat system.\n4. **Nioh** - Developed by Team Ninja, Nioh is a Dark Souls-inspired game set in feudal Japan. It offers a similar blend of challenging combat and exploration, with a deep character customization system and a rich narrative.\n5. **The Surge** - This sci-fi action RPG, developed by Deck13 Interactive, features a similar souls-like gameplay experience with a focus on melee combat and exploration. Set in a dystopian future, The Surge offers a challenging and rewarding experience.\n6. **Dying Light** - While not as punishingly difficult as Dark Souls, Dying Light combines parkour, melee combat, and a dynamic day-night cycle to create a thrilling experience. The game's first-person perspective and zombie-filled setting add a fresh twist to the action RPG genre.\n7. **Salt and Sanctuary** - This 2D platformer with RPG elements, developed by Ska Studios, offers a more accessible Dark Souls-like experience. With a focus on exploration, platforming, and combat, Salt and Sanctuary is a great option for those who want a similar feel without the intense difficulty.\n8. **Hyper Light Drifter** - This top-down action RPG, developed by Heart Machine, features a beautiful, atmospheric world and a unique art style. With a focus on exploration and puzzle-solving, Hyper Light Drifter offers a more relaxed, yet still challenging, experience.\n9. **Ashen** - This action RPG, developed by A44, is set in a dark, atmospheric world with a focus on co-op play. Ashen offers a similar sense of exploration and challenge, with a unique \"passive multiplayer\" system that allows players to seamlessly join and leave each other's games.\n10. **Remnant: From the Ashes** - This cooperative action RPG, developed by Gunfire Games, features a similar blend of exploration, combat, and character progression. With a focus on co-op play and a dynamic world, Remnant offers a fresh take on the action RPG genre.\n\nThese games all offer varying degrees of challenge, exploration, and combat, so you're sure to find something that scratches that Dark Souls itch.",
