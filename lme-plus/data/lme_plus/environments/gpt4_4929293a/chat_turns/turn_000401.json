  "content": "For a protein-packed breakfast, here are the options that have the most protein:\n\n1. Egg muffins: One large egg contains about 6 grams of protein, and most muffin cups hold about 2 eggs. So, two egg muffins can give you about 12 grams of protein. 2. Yogurt parfait: Greek yogurt is a great source of protein, and adding a few tablespoons of granola will provide additional protein. A standard serving of Greek yogurt contains around 17 grams of protein. 3. Smoothie bowl: Adding a scoop of protein powder or using Greek yogurt in your smoothie bowl can boost the protein content. A cup of Greek yogurt alone can contain up to 23 grams of protein. 4. Peanut butter banana sandwich: One tablespoon of peanut butter contains about 4 grams of protein, and a slice of whole wheat bread contains about 3-4 grams of protein. So, a peanut butter banana sandwich can provide around 8 grams of protein. Hope this helps!",
