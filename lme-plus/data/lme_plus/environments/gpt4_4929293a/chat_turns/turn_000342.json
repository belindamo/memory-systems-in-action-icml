Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, and Street Art are all fascinating movements that have shaped the modern and contemporary art landscape. Here are some key points to get you started:\n\n**Abstract Expressionism:**\n\n* Emerged in the 1940s and 1950s in the United States\n* Characterized by non-representational, non-figurative artworks that emphasize emotional expression and spontaneous gesture\n* Artists like Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Mark Rothko created works that explored the subconscious, the emotional, and the spiritual\n* Techniques included dripping, pouring, and splashing paint, as well as using unconventional materials like sand and paper\n\n**Pop Art:**\n\n* Emerged in the 1950s and 1960s in the United States and United Kingdom\n* Characterized by bold, colorful, and graphic artworks that celebrated popular culture, consumerism, and mass media\n* Artists like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jasper Johns used familiar images from advertising, comic books, and celebrity culture to comment on the superficiality and banality of modern life\n* Techniques included silkscreen printing, collage, and sculpture\n\n**Street Art:**\n\n* Emerged in the 1970s and 1980s in urban centers around the world\n* Characterized by public, often illicit, artworks that engage with the urban environment and challenge traditional notions of art and its relationship to society\n* Artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Banksy used stencils, graffiti, and murals to express political, social, and personal messages\n* Techniques included stencil art, wheatpasting, and street installation\n\nThese are just brief introductions to each movement, but I hope they give you a sense of the key themes, techniques, and artists associated with each. As you delve deeper, you'll discover the complexities and nuances of each movement, as well as the ways in which they intersect and influence one another.\n\nRemember, the best way to learn about art is to see it in person, so try to visit museums, galleries, and street art festivals to experience these movements firsthand. You can also explore online resources, documentaries, and books to deepen your understanding.\n\nWhat specific aspects of these movements would you like to learn more about? The artists, the techniques, the historical context, or something else?",
