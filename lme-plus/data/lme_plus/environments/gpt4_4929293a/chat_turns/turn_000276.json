  "content": "I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to start your morning drawing routine! It's great that you're setting up a dedicated space and planning to experiment with different tools and prompts. Remember to have fun and enjoy the process, and don't worry if your drawings aren't perfect.\n\nAnd don't worry about not having time to draw this evening; yoga is an excellent way to relax and unwind, and you can always start fresh tomorrow morning. Consistency is key, but it's also important to listen to your body and prioritize self-care.\n\nYou're welcome for the motivation and guidance! I'm always here to help. Remember to be kind to yourself, celebrate your small wins, and have fun with the process. You got this!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I'll let you get started on your creative journey. Good luck, and I hope you have a wonderful time exploring your creativity!\n\n(And don't forget to stretch and breathe during your yoga class tonight)",
