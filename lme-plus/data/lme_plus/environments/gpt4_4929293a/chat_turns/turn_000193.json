They have an impressive seafood selection, including wood-fired seafood dishes that are simply fantastic. Their menu changes seasonally, but some popular seafood options include:\n\n* Wood-fired octopus with romesco and preserved lemon\n* Grilled swordfish with pickled pink peppercorns and citrus\n* Seafood tower with oysters, lobster, and shrimp\n* Wood-fired mussels with 'nduja and grilled bread\n\nGirl & the Goat's seafood dishes are expertly prepared, and their wood-fired grill adds a unique flavor to their seafood options. The atmosphere is lively and upscale, making it a great fit if you're looking for a similar experience to the \"Taste of Hope\" dinner.\n\nAnother great option would be **The Publican**, which offers an impressive selection of oysters, seafood towers, and other seafood dishes. Their menu is constantly changing, but some popular seafood options include:\n\n* Oysters on the half shell with various toppings\n* Seafood tower with oysters, shrimp, and lobster\n* Grilled fish with seasonal accompaniments\n* Mussels with white wine and garlic\n\nThe Publican's atmosphere is lively and bustling, with a focus on community tables and a great selection of craft beer. While it's not as upscale as Girl & the Goat, it's still a fantastic option for seafood lovers.\n\nBoth of these restaurants are great choices if you're looking for exceptional seafood in the West Loop. Enjoy your dining experience!",
