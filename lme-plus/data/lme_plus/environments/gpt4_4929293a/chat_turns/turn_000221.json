  "content": "Sure! If you're looking for a more stable sailing vessel that can handle rough seas, a schooner might be a good choice. Schooners have two masts with multiple sails, which helps to distribute weight more evenly and lowers the center of gravity. This makes them much more stable than sloop ships in rough seas.\n\nSchooners are also known for their reliability and seaworthiness, making them a common choice for ocean crossing and long voyages. They can handle strong winds and heavy seas with ease, making them a great choice for sailors looking for a stable and reliable sailing vessel.\n\nOther options you might want to consider depending on your needs include ketches, yawls, or even a motor yacht with a displacement hull. However, it's always a good idea to do some additional research and talk to other sailors or boating experts to determine the best type of sailing vessel for your specific needs and preferences.",
