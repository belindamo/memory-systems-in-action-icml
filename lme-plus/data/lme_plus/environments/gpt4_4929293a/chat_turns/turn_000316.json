  "content": "Sales teams typically look for detailed information about leads in their CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. CRMs are databases designed to store and manage information about customers and leads, including demographic information, contact information, and historical sales data.\n\nIn addition to the information stored in the CRM, sales teams may also use other sources of information to gather more details about a lead, such as the lead's social media profiles, company websites, or industry reports. Some CRMs also have built-in tools for researching leads, such as lead scoring, which helps sales teams prioritize their outreach efforts.\n\nOverall, the goal of the sales team is to gather as much relevant information as possible about a lead to understand their needs, pain points, and buying behavior. This information helps sales teams to tailor their pitch and messaging to the specific lead, increasing the likelihood of closing the sale.",
