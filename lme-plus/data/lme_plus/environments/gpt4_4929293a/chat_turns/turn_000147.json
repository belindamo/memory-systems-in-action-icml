  "content": "The human brain processes language and interprets meaning from words and sentences using a complex system of neural networks and cognitive mechanisms. \n\nWhen we see or hear a word, the brain quickly retrieves its meaning from our mental lexicon, which is a mental dictionary that stores our knowledge of words and their definitions. This process involves the activation of multiple brain regions, including the left temporal lobe, which is responsible for processing the sounds and meanings of words.\n\nAs we hear or read a sentence, our brain also creates a mental representation of the text's structure and meaning, using a combination of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic information. This process involves the integration of information from different brain regions, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, which is involved in syntactic processing, and the left middle temporal gyrus, which is involved in semantic processing.\n\nAdditionally, our brain relies on contextual cues and our own knowledge and experiences to interpret the meaning of words and sentences. For example, if we hear the phrase \"I ate a sandwich,\" our brain automatically fills in missing information based on our expectations and experiences, such as the type of sandwich, where it was eaten, and who ate it.\n\nOverall, the process of language processing and interpretation involves a highly interconnected network of neural systems and cognitive processes, which work together to give meaning to words and sentences.",
