I'll also try to experiment with different tools and prompts to keep things fresh and exciting.\n\nBy the way, I just remembered that I have a yoga class tonight at 6:30 pm, so I might not have time to draw this evening. But I'm looking forward to getting started tomorrow morning. Thanks for the motivation and guidance!",
