  "content": "Typically, with hotel loyalty programs, you can earn loyalty points or rewards based on the number of nights you stay, the amount you spend on your stay, or a combination of both. Some loyalty programs also offer additional ways to earn points, such as booking through their website or participating in special promotions. \n\nGenerally, the higher your membership tier, the more benefits and rewards you can receive. You can usually earn loyalty points or rewards by booking directly with the hotel, using a co-branded credit card, or through a travel rewards program. \n\nIt's important to note that each hotel loyalty program may have different rules and earning structures, so it's best to research the specific program you're interested in to understand how to earn and redeem points or rewards.",
