I remember buying a wireless headphone on Amazon on the 10th, a kitchen appliance on Amazon on the 20th, three dresses and a pair of boots on ASOS on the 15th, and a vintage watch on eBay on the 25th last month. That's four online purchases in total. Can you help me explore some ways to stay mindful of my spending habits and make more intentional purchasing decisions?",
