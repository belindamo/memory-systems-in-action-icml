Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Personal connection**: You've already established a connection with the product manager from Google, which can make it easier to ask for advice or feedback.\n2. **Industry insights**: They likely have valuable insights into the marketing strategies and tactics that work (or don't work) in the industry.\n3. **Specific feedback**: They can provide feedback on your marketing strategy, pointing out potential flaws or areas for improvement.\n4. **Networking opportunities**: This can be a great way to strengthen your connection with the product manager and potentially open up new opportunities for collaboration or mentorship.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Time commitment**: Be respectful of their time and expertise. Make sure you're not asking for too much of their time or expecting them to do the work for you.\n2. **Unclear expectations**: Be clear about what you're asking for: is it a quick call, a meeting, or written feedback? Make sure you're both on the same page.\n3. **Biased feedback**: Keep in mind that their feedback may be influenced by their own experiences, biases, or the company they work for.\n\nTo make the most of reaching out to your network, consider the following:\n\n1. **Prepare thoughtful questions**: Come prepared with specific, well-thought-out questions that demonstrate you've done your research and are serious about seeking their advice.\n2. **Be respectful of their time**: Keep your ask concise and focused. Avoid asking for too much of their time or expecting them to do the work for you.\n3. **Show appreciation**: Express gratitude for their time and feedback, and offer to return the favor in some way (e.g., offering to help with a project or introducing them to someone in your network).\n\nHere's an example email to reach out to the product manager from Google:\n\nSubject: Seeking Marketing Advice from a Pro\n\nHi [Product Manager's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our conversation at the TechX conference. I've been working on a side project, [Your Project], and I'm looking for some expert advice on marketing strategies.\n\nI was impressed by your experience in product management at Google and thought you might be able to offer some valuable insights. Would you be open to a quick call to discuss my marketing strategy and provide some feedback?\n\nI've prepared some specific questions to ensure our conversation is productive and respectful of your time. If you're available, I'd love to schedule a call at your convenience.\n\nThanks in advance for considering my request, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nRemember to be respectful, prepared, and open to feedback, and you'll be more likely to get a positive response.",
