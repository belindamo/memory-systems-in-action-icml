Lead: A lead is a person or organization that has shown an interest in your product or service, but has not yet been fully qualified as a potential customer. Leads can come from a variety of sources, such as a website sign-up form, a trade show, or a referral.\n2. Prospect: A prospect is a lead that has been qualified as a potential customer. Qualification involves assessing the lead's needs, budget, authority, and timeline to determine if they are a good fit for your product or service. Once a lead has been qualified, they become a prospect.\n\nIn summary, a lead is a potential customer that requires further qualification, while a prospect is a qualified lead that is considered a good fit for your product or service.",
