  "content": "The Posture system is a core mechanic in Sekiro that sets it apart from other Soulsborne games. It's a fascinating system that rewards strategy, timing, and finesse. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works and how it impacts gameplay:\n\n**What is Posture?**\n\nPosture refers to the balance and stability of both you and your enemies. It's a measure of your ability to withstand attacks, absorb damage, and maintain control in combat. Think of it as a mental and physical state that affects your combat performance.\n\n**How does Posture work?**\n\n* When you or an enemy takes damage, their Posture meter fills up. The meter is divided into segments, and each segment represents a certain amount of Posture.\n* As the Posture meter fills, the character's defenses weaken, making them more susceptible to attacks. When the meter is full, the character is \"broken,\" leaving them stunned and vulnerable to a devastating finishing blow.\n* Deflecting attacks, using Prosthetic Tools, and performing successful counterattacks can reduce an enemy's Posture meter.\n* Conversely, taking damage, being grabbed, or having your attacks blocked can increase your own Posture meter.\n\n**How does Posture affect gameplay?**\n\n* **Deflecting attacks**: Deflecting enemy attacks is crucial in Sekiro. Successful deflections not only reduce the enemy's Posture but also leave them open to counterattacks. Timing is key, as mistiming a deflection can result in taking damage and increasing your own Posture meter.\n* **Breaking enemies**: When an enemy's Posture meter is full, you can perform a Deathblow, a one-hit kill that instantly defeats them. Breaking enemies is a great way to clear out tough foes and create opportunities for stealth or escape.\n* **Prosthetic Tools**: Sekiro's Prosthetic Tools, such as the Grappling Hook and Flame Vent, can be used to manipulate enemy Posture. These tools can be used to stun enemies, create distance, or even set up ambushes.\n* **Stamina management**: Since Sekiro focuses on strategy and stealth, you'll need to manage your stamina carefully. Using Prosthetic Tools, deflecting attacks, and performing complex combos can drain your stamina, leaving you vulnerable to enemy attacks.\n* **Combat pacing**: The Posture system encourages a more measured approach to combat. You'll need to carefully time your attacks, wait for openings, and capitalize on enemy mistakes to succeed.\n\n**Tips for mastering Posture:**\n\n* Practice your deflection timing and technique. It's essential to develop a sense of rhythm and anticipation to successfully deflect attacks.\n* Learn enemy patterns and weaknesses to exploit their Posture. Each enemy has unique attack patterns and vulnerabilities that can be used to your advantage.\n* Use Prosthetic Tools strategically to control enemy Posture and create opportunities for attack or escape.\n* Manage your stamina carefully, as running out of stamina can leave you open to attack.\n\nBy mastering the Posture system, you'll be able to outmaneuver and outsmart your enemies, making Sekiro's challenging combat encounters more manageable and rewarding.",
