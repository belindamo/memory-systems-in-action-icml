I've also been thinking about my daily habits, and I've realized that I spend a lot of time watching YouTube videos. I've been watching a lot of true crime documentaries, and I've also been watching cooking videos and ASMR videos to relax. Do you have any recommendations on how I can better manage my screen time and make time for more productive activities?",
