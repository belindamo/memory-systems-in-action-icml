  "content": "Schitt's Creek is a great show! You're getting close to the end of Season 4, which is a fantastic season.\n\nRegarding Brooklyn Nine-Nine, it's a show that balances both absurdity and dry humor, but leans more towards the former. It's a police sitcom that's known for its fast-paced, witty dialogue, and over-the-top humor. The show's tone is generally light-hearted and playful, with a lot of comedic situations arising from the characters' quirks and interactions.\n\nThe show's absurdity comes from its cast of lovable and eccentric characters, including Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg), a goofy and carefree detective, and Captain Holt (Andre Braugher), a strict and deadpan captain. The show often features ridiculous situations, silly antics, and comedic misunderstandings, which are played for laughs.\n\nAt the same time, Brooklyn Nine-Nine also has a dry, sarcastic humor, particularly through the character of Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), who's known for her deadpan reactions and dark humor. The show also tackles more serious topics, like police brutality and LGBTQ+ issues, but handles them in a way that's respectful and still finds room for humor.\n\nOverall, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a show that's more focused on making you laugh and having a good time, rather than being a dry, cerebral comedy. If you enjoy absurdity, witty banter, and a cast of lovable characters, you'll likely enjoy Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\n\nGive it a try and see how you like it!",
