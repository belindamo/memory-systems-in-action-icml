  "content": "There are many different ingredients you can add to this salsa to customize it to your liking! Here are a few ideas:\n\n- Mango: Diced mango chunks add sweetness and acidity to the salsa. - Pineapple: Like mango, pineapple adds sweetness and a hint of tropical flavor to the salsa. - Corn: Charred corn kernels add a nice texture and sweetness to the salsa. - Black beans: Drained and rinsed canned black beans add protein and depth of flavor to the salsa. - Cucumber: Diced cucumber adds crunch and freshness to the salsa. - Bell peppers: Diced bell peppers add color and crunch to the salsa. - Tomatillos: Roasted tomatillos add tangy flavor and bright green color to the salsa. Just keep in mind that adding more ingredients will change the flavor and texture of the salsa, so it's best to experiment with small batches and adjust the seasonings as needed. Enjoy!",
