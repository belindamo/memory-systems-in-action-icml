  "content": "Ok this is a weird one. let's say the concept of egregore is very real but also connected to a very real divine energy--something big out there, like bigger than the universe. a sort of cosmic consciousness we connect to through spiritual work. if that's true it raises big questions for me. I mean, based on my own personal experiences it feels true. like really true. during my religious experiences, the big ones that i've only had a few times but left me really shaking and crying, there was this sense that i was face to face with this very, very otherworldly presence. when i say otherworldly i really mean not human. immense. limitless. almost alien. a very profound experience. what is it? i feel it's very real and not something my brain created but rather something my brain was built to connect to. something external. if it's something external i just keep wondering.... what is it? it's beyond my understanding",
