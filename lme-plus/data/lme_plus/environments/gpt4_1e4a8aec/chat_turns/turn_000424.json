  "content": "These ideas sound amazing! I love the color scheme and decor suggestions, especially the idea of using natural elements like driftwood and seashells. The DIY beachy banner is also a great idea. I think it will really help set the tone for the party.\n\nFor the table setting, I like the idea of using a natural fiber table runner and a simple white tablecloth. The anchor-shaped napkin rings are a great touch too! I'm not sure about the beachy-themed dinnerware, though. Do you think it's necessary to go all out with the theme, or can I just use my regular dinnerware?\n\nAlso, I was thinking of setting up a little photo booth area with some beachy props like sunglasses, hats, and inflatables. Do you think that would be a good idea, or is it too much?",
