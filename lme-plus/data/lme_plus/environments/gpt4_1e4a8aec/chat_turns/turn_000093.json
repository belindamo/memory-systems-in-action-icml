  "content": "Wynwood Walls and the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami are both fantastic choices for art lovers. You'll have a blast exploring the vibrant street art and murals in Wynwood, and the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami is a great spot to enjoy some modern and contemporary art. Grabbing lunch at one of the outdoor cafes in Wynwood will be a perfect way to break up the day and refuel.\n\nAnd yay for booking your flight when you did! Saving $100 on your flight is a great feeling, especially when you can put that money towards more fun activities and experiences during your trip. It's always a good idea to book flights early to get the best deals, and it looks like you made a smart move.\n\nNow that you have some activities planned, are there any other things you'd like to do or experience during your trip? Are there any specific foods or drinks you want to try while you're in Miami?",
