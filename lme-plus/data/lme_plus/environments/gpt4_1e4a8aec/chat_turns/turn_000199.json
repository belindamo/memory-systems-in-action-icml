  "content": "Yes, many Sumerian writings still exist today, though they are relatively limited in number. Most of the surviving Sumerian texts were written on clay tablets that were fired and preserved over the centuries. \n\nSome of the most important surviving works include religious texts such as hymns, poems, prayers, and incantations, as well as legal and administrative documents like contracts, deeds, and receipts. Examples of Sumerian literature include the epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest surviving works of literature in the world.\n\nScholars continue to study and decipher these ancient writings, piecing together a picture of Sumerian society, culture, and history. The study of Sumerian texts has also helped us to understand the development of writing and the history of the ancient Near East more broadly, making it an important part of human knowledge and culture.",
