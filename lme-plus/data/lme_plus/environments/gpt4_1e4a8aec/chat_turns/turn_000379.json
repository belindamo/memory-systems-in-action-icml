Make sure to try it with a thick crust, and don't forget to order some garlic bread on the side.\n\nThat's great to hear that your portable power bank from Best Buy has been serving you well! A reliable power bank is essential for travelers, especially when you're exploring a new city and need to keep your devices charged. Quick charging is a lifesaver, especially when you're on the go.\n\nSince you mentioned Best Buy, I have to ask: Have you considered getting a portable Wi-Fi hotspot for your trip? It can be super helpful when you need internet access on the go, especially if you're planning to use Google Maps or other online resources to navigate the city. Just a thought!\n\nNow, back to Chicago: Are you planning to visit any specific landmarks or attractions during your trip? I can give you some insider tips and recommendations to make the most of your time in the Windy City.",
