  "content": "Yes, adding avocado to this salsa would be a great idea! It will give the salsa a creamy texture and add extra flavor. To add avocado, you can simply dice it up into small pieces and add it to the blended salsa or pulse it a few times in the blender or food processor with the other ingredients to create a chunkier texture. Just be aware that the avocado will cause the salsa to turn brown over time, so it's best to use the salsa quickly or add the avocado just before serving.",
