I think it's great that you're considering a mix of genres and tempos to keep the playlist engaging.\n\nBy the way, since your parents enjoyed the Paul McCartney concert, they might also appreciate some other 1980s solo work from other Beatles members. You could consider adding tracks like George Harrison's \"Got My Mind Set on You\" or Ringo Starr's \"Private Property\" to the playlist.\n\nWhat do you think about including some 1990s tracks in the playlist as well? That decade saw the rise of alternative rock, grunge, and pop, which might appeal to different age groups in your family. Let me know if you'd like some suggestions for must-have 1990s tracks!",
