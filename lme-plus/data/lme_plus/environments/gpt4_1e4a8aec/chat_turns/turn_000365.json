  "content": "Gochujang paste is a staple ingredient in Korean cuisine, and it's a game-changer in BBQ sauces.\n\n**What is gochujang paste?**\n\nGochujang () is a Korean chili paste made from fermented soybeans, rice, and red chili peppers (gochugaru). The fermentation process gives gochujang its distinctive thick, sticky texture and deep, savory flavor. The name \"gochujang\" literally means \"pepper paste\" in Korean.\n\n**Flavor profile:**\n\nGochujang has a rich, complex flavor profile that's both sweet and savory, with a slow-building heat. It's often described as umami, similar to soy sauce or miso, but with a deeper, more intense flavor. The heat level can vary depending on the brand and type of gochujang, but it's generally milder than sriracha or hot sauce.\n\n**How is gochujang used in Korean BBQ?**\n\nGochujang is a fundamental ingredient in Korean BBQ, particularly in marinades, sauces, and dipping sauces. It adds depth, heat, and umami flavor to grilled meats, vegetables, and seafood. Here are some ways gochujang is used in Korean BBQ:\n\n1. **Marinades:** Gochujang is often mixed with soy sauce, garlic, ginger, sugar, and sesame oil to create a marinade for meats like bulgogi (thinly sliced beef) or galbi (short ribs).\n2. **BBQ sauces:** Gochujang is blended with other ingredients like ketchup, brown sugar, garlic, and sesame oil to create a sweet and spicy BBQ sauce.\n3. **Dipping sauces:** Gochujang is mixed with soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar to create a dipping sauce for grilled meats and vegetables.\n4. **Glazes:** Gochujang is used as a glaze for grilled meats, adding a sweet and sticky layer of flavor.\n\n**Tips for using gochujang:**\n\n1. **Start with a small amount:** Gochujang is potent, so begin with a small amount and adjust to taste.\n2. **Mix with other ingredients:** Gochujang is often used in combination with other ingredients to balance out its strong flavor.\n3. **Store it properly:** Gochujang can be stored in the fridge for up to 6 months or frozen for up to a year.\n\n**Where to find gochujang:**\n\nYou can find gochujang paste in most Asian grocery stores, some well-stocked supermarkets, or online. Popular brands include Sunchang, Koko, and Chongga. If you can't find gochujang, you can substitute it with a mixture of gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) and soy sauce, but the flavor won't be the same.\n\nNow that you know more about gochujang, are you ready to try out the Korean-Style BBQ Sauce recipe I provided earlier?",
