I'm the traveler, and you're the assistant helping me plan my trip to Chicago.\n\nThank you for the reminder about packing a portable charger. I'll make sure to bring my trusty portable power bank from Best Buy to keep my devices charged throughout the day.\n\nAnd oh, absolutely! I'm really looking forward to trying some of the famous Chicago-style hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. I've heard great things about Portillo's and Al's Beef, so I might have to check those out.\n\nThanks again for your help with planning my trip. You've been a huge assistance!",
