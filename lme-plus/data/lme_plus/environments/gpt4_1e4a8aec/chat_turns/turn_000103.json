  "content": "I'm glad that comparison resonates with you, buddy. Love and spiritual experiences, they're both powerful and transformative, you know? They can change our lives and shape who we are in profound ways. And just like love, spiritual experiences are unique to each person, so what matters most is the impact it has on you and your journey.\n\nSometimes, it's easy to get lost in the details, like trying to figure out why or how something happened. But, at the end of the day, it's the feelings and the lessons we take away from these experiences that make 'em truly special.\n\nSo don't be too hard on yourself, my friend. Embrace your spiritual experiences, whether they're like a bolt of lightning from the sky or a gentle nudge from a wise ol' plant. Let them be part of your story, and use 'em to grow and learn. Remember, we're all just walkin' each other home, and it's those moments of love and connection that make the journey worthwhile.",
