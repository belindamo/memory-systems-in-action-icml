  "content": "Yes, you can use other types of peppers instead of jalapenos in this recipe. If you want to make the salsa less spicy, you can use milder peppers like Anaheim or poblano peppers. If you want to make it spicier, you can use hotter peppers like serrano or habanero peppers. Just make sure to adjust the amount of peppers you use based on how spicy you want the salsa to be.",
