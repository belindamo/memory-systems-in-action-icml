  "content": "I'm so excited to try all the delicious Cuban food! I think I'll plan a visit to Little Havana on one of my free days. I'll definitely check out Ball & Chain and Versailles Restaurant for some traditional Cuban cuisine. And, of course, I'll make sure to stroll down Calle Ocho and visit the Domino Park. Thanks for the recommendations!\n\nBy the way, I've been thinking about my upcoming trip to Europe. I've been researching travel agencies that offer package deals, and I'm considering Trafalgar, Contiki, and EF Go Ahead Tours. Do you have any experience with any of these agencies or know anyone who has used them?",
