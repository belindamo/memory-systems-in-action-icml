It's also awesome that you've been able to use it for both your daily commute and your camping trip.\n\nIt's always great to have a versatile bag that can adapt to different situations. REI's backpacks are designed to be rugged and durable, so it's no surprise that it held up well on your camping trip.\n\nI'm curious, what was your favorite part of the camping trip? Was there a particular activity or moment that stood out to you?\n\nAnd how did you find the backpack performed in terms of comfort and weight distribution? Was it comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, and did it distribute the weight of your gear well?",
