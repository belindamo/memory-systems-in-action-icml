  "content": "Frozen crab legs will work beautifully with this recipe.\n\nFor sides, you're on the right track thinking light and refreshing to balance out the richness of the crab legs. Here are some fantastic options that would pair perfectly:\n\n1. **Garlic and Lemon Roasted Asparagus**: A simple and flavorful side that complements the crab legs nicely. Toss asparagus spears with olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, salt, and pepper, then roast in the oven until tender.\n2. **Mixed Greens Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette**: A light and refreshing salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and a citrusy vinaigrette dressing will cut through the richness of the crab legs.\n3. **Roasted Lemon and Herb Carrots**: Sweet and citrusy carrots roasted with lemon juice, olive oil, and fresh herbs like parsley and thyme will provide a nice contrast to the savory crab legs.\n4. **Steamed Green Beans with Lemon and Garlic**: Quickly steaming green beans with lemon juice, garlic, and a pinch of salt will preserve their crunch and provide a burst of freshness on the side.\n5. **Coleslaw with Apple Cider Vinegar**: A creamy coleslaw made with shredded cabbage, mayonnaise, and apple cider vinegar will add a nice tanginess to the dish.\n\nThese sides are all relatively quick and easy to prepare, and they'll help balance out the richness of the crab legs. You can't go wrong with any of these options!\n\nDo any of these sides stand out to you, or do you have another direction in mind?",
