  "content": "I know in your line of work you are probably familiar with how profound religious experiences can be studied and neurologically they are profound. with the brain lighting up under an mri. and there are often common elements to profound religious experiences. and even overlaps in the science of what happens with people during experiences with ayahuasca. what I'm wondering is, do you feel like because the brain shows similar activity during an unprompted religious experience as it does during one created through use of something like ayahuasca, does that mean that it's all just biology? i had an experience and it was real. in every way to me and i believe it was real. it's hard to reconcile those things for me",
