Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Escondido Equine Clinic** - Located in Escondido, CA, about 10 miles from the 92026 zip code. They have a team of experienced equine veterinarians who provide routine care, dental care, and surgical services.\n2. **North County Equine Veterinary Services** - Based in Vista, CA, about 15 miles from the 92026 zip code. They offer a range of services, including routine care, lameness exams, and emergency care.\n3. **San Diego Equine Associates** - Located in San Marcos, CA, about 20 miles from the 92026 zip code. They have a team of board-certified equine veterinarians who provide comprehensive care, including routine exams, surgery, and dental care.\n\nI recommend checking out each of their websites, reading reviews, and giving them a call to find the best fit for Max's needs. You can also ask about their experience with horses, their approach to care, and their availability for routine visits.\n\nThat's great that you have a small backyard flock! 12 eggs per day is a great yield. Do you have a favorite breed of chicken, or a favorite way of using the eggs?\n\nLet me know if you need any more help or have any other questions!",
