The beachy-themed dinnerware is just an added touch to enhance the theme, but it's not necessary. Your regular dinnerware will still look lovely with the natural fiber table runner, white tablecloth, and anchor-shaped napkin rings.\n\n**Photo Booth:**\nA beachy-themed photo booth is an EXCELLENT idea! It's a great way to encourage guests to have fun, be playful, and take memorable photos. The props you mentioned, like sunglasses, hats, and inflatables, will add a lot of humor and personality to the photos. You could also consider adding some beachy backdrops, like a large piece of driftwood, a beachy mural, or even a giant shell.\n\nTo take it to the next level, you could create a custom hashtag for the party and encourage guests to share their photos on social media. This way, everyone can enjoy the photos and relive the fun after the party.\n\nSome other photo booth prop ideas:\n\n* Beach balls\n* Sunglasses with funny lenses or frames\n* Beach hats or visors\n* Inflatable rafts or pool toys\n* Seashells or starfish to use as props\n* A \"message in a bottle\" sign or prop\n* A beach-themed backdrop with a fun phrase, like \"Seas the Day!\" or \"Tidal Wave of Fun!\"\n\nRemember to keep the props simple, fun, and easy to use. You want your guests to have a blast taking photos, not to feel overwhelmed or confused.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you excited to start planning your beachy dinner party?",
