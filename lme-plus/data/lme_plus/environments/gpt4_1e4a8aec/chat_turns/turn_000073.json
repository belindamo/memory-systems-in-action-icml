  "content": "If I had to choose one aspect of building an author platform that's most important, I'd say it's **creating a website**. Here's why:\n\n1. **Ownership and control**: A website gives you complete control over the content, design, and user experience. You're not subject to the algorithms or rules of social media platforms.\n2. **Central hub**: A website serves as a central hub for your online presence, making it easy for readers to find and connect with you.\n3. **Professionalism**: A professional-looking website helps establish your credibility as an author and makes you appear more legitimate to readers, agents, and publishers.\n4. **Content showcase**: A website allows you to showcase your writing, share your work, and provide a sample of your writing style and voice.\n5. **Email list building**: A website enables you to collect email addresses from interested readers, allowing you to share news, promotions, and updates directly with them.\n\nWhile social media is important for connecting with readers and promoting your work, a website provides a foundation for your online presence that's not dependent on any particular platform. Think of your website as your \"home base\" online, and social media as \"outposts\" that drive traffic back to your website.\n\nThat being said, social media can be a great way to connect with readers, share updates, and promote your work. But if you had to start with one thing, I'd recommend building a website first.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have any questions about creating a website or concerns about getting started?",
