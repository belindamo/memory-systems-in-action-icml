Here's a brief guide to help you choose the best sandpaper for the job:\n\n**Grit Sequence**\n\nTo achieve a smooth finish, it's essential to progress through a series of grits, starting with a coarse grit and gradually moving to finer grits. This helps remove scratches and imperfections, leaving a smooth surface.\n\n* **Coarse grits (80-100)**: Use these to remove old finish, sand down rough surfaces, and remove imperfections. They're aggressive and will leave noticeable scratches.\n* **Medium grits (120-150)**: These grits are used to smooth out the surface, removing scratches from the coarse grits. They're still somewhat aggressive but will leave a smoother finish.\n* **Fine grits (220-240)**: Use these to further smooth out the surface, preparing it for finishing. They'll leave a very smooth finish with minimal scratches.\n* **Extra-fine grits (320-400)**: These are used for final sanding, removing any remaining scratches and leaving a high-gloss finish.\n\n**Sandpaper Types**\n\nThere are several types of sandpaper, each with its own characteristics:\n\n* **Open-coat sandpaper**: This type has a more open structure, which helps to prevent clogging and is ideal for sanding down rough surfaces.\n* **Closed-coat sandpaper**: This type has a denser structure, making it better suited for finer grits and smoother surfaces.\n* **Aluminum oxide sandpaper**: This is a popular choice for wood sanding, as it's durable and effective.\n* **Silicon carbide sandpaper**: This type is more aggressive than aluminum oxide and is often used for sanding metal or very hard woods.\n* **Waterproof sandpaper**: This type is designed for use with water or oil-based finishes and is ideal for sanding surfaces that will be exposed to moisture.\n\n**Other Considerations**\n\n* **Sheet size**: Choose a sandpaper sheet size that fits your project, such as 9x11 inches or 11x14 inches.\n* **Sandpaper backing**: Look for sandpaper with a sturdy backing, like a paper or cloth backing, to ensure it stays flat and doesn't tear easily.\n* **Dust collection**: Consider using a sandpaper with a built-in dust collection system or a dust-collecting sanding block to minimize dust and debris.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nFor sanding down a wood surface after removing the old finish, I recommend starting with a coarse grit (80-100) open-coat aluminum oxide sandpaper. Progress through the grit sequence, using a medium grit (120-150) and then a fine grit (220-240) for a smooth finish. If you want an extra-high-gloss finish, use an extra-fine grit (320-400) sandpaper.\n\nRemember to always sand with the wood grain to avoid scratching the surface. Change sandpaper frequently to maintain a smooth finish and prevent clogging.",
