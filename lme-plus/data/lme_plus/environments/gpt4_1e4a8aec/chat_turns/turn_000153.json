  "content": "Both Altered Carbon and Blindsight are thought-provoking and intense novels that can be stimulating, so it's worth considering your personal preferences and reading habits before deciding whether they're suitable for bedtime listening.\n\n**Altered Carbon** is a cyberpunk thriller that explores complex themes like identity, power, and corruption. While it's an engaging and well-narrated audiobook, it can be intense and suspenseful at times, with some graphic violence and mature themes. If you're sensitive to these elements or prefer a more relaxing pre-bedtime listen, you might want to consider saving Altered Carbon for a different time of day.\n\n**Blindsight**, on the other hand, is a more cerebral and philosophical novel that explores the implications of first contact with an alien species. While it's not necessarily a \"relaxing\" listen, it's more focused on ideas and introspection than action or suspense. If you enjoy thought-provoking science fiction and don't mind a slower-paced narrative, Blindsight might be a good choice for bedtime listening. However, keep in mind that it does deal with some disturbing and unsettling themes, so it's not for everyone.\n\nUltimately, it depends on your personal preferences and what you find stimulating or relaxing. If you're unsure, you could try listening to a sample or the first chapter of each book to see how they make you feel.\n\nIf you do decide to listen to either of these books before bed, make sure to set a sleep timer on your audiobook app or device, so you don't get too caught up in the story and end up staying awake all night!",
