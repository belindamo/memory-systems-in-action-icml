I recently got a new airbrush and compressor, and I'm excited to try it out on my next project, a 1/48 scale P-51 Mustang. By the way, I just got back from a model building competition where a judge gave me some feedback on my previous model, suggesting I use a different type of paint and highlighting to achieve a more realistic finish.",
