  "content": "Frozen crab legs are a great option, and they're often just as good as fresh ones. In fact, many frozen crab legs are flash-frozen soon after harvesting, which helps preserve their flavor and texture.\n\nFor this recipe, you can definitely use frozen crab legs. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Thawing:** Thaw the frozen crab legs according to the package instructions. You can thaw them in the refrigerator overnight, or thaw them quickly by submerging them in cold water.\n2. **Rinse and pat dry:** After thawing, rinse the crab legs under cold water to remove any impurities. Pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture, just like you would with fresh crab legs.\n3. **Adjust cooking time:** Frozen crab legs might need a slightly longer cooking time than fresh ones. Check on them after 12-13 minutes, and if they're not opaque and flaky, give them an additional 2-3 minutes.\n\nSome frozen crab legs may be already pre-cooked, so be sure to check the package for specific cooking instructions. If they're pre-cooked, you can skip the baking step and simply thaw, rinse, and serve with the Old Bay seasoning mixture.\n\nKeep in mind that frozen crab legs can release more moisture during cooking, which might affect the texture. However, this shouldn't impact the flavor, and the Old Bay seasoning will still infuse the crab legs with plenty of flavor.\n\nGo ahead and use frozen crab legs, and I'm sure you'll still end up with a delicious dish!",
