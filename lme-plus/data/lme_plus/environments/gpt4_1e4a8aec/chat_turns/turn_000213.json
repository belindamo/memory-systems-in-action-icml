  "content": "Introducing Azul first and then Codenames later on is a great plan. Your neighbor will appreciate the gradual introduction to new gameplay mechanics and themes.\n\nNow, about hosting a game night with 6-8 people... That's a great idea! For a larger group, you'll want games that are engaging, interactive, and can accommodate a good number of players. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Ticket to Ride**: A popular train-themed game that's easy to learn and plays well with 2-5 players. There's also an expansion, **Ticket to Ride: Longest Continuous Path**, that accommodates 6-8 players.\n2. **Settlers of Catan**: A classic game of resource management and trading that's perfect for a larger group. It's best with 3-4 players, but there's an expansion, **Catan: 5-6 Player Extension**, that allows for 5-6 players.\n3. **Codenames**: Ah, yes! Codenames is an excellent choice for a larger group. It's a word-guessing game that's perfect for teams of 4-8 players.\n4. **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong**: A social deduction game where one player takes on the role of the investigator, and the others play as suspects. It's a great game for 4-12 players.\n5. **Wits & Wagers**: A trivia game that's all about betting on the answers given by your friends. It's a great game for 4-12 players and encourages social interaction and laughter.\n6. **Taboo**: A fast-paced word-guessing game where players take turns describing a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases. It's a great game for 4-12 players.\n7. **Pictionary**: A classic drawing game that's perfect for a larger group. You can divide into teams of 2-4 players and take turns drawing and guessing.\n\nThese games are all highly interactive, engaging, and suitable for a group of 6-8 people. Make sure to have a variety of games on hand to cater to different tastes and preferences.\n\nRemember to plan ahead, set a comfortable playing area, and have snacks and drinks ready to create a welcoming atmosphere for your game night!\n\nWhich of these games do you think would be a good fit for your game night?",
