  "content": "I think these recommendations are great! I've actually been meaning to try out Azul, and now I'm even more curious about it. I've heard it's a very strategic game, but also visually appealing. I think my neighbor would enjoy it.\n\nI've also been thinking about introducing her to Codenames, since it's a great party game that's easy to learn but challenging to master. We had a blast playing it at Sarah's place last month, and I think she'd really enjoy the word-guessing aspect of it.\n\nDo you think Azul and Codenames would be a good combination to introduce to my neighbor, or should I focus on one game at a time?",
