Start by washing the tomatoes and jalapeno peppers thoroughly. Cut the tomatoes into quarters and slice the onion into thin strips.\n2. Preheat your broiler to high.\n3. Spread the tomato quarters and onion slices onto a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Place under the broiler for about 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes start to brown and blister.\n4. While the tomatoes and onions are cooking, finely chop the jalapeno peppers and garlic cloves.\n5. Once the tomatoes and onions have finished cooking, remove from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes. Once they have cooled, transfer them to a blender or food processor. Add the chopped jalapenos and garlic cloves to the blender.\n6. Squeeze the juice from one lime into the blender and add salt and pepper to taste.\n7. Blend the ingredients until you achieve the desired consistency. If the salsa is too thick, you can add a small amount of water to thin it out.\n8. Once the salsa is blended to your liking, stir in a handful of fresh cilantro.\n9. Transfer the salsa to a serving dish and let it chill in the refrigerator for about an hour.\n10. Once chilled, serve your homemade spicy salsa with tortilla chips or your favorite Mexican dish. Enjoy!",
