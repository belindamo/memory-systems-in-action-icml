The 'Museum at Night' event, which ran until midnight, offered a unique opportunity to explore the museum's vast collections under the cover of darkness. The extended hours allowed me to take a more leisurely stroll through the exhibits, and I particularly enjoyed the special activities and events that were only available during this time. The museum took on a magical quality at night, with the dimmed lights and eerie shadows adding an extra layer of excitement to the already fascinating displays. One of the highlights of the evening was the behind-the-scenes tour of the museum's taxidermy lab, which provided a fascinating glimpse into the work that goes on behind the scenes.\"\n\nFeel free to modify this paragraph or add more details to make it your own.\n\nNext, we can move on to the Science Museum or Archaeology Museum.
