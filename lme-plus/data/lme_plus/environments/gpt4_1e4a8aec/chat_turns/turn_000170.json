  "content": "My bike handling has been feeling pretty solid, and I've been working on my running form to improve my efficiency and reduce my risk of injury. I've been focusing on keeping my posture upright, landing midfoot, and quickening my turnover. I've also been doing some strength training to build up my core and glutes, which has helped with my overall running form and endurance.\n\nSpeaking of running, I've been thinking about getting new running shoes. My current shoes have been feeling a bit worn out, and I'm not sure if I should stick with the same brand and model or try something new. Do you have any recommendations for running shoes or tips for choosing the right pair?",
