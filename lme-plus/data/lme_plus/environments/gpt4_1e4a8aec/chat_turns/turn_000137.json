Here are some tutorials and guides on how to refinish wood furniture:\n\n**Preparation and Planning**\n\n1. **Assess the condition**: Inspect your side table for any damage, scratches, or worn-out areas. Decide what needs to be repaired or replaced.\n2. **Choose a finish**: Decide on the type of finish you want to achieve: stain, paint, wax, or a combination. Consider the original finish, the style you're aiming for, and the level of distressing you want.\n3. **Gather materials**: Make a list of the necessary tools and materials, such as sandpaper, wood filler, stain, paint, polyurethane, and rags.\n\n**Step-by-Step Guides**\n\n1. **Sanding and Stripping**:\n\t* Remove any hardware (e.g., legs, handles).\n\t* Sand the entire table to smooth out the surface and remove old finish (use 80-100 grit sandpaper).\n\t* Strip the old finish using a chemical stripper (follow the manufacturer's instructions).\n2. **Repairing and Filling**:\n\t* Fill any dents or holes with wood filler and let it dry.\n\t* Sand the filled areas to smooth them out.\n3. **Staining or Painting**:\n\t* Apply a wood conditioner if necessary (e.g., if the wood is unevenly colored).\n\t* Use a stain or paint of your choice, following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t* Apply multiple coats, allowing each coat to dry before applying the next one.\n4. **Polyurethane and Topcoat**:\n\t* Apply a polyurethane topcoat to protect the finish and give it a glossy sheen.\n\t* Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying times.\n5. **Distressing (optional)**:\n\t* Use sandpaper or a distressing tool to create a distressed look.\n\t* Apply a wax or oil-based finish to enhance the distressed look.\n\n**Additional Tips and Resources**\n\n* **Safety first**: Always wear protective gear, including gloves, safety glasses, and a mask when working with chemicals and power tools.\n* **Work in a well-ventilated area**: Open windows and use a fan to prevent inhaling fumes from chemicals and stains.\n* **Test and practice**: Before applying a finish to the entire table, test it on a small, inconspicuous area to ensure the desired result.\n* **Get inspiration**: Browse online marketplaces like Pinterest, Instagram, or YouTube for refinished furniture ideas and tutorials.\n* **Consult online resources**: Websites like The Spruce, DIY Network, and Woodworking Tips offer a wealth of information on refinishing wood furniture.\n\nSome popular DIY blogs and YouTube channels for furniture refinishing inspiration include:\n\n* The King of Random\n* DIY Projects\n* Woodworking Adventures\n* The Family Handyman\n* Ana White\n\nRemember to be patient, work carefully, and have fun with your project! Good luck, and I hope your vintage side table turns out beautifully refurbished!",
