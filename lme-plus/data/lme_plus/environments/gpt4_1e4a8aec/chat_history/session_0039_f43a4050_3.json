      "content": "Frozen crab legs are a great option, and they're often just as good as fresh ones. In fact, many frozen crab legs are flash-frozen soon after harvesting, which helps preserve their flavor and texture.\n\nFor this recipe, you can definitely use frozen crab legs. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Thawing:** Thaw the frozen crab legs according to the package instructions. You can thaw them in the refrigerator overnight, or thaw them quickly by submerging them in cold water.\n2. **Rinse and pat dry:** After thawing, rinse the crab legs under cold water to remove any impurities. Pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture, just like you would with fresh crab legs.\n3. **Adjust cooking time:** Frozen crab legs might need a slightly longer cooking time than fresh ones. Check on them after 12-13 minutes, and if they're not opaque and flaky, give them an additional 2-3 minutes.\n\nSome frozen crab legs may be already pre-cooked, so be sure to check the package for specific cooking instructions. If they're pre-cooked, you can skip the baking step and simply thaw, rinse, and serve with the Old Bay seasoning mixture.\n\nKeep in mind that frozen crab legs can release more moisture during cooking, which might affect the texture. However, this shouldn't impact the flavor, and the Old Bay seasoning will still infuse the crab legs with plenty of flavor.\n\nGo ahead and use frozen crab legs, and I'm sure you'll still end up with a delicious dish!"

Toss asparagus spears with olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, salt, and pepper, then roast in the oven until tender.\n2. **Mixed Greens Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette**: A light and refreshing salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and a citrusy vinaigrette dressing will cut through the richness of the crab legs.\n3. **Roasted Lemon and Herb Carrots**: Sweet and citrusy carrots roasted with lemon juice, olive oil, and fresh herbs like parsley and thyme will provide a nice contrast to the savory crab legs.\n4. **Steamed Green Beans with Lemon and Garlic**: Quickly steaming green beans with lemon juice, garlic, and a pinch of salt will preserve their crunch and provide a burst of freshness on the side.\n5. **Coleslaw with Apple Cider Vinegar**: A creamy coleslaw made with shredded cabbage, mayonnaise, and apple cider vinegar will add a nice tanginess to the dish.\n\nThese sides are all relatively quick and easy to prepare, and they'll help balance out the richness of the crab legs.

      "content": "These ideas sound amazing! I love the color scheme and decor suggestions, especially the idea of using natural elements like driftwood and seashells. The DIY beachy banner is also a great idea. I think it will really help set the tone for the party.\n\nFor the table setting, I like the idea of using a natural fiber table runner and a simple white tablecloth. The anchor-shaped napkin rings are a great touch too! I'm not sure about the beachy-themed dinnerware, though. Do you think it's necessary to go all out with the theme, or can I just use my regular dinnerware?\n\nAlso, I was thinking of setting up a little photo booth area with some beachy props like sunglasses, hats, and inflatables. Do you think that would be a good idea, or is it too much?"

      "content": "I'm so glad you liked the ideas!\n\n**Dinnerware:**\nYou can definitely get away with using your regular dinnerware, especially if it's neutral or has a coastal-inspired design. The beachy-themed dinnerware is just an added touch to enhance the theme, but it's not necessary. Your regular dinnerware will still look lovely with the natural fiber table runner, white tablecloth, and anchor-shaped napkin rings.\n\n**Photo Booth:**\nA beachy-themed photo booth is an EXCELLENT idea! It's a great way to encourage guests to have fun, be playful, and take memorable photos. The props you mentioned, like sunglasses, hats, and inflatables, will add a lot of humor and personality to the photos. You could also consider adding some beachy backdrops, like a large piece of driftwood, a beachy mural, or even a giant shell.\n\nTo take it to the next level, you could create a custom hashtag for the party and encourage guests to share their photos on social media. This way, everyone can enjoy the photos and relive the fun after the party.\n\nSome other photo booth prop ideas:\n\n* Beach balls\n* Sunglasses with funny lenses or frames\n* Beach hats or visors\n* Inflatable rafts or pool toys\n* Seashells or starfish to use as props\n* A \"message in a bottle\" sign or prop\n* A beach-themed backdrop with a fun phrase, like \"Seas the Day!\" or \"Tidal Wave of Fun!\"\n\nRemember to keep the props simple, fun, and easy to use. You want your guests to have a blast taking photos, not to feel overwhelmed or confused.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you excited to start planning your beachy dinner party?"
