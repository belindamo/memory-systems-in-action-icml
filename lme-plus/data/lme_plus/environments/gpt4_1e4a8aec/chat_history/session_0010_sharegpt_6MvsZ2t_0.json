      "content": "To write a script in Excel that automatically returns and sums sales numbers per country using `VLOOKUP` and a pivot table, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the Excel worksheet, create a table with the following columns: `Country`, `Sales`, and `Date`.\n2. In the `Country` column, enter the name of each country where you have made sales.\n3. In the `Sales` column, enter the sales numbers for each country.\n4. In the `Date` column, enter the date on which each sale was made.\n5. Select the cells in the table, and then click the `Insert` tab.\n6. In the `Tables` group, click `PivotTable`, and then select `PivotTable` from the drop-down menu.\n7. In the `Create PivotTable` dialog box, select the cells in the table as the data source, and then click `OK`.\n8. In the `PivotTable Fields` pane, drag the `Country` field to the `Rows` area, and then drag the `Sales` field to the `Values` area.\n9. In the `PivotTable Fields` pane, click the `Value Field Settings` button, and then select `Sum` from the drop-down menu.\n10. In a new cell, enter the `VLOOKUP` function, which has the following syntax: `=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])`.\n11. In the `lookup_value` argument, enter the name of the country that you want to look up.\n12. In the `table_array` argument, enter the range of cells that contains the pivot table.\n13. In the `col_index_num` argument, enter the number of the column in the pivot table that contains the sales numbers.\n14. In the `range_lookup` argument, enter `TRUE` if you want the `VLOOKUP` function to return an approximate match, or `FALSE` if you want the function to return an exact match.\n15. Press `Enter` to calculate the `VLOOKUP` function, and then repeat the process for each country that you want to look up.\n\nBy using the `VLOOKUP` function together with a pivot table, you can easily and quickly sum sales numbers per country in Excel."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "If the number of rows for each country's sales numbers is different, you would need to change the `table_array` argument in the `VLOOKUP` function to include all of the rows in the pivot table that contain sales data. This will ensure that the `VLOOKUP` function can find the appropriate sales data for each country, regardless of the number of rows."

      "content": "To graph the country's sales numbers against each other, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the Excel worksheet, select the cells that contain the `VLOOKUP` formulas that you used to sum the sales numbers for each country.\n2. Click the `Insert` tab, and then click the `Column` button in the `Charts` group.\n3. In the `Column` chart types, select the chart type that you want to use (e.g., `Clustered Column` or `Stacked Column`).\n4. In the `Column Chart` dialog box, select the range of cells that contains the `VLOOKUP` formulas as the data source, and then click `OK`.\n5. Excel will create a column chart that compares the sales numbers for each country.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a pivot chart by following these steps:\n\n1. In the Excel worksheet, click the `Analyze` tab in the `PivotTable Tools` ribbon.\n2. In the `Tools` group, click the `PivotChart` button, and then select the type of chart that you want to create (e.g., `Column`, `Line`, or `Pie`).\n3. In the `Create PivotChart` dialog box, select the range of cells that contains the pivot table as the data source, and then click `OK`.\n4. Excel will create a pivot chart that compares the sales numbers for each country.\n\nBy using either a column chart or a pivot chart, you can easily compare the sales numbers for different countries in Excel."
