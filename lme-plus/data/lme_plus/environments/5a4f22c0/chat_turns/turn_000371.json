Attending a prestigious festival like TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) and seeing the impact of their online presence firsthand is invaluable. It's fantastic that you got to experience the festival's online efforts and see how they enhanced your overall experience.\n\nThe daily vlogs, interviews with filmmakers, and behind-the-scenes footage are all great examples of engaging content that can help build a community around the festival. By sharing these types of content, the festival can:\n\n1. **Provide exclusive access**: Give attendees and online followers a glimpse into the festival's inner workings, making them feel like they're part of something special.\n2. **Build anticipation**: Create buzz around specific films, events, or guests, which can drive ticket sales and increase engagement.\n3. **Offer unique insights**: Share the perspectives of filmmakers, actors, or industry professionals, providing a deeper understanding of the films and the festival's programming.\n4. **Create a sense of FOMO**: For those who can't attend the festival in person, online content can make them feel like they're still part of the experience, which can lead to increased engagement and a stronger online community.\n\nIt's also great to hear that \"The French Dispatch\" and \"Dune\" received standing ovations! Those are both highly anticipated films, and it's exciting to see them generating buzz.\n\nNow, let's apply these learnings to your own film festival. What type of content do you think would resonate with your audience? Would you focus on filmmaker interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, or perhaps showcase the festival's unique atmosphere?",
