Asking your followers to share their favorite skincare routines or tips can be a great way to encourage engagement and create a sense of community on your post. Since you've had success with asking for book recommendations, it's likely that your followers will be enthusiastic about sharing their skincare expertise as well.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to make the most out of this idea:\n\n1. **Keep it open-ended**: Instead of asking a specific question, try asking an open-ended question like \"What's your favorite skincare routine or tip?\" or \"What's one skincare trick that's changed your skin?\"\n2. **Encourage sharing**: Use phrases like \"Share your skincare secrets!\" or \"Spill your skincare tea!\" to make it fun and inviting.\n3. **Create a conversation starter**: Consider sharing a personal anecdote or a fun fact about your own skincare journey to get the conversation started.\n4. **Pin the post**: Pin the post to the top of your profile so that it remains visible and encourages new followers to engage with the conversation.\n5. **Respond and engage**: Make sure to respond to comments and engage with your followers who share their routines or tips. This will help create a sense of community and encourage more people to participate.\n\nBy asking your followers to share their skincare routines or tips, you'll not only encourage engagement but also create a valuable resource for your audience. Who knows, you might even discover some new products or techniques to try out yourself!",
