Remove any leftover trash, dust, or debris from the can and liner.\n2. **Disinfect the trash can**: Use a disinfectant spray or wipe to kill bacteria and germs that can cause unpleasant odors. Pay attention to the handles, lid, and any other areas that come into contact with your hands.\n3. **Use a trash can liner with odor-control properties**: Look for trash can liners that are specifically designed to reduce odors. These liners often contain odor-neutralizing agents or fragrances that help keep the trash can smelling fresh.\n4. **Sprinkle baking soda or odor-absorbing powder**: Sprinkle a small amount of baking soda or an odor-absorbing powder (like silica gel or activated charcoal) at the bottom of the trash can before adding a new liner. This will help absorb any moisture and neutralize odors.\n5. **Keep the trash can dry**: Make sure to wipe the trash can dry with a clean cloth after cleaning to prevent moisture buildup, which can contribute to unpleasant odors.\n6. **Use essential oils or air fresheners**: Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil (like lemon, tea tree, or lavender) to the trash can or use an air freshener specifically designed for trash cans. This will help leave a pleasant scent and mask any odors.\n7. **Take out the trash regularly**: This might seem obvious, but taking out the trash regularly will prevent the buildup of waste and reduce the likelihood of unpleasant odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can keep your bathroom trash can smelling fresh and clean. Remember to stay consistent with your cleaning schedule and take out the trash regularly to maintain a hygienic and pleasant bathroom environment!",
