Here are some tips to help you get streak-free mirrors:\n\n1. **Choose the right glass cleaner**: Opt for an ammonia-free glass cleaner, as ammonia can leave streaks and residue. Look for a cleaner that's specifically designed for mirrors and glass surfaces.\n2. **Use a lint-free paper towel**: Regular paper towels can leave behind lint and streaks. Instead, use a lint-free paper towel or a microfiber cloth, which is designed for cleaning glass surfaces.\n3. **Spray the cleaner correctly**: Spray the glass cleaner onto the mirror in a gentle, sweeping motion, starting from the top and working your way down. Avoid spraying the cleaner directly onto the paper towel, as this can cause excess liquid to drip onto the mirror.\n4. **Wipe in a circular motion**: Hold the paper towel or microfiber cloth flat against the mirror and wipe in a circular motion, starting from the top and working your way down. Apply gentle pressure, but avoid applying too much pressure, which can create streaks.\n5. **Use a dry section of the paper towel**: As you wipe the mirror, use a dry section of the paper towel to wipe away any excess cleaner and prevent streaks.\n6. **Clean in small sections**: Divide the mirror into smaller sections and clean one section at a time. This will help you maintain a streak-free finish and prevent streaks from spreading across the entire mirror.\n7. **Inspect and repeat**: After cleaning the entire mirror, inspect it for any remaining streaks or spots. If you notice any, repeat the cleaning process as needed.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* Avoid cleaning mirrors in direct sunlight, as this can cause the cleaner to evaporate too quickly and leave streaks.\n* If you notice stubborn streaks or spots, try using a glass cleaner with a built-in anti-streak formula or a specialized mirror cleaner.\n* For a more eco-friendly option, consider using a mixture of water and white vinegar or a microfiber cloth with just water to clean your mirrors.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve streak-free mirrors using glass cleaner and paper towels. Happy cleaning!",
