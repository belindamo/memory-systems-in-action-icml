  "content": "I'm thinking of participating in a summer festival that's happening in a few weeks. It's a pretty popular event, and I've heard it attracts a lot of people who are interested in handmade and unique items. Since I've had some success selling my jewelry at other events, like the Artisan Market on March 13th where I sold 5 pieces, I think this festival could be a good opportunity for me. Do you think I should focus on bringing a variety of pieces or specialize in a specific type of jewelry for this event?",
