  "content": "This father is always present when you\u2019re with him, and you can feel how he\u2019s there for you and with you.\nYou can always feel safe with this father, and he never does anything to frighten you.\nHe is a responsible father, and you can feel that he takes care of things in a dependable way.\nWhen you\u2019re with this father, things are clear and predictable, and you feel that he\u2019s in control.\nThis father has attuned playfulness, and you can feel how he\u2019s with you in a way that is enjoyable and fun, but also aware of your feelings and needs.\n\nIn this way, the therapist is using the information from the patient\u2019s AAI to shape the imagery and suggest specific qualities of the imagined parent figures that are the positive opposites of the problematic aspects of the patient\u2019s actual experiences with his or her parents. This helps to create new, secure attachment representations and facilitate the process of earned attachment security.",
