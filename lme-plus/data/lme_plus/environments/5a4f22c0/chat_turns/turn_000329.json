  "content": "This is an information about repudiating a building contract. Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nPractical considerations\nIf you are the innocent party, it can sometimes be difficult to establish that the other party has repudiated the contract (as opposed to merely breaching it). The issue will always turn on the specific facts involved.\n\nTo emphasise, repudiation involves more than just an ordinary breach. The conduct must show a clear intention by the other party to effectively walk away from the agreement. You will need compelling evidence to support a termination for repudiation.\n\nWhether the conduct of the other party gives you a right to terminate for repudiation will depend on all of the circumstances, including the terms of your contract. For example, the mere fact that a contractor has left the site may not of itself demonstrate that it has abandoned the works. (For example, it may have told you that it intends to return or there may be a valid reason for it not being there.) Keep in mind that the test for repudiation is applied objectively.",
