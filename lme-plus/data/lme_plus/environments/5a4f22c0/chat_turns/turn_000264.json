  "content": "Companion planting is a great way to create a harmonious and thriving garden ecosystem! Here are some companion plant suggestions that go well with basil, mint, and cilantro:\n\n**Basil:**\n\n* Tomatoes: Planting basil with tomatoes is a classic combination. Basil repels pests that target tomatoes, such as whiteflies and aphids, and adds flavor to tomato dishes.\n* Marigold: Marigold repels nematodes, which can harm basil, and also attracts beneficial insects.\n* Borage: Borage attracts beneficial insects and improves the flavor and texture of nearby basil.\n* Chives: Chives and basil have similar growing conditions and can be used together in many recipes.\n\n**Mint:**\n\n* Lemon balm: Both mint and lemon balm are members of the same plant family and have similar growing conditions. They can be used together in teas and desserts.\n* Oregano: Oregano and mint have similar pest-repelling properties and can be used together in Mediterranean-inspired dishes.\n* Radish: Radish can help to repel cucumber beetles, which can spread bacterial wilt to mint.\n* Bees love mint, so consider planting it near bee-friendly flowers like lavender or coneflower.\n\n**Cilantro:**\n\n* Carrots: Cilantro and carrots have similar growing conditions and can be used together in salads and slaws.\n* Dill: Dill and cilantro have similar pest-repelling properties and can be used together in pickling recipes.\n* Tomatoes: Cilantro can help to repel spider mites and aphids that target tomatoes.\n* Nasturtium: Nasturtium repels aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that target cilantro.\n\nRemember to plant companions according to their growing requirements and space needs. Also, keep in mind that some plants, like mint, can be invasive, so consider containing them to prevent spreading.\n\nHappy planting, and enjoy your expanded herb garden!",
