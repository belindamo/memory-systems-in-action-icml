Here are some pros and cons of each approach:\n\n**Option 1: Separate post for your own routine**\n\nPros:\n\n* Allows you to go into more detail about your own routine without overwhelming the post\n* Can create a sense of anticipation and excitement for your followers to share their own routines\n* Gives you more flexibility to add more visuals, like step-by-step photos or videos, to showcase your routine\n\nCons:\n\n* Might dilute the engagement on the original post asking for recommendations\n* Requires more effort to create two separate posts\n\n**Option 2: Include your own routine in the same post**\n\nPros:\n\n* Keeps the conversation in one place and encourages followers to engage with both your routine and the request for recommendations\n* Can make the post feel more conversational and personal\n* Saves time and effort by combining the two into one post\n\nCons:\n\n* Might make the post feel too long or overwhelming\n* Could overshadow the call to action for followers to share their own routines\n\nHere's a possible compromise:\n\n**Hybrid approach**\n\nYou could create a post that shares your own routine in a concise and visually appealing way (e.g., a short paragraph or a series of Instagram Stories) and then ask your followers to share their own routines in the comments. This way, you're still showcasing your own expertise and sharing your personal experience, but also leaving room for your followers to take center stage and share their own tips and recommendations.\n\nUltimately, choose the approach that feels most authentic and engaging to your audience. If you do decide to include your own routine in the same post, try to keep it brief and focused on the key products or steps that make a difference for you.",
