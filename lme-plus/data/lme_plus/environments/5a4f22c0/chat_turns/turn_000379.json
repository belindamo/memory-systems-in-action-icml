However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to recall specific conversations or keep track of your previous posts. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation.\n\nThat being said, I can still provide you with general advice on using hashtags and creating a great skincare post!\n\nUsing the hashtag #newme again might not be the most effective strategy, especially if it's not directly related to your skincare products. While it's great that it worked well for your haircut post, you might want to use more specific and relevant hashtags for your skincare post to attract the right audience.\n\nHere are some tips for creating a great skincare post:\n\n1. **Use relevant hashtags**: Research and use popular hashtags in the skincare community, such as #skincare, #skincare routine, #skincare products, #glowup, #selfcare, etc. You can also use hashtags specific to the type of products you're featuring, like #moisturizer, #serum, or #exfoliant.\n2. **Be specific**: Share your favorite products, and explain why you love them. Mention their benefits, how they've helped your skin, and any notable ingredients.\n3. **Include high-quality visuals**: Take clear, well-lit, and aesthetically pleasing photos of the products, and consider including a selfie to show the results.\n4. **Write an engaging caption**: Share your personal experience, ask questions, or ask for recommendations from your followers. This will help encourage engagement and start a conversation.\n5. **Tag the brands**: If you're featuring specific products, tag the brands to give them credit and potentially get their attention.\n\nRemember, the key to success on Instagram is to create content that resonates with your audience and uses relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience. Good luck with your post, and I hope these tips help!",
