  "content": "I think these suggestions will really help me add some dynamic feel to my bird sculpture. I'm going to try using a combination of wire and hot glue to attach the wings and tail, and experiment with adding some poseable elements like the neck and eyes. I'll also try to add some texture and movement to the feathers using fabric paint and markers. One thing I'm still unsure about is how to display my sculpture once it's complete. Do you have any suggestions on how to create a base or pedestal for my bird sculpture?",
