  "content": "That's really helpful! I'm especially interested in incorporating velvet and other rich fabrics into the design. I've been browsing online and found some beautiful velvet fabrics with intricate patterns that would be perfect for upholstery. Speaking of upholstery, I've been thinking of reupholstering some of my antique pieces, like the armchair I restored, with these fabrics. Do you have any tips on how to choose the right fabric for upholstery, especially when it comes to antiques?",
