  "content": "What a wonderful experience attending a cultural festival can be! It's great that it sparked an interest in your own heritage and motivated you to plan a trip to visit your relatives in Europe.\n\nOf course, I'd be happy to help you with visa requirements for European countries. However, before we dive into that, I just need to know a few more details from you.\n\nCould you please tell me:\n\n1. What is your nationality (i.e., what country's passport do you hold)?\n2. Which European countries do you plan to visit specifically?\n3. How long do you plan to stay in each country?\n4. What is the purpose of your visit (e.g., visiting relatives, tourism, business, study)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with more tailored guidance on visa requirements, any necessary documents, and the application process.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to check the official government websites of the countries you plan to visit or consult with the embassies or consulates of those countries in your home country for the most up-to-date and accurate information on visa requirements.",
