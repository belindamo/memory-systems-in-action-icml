  "content": "I'm thinking of using my new guitar to play some blues and folk songs, especially since I've been taking lessons with Alex and I've been really getting into the blues style. I've also been trying out different effects pedals, and I recently bought a reverb pedal that I really like. Do you think I could use that pedal with the Fender American Performer Stratocaster, and are there any other pedals you'd recommend for blues and folk playing?",
