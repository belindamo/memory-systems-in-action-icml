Here's a possible outline to get you started:\n\nTitle: The Awakening of Nyarlathotep\n\nOpening: The story begins with the protagonist, a young archaeologist named Emily, arriving at an ancient temple in Egypt to study some newly discovered artifacts. As she explores the temple, she finds a hidden chamber filled with forbidden knowledge about an ancient deity named Nyarlathotep.\n\nPlot:\n\n* Emily becomes obsessed with the knowledge she has uncovered and begins to experience strange visions and nightmares.\n* She discovers a group of cultists who worship Nyarlathotep and believe they can awaken him from his slumber.\n* As Emily investigates the cultists, she uncovers a dark plot to perform a ritual that will unleash Nyarlathotep on the world.\n* Emily tries to stop the cultists, but they capture her and use her as a sacrifice in their ritual.\n* The ritual is successful, and Nyarlathotep is awakened. Emily is able to escape, but the world is now plunged into chaos and darkness.\n* Emily realizes that Nyarlathotep's awakening was inevitable and that nothing can stop the ancient deity from wreaking havoc on the world.\n\nEnding: The story ends with Emily writing a journal entry, warning others not to delve too deeply into forbidden knowledge and to be aware of the ancient powers that lurk in the darkness. She knows that Nyarlathotep will never be defeated and that the world will never be the same again.\n\nOf course, this is just one possible story outline, and you can feel free to modify it or add your own unique elements to make it your own.
