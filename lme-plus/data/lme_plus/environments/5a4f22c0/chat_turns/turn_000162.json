This will make it easier to find what you need and prevent clutter.\n2. **Prioritize your most-used products**: Store your daily essentials in easy-to-reach locations, and reserve higher shelves or harder-to-reach areas for less frequently used products.\n\n**Storage Tips**:\n\n1. **Use baskets and bins**: Use baskets, bins, or containers to store small items like cotton pads, Q-tips, or sample products. Label each container so you can easily identify what's inside.\n2. **Utilize vertical space**: Maximize your cabinet's vertical space by using stackable shelves, baskets, or turntables. This will help keep products off the floor and make the most of the available space.\n3. **Store products by size**: Organize products by size, with larger items like bottles and jars at the bottom and smaller items like tubes and samples at the top.\n4. **Keep products facing forward**: Store products with their labels facing forward, making it easy to read and identify what's inside.\n5. **Consider a Lazy Susan**: Install a Lazy Susan or a turntable in a corner or on a shelf to make it easy to access products that are hard to reach.\n6. **Keep frequently used products at eye level**: Store your most-used products at eye level, so you can easily grab them without having to bend or stretch.\n7. **Store products in a logical order**: Organize products in the order you use them in your skincare routine. For example, store cleansers near the sink, followed by toners, essences, serums, and moisturizers.\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n\n1. **Purge expired or unused products**: Take this opportunity to get rid of expired or unused products that are taking up space and cluttering your cabinet.\n2. **Label everything**: Label each shelf, basket, or container so you can easily find what you need and maintain your organized system.\n3. **Keep the cabinet clean**: Regularly clean your cabinet to prevent dust and product buildup. Wipe down shelves and containers with a damp cloth, and dry them thoroughly to prevent water spots.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a organized and functional bathroom cabinet that makes your skincare routine more efficient and enjoyable!",
