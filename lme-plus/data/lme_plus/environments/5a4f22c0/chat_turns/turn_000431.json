  "content": "the patient to someone qualified to administer the AAI and obtain the transcript and scoring from that person. Questions 3 and 4 of the AAI each yield five adjectives that describe the patient\u2019s relationships with his or her mother and father (or primary caregivers), respectively, during early childhood. The adjectives chosen are revealing indicators of the nature of the parental relationships and the qualities of the parents that likely contributed to the attachment insecurity. Consider the following list of adjectives from a patient\u2019s AAI transcript:\nRelationship with mother\nAnxious\nNot accepting Cold Caretaking Pressured\nRelationship with father\nAbsent Frightening Irresponsible Chaotic Playful\nThis information about the patient\u2019s experience of her actual parents is tremendously valuable as a guide for the therapist\u2019s shaping and suggesting of qualities of the imagined parent figures. Prior to the IPF session, the therapist establishes the positive opposite of the adjectives that reflect negative qualities. Positive opposites of the adjectives above are as follows:\nRelationship with mother\nCalm\nAccepting\nWarm\n[Attuned caretaking] Relaxed; accepting\nRelationship with father\nPresent\nSafe; never frightening Responsible\nClear, predictable [Attuned playfulness]\nThe bracketed words bear some explanation. In the AAI, after the patient names five adjectives for a parent, for each adjective the interviewer asks for specific memories that illustrate why that adjective was chosen. The patient\u2019s memory for \u201ccaretaking\u201d revealed that she experienced her mother as instrumentally caretaking, providing food and shelter and transportation, but not in a caring, attuned way. So the positive opposite of that would be \u201cattuned caretaking.\u201d The patient\u2019s memory for the description of the relationship with her father as \u201cplayful\u201d was of the father being playful, but on his terms and not aware of the patient\u2019s state. So the positive opposite of that would be \u201cattuned playfulness.\u201d\nOften, some of the adjectives given reflect truly positive experiences with the parents. Such adjectives need not be modified. As is described in Chapter 11, on treating dismissing attachment, the adjectives given by patients with dismissing attachment are usually all positive. How to work with that circumstance is described in that chapter.\nIn IPF sessions with the above patient, when it was appropriate for the therapist to make specific suggestions of qualities of the imagined parent figures, the following statements were made (in no particular order and not all in one session). The relevant qualities are undelined. Note that although the AAI specifically asks for adjectives to describe the relationship with the parents, when the positive opposites are integrated into the IPF protocol, they can be applied as qualities of the relationships, qualities of how the patient feels in relationship to the parents, and/or as qualities of the parents themselves.\nNotice how calm the mother is when you\u2019re with her, and how calm it feels when you\u2019re together. This mother is so very accepting of who you are.\nNotice what it is about this mother that brings that feeling of warmth.\nThis mother is always attuned to you and your needs, and provides for you what feels just right.\nYou can wonder what stands out to you most that shows you how relaxed and accepting she is of you.",
