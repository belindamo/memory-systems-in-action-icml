  "content": "I think I can use a wooden base or a metal pedestal to create a sturdy and elegant display for my bird sculpture. I'll experiment with different heights and angles to find the one that works best. I'll also consider adding a protective coating to prevent any damage or wear.\n\nOne last question: Do you have any suggestions on how to title my sculpture? I want to come up with a title that captures the essence of my artwork and the eco-friendly theme.\n\n(By the way, I'll make sure to work on my sculpture around my Saturday morning commitment from 10 am to 1 pm!)",
