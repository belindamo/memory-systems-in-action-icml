Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nWrongful termination can be repudiation\n\nIf you purport to terminate a contract where you have no right to do so, this can amount to a repudiation.\n\nThis is because your conduct would demonstrate to a reasonable person that you no longer intend to be bound by the contract.\n\nThe consequence of wrongful termination can be serious. This is because if you repudiate the contract, the other party could elect to terminate the contract and sue you for damages.\n\nThis is why you need to tread very carefully before terminating a contract, and why we would always suggest that you seek legal advice.",
