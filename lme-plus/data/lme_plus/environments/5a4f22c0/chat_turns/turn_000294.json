  "content": "It's understandable to question the value of constantly monitoring and adjusting for personal biases. However, it's important to recognize that our biases and assumptions can often go unnoticed or unchallenged, leading to suboptimal decision-making.\n\nBy taking the time to actively monitor and adjust for personal biases, a leader can ensure that they are making decisions based on objective data and critical thinking, rather than being swayed by personal preferences or assumptions. This can help to minimize the risk of unintended consequences and ensure that the change management process is aligned with the organization's goals and values.\n\nTrusting your instincts is important, but it's equally important to take a nuanced approach to decision-making that considers all available data and perspectives. By actively monitoring and adjusting for personal biases, a leader can build confidence in their decision-making process and create a culture of transparency and accountability within the organization.\n\nIn summary, while it may feel like a waste of time to constantly monitor and adjust for personal biases, doing so can lead to better decision-making and ultimately, a more successful change management process.",
