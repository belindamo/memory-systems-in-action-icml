It shows you're interested in catching up again and leaves the ball in her court to respond when she's free.\n\nBy sending a text, you're:\n\n* Being considerate of her time and schedule\n* Giving her an opportunity to respond when she's available\n* Keeping the tone light and friendly\n\nYour message is also short and to the point, making it easy for your friend to respond with a simple \"yes\" or \"let me check my schedule.\" This can help get the conversation started and lead to a new meetup.\n\nRemember, the goal is to reconnect and have a good time with your friend. Don't overthink it, and just go with the flow.\n\nGo ahead and send that text message! What do you think you'll do if your friend responds positively and you schedule another meetup?",
