However, adding him to your spreadsheet can help you keep track of your social connections and remember important details about your conversations.\n\nYou can also consider adding a \"Relationship\" or \"Category\" column to your spreadsheet to differentiate between professional contacts, friends, and acquaintances. This can help you tailor your outreach and communication strategies accordingly.\n\nHow's your networking going? Have you had any interesting conversations or connections recently?",
