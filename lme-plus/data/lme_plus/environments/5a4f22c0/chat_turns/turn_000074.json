However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your specific location or the exact train station and coffee shop you're referring to. I can provide general directions, but I won't be able to give you tailored instructions based on your specific commute.\n\nThat being said, if you can provide me with the name of the train station and the coffee shop, or even just the general area or neighborhood, I can try to give you directions. Alternatively, you can also try using a mapping app like Google Maps or Waze to get the most accurate and up-to-date directions.\n\nAdditionally, I'm curious - how would you like me to take into account your varying commute routine on different days of the week? Are you looking for directions from the bus stop on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and from the train station on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",
