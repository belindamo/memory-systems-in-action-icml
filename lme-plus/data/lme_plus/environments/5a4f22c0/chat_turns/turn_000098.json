  "content": "In Mort, women play a significant role in shaping the story and its outcome. One primary example is Princess Keli, who defies traditional gender roles by insisting on becoming a warrior and challenging Death himself. She is portrayed as a strong and capable character who can hold her own against any male opponent.\n\nSimilarly, Mort's love interest, Ysabell, is portrayed as intelligent and resourceful, and she serves as his guide throughout the story. Unlike in traditional fantasy literature, where female characters are often relegated to supporting roles, Keli and Ysabell are central to the plot and take an active role in shaping events.\n\nAdditionally, Mort's portrayal of Death himself challenges traditional portrayals of death as a malevolent and frightening figure. Death is instead depicted as a complex and somewhat sympathetic character, with a dry sense of humor and a respect for the lives of all beings, including women.\n\nOverall, Mort's representation of women differs from traditional fantasy literature in that it portrays them as capable and strong individuals who can hold their own in a world dominated by men. This refreshing portrayal challenges gender stereotypes and helps to create a more inclusive and dynamic fantasy world.",
