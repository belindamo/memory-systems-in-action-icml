That's great!\n\nBy suggesting a few dates and times, you're giving your friend options and making it easier for her to find a time that works for her. And by asking about what she's been up to lately, you're showing genuine interest in her life and giving her an opportunity to share what's new and exciting with her.\n\nAsking about what she wants to talk about or do during your meetup is also a great way to make sure you're both on the same page and can plan a fun and engaging activity together. It might even give you some ideas for new things to try or explore together!\n\nRemember, the key to a successful meetup is to be flexible, open-minded, and genuinely interested in your friend's life and experiences. By doing so, you'll create a positive and enjoyable atmosphere for both of you.\n\nNow that you have a plan in place, go ahead and send that text message! What do you think you'll do if your friend suggests a activity or topic that you're not familiar with or haven't tried before?",
