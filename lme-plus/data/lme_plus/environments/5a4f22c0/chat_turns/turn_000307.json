  "content": "Could you please give me feedback on my following text: It all started with a man, lonely on his canoe, that is lost in his mind looking at the mountains. He decides to navigate further on the lake even if he doesn't have a safety vest. Once in the middle of it, he just falls asleep with the sounds of the wind hitting the mountains and the sun keeping his face warm. 30 minutes later, he opens his eyes to realise he is lost, stuck on the opposite side of the lake. His boat is floating in the middle of the lake. He finally calls the authorities and they pick him up and bring him back to his home.",
