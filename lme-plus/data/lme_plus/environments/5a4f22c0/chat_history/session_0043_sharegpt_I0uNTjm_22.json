And they communicate their delight to you in ways you can really take in.\n\n\u2022 See what it is about them that makes it so very clear that they\u2019re absolutely delighted in who you are.\n\nENCOURAGEMENT FOR EXPLORATION Inner exploration\n\n\u2022 They help you to see that emotions are not dangerous but are natural ways of learning about yourself and are also ways of expressing unmet needs.\n\n\u2022 In this special relationship, you experience them as especially attuned, capable of listening carefully, and able to validate your feelings.\n\n\u2022 These parents help you to see yourself as the unique, deep, rich, and complex individual you are.\n\n\u2022 Feeling such safety and security with them, you can begin to explore your inner experience in a creative way, bringing to your exploration an attitude of openness and discovery.\n\n\u2022 No matter what you discover, you find that they are quite responsive and accepting of your inner experience, whether it\u2019s comfortable or uncomfortable to you.\n\nOuter exploration\n\n\u2022 With their support, you start to feel inspired to try new things.\n\n\u2022 They encourage you to explore new ways of acting and doing things.\n\n\u2022 With such secure feelings, you can become capable and competent in the world in so many ways.\n\n\u2022 And with their encouragement, you can become more adventuresome and daring.\n\n\u2022 They are happy to support you as you learn and explore and discover what you like.\n\n\u2022 Isn\u2019t it wonderful to feel their support as you go off on your own to see what you find!\n\nNotice that these suggestions are made in ways that do not impose how the imagined parents will manifest the qualities; instead, the presence of the qualities is suggested, and the patient\u2019s attention is pointed toward imagining the ways that the qualities will appear in the parent figures.\n\nIt can be particularly beneficial if the suggested qualities are linked to and build upon what the patient describes about the parents. For example:\n\nPatient: I guess, they\u2019re just, smiling now, so happy to be around me [delight], putting their hand on my shoulder.\n\nTherapist: Yes, they\u2019re so happy to be around you, and they express that to you in ways you can really take in. And putting their hand on your shoulder\u2014it seems like such a simple touch, but notice how deep it feels, saying so much about how delighted they are to be with you. You can feel so much from that.\n\nHere, the therapist mirrored the patient\u2019s experience of the parents being happy to be with him, using the same phrase as he did, and then suggested that they would express that happy feeling to him to highlight and possibly enhance the patient\u2019s experience of direct communication of the parents\u2019 delight in the child. The addition of \u201cin ways you can really take in\u201d is a suggestion of the parents being attuned to the patient\u2019s best ways of receiving their expressions.\n\nSuggest that the imagined parent figures have specific qualities that are the positive opposite of the particular patient\u2019s experiences with his or her actual parents. During intake evaluation, inquiry into the patient\u2019s early recollections of his or her parents and the ways they were toward the patient during childhood yields information that can be fruitfully brought into the IPF sessions. Based on the principle that particular parental behaviors and ways of being impede the development of secure attachment, knowledge of which of those factors are relevant to a particular patient allows the IPF imagery to be developed and shaped so those factors are most effectively countered. When imagined parent figures embody the positive opposites of the developmentally disruptive ways of being of the actual parents, they will most effectively and efficiently create the new attachment representations that will result in earned attachment security.\n\nInformation about a patient\u2019s early experiences with parents can be obtained in several ways. The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, & Main, 1996) was developed to specifically obtain information relevant to attachment status. Ideally, the therapist will be trained and qualified to administer the AAI and will do so with patients who present with relational disturbance. Alternately, the therapist can refer"

      "content": "Yes, IPF is a therapeutic technique that aims to help individuals develop new, positive attachment representations in order to improve their ability to form and maintain secure attachments in their relationships. It involves the use of imagery to create mental representations of idealized parent figures, who embody attachment-promoting qualities that may have been lacking in the patient's actual parents. The therapist guides the patient in imagining and interacting with these parent figures, and helps the patient focus on the sensory and emotional experiences associated with these interactions. By doing this, the patient is able to process and integrate new, positive attachment experiences, which can lead to changes in their real-life attachment behaviors and relationships."

      "content": "the patient to someone qualified to administer the AAI and obtain the transcript and scoring from that person. Questions 3 and 4 of the AAI each yield five adjectives that describe the patient\u2019s relationships with his or her mother and father (or primary caregivers), respectively, during early childhood. The adjectives chosen are revealing indicators of the nature of the parental relationships and the qualities of the parents that likely contributed to the attachment insecurity. Consider the following list of adjectives from a patient\u2019s AAI transcript:\nRelationship with mother\nAnxious\nNot accepting Cold Caretaking Pressured\nRelationship with father\nAbsent Frightening Irresponsible Chaotic Playful\nThis information about the patient\u2019s experience of her actual parents is tremendously valuable as a guide for the therapist\u2019s shaping and suggesting of qualities of the imagined parent figures. Prior to the IPF session, the therapist establishes the positive opposite of the adjectives that reflect negative qualities. Positive opposites of the adjectives above are as follows:\nRelationship with mother\nCalm\nAccepting\nWarm\n[Attuned caretaking] Relaxed; accepting\nRelationship with father\nPresent\nSafe; never frightening Responsible\nClear, predictable [Attuned playfulness]\nThe bracketed words bear some explanation. In the AAI, after the patient names five adjectives for a parent, for each adjective the interviewer asks for specific memories that illustrate why that adjective was chosen. The patient\u2019s memory for \u201ccaretaking\u201d revealed that she experienced her mother as instrumentally caretaking, providing food and shelter and transportation, but not in a caring, attuned way. So the positive opposite of that would be \u201cattuned caretaking.\u201d The patient\u2019s memory for the description of the relationship with her father as \u201cplayful\u201d was of the father being playful, but on his terms and not aware of the patient\u2019s state. So the positive opposite of that would be \u201cattuned playfulness.\u201d\nOften, some of the adjectives given reflect truly positive experiences with the parents. Such adjectives need not be modified. As is described in Chapter 11, on treating dismissing attachment, the adjectives given by patients with dismissing attachment are usually all positive. How to work with that circumstance is described in that chapter.\nIn IPF sessions with the above patient, when it was appropriate for the therapist to make specific suggestions of qualities of the imagined parent figures, the following statements were made (in no particular order and not all in one session). The relevant qualities are undelined. Note that although the AAI specifically asks for adjectives to describe the relationship with the parents, when the positive opposites are integrated into the IPF protocol, they can be applied as qualities of the relationships, qualities of how the patient feels in relationship to the parents, and/or as qualities of the parents themselves.\nNotice how calm the mother is when you\u2019re with her, and how calm it feels when you\u2019re together. This mother is so very accepting of who you are.\nNotice what it is about this mother that brings that feeling of warmth.\nThis mother is always attuned to you and your needs, and provides for you what feels just right.\nYou can wonder what stands out to you most that shows you how relaxed and accepting she is of you."

This helps to create new, secure attachment representations and facilitate the process of earned attachment security."
