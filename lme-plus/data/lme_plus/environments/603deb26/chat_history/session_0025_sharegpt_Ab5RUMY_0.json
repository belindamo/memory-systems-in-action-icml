Well of course the first time i was rather excited and i'll take a dip every now and again on a hot day but the sand the water its not really my thing. In Germany being tossed into the ocean or having tsunami drills wasn't really a huge thing. Of course there\u2019s water but mostly just lakes, nothing too big. What really surprised me was the lack of nudity on beaches. Believe it or not, public nudity isn't that big of a deal in Germany. Whenever we would go to a lake or man made beach whatever it may be. German people would shamelessly wear as little as possible or nothing at all. They would change wherever with not a care in the world. It is their normal. Surprisingly, my family never lived on a base. We always lived off base on various streets we could hardly pronounce. Our first home was quite beautiful and located in such a lovely neighborhood. Unfortunately it was located right across the street from a butcher shop/deli so you can imagine how not fun that was. They would slaughter the pigs right there and then serve it fresh the next day. This is partially why I became a vegetarian. In Hawaii or really anywhere in America it's very rare you\u2019ll find a deli that serves up their meat straight from the back of their slaughterhouse. It's usually pre packaged and shipped. That was one of the good things about Germany, most everything was fresh. Fresh bread from your local bakery, (one on every corner) fresher soda too.\""
