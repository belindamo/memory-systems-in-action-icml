  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I'll definitely try out that lavender syrup recipe and experiment with the cocktails you suggested. By the way, speaking of experimenting with cocktails, I've been trying to perfect my Negroni recipe and I've found that using Hendrick's gin and Carpano Antica vermouth really brings out the flavors. I've tried making it at home for 5 times now since Emma teached me how to make it, and I'm getting closer to getting it just right. Do you have any recommendations for other bitter liqueurs I could try in place of Campari?",
