  "content": "Sure, I will continue normalizing the ERD until 5NF.\n\nStep 1: Identify the functional dependencies between attributes in each table.\n\nIn the given ERD, it is assumed that there are no functional dependencies other than the primary keys.\n\nStep 2: Create separate tables for each set of related data and assign primary keys.\n\nBased on the relationships in the ERD, we can create the following tables:\n\n* Customer (customer\\_id PK, name, address, contact\\_details, kyc\\_details)\n* Account (account\\_number PK, account\\_type, account\\_balance, account\\_status, customer\\_id FK)\n* Transaction (transaction\\_id PK, transaction\\_type, transaction\\_date, transaction\\_amount, transaction\\_status, account\\_number FK)\n* Loan (loan\\_id PK, loan\\_amount, repayment\\_schedule, customer\\_id FK)\n* Loan\\_Type (loan\\_type\\_id PK, loan\\_id FK, loan\\_type)\n* Interest\\_Rate (interest\\_rate\\_id PK, loan\\_id FK, interest\\_rate)\n* Credit (credit\\_id PK, credit\\_limit, credit\\_utilization, credit\\_score, credit\\_status, customer\\_id FK)\n* Risk (risk\\_id PK, risk\\_type, risk\\_level, risk\\_status, customer\\_id FK)\n* Compliance (compliance\\_id PK, compliance\\_type, compliance\\_status, compliance\\_deadline, customer\\_id FK)\n* Treasury (treasury\\_id PK, customer\\_id FK)\n* Investment (investment\\_id PK, investment\\_portfolio, treasury\\_id FK)\n* Cash (cash\\_id PK, cash\\_reserves, treasury\\_id FK)\n* Forex\\_Transaction (forex\\_transaction\\_id PK, forex\\_transactions, treasury\\_id FK)\n* Business\\_Intelligence (business\\_intelligence\\_id PK, revenue, profitability, market\\_share, kpi, customer\\_id FK)\n* Integration (integration\\_id PK, customer\\_id FK)\n* API\\_Endpoint (api\\_endpoint\\_id PK, api\\_endpoints, integration\\_id FK)\n* API\\_Key (api\\_key\\_id PK, api\\_keys, integration\\_id FK)\n* Integration\\_Status (integration\\_status\\_id PK, integration\\_status, integration\\_id FK)\n\nNote that we have separated the tables that have transitive dependencies (Loan, Loan\\_Type, and Interest\\_Rate) into separate tables. We have also created separate tables for the Treasury and Integration/API tables since they have multiple attributes that are not functionally dependent on each other.\n\nStep 3: Remove any redundant data and dependencies.\n\nSince we created separate tables for each set of related data, there should be no redundant data. However, we should still check for any transitive dependencies.\n\nAll tables are in 3NF, and no further normalization is necessary.\n\nStep 4: Verify the normalization level of the tables.\n\nAll tables are in 3NF, which means they are free of transitive dependencies and redundant data. Additionally, since we have separated the Treasury and Integration/API tables into separate tables, we have also eliminated any multi-valued dependencies.\n\nStep 5: Normalize the tables further into higher normal forms.\n\nWe do not have any additional dependencies that require further normalization. Therefore, all tables are in 5NF.\n\nOverall, by following the normalization steps, we have created a well-structured and organized database schema that is optimized for data consistency, reduced redundancy, and improved data integrity.",
