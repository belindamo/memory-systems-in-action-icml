  "content": "UV protection is a crucial consideration when it comes to preserving the colors and condition of your Pok\u00e9mon figures, especially if you plan to display them in a sunny area or under bright lighting.\n\nUV rays can cause colors to fade, become discolored, or even brittle over time. This is especially true for figures with vibrant or sensitive colors, like your rare Mewtwo figurine.\n\nWhen looking for a display case with UV protection, consider the following:\n\n1. **UV-filtering glass or acrylic:** Some display cases feature glass or acrylic materials that are specifically designed to filter out UV rays. These materials can block up to 99% of UV radiation, providing excellent protection for your figures.\n2. **UV-resistant coatings:** Some cases may have a special coating that helps to block UV rays. This coating can be applied to the glass or acrylic surfaces and can be an effective way to protect your figures.\n3. **Low-UV-emission lighting:** If you plan to use lighting to illuminate your display case, look for options with low-UV-emission bulbs. These bulbs are designed to reduce UV radiation and can be a good option for displays that require lighting.\n\nWhen shopping for a display case with UV protection, be sure to check the product description or manufacturer's specifications for mentions of UV protection, UV filtering, or UV resistance. You can also look for certifications like UV-filtering glass or acrylic from reputable organizations.\n\nRemember, even with UV protection, it's still important to place your display case in a location that receives minimal direct sunlight and uses low-UV-emission lighting to ensure the longest possible lifespan for your Pok\u00e9mon figures.\n\nBy considering UV protection, you can help preserve the beauty and condition of your rare Mewtwo figurine and other Pok\u00e9mon figures for years to come!",
