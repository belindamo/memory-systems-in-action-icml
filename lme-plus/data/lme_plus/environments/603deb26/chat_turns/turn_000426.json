  "content": "I'm really interested in the Lady Emily Ashton series. I've always been fascinated by the Victorian era, and I love the idea of a strong female protagonist navigating high society. By the way, I recently attended a book reading event at the local library where author Emma Taylor discussed her latest novel, \"The Lost City\". I had finished reading the book a week prior and was excited to hear her insights on the writing process. I even got my book signed by her afterwards!",
