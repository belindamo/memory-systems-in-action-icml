  "content": "Technology has had a significant impact on the practice of origami by providing new tools and resources for practitioners to learn, create, and share their work. One of the most significant ways technology has influenced origami is through the availability of instructional videos, online tutorials, and digital diagrams, making it easier for people to learn the art form regardless of their location or access to physical resources.\n\nAdditionally, there are now a variety of digital tools available for creating origami designs, from computer-aided design (CAD) software to mobile apps. These tools allow origami designers to experiment with new shapes and iterations and create more complex and intricate designs. Some of these digital tools even simulate the folding process, making it possible to adjust folds and creases before committing to the final design.\n\nSome popular digital tools for creating origami designs include:\n\n1. Origami Studio: This software is specifically designed for creating origami designs and offers a range of features to help designers create and visualize their work in 3D.\n\n2. Autodesk Fusion 360: This CAD software offers a broad range of design tools that are useful for creating origami designs.\n\n3. Tinkercad: This is a free, online 3D modeling program that offers a relatively simple interface, making it easy for beginners to start creating their own origami designs.\n\n4. Folding@home: This is a distributed computing project that uses the power of thousands of computers to simulate protein folding. Although not strictly related to origami, the project has been praised for its ability to simulate the intricate folding required for the origami-style shapes of certain proteins.\n\nOverall, technology has significantly impacted the practice of origami, providing new tools and resources for designers to create and share their work. These tools will likely continue to evolve, providing even more possibilities for the art form in the future.",
