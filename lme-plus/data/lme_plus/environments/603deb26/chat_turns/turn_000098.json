Here are some additional tips to help you increase engagement on Instagram:\n\n1. **Post high-quality content**: Share visually appealing, interesting, and relevant photos or videos that align with your brand or niche. Make sure they're well-lit, in focus, and captioned with a clear and concise message.\n2. **Use a mix of hashtags**: While using relevant hashtags like #hikingadventures is excellent, try to mix it up with a combination of niche-specific, popular, and less popular hashtags. This will help you reach a broader audience and avoid over-saturation.\n3. **Engage with your audience**: Respond to comments and messages promptly. Like and comment on other users' posts, especially in your niche. This will help you build relationships and encourage users to engage with your content.\n4. **Post consistently**: As you've noticed, consistency is key. Aim to post at least 3-5 times a week, but make sure you don't sacrifice quality for quantity.\n5. **Utilize Instagram Stories**: Share behind-the-scenes content, sneak peeks, or exclusive deals to keep your audience engaged.
