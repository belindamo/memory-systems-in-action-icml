It's a great starter set for any farmer, and the cordless design makes it convenient for use around the farm. Price: Around $150.\n2. **Craftsman 10-Piece Combination Wrench Set**: This set includes a range of wrenches, pliers, and screwdrivers, all made with durable steel and comfortable grips. It's a great all-around set for any farmer. Price: Around $100.\n3. **Kobalt 22-Piece Tool Set**: This set includes a wide range of tools, including wrenches, pliers, screwdrivers, and more. It's a great value for the price and would be a great addition to any farm toolbox. Price: Around $180.\n\nAll of these options are high-quality toolsets that should meet your needs. However, if you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, you could consider purchasing individual tools instead of a set.\n\nGlad to hear that you're happy with the sale of the excess roosters! Investing in your farm is a great way to improve efficiency and productivity.",
