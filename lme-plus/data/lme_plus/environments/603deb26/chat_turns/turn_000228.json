Sweet potato toast and hummus: Top sweet potato slices with hummus and veggies for a nutrient-packed snack that's also high in carbs. 3. Whole wheat toast and avocado: Top whole wheat toast with avocado for a pre-workout snack that's high in healthy carbs and also provides healthy fats. 4. Date energy balls: Dates are high in carbs and when combined with nuts or sunflower seeds make an ideal pre-workout snack that will provide both energy and protein. 5. Smoothie bowl: Blend up your favorite fruits and veggies with plant-based protein powder and top with granola, nuts, and seeds for a nutrient-dense and high-carb snack. These are just a few ideas to get you started. You can also experiment with foods like oranges, berries, oats, or whole-grain crackers to create high-carb snacks that are also rich in protein.",
