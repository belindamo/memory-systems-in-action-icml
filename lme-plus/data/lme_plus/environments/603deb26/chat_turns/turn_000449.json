However, Phoebus also desires Esmeralda, and his betrayal leads to a tragic series of events that ends in Quasimodo's death and the reconciliation of the other characters.\n\nThroughout the novel, Hugo explores themes of love, loyalty, faith, and the struggle against oppression and social injustice.
