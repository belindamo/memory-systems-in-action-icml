I've also been experimenting with different types of gin, and I recently picked up a bottle of Hendrick's gin, which I'm really enjoying. By the way, speaking of gin, I've tried making a Negroni at home 10 times now since my friend Emma showed me how to make it. Do you have any recommendations for other gin-based cocktails that I should try making?",
