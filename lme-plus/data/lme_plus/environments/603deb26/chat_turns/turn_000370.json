You won't be disappointed with the sound quality and build.\n\nNow, about your Marvel collectibles: cleaning and maintaining them is crucial to preserving their condition and value. Here are some tips for your Iron Man Funko Pop and other collectibles:\n\n1. **Dusting:** Use a soft, dry brush or a microfiber cloth to gently remove dust and dirt from the surface. Avoid using compressed air or vacuum cleaners, as they can create static electricity that attracts more dust.\n2. **Cleaning:** For more stubborn dirt or stains, mix a small amount of mild soap with warm water. Dip a soft cloth into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and wipe down the collectible. Avoid getting any liquids into crevices or joints. For Funko Pops, you can also use a gentle cleaning product like Funko's own cleaning solution.\n3. **Avoid harsh chemicals:** Never use strong chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or polishes, as they can damage the paint, plastic, or other materials.\n4. **Display with care:** When displaying your collectibles, avoid direct sunlight, extreme temperatures, and humid environments. UV light can cause colors to fade, and moisture can lead to mold or warping.\n5. **Storage:** If you need to store your collectibles, use acid-free tissue paper, bubble wrap, or foam inserts to cushion them. Store them in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.\n6. **Handling:** Always handle your collectibles with clean, dry hands. Avoid touching the surface of the figure, as oils from your skin can attract dirt and dust.\n7. **Inspection:** Regularly inspect your collectibles for signs of damage, such as cracks, fading, or loose joints. Catching issues early can help prevent further damage.\n\nFor your Iron Man Funko Pop, you can also consider using a Funko Pop display case or a protective acrylic case to keep it dust-free and secure.\n\nRemember to always check the manufacturer's specific cleaning and maintenance instructions for any unique or special care requirements.\n\nEnjoy your new record player and your Marvel collectibles!",
