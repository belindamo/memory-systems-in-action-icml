  "content": "That's a great idea! Having a familiar face behind the camera will definitely help the kids feel more comfortable and natural in front of the lens. Your sister, Rachel, will be able to capture some wonderful moments, and you'll have the added bonus of having a personal touch to the photos.\n\nProviding a shot list and communicating with Rachel beforehand will ensure that she knows what you're looking for and can plan accordingly. Don't forget to also give her some creative freedom to capture her own unique moments and perspectives.\n\nIt's also a great way to involve your sister in the party planning process and make her feel more connected to the celebration. I'm sure she'll appreciate the opportunity to contribute to Ava's special day.\n\nNow that we've covered decorations, activities, party favors, and photography, I think you're all set for a fantastic party! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope Ava has an amazing birthday and that you and your guests have a blast celebrating with her!",
