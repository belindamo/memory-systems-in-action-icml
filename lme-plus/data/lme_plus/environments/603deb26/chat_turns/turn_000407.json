  "content": "That's wonderful! Introducing a new baby to the family is a special occasion, and having them at the picnic will definitely make the day even more memorable. It's great that you're all excited to meet the little one and spend time with them.\n\nI'm sure the baby will bring a lot of joy and energy to the gathering, and it's a great way to create new memories with your family. It's also a wonderful opportunity for the baby to meet their extended family members and start building relationships from a young age.\n\nI'm sure you'll all be taking plenty of photos and creating special moments with the baby, which will be lovely to look back on in the years to come. Are there any special plans or traditions that you have for introducing the baby to the family, or any fun activities you're planning to do with them during the picnic?",
