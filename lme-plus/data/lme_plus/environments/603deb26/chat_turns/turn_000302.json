Here's some Python code that does this:\n```python\nimport json\nimport os\nimport time\n\nfilename = \"output.json\"\nmax_age_seconds = 24 * 60 * 60  # 24 hours in seconds\n\n# Check the last modification time of the file\nif os.path.exists(filename):\n    file_age = time.time() - os.path.getmtime(filename)\n    if file_age < max_age_seconds:\n        print(f\"File '{filename}' was modified within the last 24 hours. Skipping write.\")\n        # File was modified within the last 24 hours, so skip the write\n        exit()\n\n# Create a dictionary object to represent your JSON data\ndata = {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"email\": \"johndoe@example.com\"\n}\n\n# Open the file for writing\nwith open(filename, \"w\") as outfile:\n    # Write the JSON data to the file\n    json.dump(data, outfile)\n    print(f\"Wrote data to '{filename}'.\")\n```\nIn this code, we first define the maximum age of the file in seconds (24 hours). Then, we check if the file exists, and if so, we calculate its age (time since last modification) using `os.path.getmtime()` and `time.time()`. If the file age is less than the maximum age, we skip the write and exit the program.\n\nIf the file doesn't exist or its age is greater than the maximum age, we proceed to create the dictionary object representing the JSON data and write it to the file using `json.dump()`. Finally, we print a message confirming that the data was written to the file.",
