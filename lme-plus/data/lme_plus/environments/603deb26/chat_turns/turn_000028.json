  "content": "`onerror()` is an event handler that is used to execute a piece of JavaScript code when an error occurs during the loading of a web page or a resource such as an image or a script. It is a part of the HTML DOM event model, which allows developers to create interactive web pages by responding to user actions and browser events.\n\nThe `onerror()` event handler can be attached to the `window` object or any HTML element, such as an image or a script, using the `onerror` attribute. For example:\n```php\n<img src=\"image.jpg\" onerror=\"alert('Error loading image!')\">\n```\nIn this example, an `onerror()` event handler is attached to the `img` element. If an error occurs while loading the image, such as the image file not being found or the server returning an error, the JavaScript code `alert('Error loading image!')` is executed, which displays an alert dialog box with the message \"Error loading image!\".\n\nThe `onerror()` event handler is commonly used to handle errors that occur during the loading of web pages or resources, such as displaying a message to the user or retrying the loading of the resource. By using event handlers like `onerror()`, developers can create web pages that provide a more robust and error-resistant user experience.",
