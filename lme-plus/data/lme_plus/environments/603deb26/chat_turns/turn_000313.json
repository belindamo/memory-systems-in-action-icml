  "content": "That's a great idea! A costume walk with a contest sounds like a lot of fun. I think it's also a good idea to have a prize for the best costume. It'll definitely add an extra layer of excitement to the event. By the way, have you thought about reaching out to local businesses to see if they'd be willing to donate any prizes or sponsor the event? I've had some experience with that in the past, like at the \"Fireworks Festival\" charity event where we raised over $5,000 for a local children's hospital, and it really helped make the event a success.",
