I've been doing pretty well lately, like last week I posted a photo from my hike and it got a ton of engagement - 237 likes and 34 comments. But I think it's because I used a relevant hashtag #hikingadventures. By the way, have you noticed how important consistency and hashtags are on other platforms like TikTok? I've seen a slow but steady increase in followers over the past few months, and in the past month alone, I gained around 10 new followers, which is a result of posting more consistently and using relevant hashtags.",
