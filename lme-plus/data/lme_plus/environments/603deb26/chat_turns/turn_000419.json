  "content": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. I'm glad you're excited about historical mysteries with female protagonists! However, I have to clarify that Emma Taylor and \"The Lost City\" are not real in the sense that they are not actual books or authors that I can find in my databases or online searches.\n\nBut, I'd be happy to recommend more historical mysteries with female protagonists that you might enjoy! Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. The Mary Russell series by Laurie R. King - This series follows Mary Russell, a brilliant and independent woman who becomes the apprentice and later the wife of Sherlock Holmes.\n2. The Maisie Dobbs series by Jacqueline Winspear - Set in post-WWI England, this series follows Maisie Dobbs, a psychologist and private investigator, as she solves mysteries and navigates the changing social landscape.\n3. The Lady Emily Ashton series by Tasha Alexander - This series follows Lady Emily, a Victorian aristocrat who becomes embroiled in mysteries and adventures in the late 19th century.\n4. The Amelia Peabody series by Elizabeth Peters - This series follows Amelia Peabody, a Victorian archaeologist and amateur detective, as she travels through Egypt and solves mysteries with her husband Radcliffe Emerson.\n5. The Phryne Fisher series by Kerry Greenwood - Set in 1920s Australia, this series follows Phryne Fisher, a glamorous and independent detective, as she solves crimes and navigates the jazz age.\n6. The Verity Kent series by Anna Lee Huber - This series follows Verity Kent, a former spy and war widow, as she solves mysteries in post-WWI England.\n7.
