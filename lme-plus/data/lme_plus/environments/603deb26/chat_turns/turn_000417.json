It's possible that the event you attended was fictional or a mock event, or maybe you misremembered the details.\n\nBut don't worry! I'd be happy to recommend some books and authors in the adventure/mystery genre that you might enjoy. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Indiana Jones-esque adventures:\n\t* \"The Da Vinci Code\" by Dan Brown\n\t* \"The Lost Symbol\" by Dan Brown\n\t* \"The Atlantis Code\" by Charles Brokaw\n2. Archaeological mysteries:\n\t* \"The Seventh Scroll\" by Wilbur Smith\n\t* \"The Sign of Four\" by Arthur Conan Doyle\n\t* \"The Alexander Cipher\" by Will Adams\n3. Action-packed treasure hunts:\n\t* \"Sahara\" by Clive Cussler\n\t* \"Atlantis Found\" by Clive Cussler\n\t* \"The Romanov Prophecy\" by Steve Berry\n4. Historical mysteries:\n\t* \"The Historian\" by Elizabeth Kostova\n\t* \"The Eight\" by Katherine Neville\n\t* \"The Shadow of the Wind\" by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n\n\nThese books should give you a good starting point. Let me know if you have any specific preferences (e.g., historical period, tone, level of complexity) and I can provide more targeted recommendations!",
