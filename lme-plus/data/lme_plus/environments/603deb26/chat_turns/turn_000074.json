Naan (Indian): A great choice! Naan is a crowd-pleaser, and you can flavor it with various spices and herbs to complement other dishes.\n2. Sushi rolls (Japanese): Excellent choice! Sushi is always a hit, and you can create vegetarian options to cater to your guests' dietary needs.\n3. Croissants (French): Flaky, buttery croissants are a wonderful addition to any menu. You can also consider offering a gluten-free croissant option or a substitute for your gluten-free guest.\n\nTo incorporate lemons, here are some ideas:\n\n* Lemon-herb naan: Infuse your naan with a mixture of lemon zest, olive oil, garlic, and herbs like parsley or cilantro.\n* Lemon-ginger dipping sauce for sushi: Create a refreshing and zesty dipping sauce by combining lemon juice, grated ginger, soy sauce, and a hint of sugar.\n* Lemon curd or lemon bars: Offer a sweet and tangy dessert option, like lemon curd or lemon bars, to balance the savory flavors of the naan and sushi.\n\nTo accommodate your vegetarian and gluten-free guests, consider the following:\n\n* Vegetarian sushi options: Prepare cucumber, avocado, or carrot-based sushi rolls, or offer inari (sweetened tofu pouches).\n* Gluten-free naan or flatbread: Use gluten-free flours like rice flour, almond flour, or coconut flour to make a gluten-free naan or flatbread.\n* Gluten-free croissants: Look for gluten-free croissant recipes or offer a gluten-free pastry alternative, like a fruit tart or lemon bars.\n\nHere's a sample menu to get you started:\n\nAppetizer:\n\n* Lemon-herb naan with a side of spiced chickpeas or hummus\n\nMain Course:\n\n* Sushi rolls (vegetarian options available) with a lemon-ginger dipping sauce\n* Gluten-free naan or flatbread with a variety of toppings (e.g., roasted vegetables, avocado, goat cheese)\n\nDessert:\n\n* Lemon curd or lemon bars (gluten-free option available)\n* Fresh fruit platter with a dollop of whipped cream or coconut cream (gluten-free)\n\nFeel free to mix and match these ideas or add your own creations to create a menu that showcases your culinary skills and accommodates your guests' dietary needs.
