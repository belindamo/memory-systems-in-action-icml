  "content": "Moscato d'Asti is a great choice for a dessert wine. Its sweet and fruity flavors, along with its crisp acidity, make it a perfect match for a variety of sweet treats. And you're right, it's not too heavy, so it won't overpower the desserts.\n\nI'm glad I could help with the recommendations. It sounds like you have a great plan in place for your dinner party. Lasagna, garlic bread, Chianti, and Moscato d'Asti - it's a classic Italian-inspired menu that's sure to please your guests.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need any more assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a wonderful time at your dinner party and that your guests enjoy the food and wine. Buon appetito!",
