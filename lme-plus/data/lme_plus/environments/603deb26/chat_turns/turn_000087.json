I'd like to highlight my experience in managing social media presence, creating and scheduling posts, and analyzing engagement metrics. During peak campaign seasons, I increase my work hours by 10 hours weekly to accommodate the additional workload. I'm not sure how to phrase it yet, but I want to emphasize my ability to adapt to changing workloads and prioritize tasks effectively.",
