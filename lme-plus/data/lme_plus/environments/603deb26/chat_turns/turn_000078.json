Grilled portobello mushrooms and carrot-ginger tempura bits will add a wonderful depth of flavor and texture to your vegetarian sushi options.\n\nLemon-herb quinoa is a fantastic side dish idea! It's a light, refreshing, and healthy option that will complement the flavors of your naan, sushi, and croissants perfectly. The brightness of the lemon will cut through the richness of the other dishes, and the herbs will add a lovely aroma and freshness.\n\nTo make the lemon-herb quinoa even more special, consider adding some toasted pine nuts or chopped fresh herbs like parsley, basil, or cilantro on top for added texture and flavor. You could also squeeze a bit of fresh lemon juice over the quinoa just before serving to bring out the flavors.\n\nWith this side dish, you'll have a well-rounded and balanced menu that showcases a variety of flavors and textures. Your guests will appreciate the thought and effort you've put into creating a cohesive and delicious menu.\n\nHere's a quick recap of your menu:\n\n* Appetizer: Lemon-herb naan with spiced chickpeas or hummus\n* Main Course: Vegetarian sushi rolls (with grilled portobello mushrooms and carrot-ginger tempura bits) with lemon-ginger dipping sauce\n* Side Dish: Lemon-herb quinoa\n* Dessert: Lemon curd or lemon bars (with gluten-free option)\n\nYou're getting close to finalizing your menu!
