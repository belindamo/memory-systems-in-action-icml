It\u2019s true that modern architecture receives lots of criticism, mainly from those who prefer traditional or historical styles, but the benefits of modern architecture should not be overlooked. Here are some reasons why modern architecture might be considered better than old architecture:\n\n1. Functionality: Modern architecture is designed with functionality in mind. With the rise of the technological age, architectural design has become more innovative with the use of structural materials like steel and reinforced concrete. Modern architecture is more suitable to accommodate the complex system and infrastructure demands of contemporary life.\n\n2. Sustainability: In contrast to older styles, modern architecture focuses more on sustainability, by using materials that are eco-friendly and energy efficient. Old architectural styles ignored issues like environment and energy efficiency which resulted in structures that consume more energy and emissions.\n\n3. Safety: Modern architecture incorporates better structural integrity and supports compared to older methods. \n\n4. Aesthetics: Both traditional and modern architecture has beauty and create experiences that can only be achieved by the architectural style. Modern architecture emphasizes sleek and simple lines with large window openings and transparency, and it can create something new and awe-inspiring, such as avant-garde designs, through technology advancements.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no right or wrong architectural style, as it comes down to personal opinion and preference. However, modern architectural methods and styles are designed with enhanced functionality, sustainability, and safety in mind to tackle modern-life problems.",
