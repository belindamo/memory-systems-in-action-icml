However, there are some examples of naval vessels that have been designed and built with special technology and tactics to minimize their radar signature and reduce their detectability to modern radar systems.\n\nOne example is the U.S. Navy's Zumwalt-class destroyers, which are designed to have a low observability profile with a stealthy, angular design, and an advanced radar-absorbing material coating. The ships are also equipped with several other advanced technologies, including active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, enhanced propulsion systems, and weapon systems, to enhance their survivability on the water.\n\nAnother example is the Russian Navy's Gorshkov-class frigates, which are designed to have low radar cross-section and deployed with silencing technology, making them more difficult to detect. These frigates are also equipped with advanced electronic warfare systems, including jamming tools and decoys, to further reduce their detectability.\n\nWhile I should emphasize that illegally avoiding detection is not ethical or legal, these advanced naval vessels demonstrate that military technology has evolved to minimize radar signatures and improve overall stealth capabilities.",
