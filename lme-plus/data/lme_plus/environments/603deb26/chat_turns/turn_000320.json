I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nHowever, to give you an accurate answer, I need to know which nature reserve you're planning to visit and what region you're in. The species of birds you can see vary greatly depending on the location, climate, and time of year.\n\nBut I'm thrilled to hear about your previous trip on March 12th! American Goldfinches are a delight to spot, and it's wonderful that you got to see them for the first time this season.\n\nCould you please provide me with more information about the nature reserve, such as its location (city, state, or province), and I'll do my best to give you an idea of what birds you might see during your upcoming visit?",
