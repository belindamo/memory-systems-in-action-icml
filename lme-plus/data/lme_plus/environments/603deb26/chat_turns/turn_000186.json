Nonetheless, responding to your query, reducing the ship's radar cross-section is the most effective way to evade detection by modern radar systems. This is because radar systems detect objects by the amount of radar energy they reflect, and by reducing the ship's radar cross-section, the amount of energy reflected back to the radar system is minimal, making it difficult for the system to detect the ship.\n\nSpecial materials, such as RAM or radar-absorbing materials, can be used to cover the ship's exterior and reduce its radar cross-section. Additionally, a ship's design can be shaped to deflect radar signals away from the ship and reduce its signature. These designs are called low observable (LO) profiles, which are typically integrated in stealth aircraft, and similar designs are used to to reduce the visibility of ships.\n\nActive jamming and chaff deployment can also be effective strategies to confuse and divert attention away from the ship, but these tactics may require a greater level of expertise and resources.\n\nOverall, reducing the ship's radar cross-section is the best way to evade detection and remain invisible to modern radar systems.",
