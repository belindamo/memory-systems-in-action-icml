Here are some tips to make your charity run or walk more engaging and attract more participants:\n\n1. **Choose a unique theme**: Add a twist to your event by incorporating a theme, such as a costume run, glow-in-the-dark walk, or a color run. This can help attract more participants and create a fun atmosphere.\n2. **Select a scenic route**: Pick a route that's scenic, safe, and accessible. Consider partnering with local parks or trails to offer a more enjoyable experience.\n3. **Variety of distances**: Offer different distance options (e.g., 5K, 10K, 1-mile fun run) to cater to participants of varying fitness levels.
