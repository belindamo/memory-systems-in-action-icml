  "content": "Avocado and cucumber rolls are classics, but adding some more substantial options will definitely elevate your vegetarian sushi game. Here are some delicious and easy-to-make vegetarian sushi filling ideas:\n\n1. **Roasted sweet potato**: Sweet potatoes are a great match for sushi rice, and roasting them brings out their natural sweetness. Simply roast diced sweet potatoes in the oven with some oil, salt, and pepper until tender, then let them cool before using as a filling.\n2. **Grilled portobello mushrooms**: Marinate sliced portobello mushrooms in a mixture of soy sauce, sake, and sugar, then grill them until tender and slightly charred. They add a meaty texture and earthy flavor to your sushi.\n3. **Carrot-ginger tempura bits**: Shred carrots and mix with grated ginger, then coat with a light tempura batter and fry until crispy. These sweet and crunchy bits add a nice textural contrast to your sushi.\n4. **Spinach and tofu**: Mix saut\u00e9ed spinach with crumbled tofu, soy sauce, and sesame oil for a protein-packed filling. You can also add some grated ginger and garlic for extra flavor.\n5. **Pickled shiitake mushrooms**: Slice shiitake mushrooms thinly and pickle them in a mixture of vinegar, sugar, and soy sauce. They add a tangy, umami flavor to your sushi.\n6. **Crispy fried tofu**: Cut extra-firm tofu into small cubes, coat with a light batter, and fry until crispy. Then, season with soy sauce and sesame oil for added flavor.\n\nThese fillings offer a variety of textures and flavors that will complement your avocado and cucumber rolls nicely. You can also experiment with different combinations of fillings to create unique flavor profiles.\n\nRemember to handle the fillings gently when assembling your sushi rolls to avoid breaking the rice or damaging the filling. Good luck, and I hope your guests enjoy your delicious vegetarian sushi creations!",
