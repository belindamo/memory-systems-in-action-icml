I've searched my databases and online resources, and I couldn't find any information on an author named Emma Taylor or a book titled \"The Lost City\" that matches your description.\n\nHowever, I'm thrilled that you're excited about the Lady Emily Ashton series! It's a great choice, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. The Victorian era is a fascinating time period, and Lady Emily is a wonderful protagonist.\n\nIf you have any more questions about the series or need further recommendations, feel free to ask! I'm here to help.",
