  "content": "I'm thinking of making a few dishes from different cuisines, like naan from my Indian class, some sushi rolls from my sushi-making class, and maybe some croissants from my pastry-making class. I also want to feature lemons, since I've been experimenting with lemon-based recipes lately. I don't have a specific theme in mind, but I want the menu to be diverse and flavorful.
