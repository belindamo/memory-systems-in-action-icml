  "content": "There is no evidence to suggest that the popularity of digital tools for origami has caused a decline in the traditional practice of folding paper. In fact, the availability of digital tools and resources has made it easier for people to learn about and practice origami, which has led to an increase in its popularity and participation.\n\nDue to the internet and social media, origami enthusiasts have access to an endless stream of designs, tutorials, diagrams, and videos that they can use to improve their skills and connect with other enthusiasts. This has led to a considerable increase in the number of people practicing the art form, as well as its visibility and popularity.\n\nMoreover, although digital tools can be useful for origami design and visualization, they cannot replace the experience of folding paper in real life. Many enthusiasts find the tactile experience of origami to be an essential and satisfying aspect of the art form, and they will continue to practice it regardless of the availability of digital tools.\n\nOverall, while digital tools have undoubtedly impacted the practice of origami, they have not caused a decline in the traditional practice of folding paper, and may have even contributed to its continued popularity and growth.",
