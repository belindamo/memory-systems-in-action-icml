Lasagna is a great choice for a dinner party, and I'd be happy to provide you with a simple recipe that serves 8-10 people.\n\nHere's a classic lasagna recipe that's easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser:\n\n**Lasagna Recipe for 8-10 people**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 8-10 lasagna noodles\n* 1 pound ground beef\n* 1 onion, chopped\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 cups marinara sauce\n* 1 cup ricotta cheese\n* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese\n* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1 egg, beaten\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Fresh basil leaves, chopped (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).**\n2. **Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.**\n3. **In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat until browned, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks.**\n4. **Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent.**\n5. **Stir in the marinara sauce and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for a few minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.**\n6. **In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.**\n7. **In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.**\n8. **Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by half of the shredded mozzarella cheese.**\n9. **Repeat the layers: meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese.**\n10. **Top the final layer of mozzarella cheese with the grated Parmesan cheese.**\n11. **Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.**\n12. **Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.**\n13. **Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves, if desired.**\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can prepare the meat sauce and ricotta cheese mixture ahead of time to make assembly easier.\n* Consider using a lasagna with a built-in meat sauce or a store-bought marinara sauce to simplify the recipe.\n* If you want to add extra flavor, you can saut\u00e9 some mushrooms, bell peppers, or spinach with the onion and garlic in step 3.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and sharing this lasagna with your family and friends!",
