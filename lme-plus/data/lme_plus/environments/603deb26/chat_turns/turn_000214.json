These skills can help students learn to communicate clearly and respectfully with others.\n\n3. Role-play and dramatic play: Provide opportunities for young students to practice communication skills and problem-solving through role-plays and dramatic play. This can help them learn how to interact respectfully with others in different settings.\n\n4. Use social stories: Social stories are short stories that teach children how to behave in specific social situations. They can be used to help young students learn how to interact respectfully with others in different settings.\n\n5. Engage in community service projects: Engage young students in community service projects that promote respectful behavior and kindness. This can help them develop a sense of empathy and social responsibility.\n\n6.
