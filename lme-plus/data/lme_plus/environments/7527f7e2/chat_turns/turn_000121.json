  "content": "Writing systems are typically considered to represent a spoken or gestured language, as they are used to transcribe the sounds, words, or concepts of a language into a written form.\n\nIn most cases, writing systems are developed after a spoken or gestured language already exists, as a way to record and preserve the language. The earliest examples of writing systems, such as cuneiform and hieroglyphs, were developed to record the languages of ancient civilizations.\n\nHowever, there are also examples of writing systems being developed before a spoken or gestured language. For example, sign languages have been developed to serve as a means of communication for deaf people and they have developed their own writing systems. Sign languages are visual-manual languages, and their writing systems use different techniques such as fingerspelling, signing in space and facial expressions to represent the language.\n\nOverall, writing systems are primarily considered to represent spoken or gestured languages, but there are also examples of the reverse, where a spoken or gestured language represents a writing system. In both cases, the writing system serves as a tool to represent and preserve the language.",
