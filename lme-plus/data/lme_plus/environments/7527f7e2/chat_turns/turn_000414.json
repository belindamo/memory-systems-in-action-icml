I've already got some live plants like Java moss and Anacharis in the tank, so I might consider adding some more of those or trying out some of the other plants you mentioned. By the way, I got the harlequin rasboras last weekend, and they're really active, always chasing each other around the tank. I'm a bit worried they might harass my neon tetras, but so far, they seem to be getting along okay. Do you think I should be concerned about aggression between the two species?",
