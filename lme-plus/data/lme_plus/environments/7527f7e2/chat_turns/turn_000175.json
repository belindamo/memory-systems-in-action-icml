  "content": "I'd love to explore some new recipes and cooking techniques! I've been feeling a bit stuck in a cooking rut lately, and I'd love some inspiration. I don't have any dietary restrictions, but I do prefer to eat relatively healthy and balanced meals. I've been thinking about trying out some new cuisines, like Korean or Indian food, which I've heard are often very affordable and delicious.\n\nAlso, I've been considering meal prepping on the weekends to make my weekdays easier. Do you have any tips on how to get started with meal prepping?",
