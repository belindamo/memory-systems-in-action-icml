Nance is known for his athleticism, defensive prowess, and ability to play multiple positions, while Zeller is a solid rebounder, defender, and efficient scorer in the paint.\n\nBoth players should provide valuable depth to the Trail Blazers' frontcourt, which has been a significant area of weakness in recent seasons. Nance, in particular, could be a crucial addition to the team's defensive strategy, as he has shown an ability to guard multiple positions and disrupt opponents' offensive flow.\n\nHowever, whether or not Nance and Zeller make a significant impact on the team depends on many factors, including their chemistry with the other players, how well they adapt to the team's system, and how much playing time they receive. But overall, both players have the potential to be important contributors to the Trail Blazers' success this season.",
