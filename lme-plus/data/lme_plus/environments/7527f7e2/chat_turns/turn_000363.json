Here are some tips to help you identify a good cobbler based on their website and social media:\n\n**Website:**\n\n1. **Clear Services Page**: A good cobbler's website should have a clear services page that lists the types of repairs they offer, including shoe repair, leather goods repair, orthotics, and any other specialized services.\n2. **Portfolio or Gallery**: Look for a portfolio or gallery section that showcases their work. This can give you an idea of their craftsmanship, attention to detail, and the types of projects they've worked on.\n3. **Testimonials**: Check for customer testimonials or reviews on their website. While these can be curated, they can still give you an idea of the cobbler's reputation and customer satisfaction.\n4. **About Page**: An \"About\" page can provide insight into the cobbler's experience, qualifications, and values. Look for information about their training, years of experience, and any certifications.\n5. **Contact and Location**: Make sure their website has a clear contact page with a physical address, phone number, and email address.\n\n**Social Media:**\n\n1. **Consistency**: Check how frequently they post and how consistent their posting schedule is.

Do they respond to customer inquiries or concerns? Do they share customer testimonials or reviews?\n\n**Red Flags:**\n\n1. **Poor Website Design or Lack of Information**: A poorly designed website or lack of information can indicate a lack of professionalism or attention to detail.\n2. **No Clear Services or Pricing**: If a cobbler's website doesn't clearly list their services or pricing, it may be a sign of unclear communication or a lack of transparency.\n3. **No Customer Reviews or Testimonials**: If a cobbler's website or social media lacks customer reviews or testimonials, it may be a sign of inexperience or poor customer service.\n4. **Unprofessional Social Media Behavior**: If a cobbler's social media behavior is unprofessional, such as frequent complaining or negativity, it may indicate a poor attitude or lack of customer focus.\n\nBy evaluating a cobbler's website and social media presence, you can get a better sense of their professionalism, attention to detail, and customer service.
