Here are some ideas that fit well with the Vintage Garden Party theme and would be suitable for an 86-year-old grandma and her guests:\n\n1. **Garden Trivia**: Create a trivia game with questions about gardening, flowers, and nature. You can also include questions about your grandma's life, interests, and favorite things.\n2. **Flower Crown Station**: Set up a station where guests can create their own flower crowns using real or artificial flowers, greenery, and ribbons. This can be a fun and creative activity.\n3. **Vintage Garden-themed Bingo**: Design bingo cards with garden-themed images, such as flowers, butterflies, or gardening tools. Call out the items, and see who marks them off first.\n4. **Guess the Herb**: Prepare small pots with different herbs, and have guests guess which herb is which. This can be a fun and interactive way to explore different scents and flavors.\n5. **Vintage Photo Booth**: Set up a photo booth with props like vintage hats, scarves, and gardening tools. Take pictures of guests with fun and silly expressions.\n6. **Garden-themed Word Scramble**: Create a word scramble with garden-themed words, such as \"flower,\" \"garden,\" or \"bloom.\" See who can unscramble the words first.\n7. **Tea Leaf Reading**: Hire a tea leaf reader or have a designated person read tea leaves for guests. This can be a fun and unique activity that adds to the vintage garden party atmosphere.\n8. **Vintage Garden Music**: Create a playlist with music from the 1940s-1950s, or play traditional garden party music, such as string quartets or jazz. Encourage guests to dance or sing along.\n9. **Garden-themed Storytelling**: Set up a designated area for guests to share their own garden stories, memories, or tips. This can be a great way to encourage socializing and create a sense of community.\n10. **Vintage Garden-inspired Crafts**: Set up a craft station where guests can create their own garden-inspired crafts, such as decorating planters, making garden-themed cards, or creating flower press art.\n\nRemember to keep the games and activities simple, enjoyable, and accessible for your grandma and her guests. The goal is to create a fun and memorable experience, not to exhaust or overwhelm anyone.\n\nWhich of these ideas resonates with you, or do you have any other questions about games and activities?",
