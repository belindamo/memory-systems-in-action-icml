Here are some tips to help you do it effectively and safely:\n\n**Glass Walls:**\n\n1. **Magnetic algae scraper:** Use a magnetic algae scraper to remove algae and debris from the glass walls. This is the most efficient and safe way to clean the glass.\n2. **Avoid using harsh chemicals:** Never use harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, or soap to clean the glass. These can leave residues that can harm your fish or affect the water quality.\n3. **Use a soft cloth or sponge:** If you need to remove stubborn algae or debris, use a soft, lint-free cloth or a non-abrasive sponge. Gently wipe the glass in a circular motion, starting from the top and working your way down.\n4. **Clean the glass in sections:** Divide the tank into sections, and clean one section at a time. This will help prevent algae and debris from spreading to clean areas.\n\n**Decorations:**\n\n1. **Remove decorations:** Take out any decorations that are removable, such as plants, rocks, or ornaments. Rinse them gently in a bucket of tank water to remove any debris.\n2. **Soak decorations:** For decorations that can't be removed, you can soak them in a bucket of tank water with a small amount of aquarium-safe cleaning solution (like AlgaeFix or Mag-Float). Let them soak for 10-15 minutes to loosen any algae or debris.\n3. **Brush off debris:** Use a soft-bristled brush or a clean toothbrush to gently remove any debris or algae from the decorations.\n4. **Rinse thoroughly:** Rinse the decorations thoroughly in tank water to remove any cleaning solution or debris.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Turn off the filter and pumps:** Before cleaning the tank, turn off the filter and pumps to prevent any debris or cleaning solution from getting sucked into the system.\n2. **Use a bucket:** Use a bucket to rinse the decorations and clean the tank to prevent any debris or cleaning solution from entering the tank.\n3. **Clean the tank in small sections:** Divide the tank into sections, and clean one section at a time to prevent algae and debris from spreading to clean areas.\n4. **Monitor your fish:** Keep an eye on your fish during the cleaning process to ensure they're not stressed or affected by the cleaning.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to clean your tank's glass walls and decorations safely and effectively.
