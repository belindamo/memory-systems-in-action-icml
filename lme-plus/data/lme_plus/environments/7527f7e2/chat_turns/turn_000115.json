  "content": "Languages like English, in which words can be formed by combining different morphemes, are called inflected languages or morphologically rich languages.\nMorphemes are the smallest units of meaning in a language, and inflected languages use morphemes to indicate grammatical relationships between words, such as tense, number, and possession.\nEnglish words often have a root word, or a base word, to which different affixes, such as prefixes or suffixes, can be added to form new words. This process is called affixation, and it's a common way to create new words in inflected languages.\nOther examples of inflected languages include German, Spanish, Russian, and Latin.\nOn the other hand, languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese are considered isolating languages or morphologically poor languages because words don't change form to indicate grammatical relationships, and new words are formed by stringing together independent words or characters.",
