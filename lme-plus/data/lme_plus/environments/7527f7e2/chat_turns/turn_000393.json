  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have an opinion or personal beliefs, but I can provide some insight based on what experts and analysts have speculated about the Trail Blazers' potential future without Damian Lillard.\n\nIf Lillard were to leave the team, the Trail Blazers would likely need to rely on their other star players, such as CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic, to step up and take on more leadership roles. McCollum is a dynamic scorer who has shown that he can carry the team in Lillard's absence, while Nurkic is a dominant force on both ends of the court and can impact the game through his defense and rebounding.\n\nAdditionally, the Trail Blazers would likely need to look to their bench to provide additional depth and support. Players such as Norman Powell and Robert Covington have shown that they can make significant contributions on the court, and the team may need to rely more heavily on these role players to fill the void left by Lillard's absence.\n\nOverall, it would be a challenging situation for the Trail Blazers if Lillard were to leave, but the team has shown that they have the talent and depth to compete in the league, and they would likely need to adapt and adjust to ensure continued success without Lillard.",
