But I can suggest a few options to help you get the weather forecast for your location:\n\n1. Check online weather websites: You can check websites like weather.com, accuweather.com, or wunderground.com for the latest weather forecast for your location. Simply enter your city or zip code, and you'll get the current weather conditions and forecast for the next few days.\n2. Use a weather app: You can download a weather app on your smartphone, such as Dark Sky or Weather Underground, which can provide you with hyperlocal weather forecasts, including sunrise and sunset times.\n3. Contact a local news station: You can also contact a local news station or newspaper in your area to ask about the weather forecast for Saturday morning. They may be able to provide you with more detailed information about the weather conditions and any potential weather advisories.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider the following tips for planning a successful sunrise photo shoot:\n\n* Plan to arrive at the location at least 30 minutes before sunrise to set up and get into position.\n* Bring warm clothing and layers, as it can be chilly in the early morning hours, especially near a lake.\n* Bring a flashlight or headlamp to help you navigate in the dark.\n* Don't forget to bring your camera, lenses, and any other necessary equipment.\n* Be prepared for changing weather conditions, and have a backup plan in case of bad weather.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a successful and enjoyable photo shoot!",
