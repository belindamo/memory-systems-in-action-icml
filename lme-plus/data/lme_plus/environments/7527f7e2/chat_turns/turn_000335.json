  "content": "In a Magic the Gathering \"mini\" set containing 30 new cards, the number of cards of each type will vary depending on the specific theme and mechanics of the set. Here is a rough estimate of the number of cards of each type that might be found in a \"mini\" set:\n\n* Creatures: 10-15\n* Instants: 5-10\n* Sorceries: 5-10\n* Enchantments: 5-10\n* Artifacts: 5-10\n* Planeswalkers: 1-5\n* Lands: 5-10\n\nIt's worth noting that these are just rough estimates, and the actual number of cards of each type in a \"mini\" set can vary widely. The proportions of the different card types may also vary depending on the specific themes and mechanics of the set.\n\nI hope this information helps to give you an idea of the number of cards of each type that might be found in a Magic the Gathering \"mini\" set. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
