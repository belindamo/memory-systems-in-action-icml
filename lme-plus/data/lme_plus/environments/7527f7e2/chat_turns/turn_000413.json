  "content": "Harlequin rasboras are wonderful additions to a community aquarium! Providing them with plenty of hiding places and visual barriers will help them feel secure and encourage them to swim and explore more. Considering your current setup, here are some decoration suggestions that might complement your aquarium and provide hiding spots for your rasboras:\n\n1. **Plants:** Add some dense, fast-growing plants like Java moss, Anacharis, or Water Wisteria. These will provide hiding places and create a sense of security for your rasboras. You can also use plants with longer stems like Vallisneria or Cabomba to create a \"forest\" effect.\n2. **Rock caves:** Add some rock formations or caves to create hiding places and visual barriers. You can use natural rocks or artificial decorations like ceramic or resin caves. Make sure they have multiple entrances and exits to prevent trapping your fish.\n3. **Driftwood:** Driftwood can add a natural, rustic touch to your aquarium and provide hiding places for your rasboras. You can arrange the wood to create tunnels, caves, or even a \"sunken ship\" effect.\n4. **Decorative bridges:** Add a decorative bridge or two to create hiding places and visual interest. These can be made of wood, stone, or ceramic and can be placed at different levels to create a sense of depth.\n5. **Ceramic ornaments:** Use ceramic ornaments like treasure chests, sunken ruins, or other decorative pieces to create hiding places and add visual interest. Make sure they have no sharp edges and are safe for your fish.\n6. **Tunnels and tubes:** Add some tunnel or tube decorations to create hiding places and swimming routes for your rasboras. These can be made of plastic, ceramic, or PVC pipes.\n7. **Moss-covered decorations:** Add decorations covered in moss or Anacharis to create a natural, lush look. These can be rocks, logs, or even decorative figurines.\n\nRemember to leave enough swimming space for your rasboras and avoid overcrowding the aquarium. Also, ensure that any new decorations are compatible with your aquarium's water parameters and are safe for your fish.\n\nBefore making any changes, take some time to observe your rasboras' behavior and see where they tend to congregate or hide. This will help you determine the best placement for new decorations. Have fun redecorating, and enjoy watching your rasboras thrive in their new environment!",
