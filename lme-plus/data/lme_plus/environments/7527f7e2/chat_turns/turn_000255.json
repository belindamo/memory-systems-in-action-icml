Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have a character limit, but I understand that you do.\n\nTo continue our conversation, I suggest we break it down into smaller topics or questions. You can ask me a specific question about Eid celebrations, and I'll do my best to provide a detailed response. This way, we can have a more focused conversation and avoid hitting the character limit.\n\nSome potential topics we could explore further include:\n\n1. Eid-al-Fitr traditions in Pakistan and India\n2. Eid-al-Adha customs and practices in both countries\n3. The significance of Eid in Pakistani and Indian cultures\n4. Traditional Eid foods and desserts in Pakistan and India\n5.
