I've started browsing online at stores like H&M and Uniqlo, and was surprised at how many stylish pieces I could find. I'm also considering canceling my subscription to a monthly beauty box, which was costing me $50 a month.

Instead, I've started buying beauty products at a discount store, where I can find similar products at a fraction of the cost.",
