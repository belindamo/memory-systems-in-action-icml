  "content": "The number of cards in a Magic the Gathering set can vary widely, depending on the type of set and the specific theme and mechanics being introduced.\n\nGenerally, a \"large\" set in a block will contain around 280-300 new cards, while a \"small\" set in a block will contain around 100-140 new cards. A \"core\" set will typically contain around 280-300 new and reprinted cards.\n\n\"Expansion\" sets, which are standalone sets released between blocks, will typically contain around 100-140 new cards.\n\n\"Special\" sets, such as \"Commander\" sets or \"Masterpiece\" sets, can vary widely in size, but are generally smaller than large or core sets.\n\nIt's worth noting that these numbers are just rough estimates, and the actual number of cards in a set can vary. Additionally, the total number of cards in a set will also include any reprints of previously released cards.\n\nI hope this information helps to give you an idea of the typical size of Magic the Gathering sets. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
