  "content": "A 25% weekly water change is a great maintenance routine, but considering the introduction of new fish, a larger water change this time might be beneficial. Here's why:\n\n1. **Reducing stress:** A larger water change can help dilute any stress hormones or toxins that may have built up in the tank, making the environment more comfortable for your fish.\n2. **Removing excess nutrients:** With the addition of new fish, you may have increased the biological load on your tank. A larger water change can help remove excess nutrients, waste products, and toxins that can contribute to algae growth or water quality issues.\n3. **Stabilizing water parameters:** A larger water change can help stabilize water parameters, such as pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels, which can fluctuate when introducing new fish.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider a few things before doing a larger water change:\n\n1. **Don't overdo it:** A sudden, drastic change in water volume or chemistry can be stressful for your fish. Aim for a 30-40% water change, but avoid doing more than 50% to prevent shocking your fish.\n2. **Match water parameters:** Make sure the replacement water is matched to your tank's water parameters, including temperature, pH, and hardness. You can use a water conditioner to remove chlorine, chloramines, and heavy metals from the tap water.\n3. **Monitor your fish:** Keep a close eye on your fish during and after the water change. If you notice any signs of stress or distress, such as rapid breathing, lethargy, or erratic swimming, you may need to slow down the water change or perform smaller, more frequent changes.\n\nTo do a larger water change safely:\n\n1. **Gradual change:** Perform the water change in stages, replacing 10-15% of the tank volume at a time, with 10-15 minute intervals in between. This will help your fish adjust to the changes.\n2. **Use a gravel vacuum:** Remove any debris and waste from the substrate using a gravel vacuum to prevent stirring up sediment and clouding the water.\n3. **Add water slowly:** When adding new water, do it slowly to prevent sudden changes in water flow or chemistry.\n\nBy doing a larger water change this time, you'll be helping to create a more stable and comfortable environment for your harlequin rasboras and neon tetras. Just remember to monitor your fish and adjust your water change strategy as needed.",
