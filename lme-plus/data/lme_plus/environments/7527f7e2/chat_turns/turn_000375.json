  "content": "There are a few reasons why a runner's heart rate may be lower than a non-runner's heart rate:\n\n1. Increased cardiovascular fitness: Regular running can improve cardiovascular fitness, which means the heart becomes more efficient at pumping blood and oxygen to the muscles. As a result, the heart doesn't have to work as hard to maintain a normal resting heart rate.\n2. Increased stroke volume: Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat. Running can increase stroke volume, which means the heart pumps more blood with each beat, so it doesn't have to beat as fast to deliver the necessary amount of oxygen to the muscles.\n3. Improved autonomic nervous system function: The autonomic nervous system regulates the body's automatic functions, such as heart rate. Running can improve the function of the autonomic nervous system, which may lead to a lower resting heart rate.\n4. Genetic factors: Some people naturally have lower resting heart rates than others, and this can be influenced by genetic factors. If a runner has a naturally low resting heart rate, their heart rate may be lower than a non-runner's even if they don't engage in regular physical activity.",
