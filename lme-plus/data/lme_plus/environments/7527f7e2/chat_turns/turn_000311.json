Sunrise times vary depending on your location, time zone, and time of year.\n\nBut you can easily find the sunrise time for your location online. Here are a few options:\n\n1. Google search: Simply type \"sunrise time [your city/state]\" or \"sunrise time [your zip code]\" in Google, and it will show you the sunrise time for your location.\n2. Weather websites: Many weather websites, such as weather.com or accuweather.com, provide sunrise and sunset times for specific locations.\n3. Sunrise/sunset apps: You can download apps like Sunrise Sunset Times or The Photographer's Ephemeris, which can provide you with sunrise and sunset times for your location.\n\nJust enter your location, and you'll get the sunrise time for Saturday.
