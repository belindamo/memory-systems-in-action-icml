  "content": "I'll try to write in my anxiety journal during my lunch break, right after my 30-minute walk and PMR session. This way, my thoughts and feelings will be fresh in my mind, and I can accurately record my anxiety levels and relaxation ratings. I'll also set a reminder on my phone to take progress photos every Sunday morning, so I can track my physical changes over time.\n\nBy doing it this way, I'll be able to establish a consistent routine and make tracking my progress a habit. I'm excited to see how this will help me understand my anxiety better and make adjustments to my strategy as needed.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there anything else I can do to make the most of my tracking methods?",
