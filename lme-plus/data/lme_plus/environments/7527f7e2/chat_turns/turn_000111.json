  "content": "Sure, instead of a hierarchy, we can represent the different grammatical units as layers in a \"layer cake\" model, where each layer is made up of the layers below it.\n\nAt the top level, we have Sentences, which are made up of Clauses (Independent and Dependent) and Phrases.\n\nThe next level down is made up of Phrases, which can be found in both clauses and independently in a sentence.\n\nThe next level down is made up of Words, which can be found in phrases, clauses and sentences.\n\nThe bottom level is made up of Letters, which make up words.\n\nAs for the separate layer cake for subject, predicate, object and complement, they can be considered as separate layers that can be added to the main layer cake. They are grammatical roles that can be assigned to different parts of the sentence, for example, subject can be a noun phrase, predicate can be a verb phrase, object can be a noun phrase and complement can be an adjective phrase.\n\nSo the main layer cake of Sentences, Clauses, Phrases, Words and letters can be modified by adding the layers of subject, predicate, object and complement to the different parts of the sentence, depending on the context and the language structure.\n\nI hope this helps in visualizing how the different grammatical units can be represented as layers in a \"layer cake\" model and how the different grammatical roles can be added to it.\nPlease let me know if you have any other question.",
