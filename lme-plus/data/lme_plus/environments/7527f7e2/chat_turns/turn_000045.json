  "content": "For the flower crown station, I think it would be lovely to provide a variety of flowers, greenery, and decorations for guests to choose from, allowing them to get creative and design their own unique crowns. This way, guests can express their personal style and preferences, and the activity becomes more interactive and engaging.\n\nHere are some suggestions for the types of flowers, greenery, and materials you could provide:\n\n* Fresh flowers: roses, carnations, daisies, baby's breath, and other flowers in pastel shades to match the vintage garden party theme\n* Greenery: eucalyptus, ferns, lemon leaves, and other foliage to add texture and depth to the crowns\n* Decorations: ribbons, lace, pearls, feathers, and other embellishments to add a touch of elegance and whimsy\n* Floral wire, floral tape, and scissors for guests to use to create their crowns\n\nTo make the activity more structured, you could also provide some pre-made flower crown bases or partial designs for guests to build upon. This would give them a starting point and help them feel more confident in their creative abilities.\n\nAs for the level of guidance, I think it would be helpful to have a designated person or two to assist guests at the flower crown station. This person could provide demonstrations, offer tips and advice, and help guests with any tricky parts of the process. However, it's also important to allow guests to have the freedom to create and experiment, so the guidance should be gentle and supportive rather than too prescriptive.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this sound like a good approach, or do you have any other ideas for the flower crown station?",
