  "content": "Yes, people with diabetes can still eat sweets, but in moderation and as part of a balanced meal plan.\n\nFoods high in sugar can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, so it's important to keep portion sizes small and limit how often you eat them. Here are some tips for including sweets in a diabetes-friendly diet:\n\n1. Choose sweets that are lower in sugar and fat, such as small portions of fresh fruit, sugar-free gelatin, or low-fat yogurt.\n\n2. Opt for baked or roasted sweets instead of fried or saut\u00e9ed options.\n\n3. Pair sweets with protein and fiber-rich foods, which can help slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. For example, enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate with some almonds or a small apple with a tablespoon of peanut butter.\n\n4. Consider sugar substitutes, such as stevia or monk fruit, instead of regular sugar, as they don't raise blood sugar levels as much.\n\nRemember, it's important to work closely with your healthcare team to develop a meal plan that meets your unique needs and fits with your diabetes management plan.",
