      "content": "factor in everything ive asked you and tell me if this letter is ok to show my tenancy agent my concerns and things id like to address during the inspection. I struggle to put my thoughts together in in-person conversations and often overlook sharing critical information due to anxiety.\nI have had concerns that I would like to bring up to the tenancy agency about the landlord's conduct regarding the speed and notice given for repairs. I have become aware over the last year that Venkatesh has developed some health problems and knowing this I have gone incredibly far out of my way to be patient with him regarding these repairs. I also have been fearful to bring up these concerns as I have not wanted to jeopardize our living situation by angering the landlord given that we are on a month-to-month lease. I have been living constantly in a situation where the landlord will contact me the day before asking for access to the property in various ways, meaning I often have to make myself and the house available and cancel plans and commitments. I am disabled, but I do have a life to live. Unfortunately, I have had to fight an uphill battle in getting 24 hours' notice or proper communication from the landlord. As a formally diagnosed Autistic individual registered with the NDIS this is starting to take a severe toll on my mental state, and even starting to take a toll on my physical body due to prolonged stress.\n\nRecently I was having a conversation with my next-door neighbor regarding a recent break-in that took place on their property. She raised genuine concern for me and asked if my landlord has been harassing me due to the fact he is at the property \u201cvery, very often without getting much done\u201d. This External validation of my existing concerns was enough for me to finally realize the toll the landlord's behavior has been taking on me. It was also the Catalyst in my writing of this. Being disabled has the propensity of skewing the way you see the world, I did not realize the scale of the issues until an unrelated person expressed the same concern. Due to my autism, and not wanting to be a difficult tenant, I walked a fine line between trying to make myself fully available and cooperative for repairs and being taken advantage of.\n\nThe landlord is on the property for long hours very frequently. He does not finish his jobs within a reasonable time and will often need to return multiple times per repair item (excluding the visit for assessing the initial repair). I feel as if I can not relax in my own home as he could message me at any point requesting access tomorrow. This has been going on since the initial report of the fault in the garage ceiling with various topics of repair. The garage issue which took more than a year for him to resolve left us without the use of an integral part of the house for a year directly after a rent increase. He has been in the process of repairing the retainers in the front yard and the back gate for over a month, he has been to the house well over 5 times for the front yard maintenance alone. He began this work with a contractor who has not returned and has been conducting the repairs solo since.\n \nOften the landlord will not ask if a certain time or date is suitable for his visit, he will instruct me when he will be here with no seeming choice on my end. Between this and the to-and-fro nature of his repairs, I have to cancel plans frequently to be home for maintenance as he will often need access to the power points in the garage. I am normally told when he will be coming the day before, often in the afternoon. I have asked him many many many times over text, over the phone, and in person that I need 24-hour notice. Only recently, after years of asking, has he begun to provide the proper notice and it is not completely consistent. Another issue I have been facing with the landlord's communication is he will often not update me if he is severely late or not coming at all until many hours after the initial time he said he would arrive. Due to the constant visits and frequent cancellations without proper communication, I struggle to be able to make plans as I do not know what I will have to cancel to accommodate the landlord. This is incredibly distressing to me as I am autistic and uncertainty is quite difficult to work around."
