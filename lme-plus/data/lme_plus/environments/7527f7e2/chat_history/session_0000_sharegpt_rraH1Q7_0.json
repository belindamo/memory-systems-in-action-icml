They are often responsible for managing online advertising campaigns, email marketing, social media, and other digital marketing channels.\n* Eko's software could be particularly useful for ecommerce marketers who want to create more engaging and interactive experiences for their customers. For example, interactive product demos, personalized product recommendations, and virtual try-ons could help to increase engagement and conversion rates.\n* However, ecommerce marketers may not have as much influence over the product development process or the overall user experience on the website.
