  "content": "The term \"theory\" in science has a different meaning than its colloquial usage. In science, a theory is a well-substantiated explanation for a set of phenomena that has been extensively tested and supported by a large body of evidence.\n\nEvolution is a scientific theory because it is an explanation of how living organisms have changed over time and how new species arise through a process of natural selection. The theory of evolution is supported by a vast amount of evidence from fields such as biology, genetics, paleontology, and geology. This evidence includes the fossil record, comparative anatomy and embryology, molecular biology, and observations of evolutionary changes in natural populations.\n\nWhile the theory of evolution has been supported by an overwhelming amount of evidence, it is not considered a fact in the same way that gravity is a fact. This is because the theory of evolution is constantly being refined and modified as new evidence is discovered. However, the fact that it is still considered a theory does not detract from its scientific validity or the strength of the evidence supporting it.",
