However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I can't provide a specific recommendation for a bike shop in your downtown area.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you find a good place to get your road bike serviced:\n\n1. **Online Search**: Type \"bike shops near me\" or \"road bike service near me\" in a search engine like Google, and it'll show you the nearest options along with their addresses, phone numbers, and reviews.\n2. **Yelp**: Check out Yelp, a review website that allows users to rate and review local businesses, including bike shops. You can filter the search by location, rating, and services offered.\n3. **Local Cycling Community**: Reach out to local cycling clubs, groups, or online forums and ask for recommendations. Cyclists often have strong opinions about good bike shops and mechanics.\n4. **Check with Local Bike Manufacturers**: If you have a specific brand of bike, you can visit their website and look for authorized dealers or service centers in your area.\n5. **Ask Around**: Ask friends, colleagues, or fellow cyclists for recommendations. Word of mouth is a great way to find a reliable and trustworthy bike shop.\n\nRemember to research and read reviews before choosing a bike shop to ensure you find a reputable and skilled mechanic to service your road bike.",
