  "content": "Despite the benefits of serverless computing, there are also some potential downsides to consider. One of the main concerns is the lack of control over the underlying infrastructure. With serverless computing, developers don't have direct access to the servers, so they can't tune performance or troubleshoot issues that require low-level access. Additionally, serverless computing can result in unpredictable costs. Although it can be more cost-effective for small to medium workloads, the pricing model can become less efficient for large-scale or long-running workloads. \n\nIn some cases, traditional server-based infrastructure may still be preferred over serverless. For example, applications that require low latency or a high level of control over the infrastructure should use traditional infrastructure. Also, applications that have large amounts of data, such as big data processing, may not be the best fit for serverless due to potential network and storage bottlenecks. \n\nUltimately, whether serverless or traditional infrastructure is the better choice depends on the specific requirements of the application and use case. Developers should carefully evaluate the tradeoffs and consider the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.",
