  "content": "It is difficult to predict when planet earth's markets will be ready for free energy disclosure. The readiness of markets to adopt new technology is influenced by a variety of factors, including the availability of funding, the level of public awareness and interest, and the level of competition in the marketplace. Additionally, the concept of free energy is not well defined, as it's not clear if it refers to energy that is literally free (i.e. without cost) or energy that is so cheap it's effectively free.\n\nA number of breakthroughs in energy technology have been made in recent years, and there is ongoing research and development in the field of renewable energy. However, the widespread adoption of these technologies is likely to be a gradual process that will be influenced by a variety of factors, including government policies, economic conditions, and technological advancements. It may take some time before the markets are ready for free energy disclosure, if it ever happens.",
