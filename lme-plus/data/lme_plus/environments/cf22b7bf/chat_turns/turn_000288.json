And thanks for the hydration tips! I'll make sure to drink plenty of water before and during my runs.\n\nBy the way, I was thinking about my progress so far, and I realized that I've been doing pretty well with my workouts and diet. I've lost 5 pounds in the past month, which is slow but steady progress. I'm hoping to continue this trend and reach my goal weight by the end of the summer. Do you have any tips on how to stay motivated and focused on my long-term goals?",
