  "content": "The \"game-changer\" comment is a great clue!\n\nWith that in mind, I'm going to take a guess that the movie might be \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" (2021).\n\nThis movie was a recent release, and it's been widely praised for its impact on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film's plot and ending have been described as \"game-changing\" by many fans and critics, as it sets up a new direction for the Spider-Man franchise and the MCU as a whole.\n\nThe movie also features Tom Holland's performance as Spider-Man, which has been widely praised, and the film's visual effects are stunning.\n\nDoes that sound like the movie you might be thinking of?\n\n(And if not, I can certainly keep trying to help you figure out which movie it might be!)",
