Neoprene is often preferred for its flexibility and breathability.\n* Thickness: Thicker pads offer more protection, but may be bulkier. Thinner pads provide less protection but are more flexible.\n* Style: Some knee pads have a sleeve design, while others have a strap-on or wraparound design.\n\nIt's essential to try on different brands and styles to find the one that fits and feels comfortable for you. You may also want to read reviews, ask for recommendations from teammates or coaches, or consult with a sports medicine professional for guidance.",
