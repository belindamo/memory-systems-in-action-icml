  "content": "I like the exercises you suggested, especially the Pallof Press and Bird Dog. I'll definitely add those to my routine. As for my 10K goal, I'm a complete beginner when it comes to running, but I've been doing a lot of cardio at the gym and I've been trying to incorporate more outdoor activities. I've been doing 30-minute walks during my lunch break, 3 times a week. I think I can dedicate about 4-5 hours a week to training. Can you help me create a more detailed training plan with specific workouts and distances? Also, by the way, I've been tracking my progress using a fitness app, and I've burned an average of 2500 calories per week, which is higher than my goal. I've also lost about 5 pounds in the past month, which is slow progress, but I'm okay with that.",
