  "content": "I'll start by creating a new sheet in Ulysses for my main character, the protagonist of my fantasy fiction piece, \"The Lost City\". I'll use headers and subheaders to organize the character's bio, appearance, skills, relationships, and quests. I'll also create a separate sheet for my antagonist and other key characters, and use Ulysses' linking feature to connect them and track their relationships. Additionally, I'll experiment with character development techniques like character interviews and journaling to get a deeper understanding of their motivations and personalities.",
