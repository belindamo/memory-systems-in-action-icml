I've been posting regularly for a while now, and I've seen some growth - I gained around 20 new followers in the first week of my campaign. I've noticed that my morning posts tend to get more engagement, so I'll make sure to post my videos during that time. Do you have any tips on how to create eye-catching thumbnails for my videos?",
