  "content": "Sure! One example of a use case where serverless computing would be an ideal choice is for web backend APIs. \n\nBackend APIs typically have unpredictable and varying workloads, which makes it difficult to predict the necessary server capacity for traditional server-based infrastructure. With serverless computing, however, resources are automatically scaled up and down based on usage, which means the API can handle traffic spikes without the need for manual capacity management. \n\nIn addition, serverless computing enables developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure, which can increase development speed and agility. \n\nOverall, serverless computing for backend APIs is a great way to empower developers to focus on writing code and delivering value to end-users rather than worrying about managing infrastructure.",
