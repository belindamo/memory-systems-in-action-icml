  "content": "Those are some great details to start with!\n\nUnfortunately, the fact that you saw it on a Saturday and had brunch with Emily the day before doesn't give me any specific clues about the movie itself. But the fact that it was a solo movie and light-hearted/funny is helpful!\n\nHere are a few questions to help narrow it down further:\n\n* Was the movie part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)? (e.g. Iron Man, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, etc.)\n* Do you remember which superhero or character was the main focus of the movie?\n* Was the movie a origin story (i.e. the character's first film), or was it a sequel?\n* Did the movie have any notable villains or plot points that you remember?\n\nAny additional details you can provide will help me try to figure out which Marvel movie you're thinking of!",
