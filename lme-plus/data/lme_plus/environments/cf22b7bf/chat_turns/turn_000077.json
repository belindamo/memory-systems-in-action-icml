  "content": "ShopRite Price Plus loyalty program!\n\n**AwardWallet**: Unfortunately, AwardWallet does not support tracking ShopRite Price Plus loyalty program. As I mentioned earlier, AwardWallet's primary focus is on travel-related loyalty programs, and they don't have integrations with retail loyalty programs like ShopRite.\n\n**LoyaltyLion**: Unfortunately, LoyaltyLion also does not support tracking ShopRite Price Plus loyalty program. While they do offer support for some retail loyalty programs, ShopRite is not currently one of them.\n\nIt seems that neither AwardWallet nor LoyaltyLion currently supports tracking ShopRite Price Plus loyalty program. However, there are a few alternatives you could consider:\n\n1. **ShopRite's mobile app**: You can use ShopRite's own mobile app to track your Price Plus loyalty program points, digital coupons, and sales.\n2. **Fetch Rewards**: Fetch Rewards is a mobile app that allows you to link your ShopRite loyalty card and earn points on your purchases. You can also track your points and redeem rewards within the app.\n3. **Spreadsheets or notes**: You can create a spreadsheet or use a notes app to manually track your ShopRite Price Plus points and rewards. This might not be as convenient, but it's a low-tech solution that can still help you stay organized.\n\nKeep in mind that loyalty program tracking apps and tools are constantly evolving, so it's possible that AwardWallet or LoyaltyLion might add support for ShopRite Price Plus in the future.",
