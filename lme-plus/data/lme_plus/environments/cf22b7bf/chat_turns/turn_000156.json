  "content": "Yes, it's true that clinking glasses or drinking before toasting is considered impolite in the Czech Republic. When toasting, it's customary to wait until everyone at the table has a full glass before clinking glasses and taking a sip. This is a sign of respect and shows that you are acknowledging the presence of the other person. It's also considered bad luck to not make eye contact when clinking glasses - this is known as a \"curse\" and can result in seven years of bad sex.\n\nWhen clinking glasses in the Czech Republic, it's important to look the person you're toasting with in the eye and clink the bottom of your glass against theirs. It's also common to say \"Na zdrav\u00ed!\" (pronounced \"naz-drah-vee\"), which means \"to your health!\" or \"Cheers!\"\n\nIf you're not sure about the customs and protocols for clinking glasses or toasting in a particular situation, it's always a good idea to observe what others are doing and follow their lead.",
