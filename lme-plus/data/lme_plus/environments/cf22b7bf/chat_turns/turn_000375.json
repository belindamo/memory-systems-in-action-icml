  "content": "In Flang, the phrase \"The house's dog\" would be translated as \"Fashi flom\".\n\nTo break it down:\n- \"fashi\" is the inflected form of the word \"fash\" (house) in the genitive case\n- \"flom\" is the word for \"dog\" in Flang\n- When a noun is used in the genitive case, it doesn't change its form in Flang.\n\nSo, when we put it all together, we get \"Fashi flom\" which means \"The house's dog\" in Flang. I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions or requests.",
