Hold a cable or resistance band and press it away from your body, keeping your core muscles engaged.\n2. **Side Plank Variations**: Add some variety to your traditional side plank by lifting your top leg, arm, or using a weight.\n3. **Russian twists**: A classic exercise that targets your obliques. Use a weight or medicine ball and twist your torso, touching the weight to the ground beside you.\n4. **Bird Dog**: Strengthens your core, glutes, and hamstrings. Start on all fours, then lift your right arm and left leg off the ground, holding for a few seconds before switching sides.\n\n**Legs:**\n\n1. **Step-ups**: Targets your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Use a bench, stair, or step, and alternate legs.\n2. **Lunges with a twist**: Add a twist to your traditional lunge by rotating your torso as you lower into the lunge.\n3. **Calf raises on a step**: Targets your calf muscles. Stand on a step or platform, raise up onto your toes, and then lower back down.\n4. **Glute bridges**: Strengthens your glutes and hamstrings. Lie on your back, lift your hips up towards the ceiling, and then lower back down.\n\n**10K Goal:**\n\nTo determine if your goal of running a 10K by the end of summer is realistic, let's consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Current fitness level**: What's your current running experience and fitness level? Are you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced runner?\n2. **Current running routine**: How often do you currently run, and what's your typical distance and pace?\n3. **Training time**: How much time can you dedicate to training each week?\n4. **Summer timeline**: When exactly do you want to run the 10K, and how many weeks do you have to train?\n\nAssuming you're a beginner or intermediate runner, a general rule of thumb is to increase your weekly mileage by no more than 10% each week to allow for adaptation and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nIf you're new to running, it's recommended to start with shorter distances (3-5K) and gradually build up to longer distances. A 10K might be a challenging goal, but it's achievable with consistent training and dedication.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of a 12-week training plan to help you reach your goal:\n\n* Weeks 1-4: Build up to running 3-4 times a week, with one longer run (5-6K) on the weekends.\n* Weeks 5-8: Increase your weekly mileage by 10% each week, with one longer run (7-8K) on the weekends.\n* Weeks 9-12: Continue to increase your weekly mileage, with one longer run (9-10K) on the weekends.\n\nRemember to also incorporate rest days, cross-training, and proper nutrition to support your training.\n\nI hope this helps!
