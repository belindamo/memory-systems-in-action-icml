  "content": "While there is no evidence of direct contact between the two civilizations, there are some similarities between the Maya and Inca cultures that suggest indirect contact or shared influences. For example, both civilizations practiced terrace farming, developed a sophisticated astronomer, and built impressive architectural structures. Both civilizations also developed their own systems of writing and had a great admiration for gold and other precious metals. However, it is believed that these similarities are the result of independent innovation rather than direct contact. It is important to note that the Maya civilization reached its height in the period between 250 and 900 CE, while the Inca civilization emerged much later, during the 15th century, in what is now Peru.",
