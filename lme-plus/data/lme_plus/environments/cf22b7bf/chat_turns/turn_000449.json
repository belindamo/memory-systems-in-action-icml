  "content": "You are correct in pointing out that my previous statement, \"Baptism is an outward expression of an inward faith,\" is not a direct quote from the New Testament. I apologize for any confusion that may have caused.\n\nTo clarify, baptism is indeed a crucial step in receiving salvation and becoming a Christian, as taught in the New Testament. It is a public declaration of one's faith in Jesus Christ and signifies a new life in Him.\n\nFor example, in Acts 2:38, Peter tells the crowd, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\" The order of repentance, baptism, and receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit is clear in this passage.\n\nIn Acts 8:36-38, we see the story of the Ethiopian eunuch who hears the gospel message and asks to be baptized immediately. Philip responds, \"If you believe with all your heart, you may.\" The eunuch responds, \"I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,\" and he is baptized.\n\nIn Acts 22:16, when Paul is recounting his own conversion story, he says, \"And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.\"\n\nTherefore, it is clear from the examples in the New Testament that baptism is an essential part of the process of receiving salvation and becoming a Christian, along with repentance, confession of faith, and belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior.",
