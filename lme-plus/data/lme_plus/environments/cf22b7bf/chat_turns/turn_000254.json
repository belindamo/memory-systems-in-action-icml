Tighten your abdominal muscles and buttock muscles, and press your lower back into the floor. Hold this position for a few seconds, and then release. 2. Superman: Lie on your stomach with your arms and legs extended. Lift your arms and legs off the ground simultaneously, hold for a few seconds, and then lower back to the starting position. 3. Bridges: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lift your hips off the ground until your knees, hips, and shoulders are in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds, and then lower back down. 4. Cat and Cow stretch: Start on your hands and knees, with your wrists directly under your shoulders and knees under hips. Arch your back up towards the ceiling, and then lower it down towards the floor. 5. Quadruped arm and leg raise: Start on your hands and knees. Lift one arm and the opposite leg off the ground, and hold for a few seconds. Lower back down and repeat on the other side. These exercises can help strengthen your lower back muscles, which can reduce pain and improve posture. As always, if you experience any pain or discomfort during these exercises, stop and consult with a healthcare provider.",
