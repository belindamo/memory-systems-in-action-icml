  "content": "Pregnant women can get a mammogram if it is necessary for diagnosing breast cancer or other breast problems. However, routine mammograms are generally not recommended during pregnancy because of the risk of radiation exposure to the developing fetus.\n\nMammograms use low-dose X-rays to produce images of the breast tissue, and the radiation from the mammogram can potentially harm the fetus. Although the risk of harm is minimal, it is still recommended to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure during pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, mammograms are less effective for detecting breast cancer in pregnant women due to the increased density and changes in the breast tissue during pregnancy. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often preferred for diagnostic imaging in pregnant women as they do not use radiation and are more effective for visualizing breast tissue changes.\n\nOverall, mammograms can be effective for detecting breast cancer in women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding. However, due to the risks associated with radiation exposure during pregnancy, other diagnostic imaging techniques may be used for pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.",
