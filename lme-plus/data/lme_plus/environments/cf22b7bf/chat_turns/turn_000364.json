  "content": "Karl Marx and his ideas were certainly an important influence on the Frankfurt School. The founders of the Frankfurt School, Carl Gr\u00fcnberg and Felix Weil, were inspired by the Marxist tradition and wanted to create a research center that would apply Marxist theory to the study of contemporary society. They sought to understand how capitalist societies produce and maintain inequality and oppression and how traditional forms of Marxism were no longer sufficient in understanding the complexities of capitalist societies. Therefore, they developed a more interdisciplinary approach that included psychology, sociology, philosophy, and other fields in their analysis and added a greater emphasis on the role of culture and ideology in shaping society, and the ways in which individuals internalize and resist these ideologies.\n\nIn summary, Karl Marx and his ideas were an important influence on the Frankfurt School, but the Frankfurt School expanded on these ideas by adding a more interdisciplinary approach and emphasizing the role of culture and ideology in shaping society, and the ways in which individuals internalize and resist these ideologies.",
