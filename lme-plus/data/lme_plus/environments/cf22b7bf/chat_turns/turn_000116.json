  "content": "No, you don't have to be an expert yogi to practice these poses. Yoga is for everyone, and you can modify the poses to fit your own level of flexibility and comfort. That's why it's important to focus on your own body and listen to what it needs, instead of trying to mimic what others are doing. \n\nFor example, in Child's Pose, you can use a bolster or a pillow under your chest or forehead if you can't touch the ground. In Eagle Pose, you can start by wrapping your arms around your body instead of crossing them over each other if you can't reach your shoulders. And in Cat-Cow Pose, you can make smaller movements with your spine if you find it difficult to arch or round your back.\n\nOver time and with regular practice, you may find that your flexibility improves, and you're able to move deeper into the poses. But remember, yoga is not about achieving a perfect pose, it's about being present in the moment and connecting with your body and breath. So, be patient with yourself and focus on what feels good for you.",
