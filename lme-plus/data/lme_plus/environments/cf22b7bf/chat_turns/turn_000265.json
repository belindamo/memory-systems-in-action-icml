He was known for his relentless work ethic and his willingness to push himself to be the best.\",\n    \"CLUTCH PERFORMANCES: Jordan was famous for his ability to perform under pressure, and he had a knack for making clutch shots and game-winning plays when it mattered most.\",\n    \"CHAMPIONSHIP SUCCESS: Jordan won six NBA championships over the course of his career, which is an impressive feat that few other players have matched.\",\n    \"CULTURAL IMPACT: Jordan's impact on basketball and popular culture was enormous, and his success helped to elevate the sport and make it more popular around the world.\"\n]\n\nlebron_points = [\n    \"Skill and athleticism: LeBron is a highly skilled player with exceptional athleticism, which allows him to make incredible moves and score points in a variety of ways.\",\n    \"Competitive drive: LeBron has an intense competitive drive and a desire to win that is unmatched by many of his peers. He is known for his relentless work ethic and his willingness to push himself to be the best.\",\n    \"Clutch performances: LeBron has a knack for performing under pressure and making crucial plays in key moments.\",\n    \"Championship success: LeBron has won four NBA championships over the course of his career and has been a key contributor on multiple championship teams.\",\n    \"Cultural impact: LeBron has had a significant impact on basketball and popular culture, using his platform to advocate for social justice causes and inspire others to make a positive difference in the world.\"\n]\n\nfor i, point in enumerate(jordan_points + lebron_points):\n    if i < len(jordan_points):\n        print('\\033[31m' + point.upper() + '\\033[0m')\n    else:\n        print('\\033[33m' + point.lower() + '\\033[0m')\n```\nThis code first defines two lists of points, one for Jordan and one for LeBron. It then iterates over the combined list of points and prints each one in the appropriate color and style. Jordan's points are printed in all caps and red, while LeBron's points are printed in lowercase and yellow.",
