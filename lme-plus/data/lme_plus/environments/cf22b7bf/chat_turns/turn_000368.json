  "content": "The Frankfurt School existed during World War II, and many of its members were forced to flee Germany because of their Jewish heritage and their opposition to the Nazi regime. Some members, such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Erich Fromm, were able to flee to the United States, where they continued their work and their critiques of capitalist societies. Others, such as Herbert Marcuse, were able to emigrate to other countries.\n\nDuring World War II, the Frankfurt School scholars had a complex relationship with the Nazi regime, they were deeply critical of the ideology and the tactics of the Nazi regime, but they also recognized that the rise of fascism was rooted in the failure of liberal democracy and the economic crisis of the 1930s. They saw the Nazi regime as a reaction to the failures of capitalist societies and the weakness of the working-class movement.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas, one of the most famous student of the Frankfurt School, was not yet born during WWII, he was born in 1929. He is considered one of the most important German philosophers of the 20th century, he continued the Frankfurt School tradition of critical theory and developed his own ideas on communicative action and the public sphere. He is still alive and active, though retired, and continues to write and publish.",
