After the event, I'll focus on static stretches to help with recovery.\n\nBut anyway, back to tennis... I've been thinking about my match against Sarah, the college student who beat me in the quarterfinals. She had a really strong serve, and I struggled to return it effectively. I've been working on my return game since then, trying to improve my reaction time and footwork. Do you have any tips on how to return a strong serve?",
