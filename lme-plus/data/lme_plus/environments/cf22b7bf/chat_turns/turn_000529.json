Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n2. **Bicycle Crunches**: Lie on your back with hands behind your head, alternate bringing your elbow to the opposite knee, as if pedaling a bicycle. Focus on engaging your core and avoiding using your neck or shoulders.\n3. **Pallof Press**: Hold a resistance band or cable handle with both hands, keeping your arms straight. Press the handle away from your body, keeping your core engaged, and then return to the starting position. Repeat for 12-15 reps.\n4. **Side Plank (each side)**: Lie on your side with feet stacked, hands under your shoulders, and engage your core.

Lower back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n8. **Kettlebell Swings**: Hold a kettlebell with both hands, swing it back between your legs, and then up to chest height, using your hips and core to generate power. Repeat for 12-15 reps.\n9. **Flutter Kicks**: Lie on your back with arms extended overhead, legs straight, and engage your core.

Repeat for 12-15 reps on each side.\n\nRemember to start with lower reps and sets, and gradually increase the difficulty as your core strength improves. It's also essential to focus on proper form and engagement of your core muscles to avoid injury.\n\nIncorporate these exercises into your routine 2-3 times a week, and remember to warm up before starting any workout.
