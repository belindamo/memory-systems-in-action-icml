  "content": "With that information, I can make an educated estimate.\n\nA British Shorthair is a medium-sized breed, and a 2-year-old cat is considered an adult. Assuming Luna is at a healthy weight, her daily caloric needs are likely around 250-300 calories per day.\n\nSince you fill her bowl twice a day, let's assume each filling is around 1-1.5 cups of food (a rough estimate, as cat food densities vary). This would put her daily food intake at around 2-3 cups per day.\n\nNow, let's convert the 2kg packets to cups. A 2kg packet is approximately equal to 8-10 cups of food (depending on the density of the kibble). With 12 packets, you have a total of:\n\n12 packets x 9 cups/packet (avg.) = 108 cups of food\n\nBased on Luna's estimated daily intake, the 108 cups of food should last around:\n\n108 cups \u00f7 2.5 cups/day (avg.) = 43-45 days\n\nSo, the 12 packets of Whiskas food should last Luna around 43-45 days, assuming her appetite and activity level remain consistent.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an estimate, and the actual duration may vary depending on several factors, such as changes in Luna's appetite, activity level, or environmental factors. You can always adjust the calculation as needed based on your observations.\n\nHow does that sound?",
