  "content": "Sephora Beauty Insider points!\n\n**AwardWallet**: Unfortunately, AwardWallet does not currently support tracking Sephora Beauty Insider points. Their primary focus is on travel-related loyalty programs, and they don't have Sephora's program integrated into their system.\n\n**LoyaltyLion**: Good news! LoyaltyLion does support tracking Sephora Beauty Insider points! You can add your Sephora Beauty Insider account to LoyaltyLion and track your points, rewards, and expiration dates. LoyaltyLion has partnered with Sephora to offer this integration, making it a great option for beauty enthusiasts.\n\nIf tracking your Sephora Beauty Insider points is a top priority, LoyaltyLion might be the better choice for you. However, if you're primarily focused on travel-related loyalty programs, AwardWallet might still be a great option, and you could consider using a separate tool or spreadsheet to track your Sephora points.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check with both AwardWallet and LoyaltyLion for any updates on their supported programs, as they may add new integrations over time.",
