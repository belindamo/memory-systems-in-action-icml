  "content": "It's perfectly fine to start with doing these exercises once a day, especially if you're not used to regular exercise. You can aim for 10-15 repetitions of each exercise, depending on your comfort level. It's also important to listen to your body and not push too hard if you feel any pain or discomfort. However, if you find that you have extra time during the day, it can be beneficial to do these exercises multiple times throughout the day. For example, you can do a few repetitions of pelvic tilts or bridges during a break from work or before bed. Building healthy habits takes time, so don't worry if you're not able to do it all at once. Gradually incorporating these exercises into your daily routine can still provide benefits.",
