While Marx's ideas focused primarily on the economic and class structures of society, and the ways in which these structures produced and maintained inequality and oppression, the Frankfurt School expanded on these ideas by adding an interdisciplinary approach that included psychology, sociology, philosophy, and other fields in their analysis. They also placed a greater emphasis on the role of culture and ideology in shaping society, and the ways in which individuals internalize and resist these ideologies. Additionally, they emphasized the need for self-reflection and self-criticism, and the idea that individuals had the power to change society.\n\nIn summary, the Frankfurt School's approach was more nuanced, interdisciplinary and took into account more subtle complexities than Karl Marx's, which focused on broader themes of economic and class structures and the ways in which these structures produce and maintain inequality and oppression.",
