  "content": "I think my tennis training has definitely helped with my overall cardiovascular endurance, which should benefit my cycling. Plus, the explosive power I've developed in my legs from sprinting around the court should translate well to generating power on the bike. Speaking of which, I'm actually getting excited for the cycling event this weekend. It'll be a fun change of pace from the tennis court. Oh, and I almost forgot - I played in a local tennis tournament three Sundays ago, where I lost in the quarterfinals to a tough opponent, but it was a great experience nonetheless.",
