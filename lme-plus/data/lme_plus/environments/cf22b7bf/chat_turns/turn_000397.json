Here's why:\n\n* **Food intake tracking**: Monitoring Luna's food intake can help you:\n\t+ Ensure she's eating the right amount for her age, weight, and activity level.\n\t+ Identify any changes in her appetite, which could indicate underlying health issues.\n\t+ Adjust her food portions or switch to a different food type if needed.\n* **Waste output tracking**: Monitoring Luna's waste output can help you:\n\t+ Identify potential digestive issues, such as constipation or diarrhea.\n\t+ Detect changes in her stool quality, which could indicate gastrointestinal problems.\n\t+ Monitor her litter box behavior, which can be an indicator of overall health and happiness.\n\nBy tracking these aspects, you'll gain a more comprehensive understanding of Luna's health and be able to:\n\n* Identify potential health issues earlier, allowing for prompt veterinary care.\n* Make informed decisions about her diet, exercise, and lifestyle.\n* Improve her overall quality of life and strengthen your bond with her.\n\nBoth Petnet and PetMD allow you to track food intake and waste output, so you can log this data alongside her water intake. This will give you a more complete picture of Luna's health and help you make data-driven decisions.\n\nRemember to be consistent in your tracking, and don't hesitate to reach out to your veterinarian if you notice any unusual patterns or changes in Luna's behavior.\n\nHow do you feel about tracking Luna's food intake and waste output? Are you ready to take your pet parenting to the next level?",
