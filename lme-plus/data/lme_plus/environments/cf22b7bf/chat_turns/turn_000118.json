  "content": "Serverless computing is an execution model where the cloud infrastructure (i.e., the server) automates the allocation and provisioning of compute resources as needed by the application being hosted. This means developers are freed from the responsibility of managing servers, infrastructure, and operating systems. Instead, they can focus on writing and deploying code for their applications. \n\nIn traditional server-based infrastructure, developers are responsible for managing the servers required to host their application code, which requires them to manage the infrastructure, operating systems, and runtime environments. \n\nServerless computing doesn't eliminate servers entirely, but it changes how computing resources are managed and allocated. With serverless, developers upload code and the cloud platform takes care of providing the necessary resources and scaling them automatically, based on the workload. This makes it easier to scale and deploy applications, maximizing resource utilization and minimizing cost.",
