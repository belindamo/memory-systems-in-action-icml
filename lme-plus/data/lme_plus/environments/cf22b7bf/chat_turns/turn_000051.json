How do they change, grow, or learn from their experiences? What challenges do they overcome, and what do they discover about themselves?\n5. **Character Interactions:** Write scenes or dialogue exchanges between characters to explore their relationships, dynamics, and conflicts. This can help you develop their voices, mannerisms, and interactions.\n\n**Hybrid Exercises:**\n\n1. **A Day in the Life:** Write a scene or vignette showcasing a typical day in the life of a character in the Lost City.
