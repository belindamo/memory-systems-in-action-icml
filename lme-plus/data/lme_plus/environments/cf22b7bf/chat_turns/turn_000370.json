  "content": "Frank Gehry, the architect, was born in 1929, the same year as J\u00fcrgen Habermas. He is Jewish and was raised in Toronto, Canada. He did not live in Germany during World War II, so it is not clear what his thoughts on the war would have been.\n\nRegarding Habermas' idea about people sitting around a table and eventually agreeing on something, it is a concept that he developed as a part of his theory of communicative action. He argues that if people engage in a rational and open-ended dialogue, they will be able to reach a mutual understanding and agreement. He believes that this process is the key to resolving conflicts and reaching a just and democratic society.\n\nThe Frankfurt School scholars saw the rise of fascism as the failure of liberal democracy to address the economic and social crisis of the 1930s and the weakness of the working-class movement. They argued that the traditional liberal democracy failed to address the needs of the working class and that the capitalist societies were unable to provide for the basic needs of the population, this led to the rise of fascist movements that promised to solve these problems.\n\nHerbert Marcuse, a student of the Frankfurt School, was able to emigrate to the United States during WWII, he became a professor at several universities and continued to write and publish, influencing the counterculture and student movements of the 1960s.\n\nIn summary, Frank Gehry, the architect, was born in 1929, the same year as J\u00fcrgen Habermas, and he was raised in Canada, so it is not clear what his thoughts on World War II would have been.
