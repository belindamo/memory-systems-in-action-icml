  "content": "General Electric has a large portfolio of products and services within the energy industry, and as a result, it can be challenging to balance investing in new technology while maintaining its existing product lines. However, GE uses several strategies to address this challenge:\n\n1. Portfolio Analysis: General Electric uses portfolio analysis to identify its most promising products and services and focus its resources on those that have the greatest potential for long-term growth. This approach enables GE to prioritize its new technology investments and ensure that they align with its overall strategic goals.\n\n2. Incremental Innovations: In addition to investing in new, groundbreaking technologies, GE also engages in incremental innovation to improve its existing product lines. This approach involves making small changes to existing products to improve their functionality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n3. Customer Needs: GE is also focused on meeting its customers' needs, and it invests in new technology based on customer demand. Through customer feedback and experience, GE can determine where technological improvements are most needed and allocate resources toward meeting those needs.\n\n4. Strategic Partnerships: GE also forms strategic partnerships with other companies to develop new technologies and products that can complement and enhance its existing product lines. Such partnerships can help GE bring new innovations to market faster, while also reducing research and development costs.\n\nOverall, GE balances investing in new technology with maintaining its existing product lines by focusing on portfolio analysis, incremental innovations, customer needs, and strategic partnerships. These approaches enable GE to adapt to the changing industry while still meeting the needs of its customers and maintaining its position as a leading player in the energy industry.",
