  "content": "Yes, it is possible for shows to be globally successful without catering to every culture's values and beliefs. While it can be helpful for shows to be sensitive to cultural nuances and differences, it is not a requirement for global success.\n\nWhat's more important than catering to every culture's values and beliefs is a show's ability to tell a compelling story and create characters that people can relate to and care about. If a show has these elements, it has a better chance of resonating with audiences across cultures and languages.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some cultural sensitivities are important to keep in mind in order to avoid causing offense or controversy. In cases where a show may touch on sensitive topics or portray certain cultures or beliefs, it's important to handle these issues with care and respect.",
