  "content": "In Flang, the phrase \"The dog's house\" would be translated as \"Flomi fashi\".\n\nTo break it down:\n- \"flomi\" is the inflected form of the word \"flom\" (dog) in the genitive case\n- \"fashi\" is the inflected form of the word \"fash\" (house) in the genitive case\n\nSo, when we put it all together, we get \"Flomi fashi\" which means \"The dog's house\" in Flang. I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions or requests.",
