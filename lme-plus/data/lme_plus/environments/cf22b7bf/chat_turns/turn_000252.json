Use an ergonomic chair: An ergonomic chair provides better support for your back and reduces the chance of lower back pain. If you don\u2019t have an ergonomic chair, use a cushion to support your back.\n\n3. Support your feet: Place your feet flat on the ground or use a footrest to prevent your legs from dangling, which can cause discomfort and poor posture.\n\n4. Take breaks: Regularly get up and walk around for a few minutes to stretch out your muscles and give your back a break.\n\n5. Exercise: Exercise regularly to strengthen your core and back muscles, which can prevent back pain and improve posture.\n\n6.
