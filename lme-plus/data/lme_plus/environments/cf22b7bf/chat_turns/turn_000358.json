  "content": "Karl Marx lived from 1818 to 1883, he developed his ideas during the mid-19th century. The Frankfurt School, which began in the 1920s, was developed about 40 years after Marx's death.\n\nThe Frankfurt School was considered radical for its time, even though Marxism had already shown that inequalities come from structures of power, because they added a new layer of analysis to the understanding of society. They emphasized the need to critically examine and challenge the societal structures of power and domination, which was not a common perspective at the time. They also emphasized the need for self-reflection and self-criticism, and the idea that individuals had the power to change society. They sought to understand how individuals internalize the dominant ideologies and how these ideologies can be challenged. They also sought to understand how individuals may resist oppression and work towards social change.\n\nFoucault, on the other hand, defined power as a set of relations that exist between individuals, groups, and institutions. He argues that power is not held by one single group or individual, but is instead pervasive and operates throughout society. He also argues that power is not just repressive, it is also productive, it creates new forms of knowledge and ways of understanding the world, it shapes our desires and beliefs, and it is not just negative but also positive. Power is not just something that is held by those in positions of authority, but is also present in the everyday interactions and relations. It's a force that shapes our behaviors, beliefs, and desires, and not just something that is held by those in positions of authority.",
