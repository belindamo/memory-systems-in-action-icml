      "content": "Both AwardWallet and LoyaltyLion primarily focus on travel-related loyalty programs, but they do offer some support for non-travel loyalty programs.\n\n**AwardWallet**:\n\n* AwardWallet does track some non-travel loyalty programs, but the selection is limited. They currently support around 20-30 non-travel programs, including:\n\t+ Retail loyalty programs: Walgreens Balance Rewards, CVS ExtraCare, Rite Aid wellness+, and more\n\t+ Dining loyalty programs: Starbucks Rewards, Panera Rewards, and a few others\n\t+ Credit card rewards: Some credit card programs, like Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards\n* However, AwardWallet's primary focus remains on travel-related loyalty programs, and their non-travel program selection is not as extensive as their travel program offerings.\n\n**LoyaltyLion**:\n\n* LoyaltyLion has a more extensive list of supported non-travel loyalty programs, with over 100 programs tracked, including:\n\t+ Retail loyalty programs: Target RedCard, Walgreens Balance Rewards, CVS ExtraCare, and many more\n\t+ Dining loyalty programs: Starbucks Rewards, Panera Rewards, Dunkin' Rewards, and others\n\t+ Credit card rewards: Some credit card programs, like Chase Freedom and Discover Cashback\n\t+ Other loyalty programs: Grocery store loyalty programs, pet store loyalty programs, and more\n* LoyaltyLion's non-travel program selection is more comprehensive than AwardWallet's, but still, their primary focus is on travel-related loyalty programs.\n\nIf you have a large number of non-travel loyalty programs, you might consider using a dedicated loyalty program tracker that focuses on retail and dining loyalty programs. Some popular options include:\n\n* **Fetch Rewards**: A mobile app that tracks and rewards your purchases at various retailers, including grocery stores, gas stations, and restaurants.\n* **Drop**: A mobile app that links to your credit or debit card and rewards you with points for purchases at certain retailers, including coffee shops, restaurants, and more.\n* **Dosh**: A mobile app that offers cashback rewards at various retailers, restaurants, and hotels.\n\nKeep in mind that these apps might not offer the same level of integration and tracking as AwardWallet or LoyaltyLion, but they can still help you manage and optimize your non-travel loyalty programs."
