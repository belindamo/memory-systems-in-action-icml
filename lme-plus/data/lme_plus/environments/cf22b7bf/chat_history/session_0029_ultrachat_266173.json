      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "While neck stiffness may seem like a small issue, it can be a sign of an underlying problem that requires medical attention, such as a cervical spine injury or a nerve disorder. \n\nIf left untreated, neck stiffness can lead to chronic pain, limited mobility or even nerve damage. In addition, neck stiffness may also be accompanied by other symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and fatigue, which could indicate a more serious medical condition.\n\nTherefore, it's always best to seek medical attention if you are experiencing neck stiffness that persists despite trying self-care techniques. Early intervention can help prevent the condition from worsening and improve your overall quality of life. Remember, your health is a priority, and proactive care can help maintain your well-being in the long run."
