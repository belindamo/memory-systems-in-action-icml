    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "When starting out with Celeste speedrunning, I'd recommend focusing on the Any% route first. Here's why:\n\n1. **Easier to learn**: The Any% route is generally considered easier to learn, as it involves exploiting glitches and optimized movement to reach the final screen as quickly as possible. This route has fewer requirements and is more forgiving than the 100% route.\n2. **Faster progress**: Learning the Any% route will help you improve your overall movement and execution skills, which will translate to faster times in the long run. You'll be able to see progress and improvements more quickly, which can be motivating and help you stay engaged.\n3. **Builds foundation**: Mastering the Any% route will give you a solid foundation in Celeste's mechanics, movement, and optimization techniques. This will make it easier to learn the 100% route later on, as you'll already have a good understanding of the game's fundamentals.\n4. **Community resources**: The Celeste speedrunning community has a wealth of resources and guides focused on the Any% route, making it easier to find tutorials, tutorials, and practice materials.\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the Any% route, you can start exploring the 100% route, which involves collecting every collectible and achieving 100% completion. The 100% route is more challenging and requires a deeper understanding of the game's mechanics, but it's a great way to further improve your skills and knowledge of Celeste.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of learning and improving!"
