Remove the laces from your shoes.\n2. Soak the laces in warm water with a small amount of mild soap or detergent.\n3. Gently agitate the laces to work the soap into a lather.\n4. Rinse the laces thoroughly with clean water to remove all soap residue.\n5. Gently squeeze out excess water without wringing or twisting the laces.\n6. Lay the laces flat to air dry, away from direct sunlight.\n\nTips:\n\n* Avoid using harsh chemicals, bleach, or hot water, as they can damage the laces.\n* If your laces have a lot of stubborn stains, you can use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently scrub them.\n* Consider using a lace cleaning solution or a sports detergent specifically designed for washing athletic gear.\n\nBy hand washing your laces, you'll be able to keep them clean, fresh, and in good condition."
