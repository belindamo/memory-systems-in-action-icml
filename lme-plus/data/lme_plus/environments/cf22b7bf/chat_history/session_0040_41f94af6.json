For example:\n\n* Was it part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) or an X-Men movie?\n* Was it a solo movie or a team-up film?\n* Do you remember any specific characters, actors, or actresses in the movie?\n* Was it a light-hearted, humorous movie or a more serious, dramatic one?\n* Do you recall any memorable scenes, plot points, or action sequences from the movie?\n* Was it a recent release (like in the past year or two) or a bit older?\n\nAny details you can provide will help me try to identify which Marvel movie you're thinking of!"

      "content": "Those are some great details to start with!\n\nUnfortunately, the fact that you saw it on a Saturday and had brunch with Emily the day before doesn't give me any specific clues about the movie itself. But the fact that it was a solo movie and light-hearted/funny is helpful!\n\nHere are a few questions to help narrow it down further:\n\n* Was the movie part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)? (e.g. Iron Man, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, etc.)\n* Do you remember which superhero or character was the main focus of the movie?\n* Was the movie a origin story (i.e. the character's first film), or was it a sequel?\n* Did the movie have any notable villains or plot points that you remember?\n\nAny additional details you can provide will help me try to figure out which Marvel movie you're thinking of!"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's helpful!\n\nWith the fact that it wasn't an origin story, and the lead actor's performance being notable, I can try to make some educated guesses.\n\nGiven that it was a light-hearted and funny movie, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and ask:\n\nCould the movie be \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" (2021) or \"Morbius\" (2022)?\n\nBoth of these movies are solo films, part of the MCU, and have received praise for their visual effects and lead performances. Simu Liu's performance as Shang-Chi was particularly well-received, and Morbius features a strong performance from Jared Leto.\n\nIf neither of these sound quite right, here are a few more questions to help narrow it down:\n\n* Was the movie a more recent release (2020 or later), or do you think it might be a bit older?\n* Do you remember any specific scenes, quotes, or moments from the movie that stuck with you?\n* Was the movie more of a superhero-action film, or did it have elements of other genres (e.g. comedy, sci-fi, fantasy)?"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The \"game-changer\" comment is a great clue!\n\nWith that in mind, I'm going to take a guess that the movie might be \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" (2021).\n\nThis movie was a recent release, and it's been widely praised for its impact on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film's plot and ending have been described as \"game-changing\" by many fans and critics, as it sets up a new direction for the Spider-Man franchise and the MCU as a whole.\n\nThe movie also features Tom Holland's performance as Spider-Man, which has been widely praised, and the film's visual effects are stunning.\n\nDoes that sound like the movie you might be thinking of?\n\n(And if not, I can certainly keep trying to help you figure out which movie it might be!)"
