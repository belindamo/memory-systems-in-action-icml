      "content": "Summarize this \"Bisphenol-A The paper focused on the substance bisphenol-A, or BPA, a chemical that\u2019s been in the news for a few years now as one that shows hormone-like behavior, and has been associated with a number of health issues. BPA is a component of polycarbonate plastic, and is used as an additive in some epoxy resins and other materials. In recent years, concerns over potential health effects have led to it\u2019s removal or substitution in many cases, especially water bottles and baby bottles, even though the weight of scientific evidence still suggests that, under most circumstances, exposures to the chemical from consumer products are too low to cause concern. This was reenforced earlier in the year with a long and weighty review by the European Food Safety Agency, or EFSA. Rather than reading the entire 500 pages (riveting as it is), you can catch the highlights in under five minutes in this Risk Bites video: The EFSA review reiterated the findings of a number of other expert assessments and concluded that, while BPA has the potential to cause harm in the body at high levels, most exposures are so low that the risks are negligible based on current understanding. However, the vast majority of studies carried out so far \u2013 and the focus of the EFSA report \u2013 assume that ingesting BPA from contaminated food is the most relevant source of exposure. Ingested BPA isn\u2019t readily absorbed from your gut, and when it is, the substance is rapidly converted, or metabolized, into a less harmful form, and got rid of in healthy adults. BPA in cash register receipts There is another way that BPA can potentially get into your body though, and that\u2019s through your skin. This is the route that the team based at the University of Missouri were particularly interested in. And in particular, whether BPA in those ubiquitous cash register receipts could present an issue. BPA is used as a developer for heat-sensitive ink in many cash register receipts that use thermal paper. It\u2019s applied as a surface coating, and so in principle can be transferred from the receipt to your hands during handling. From there, there\u2019s the possibility of it passing straight through your skin and into your body, or transferring to food that you\u2019re holding, and from there into your gut. Can BPA get into your body through your skin? Previous research has hinted that this might be a viable exposure route. It\u2019s an interesting one as, unlike polycarbonate bottles where most of the BPA is locked up in the plastic, the BPA used in thermal paper is relatively available. Research so far has indicated that handling cash register receipts probably doesn\u2019t lead to high exposures under normal conditions. However, the Missouri team wondered whether there were circumstances that might change this \u2013 using hand sanitizers for instance that are potentially able to dissolve the BPA from the receipt, and enhance absorption through the skin. To test this, they first measured how much BPA was present in a number of cash register receipts. Taking a bunch of receipts from local retailers, they found an average of 20 mg of BPA per receipt in those that used the substance \u2013 in other words, 2% the weight of these receipts was BPA. Next, they set up an experiment to see how much of this BPA could transfer from a receipt to the surface of someone\u2019s hand. They tested the normal case of someone with dry hands handling a receipt for different lengths of time (up to 6 minutes). They also tested what happens when someone slathers their hands with Purell and holds a receipt, without first allowing the hand sanitizer to dry. In the absence of Purell, a small amount of BPA was left on the hands of volunteers after handling receipts \u2013 the longer the hold-time, the more was left. After 6 minutes, an average of 7 \u00b5g of BPA ended up on a person\u2019s hand \u2013 around 0.08% of the BPA on the receipt. Combining a Purell-coated hand with a receipt led to a maximum of 600 \u00b5g of BPA being transferred after one minute (after this, the measured amount decreased, possibly because it was already working its way through the skin and into the body). In other words, around 7% of the BPA on the receipt ended up on the hand after one minute, if that hand was coated in Purell and was still wet. The next step was to measure how much of that BPA was able to pass through the skin and into the bloodstream. As volunteers were holding a BPA-coated receipt, blood was taken from their arm and analyzed for the chemical. Analysis looked at the quantity of free BPA in the blood (the potentially harmful stuff \u2013 referred to as \u201cunconjugated\u201d BPA or uBPA), and the quantity of \u201cconjugated\u201d BPA (BPA that has been effectively neutralized by the body). The receipt was held for four minutes with the BPA-coated side in contact with the hand, and blood samples were taken for 90 minutes. The researchers also got their volunteers to eat 10 french fries from their Purell and BPA-coated hands, to estimate how much of the substance could be re-transferred to food, and from there to the mouth. The importance of Hand Sanitizer The study discovered that measurable quantities of unconjugated BPA enter the bloodstream within minutes of holding a BPA-containing receipt for 4 minutes in a Purell-coated hand. The peak blood concentrations measured were 5.7 nanograms of unconjugated BPA per milliliter of blood for males, and 10.2 nanograms per milliliter of blood for females. In other words, if you took a blood sample from one the arm of the female volunteers when the peak concentration of BPA was reached, around ten billionths of that sample would be BPA. For those volunteers who didn\u2019t use the Purell, there was no measurable increase in BPA in their blood. Looking at the results from the people who also handled and ate the french fries, it appeared that most of the BPA found in blood samples was from the skin, and not from transferred BPA entering the gut. However, there was some speculation that BPA on the fries could have passed into the bloodstream through the inside of the mouth. Like most research studies, this one provides another piece to the the puzzle of whether exposure to BPA is a significant health issue. But it doesn\u2019t solve the puzzle. It does show that the combination of hand sanitizer and BPA-containing cash register receipts can lead to elevated levels of unconjugated BPA in the blood stream. This raises important questions, as the exposure route hasn\u2019t previously featured greatly in assessments of BPA health risk. It also shows that when handling receipts with clean, dry hands, there isn\u2019t likely to be significant transfer of the BPA from receipts to the blood. Data interpretation isn\u2019t straight forward Interpreting the data any further than this though is not straight forward. The exposure scenarios using the Purell were not that realistic \u2013 handling receipts with hands still coated in wet, slimy Purell isn\u2019t likely to be routine for most people. neither is holding receipts in Purell-coated hands, with the printed side palm-down, for up to four minutes. The measured blood levels are also hard to interpret as they are peak levels from one-off events, and while measurable, they are small. To quantify the risks associated with these levels, more information would be needed on how often such events occur over the space of a day. In other words, what is important is not a one-off peak, but the dose received over time, and whether this exceeds levels that cause concern. One aspect of the study that is certainly worth further investigation is the relatively high levels of unconjugated BPA compared to conjugated BPA. These are substantially higher than those observed when BPA is ingested, and are possibly due to BPA passing through the skin and entering the bloodstream before passing through the liver, where it is efficiently metabolized. The authors suggested that this may increase the risk to sensitive organs and systems within the body \u2013 but without further research, this remains speculative. Don\u2019t dump your receipts just yet The bottom line is that I\u2019m not going to change my cash register receipt habits. The research extends the current state of the science, but not enough at this stage to demonstrate a clear and urgent issue with common cash register receipt practices. That said, it does indicate that further research is needed \u2013 especially where vulnerable individuals are concerned. It also suggests that smothering your hands with Purell and clutching your receipts for several minutes probably isn\u2019t advisable. Especially if you\u2019re just about to tuck into a plate of french fries.\""

A new study, however, suggests that BPA in cash register receipts could be a more significant source of exposure, particularly if hand sanitizers are used after handling the receipts. The researchers found that BPA was present in receipts at an average of 20 mg per receipt, and that handling receipts for extended periods of time or using hand sanitizers after handling the receipts could increase the amount of BPA absorbed through the skin. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential risks associated with BPA in cash register receipts."

      "content": "Hey TikTok, are you ready to learn something crazy? So, you know those cash register receipts you always get after making a purchase? Well, turns out they might be giving you a dose of a hormone-mimicking chemical called BPA! I know, I know, you're probably thinking \"what the heck is BPA?\" Well, let me tell you. BPA is a chemical used in some plastics and other materials, and it's been linked to all sorts of health problems. But here's the thing - most of the time, the amount of BPA we're exposed to is too low to cause any real harm. Except, there's one situation where it might be a bigger deal... when we use hand sanitizer after handling receipts! That's right, folks - the BPA in receipts can transfer to your skin, and if you use hand sanitizer after handling them, it could make the BPA more easily absorbed into your body! Crazy, right? So, next time you're at the store and you get a receipt, think twice before using that hand sanitizer - you never know what you might be exposing yourself to! #BPA #cashregisterreceipts #healthrisks"
