In addition to its unique rhythm, the dance is also known for its colorful costumes, which feature long flowing skirts, lace shawls, and flower crowns. The costumes vary by region and can even differ from village to village.\n\nOverall, the murcianas is a vibrant and festive dance that embodies the cultural traditions of the Murcia region. It is a source of pride for the Murcian people and continues to be an important part of their cultural heritage."
