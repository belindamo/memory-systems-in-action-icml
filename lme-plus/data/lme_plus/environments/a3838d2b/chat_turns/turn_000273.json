  "content": "The probability of winning three games in a row, where each game consists of drawing a number between 1 and 10, is (1/10) \\* (1/10) \\* (1/10) = 1/1000, or 0.001.\n\nThis means that if you play the game 1000 times, you would expect to win three games in a row approximately once. Keep in mind that this is just a theoretical calculation and actual results may vary.",
