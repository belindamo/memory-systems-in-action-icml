Here's why:\n\n1. **Scratch protection:** Screen protectors can help prevent scratches, which can occur even with careful handling. A good screen protector can absorb minor scratches and scuffs, keeping your screen looking like new.\n2. **Drop protection:** If you accidentally drop your phone, a screen protector can help distribute the impact and reduce the risk of screen damage.\n3. **Fingerprint resistance:** Many screen protectors have a fingerprint-resistant coating, making it easier to clean your screen and reducing the appearance of fingerprints.\n4. **Oleophobic coating protection:** If your phone has an oleophobic coating, a screen protector can help maintain its effectiveness by protecting it from wear and tear.\n\nWhen choosing a screen protector, consider the following:\n\n1. **Material:** Tempered glass protectors offer excellent protection, but may add thickness to your screen. PET (polyethylene terephthalate) or TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) protectors are thinner and more flexible.\n2. **Thickness:** If you prefer a minimalist approach, look for thin protectors (around 0.1-0.2 mm). Thicker protectors (around 0.3-0.5 mm) offer more protection but may affect screen sensitivity.\n3. **Adhesive:** Opt for a protector with a strong, bubble-free adhesive to ensure a smooth installation.\n4. **Brand reputation:** Choose a reputable brand that offers a good warranty and customer support.\n\nIf you decide to get a screen protector, make sure to follow the manufacturer's installation instructions carefully to avoid bubbles or dust trapped under the protector.\n\nIn your case, since you mentioned your phone is new, it's a good idea to get a screen protector to maintain its condition and prevent any potential damage.",
