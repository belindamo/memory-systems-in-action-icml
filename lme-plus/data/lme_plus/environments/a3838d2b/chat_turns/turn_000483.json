  "content": "It is difficult to provide a visual description of the zones of Nether Paradise as they are described as being composed of force and energy, rather than physical structures or landscapes. In terms of activities, the section describes that the innermost zone is the focal point of the force-energy activities of Paradise itself, and that the outermost zone may possibly be identified with the functions of the Unqualified Absolute. The mid-zone is not well understood and its function is not identified, but it is believed to have something to do with reciprocal adjustment between the inner and the outer zones. The outer zone is described as the site of \"unimagined activities\" and the central circuit point of emanations that proceed spaceward in every direction. The activities in this region are likely to be highly complex and likely beyond human comprehension, involving the manipulation and circulation of force and energy on a cosmic scale.",
