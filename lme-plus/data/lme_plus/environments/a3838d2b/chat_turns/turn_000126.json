To see why, let's use De Morgan's laws, which state that for any two sets A and B:\n\n(A \u222a B)^c = A^c \u2229 B^c\n(A \u2229 B)^c = A^c \u222a B^c\n\nSo in our case, we have W \u2286 A^c \u2229 B^c, which is equal to (A\u222aB)^c.\n\nNow we have x \u2208 W and W \u2286 (A\u222aB)^c. Can you use this information to show that x \u2208 (A\u222aB)^e?",
