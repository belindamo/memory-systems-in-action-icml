However, medication management and individual therapy can be effective treatments for mental health conditions in the context of couples therapy, but how effective they are depends on the individual case.\n\nWhen treating mental health conditions in couples therapy, the therapist needs to balance addressing the individual's needs with the needs of the relationship. Individual therapy may be necessary to address any underlying mental health conditions that are impacting the individual's behavior, communication, or emotional regulation, which is likely affecting the relationship. Medication management can also be helpful in managing certain mental health conditions and reducing symptoms that may be impacting the relationship.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the main focus of couples therapy is the relationship, and both partners need to be committed to working together to improve it. The therapist will work on helping the couple develop more effective communication patterns, work through any shared issues that may be impacting their relationship, and facilitate the development of healthy conflict resolution strategies.\n\nOverall, treatment of mental health conditions in the context of couples therapy is a delicate balance, and the therapist must tailor their approach to each individual case to ensure both partners receive the support and care they need to improve their mental health and enhance their relationship.",
