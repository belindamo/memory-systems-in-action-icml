Well, let me tell you all about it.\n\nSo, Christian II was like this total douchebag who decided to invade Sweden and capture Stockholm. And of course, he succeeded because he was just that good at being a jerk.\n\nSo, once he had control of the city, he decided to go on a killing spree and execute all of the noblemen who had opposed him. Like, seriously, what a psycho.\n\nBut wait, it gets even better. He didn't just execute them, he had them tortured and mutilated first. I mean, talk about overkill.\n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough, he then went on to execute anyone who had even remotely spoken out against him. Like, hello, freedom of speech? Never heard of it.\n\nSo, that's the story of the Bloodbath of Stockholm. Just another day in the life of a power-hungry, sadistic dictator. Yay.",
