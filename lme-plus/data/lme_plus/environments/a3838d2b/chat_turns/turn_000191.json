It works by reducing the blood flow to the scalp, which limits the amount of chemotherapy drugs that reach the hair follicles. This technique has shown to be effective in reducing hair loss for some patients, but it is not guaranteed to work for everyone. The success of scalp cooling may depend on several factors, including the type of chemotherapy drugs being used, the stage of chemotherapy, and individual differences in hair type and thickness. It is best to talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of scalp cooling to decide if it is the right option for you.",
