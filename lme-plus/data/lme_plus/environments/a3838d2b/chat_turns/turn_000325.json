My insurance premium is $120 per month, and I pay it on the 15th of every month. My registration fee was $50, and I paid it on January 10th.\n\nAlso, I'll start tracking my fuel expenses from now on. I'll make sure to keep my receipts and update the spreadsheet regularly.\n\nThanks for helping me get my car expenses organized!",
