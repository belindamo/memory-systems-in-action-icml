  "content": "Exactly! You've got it. Since x \u2208 W, and W is an open set contained in (A\u222aB)^c, x belongs to the interior of (A\u222aB)^c, which is the exterior of A\u222aB by definition. Thus, x \u2208 (A\u222aB)^e.\n\nSo, we've shown that A^e \u2229 B^e \u2286 (A\u222aB)^e. Combining this with our earlier result that (A\u222aB)^e \u2286 A^e \u2229 B^e, we can conclude that (A\u222aB)^e = A^e \u2229 B^e.\n\nGreat job working through this proof!
