I'd be happy to explain what an appraiser looks for during an appraisal.\n\n**What is an appraisal?**\n\nAn appraisal is an independent evaluation of a property's value, typically performed by a licensed appraiser. The appraiser's goal is to provide an objective opinion of the property's value, which helps lenders determine whether the sale price is reasonable and the property is sufficient collateral for the loan.\n\n**What does an appraiser look for during an appraisal?**\n\nDuring an appraisal, the appraiser will typically:\n\n1. **Exterior inspection**: Examine the property's exterior, including the condition of the foundation, walls, roof, gutters, and downspouts.\n2. **Interior inspection**: Inspect the interior of the property, including the condition of the walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doors.\n3. **Room count and layout**: Verify the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage of the property.\n4. **Amenities and features**: Note the presence and condition of amenities like a garage, pool, fireplace, and appliances.\n5. **Neighborhood analysis**: Research the local real estate market and analyze the property's location, proximity to schools, public transportation, shopping, and other amenities.\n6. **Comparative market analysis**: Identify similar properties in the area (comparables) that have recently sold to determine the subject property's value.\n7. **Site analysis**: Evaluate the property's site, including the lot size, zoning, and any potential issues like flood zones or environmental concerns.\n\n**What is the appraiser looking for?**\n\nThe appraiser is trying to determine the property's value based on its:\n\n1. **Market value**: The most probable price a buyer would pay for the property in a competitive and open market.\n2. **Value indicators**: The appraiser will look for indicators like the property's age, condition, size, and amenities to determine its value.\n3. **Comparable sales**: The appraiser will analyze recent sales of similar properties in the area to determine the subject property's value.\n4. **Functional and economic obsolescence**: The appraiser will consider any functional or economic issues that might affect the property's value, such as outdated design or high maintenance costs.\n\n**What happens after the appraisal?**\n\nAfter the appraisal, the appraiser will submit a report to the lender, which will include:\n\n1. **Appraised value**: The appraiser's opinion of the property's value.\n2. **Appraisal report**: A detailed report outlining the appraiser's methodology, findings, and conclusions.\n\nThe lender will review the appraisal report to ensure the property's value is sufficient to secure the loan. If the appraised value is lower than the sale price, the lender may request a revision to the sale price or require the borrower to make a larger down payment.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the appraisal process better!
