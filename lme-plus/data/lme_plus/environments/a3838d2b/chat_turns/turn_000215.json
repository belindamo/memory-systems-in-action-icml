However, I can offer some general advice on how to find deals on helmets from REI or other bike shops:\n\n1. **Check the REI website and sales pages**: REI often has a \"Sales & Clearance\" section on their website, where you can find discounted helmets and other gear.\n2. **Sign up for REI's email newsletter**: By signing up, you'll receive notifications about upcoming sales, promotions, and special offers.\n3. **Follow REI on social media**: REI often posts about sales and promotions on their social media channels, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n4. **Visit local bike shops**: Stop by local bike shops in your area and ask about any sales or discounts on helmets. They might have some deals or be able to offer a discount on a specific helmet.\n5. **Look for bundle deals**: Some bike shops offer discounts when you purchase a helmet with other cycling gear, such as a bike or accessories.\n6. **Check online marketplaces**: Online marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, or Moosejaw might have discounted helmets from various brands. Be sure to check the seller's ratings and reviews before making a purchase.\n7. **Discount codes and coupons**: Keep an eye on cycling forums, websites, or blogs for discount codes or coupons that can be used on helmet purchases.\n8. **Shop during holiday weekends or special events**: Many bike shops and online retailers offer sales during holiday weekends or special events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or National Bike Month.\n9. **Consider last year's models**: Many bike shops clear out previous year's models to make room for new inventory. You can find discounted helmets from reputable brands that are still certified and safe to use.\n10. **Negotiate**: If you're purchasing from a local bike shop, don't be afraid to ask if they can offer a discount or throw in some extras, like a free helmet accessory or a bike tune-up.\n\nRemember to always prioritize the safety features and certifications of the helmet, even if you're looking for a deal. A discounted helmet that meets your safety needs is a great find!",
