  "content": "That's correct! Since x \u2208 (A\u222aB)^e, it means x \u2208 (A\u222aB)^c, which implies x is in the complement of the interior of A\u222aB. Now, let's use this information to show that x \u2208 A^e \u2229 B^e.\n\nRecall that A^e = (A^c)^i and B^e = (B^c)^i, where A^c and B^c are the complements of A and B, respectively. We want to show that x \u2208 A^e and x \u2208 B^e.\n\nSince x is in the complement of the interior of A\u222aB, it is also in the complement of the interiors of A and B. Can you explain why this is the case and how this information can be used to show that x \u2208 A^e and x \u2208 B^e?",
