Unfortunately, as a large language model, I don't have the ability to browse the internet in real-time, so I won't be able to come across specific information about upcoming events. However, I can suggest some additional tips to help you find arts-related charity events:\n\n1. **Search for arts-focused organizations**: Look for organizations that specifically support arts programs, such as local art councils, museums, or performance venues. They often host events or fundraisers to support arts education or community programs.\n2. **Use specific keywords**: When searching online, use keywords like \"arts charity event,\" \"benefit for arts education,\" \"arts festival fundraiser,\" or \"support local arts\" to find relevant results.\n3. **Check with local schools and universities**: Many schools and universities have arts programs that host events or fundraisers to support their departments. Reach out to their arts or music departments to ask about upcoming events.\n4. **Look for events during National Arts Month**: October is National Arts Month in the United States, and many organizations host events and fundraisers during this time to support arts programs.\n5. **Follow local artists and art organizations**: Many local artists and art organizations use social media to promote their events and fundraisers. Follow them to stay informed about upcoming events that support arts programs.\n\nRemember to research the organization and event to ensure it aligns with your values and goals.\n\nI hope these tips help you find some amazing arts-related charity events to support!",
