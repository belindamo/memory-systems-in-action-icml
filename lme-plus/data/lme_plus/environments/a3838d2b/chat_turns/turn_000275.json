  "content": "The probability of winning exactly two games out of four, where each game consists of drawing a number between 1 and 10, can be calculated using the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula gives the probability of getting exactly k success in n independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a probability of success p.\n\nHere, each trial represents a game, and a success is winning the game. So, k = 2, n = 4, and p = 1/10.\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\nP(exactly 2 wins) = (n choose k) \\* p^k \\* (1-p)^(n-k)\n= (4 choose 2) \\* (1/10)^2 \\* (9/10)^2\n= 6 \\* (1/100) \\* (81/100)\n= 6 \\* (81/10000)\n= 486 / 10000\n= 0.0486\n\nSo, the probability of winning exactly two games out of four is approximately 0.0486, or 4.86%.",
