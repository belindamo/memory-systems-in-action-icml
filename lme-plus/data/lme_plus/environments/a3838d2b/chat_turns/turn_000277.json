  "content": "The probability of winning exactly one game out of four, where each game consists of drawing a number between 1 and 10, can be calculated using the binomial probability formula.\n\nHere, each trial represents a game, and a success is winning the game. So, k = 1, n = 4, and p = 1/10.\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\nP(exactly 1 win) = (n choose k) \\* p^k \\* (1-p)^(n-k)\n= (4 choose 1) \\* (1/10) \\* (9/10)^3\n= 4 \\* (1/10) \\* (729/1000)\n= 4 \\* (729/10000)\n= 2916 / 10000\n= 0.2916\n\nSo, the probability of winning exactly one game out of four is approximately 0.2916, or 29.16%.",
