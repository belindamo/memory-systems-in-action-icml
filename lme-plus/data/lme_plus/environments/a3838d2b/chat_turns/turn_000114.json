  "content": "To begin the proof, let's first recall the definition of the exterior of a set. The exterior of a set S, denoted S^e, is the complement of the closure of S, i.e., S^e = (S^c)^i, where S^c is the complement of S and S^i is the interior of S.\n\nWe are given that A and B are open sets in the topological space X. Our goal is to prove that (A\u222aB)^e = A^e \u2229 B^e.\n\nLet's break this down into two parts:\n\n1. Show that (A\u222aB)^e \u2286 A^e \u2229 B^e\n2. Show that A^e \u2229 B^e \u2286 (A\u222aB)^e\n\nWe'll start with part 1. Let x \u2208 (A\u222aB)^e. Can you determine what this implies about x, and how you can use this information to show that x \u2208 A^e \u2229 B^e?",
