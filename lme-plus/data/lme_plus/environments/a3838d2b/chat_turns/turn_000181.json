This creates a distinctive percussive sound that is central to the dance, and is often accompanied by traditional instruments such as the tambor, a large drum, and the guitarra, a type of guitar.\n\nThe murcianas is typically performed at festive events such as weddings and religious festivals, and is a popular form of cultural expression in Murcia. In addition to its unique rhythm, the dance is also known for its colorful costumes, which feature long flowing skirts, lace shawls, and flower crowns. The costumes vary by region and can even differ from village to village.\n\nOverall, the murcianas is a vibrant and festive dance that embodies the cultural traditions of the Murcia region.
