However, I can provide some information based on general trends. \n\nIn recent years, there has been a renewed interest among younger generations in preserving Murcia's cultural traditions of music and dance. This is evident in the growing number of young people joining folk dance groups and traditional music bands. These groups not only provide an opportunity for young people to learn and perform traditional music and dance, but also to connect with their cultural heritage and identity.\n\nFurthermore, many cultural events and festivals in Murcia have started to incorporate contemporary elements into their traditional music and dance performances, making them more appealing to younger audiences. For example, some festivals have added DJ sets mixed with traditional music, or created new choreography that blends modern and traditional styles.\n\nOverall, while the preservation of cultural traditions is an ongoing challenge, it seems that the younger generations in Murcia are embracing their cultural heritage with pride and finding new ways to keep it alive.",
