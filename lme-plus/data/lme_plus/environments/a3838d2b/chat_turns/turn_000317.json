  "content": "Setting up a spreadsheet in Google Sheets will make it easy to track and organize your car expenses.\n\nFor your maintenance category, you can create separate rows for each entry. Here's an example of how you can set it up:\n\n| Date | Category | Description | Amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2/22 | Maintenance | Flat tire repair | $15.00 |\n| 3/18 | Maintenance | Oil change | $35.00 |\n| 3/18 | Maintenance | Tire rotation and balancing | $20.00 |\n\nYou can add more columns or rows as needed, but this should give you a good starting point.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Use a consistent date format (e.g., MM/DD or YYYY-MM-DD) to make it easy to sort and filter your entries.\n* Be specific with your descriptions so you can easily recall what the expense was for.\n* Consider using formulas to calculate totals or averages for each category or for your overall car expenses.\n\nAs you add more entries, you can use Google Sheets' built-in functions to analyze your data. For example, you can use the `SUMIF` function to calculate the total amount spent on maintenance or the `AVERAGE` function to determine the average cost of your oil changes.\n\nRemember to update your spreadsheet regularly to keep track of your expenses accurately. And don't forget to add that car cover entry once you receive it and pay for it!\n\nDo you have any other expenses you'd like to add to your spreadsheet, or would you like some help with setting up formulas or charts to analyze your data?",
