  "content": "Marriage counselors may determine if there is an underlying mental health condition impacting the relationship by conducting a comprehensive assessment of both partners. This assessment may involve conducting interviews, administering validated questionnaires, and analyzing the behavior and communication patterns of each individual. The marriage counselor may also consider the individual histories of each partner, their family dynamics, and their cultural background.\n\nIn addition, if one or both partners have a history of mental health conditions, the marriage counselor may recommend that they undergo a comprehensive psychological evaluation conducted by a licensed mental health professional. This evaluation may include psychological testing, clinical interviews, and a detailed review of medical history and related records.\n\nBased on the results of this assessment, the marriage counselor may recommend individual therapy or medication management to treat the mental health condition. They may also incorporate specific techniques and strategies into their couples therapy sessions to help the couple better manage and cope with the challenges and stressors associated with the condition.",
