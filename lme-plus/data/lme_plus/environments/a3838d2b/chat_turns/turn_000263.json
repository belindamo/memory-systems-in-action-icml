Here's an overview of their comprehensive and collision coverage:\n\n**Comprehensive Coverage:**\n\nComprehensive coverage is an optional type of auto insurance that helps cover damage to your vehicle that's not related to a collision with another vehicle or object. This type of coverage typically includes:\n\n* Theft or vandalism: If your vehicle is stolen or vandalized, comprehensive coverage can help pay for repairs or replacement.\n* Fire: If your vehicle catches fire, comprehensive coverage can help cover the damage.\n* Floods: If your vehicle is damaged in a flood, comprehensive coverage can help cover the repairs.\n* Hail: If your vehicle is damaged by hail, comprehensive coverage can help cover the repairs.\n* Animal collisions: If you hit an animal, such as a deer, comprehensive coverage can help cover the damages.\n* Glass repair: Comprehensive coverage often includes glass repair or replacement, such as windshield cracks or breaks.\n* Falling objects: If a tree branch or other object falls on your vehicle, comprehensive coverage can help cover the damages.\n* Weather-related events: Comprehensive coverage can help cover damages caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.\n\nProgressive's comprehensive coverage also includes some additional features, such as:\n\n* Loan/lease gap coverage: If your vehicle is totaled, this coverage can help pay the difference between the actual cash value of your vehicle and the amount you still owe on your loan or lease.\n* Custom equipment coverage: If you've added custom features to your vehicle, such as a stereo system or rims, this coverage can help pay for repairs or replacement.\n\n**Collision Coverage:**\n\nCollision coverage is an optional type of auto insurance that helps pay for damages to your vehicle if you're involved in an accident with another vehicle or object, such as a fence or pole. This type of coverage typically includes:\n\n* Repairs to your vehicle: Collision coverage can help pay for repairs to your vehicle, regardless of who's at fault.\n* Replacement of your vehicle: If your vehicle is totaled, collision coverage can help pay for a replacement vehicle.\n\nProgressive's collision coverage also includes some additional features, such as:\n\n* Deductible savings bank: If you're involved in an accident, Progressive's deductible savings bank can help reduce your deductible amount.\n* Disappearing deductible: If you're accident-free for a certain period, Progressive's disappearing deductible can help reduce your deductible amount over time.\n\n**Deductibles:**\n\nBoth comprehensive and collision coverage require a deductible, which is the amount you'll need to pay out-of-pocket when you file a claim. Progressive offers a range of deductible options, from $0 to $1,500. The higher your deductible, the lower your premium will be.\n\n**Customizing Your Coverage:**\n\nProgressive allows you to customize your comprehensive and collision coverage to fit your needs and budget. You can choose from a range of coverage limits, deductibles, and additional features to create a policy that works best for you.\n\nKeep in mind that coverage options and availability may vary depending on your location, vehicle, and other factors. It's always a good idea to review your policy details and ask questions if you're unsure about any aspect of your coverage.",
