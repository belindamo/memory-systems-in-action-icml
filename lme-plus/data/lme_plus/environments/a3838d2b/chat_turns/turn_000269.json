However, they do offer a discount for certain vehicle customizations that can help protect your vehicle's interior and exterior.\n\n**Custom Equipment Discount:**\n\nIf you've added custom equipment or accessories to your vehicle, such as a steering wheel cover, floor mats, or a car alarm, you may be eligible for a custom equipment discount. This discount can help cover the cost of replacing or repairing these items if they're damaged or stolen.\n\nTo be eligible for this discount, the custom equipment must be permanently installed in your vehicle and must not be already included in the vehicle's standard equipment. You'll need to provide proof of purchase and installation to Progressive.\n\n**Other Ways to Protect Your Vehicle's Interior:**\n\nWhile Progressive doesn't offer a specific discount for interior protection, you can still take steps to protect your vehicle's interior from the sun's UV rays and other damage. Here are a few tips:\n\n1. **Use a steering wheel cover**: As you mentioned, a steering wheel cover can help protect your wheel from UV rays and cracking.\n2. **Invest in floor mats**: Floor mats can help protect your carpets from dirt, stains, and wear.\n3. **Use a sunshade**: A sunshade can help block UV rays and keep your vehicle's interior cooler when parked in direct sunlight.\n4. **Condition your leather seats**: If you have leather seats, regular conditioning can help protect them from cracking and drying out.\n5. **Clean your vehicle regularly**: Regular cleaning can help prevent dirt and stains from building up and damaging your vehicle's interior.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can help protect your vehicle's interior and maintain its value over time.\n\nI hope that helps!
