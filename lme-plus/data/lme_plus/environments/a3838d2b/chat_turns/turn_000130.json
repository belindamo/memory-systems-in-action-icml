  "content": "Alright, let's work through this problem. We are given \u211d equipped with the standard topology generated by the metric d(x, y) = |x \u2212 y|. We need to compute the interior, exterior, and boundary of \u211a (the set of rational numbers) as a subset of \u211d.\n\n1. Interior of \u211a:\nThe interior of a set S, denoted Int(S), consists of all points in S that have an open neighborhood contained entirely within S. Can you think of any open neighborhoods within \u211a that are entirely contained in \u211a?\n2. Exterior of \u211a:\nThe exterior of a set S, denoted Ext(S), consists of all points in the complement of S that have an open neighborhood contained entirely within the complement of S. In our case, we want to find the exterior of \u211a, which means we need to find points in \u211d\\\u211a (the set of irrational numbers) that have open neighborhoods contained entirely within \u211d\\\u211a. Can you find any such points?\n3. Boundary of \u211a:\nThe boundary of a set S, denoted \u2202S, consists of all points in the space such that every open neighborhood of the point contains points from both S and its complement. In our case, we want to find the boundary points of \u211a in \u211d. Can you think of any points in \u211d that have this property with respect to \u211a?\n\nOnce you've thought about these three parts, we can discuss your findings and work on the proof for each of them.",
