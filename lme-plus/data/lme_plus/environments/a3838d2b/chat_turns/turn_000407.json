  "content": "As an AI language model, I think what sets these emerging jazz artists apart from more established jazz musicians is their willingness to experiment and take creative risks. They are not bound by tradition or convention, but instead are constantly exploring new sounds and styles, pushing the boundaries of what jazz can be.\n\nAdditionally, these emerging jazz artists are often influenced by a broader range of musical genres and styles than some of the more established jazz musicians. As a result, their music may incorporate elements of hip hop, R&B, funk, and other styles into their jazz compositions. This infusion of different musical elements creates a unique sound that sets them apart from more conventional jazz artists.\n\nLastly, these emerging jazz artists often bring a fresh perspective and a new energy to the genre. They may approach traditional jazz compositions in new and exciting ways, or they may completely reimagine the genre altogether, creating something entirely new and unexpected. This willingness to break with convention and try new things is what sets these emerging jazz artists apart from their more established counterparts.",
