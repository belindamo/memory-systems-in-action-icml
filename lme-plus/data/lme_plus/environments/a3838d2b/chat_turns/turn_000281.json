Well, turns out they might be giving you a dose of a hormone-mimicking chemical called BPA! I know, I know, you're probably thinking \"what the heck is BPA?\" Well, let me tell you. BPA is a chemical used in some plastics and other materials, and it's been linked to all sorts of health problems. But here's the thing - most of the time, the amount of BPA we're exposed to is too low to cause any real harm. Except, there's one situation where it might be a bigger deal... when we use hand sanitizer after handling receipts! That's right, folks - the BPA in receipts can transfer to your skin, and if you use hand sanitizer after handling them, it could make the BPA more easily absorbed into your body! Crazy, right? So, next time you're at the store and you get a receipt, think twice before using that hand sanitizer - you never know what you might be exposing yourself to! #BPA #cashregisterreceipts #healthrisks",
