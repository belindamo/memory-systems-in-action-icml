  "content": "The chemical bisphenol-A (BPA) has been associated with a number of health issues, but most scientific evidence suggests that exposure to it from consumer products is generally low enough to be of little concern. A new study, however, suggests that BPA in cash register receipts could be a more significant source of exposure, particularly if hand sanitizers are used after handling the receipts. The researchers found that BPA was present in receipts at an average of 20 mg per receipt, and that handling receipts for extended periods of time or using hand sanitizers after handling the receipts could increase the amount of BPA absorbed through the skin. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential risks associated with BPA in cash register receipts.",
