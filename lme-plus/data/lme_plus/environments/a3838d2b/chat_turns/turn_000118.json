  "content": "Yes, that's correct! Since x is in the complement of the interior of A, there exists an open set U \u2286 X such that x \u2208 U, and U \u2286 X \\ A (the complement of A). Similarly, we can say that there exists an open set V \u2286 X such that x \u2208 V, and V \u2286 X \\ B (the complement of B).\n\nNow, let's use this information to show that x \u2208 A^e and x \u2208 B^e. Recall that A^e = (A^c)^i and B^e = (B^c)^i.\n\nCan you deduce why x \u2208 A^e and x \u2208 B^e based on the open sets U and V that you found?",
