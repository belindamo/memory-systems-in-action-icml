Since x \u2208 A^e and x \u2208 B^e, we know that there exist open sets U and V, with x \u2208 U \u2286 A^c and x \u2208 V \u2286 B^c.\n\nNow, let's consider the open set W = U \u2229 V. W is an open set because it is the intersection of two open sets, and x \u2208 W since x \u2208 U and x \u2208 V.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between W and A\u222aB. Can you determine whether W is contained in the complement of A\u222aB, i.e., W \u2286 (A\u222aB)^c?",
