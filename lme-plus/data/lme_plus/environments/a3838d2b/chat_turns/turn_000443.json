Many of these options are managed by ASUCLA, a student-run organization that includes several dining locations as well as the campus bookstore and other services. One popular student-run dining option is the student cooperative, Bruin Plate Co-Op, which offers fresh ingredients and sustainable practices. Bruins for Recovery is another program that provides healthy food options for students in alcohol and drug addiction recovery. There\u2019s also the Green Medallion Program, which aims to promote sustainability and ethical food choices by incorporating locally-sourced and organic ingredients. In addition, ASUCLA operates a student-run coffeehouse, Kerckhoff Coffeehouse, which is a popular spot to grab a cup of coffee, and snacks or a quick meal. These options give students the chance to gain valuable experience in management, marketing, and foodservice while providing a unique dining experience on campus.",
