While technology has many benefits in creating inclusive classrooms, it can never replace the importance of human interaction and support for students with disabilities. Assistive technology provides tools that support learning and participation, but it does not replace the need for human connection, empathy, and understanding. \n\nStudents with disabilities often require personalized attention and additional support, whether that is helping them access assistive technology or helping them better understand a particular concept. Human support is necessary to provide emotional and social support that cannot be duplicated by technology. \n\nFurthermore, the use of technology should never replace the need for continuous assessment and communication with stakeholders, including teachers, support staff, and parents. Collaboration, communication, and teamwork among all stakeholders is crucial in creating an inclusive classroom environment that enables the personalized learning experiences that students with disabilities require.",
