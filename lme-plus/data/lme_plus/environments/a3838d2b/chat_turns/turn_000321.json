Just let me know!\n\nAlso, don't forget to add that car cover entry once you receive it and pay for it. You can add a row with the date, category (Accessories), description (Custom-fit car cover), and amount (whatever the cost ends up being).\n\nHow's your spreadsheet looking so far? Do you have any other expenses to add or any questions about using Google Sheets?",
