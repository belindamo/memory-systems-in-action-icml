  "content": "That's so cool! Getting a good spot in general admission can make all the difference in the world, especially for a high-energy artist like Billie Eilish. I can imagine you and Emma must have been completely stoked to be up close and personal with the action.\n\nGeneral admission can be a bit of a gamble, but it's always worth it when you get a great spot. Did you guys have to wait in line for a while to get a good spot, or did you get there super early to secure your spot?\n\nAnd how was the crowd energy during the show? Billie Eilish has a reputation for having a very enthusiastic and dedicated fanbase, so I'm sure the vibe was electric. Did you guys participate in any of the crowd interactions or sing-alongs during the show?\n\nAlso, what was your favorite song or performance from the setlist? Billie has so many bops, it's hard to choose just one!",
