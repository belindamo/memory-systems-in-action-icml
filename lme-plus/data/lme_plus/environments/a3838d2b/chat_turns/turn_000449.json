However, it's essential to understand how PMI works, as it can impact your mortgage payments if you were to put down less than 20%.\n\n**What is Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)?**\n\nPMI is a type of insurance that lenders require when a homebuyer makes a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price. It protects the lender in case the borrower defaults on the loan. PMI does not protect the borrower; its sole purpose is to minimize the lender's risk.\n\n**How does PMI work?**\n\nHere's how PMI typically works:\n\n1. **Premium calculation**: The lender calculates the PMI premium based on the loan amount, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, credit score, and other factors. The premium is usually expressed as a percentage of the loan amount.\n2. **Monthly payment**: The PMI premium is added to your monthly mortgage payment.\n3. **Coverage**: PMI covers a portion of the loan amount, usually up to 20% of the original loan amount.\n\n**PMI rates and costs**\n\nPMI rates vary depending on the lender, loan terms, and borrower's credit score. Here are some general PMI rate ranges:\n\n* 0.3% to 1.5% of the loan amount per year (divided by 12 for monthly payment)\n* Average annual PMI premium: 0.5% to 0.7% of the loan amount\n\nFor example, if you were to put 10% down on a $320,000 home, your loan amount would be $288,000. With a 0.5% annual PMI premium, your monthly PMI payment would be:\n\n$288,000 (loan amount) x 0.5% (annual PMI premium) = $1,440 per year\n$1,440 \u00f7 12 = $120 per month (added to your mortgage payment)\n\n**When can you cancel PMI?**\n\nYou can cancel PMI once you've reached 20% equity in your home, which means your loan balance is 80% or less of the original purchase price. You'll need to:\n\n1. Request cancellation in writing\n2. Provide proof of your home's value (appraisal or market analysis)\n3. Be current on your mortgage payments\n\nLenders are also required to automatically cancel PMI when your loan balance reaches 78% of the original purchase price, based on the original amortization schedule.\n\nNow that you're aware of PMI, you can appreciate the benefits of putting 20% down and avoiding this additional cost.
