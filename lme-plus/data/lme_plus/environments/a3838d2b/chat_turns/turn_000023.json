I'd be more than happy to help you prepare and set expectations.\n\nFirst, congratulations on taking salsa classes for 3 months! That's a great milestone, and you must be feeling more confident in your dancing skills. That's perfect timing, as you'll definitely benefit from the festival experience.\n\nHere are some tips to help you prepare and make the most out of your salsa festival adventure:\n\n**Before the Festival:**\n\n1. **Practice, practice, practice**: Continue attending your classes and practicing regularly to fine-tune your skills. Focus on perfecting your basic steps, turns, and leading/following techniques.\n2. **Get comfortable with improvisation**: Salsa festivals often feature social dancing, where you'll be dancing with different partners. Practice improvising and responding to different leads or follows.\n3. **Learn some basic shines**: Shines are short, flashy movements that add flavor to your dancing. Learning a few basic shines will help you stand out and have more fun on the dance floor.\n4. **Pack comfortable shoes and clothes**: Wear comfortable, breathable clothing and shoes with a smooth sole (e.g., dance shoes or sneakers). You'll likely be dancing for extended periods, so dress accordingly.\n5. **Check the festival schedule**: Review the festival schedule to plan your day, including which workshops, performances, and social dancing sessions you want to attend.\n\n**During the Festival:**\n\n1. **Arrive early**: Get there early to register, stretch, and warm up before the first workshop or social dance session.\n2. **Be prepared to learn**: Take advantage of workshops and classes offered by renowned instructors. Be open to learning new styles, techniques, and moves.\n3. **Social dance with others**: Don't be shy! Social dancing is a great way to meet new people, practice with different partners, and learn from others.\n4. **Respect the dance floor**: Follow basic dance floor etiquette: be aware of your surroundings, respect other dancers' space, and apologize if you accidentally bump into someone.\n5. **Stay hydrated and energized**: Bring water and snacks to keep your energy levels up throughout the day.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Don't be intimidated**: You'll likely see more experienced dancers, but remember that everyone started somewhere. Focus on your own progress and have fun.\n2. **Ask questions**: If you're unsure about a move or need help, don't hesitate to ask instructors or more experienced dancers for guidance.\n3. **Take breaks**: Festivals can be overwhelming, so take breaks to rest your feet, grab a snack, or simply observe and enjoy the music.\n\nYou're going to have an amazing time at the salsa festival! With your 3 months of experience, you'll be able to appreciate the workshops, performances, and social dancing even more. Just remember to stay relaxed, have fun, and enjoy the experience.\n\nDo you have any specific questions or concerns about the festival or your preparation?",
