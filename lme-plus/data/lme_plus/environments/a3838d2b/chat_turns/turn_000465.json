  "content": "The Anker PowerCore 20000 PD is a great choice, and it's awesome that you still have the fast chargers that came with your phone.\n\nThe Anker PowerCore 20000 PD supports USB-C Power Delivery (PD) up to 18W, which is a fast charging standard. However, the fast chargers that came with your phone might use a different fast charging technology, such as QuickCharge (QC) or VOOC.\n\nHere's the good news: the Anker PowerCore 20000 PD is designed to be compatible with multiple fast charging standards, including:\n\n* USB-C Power Delivery (PD)\n* QuickCharge (QC) 3.0\n* VOOC (Voltage-Open Loop Multi-step Constant-Current Charging)\n* AFC (Adaptive Fast Charging)\n\nThis means that the Anker PowerCore 20000 PD should be able to charge your phone quickly using the fast chargers you got with your phone, as long as they use one of the supported fast charging standards.\n\nTo confirm, you can check the specifications of your phone and the fast chargers to see which fast charging standard they use. If they use QC, VOOC, or AFC, the Anker PowerCore 20000 PD should be able to take advantage of fast charging.\n\nKeep in mind that the charging speed may vary depending on the specific fast charging standard and the capacity of your phone's battery. However, the Anker PowerCore 20000 PD is designed to provide fast and efficient charging, so you should still see a significant boost in charging speed compared to a standard charger.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
