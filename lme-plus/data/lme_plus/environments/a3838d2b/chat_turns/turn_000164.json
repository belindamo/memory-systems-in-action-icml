  "content": "You make a great point. Striking a balance between using technology as a tool while also promoting independence and self-sufficiency in students with disabilities is essential. Here are some strategies that can help to strike a balance:\n\n1. Use technology as a tool to support learning, not replace it. Assistive technology should be introduced and used to help students overcome barriers and increase their independence. Once the skill is mastered, consider reducing the use of the technology and encouraging students to use the newly developed skills.\n\n2. Develop alternative strategies. Assistive technology should provide support that fosters learning and should not limit learning opportunities. Consider developing alternative strategies that students can use when technology is not available or when they cannot access it.\n\n3. Encourage self-advocacy. Empower students to identify their needs and seek out the resources and support they require. Assist them in exploring solutions that encourage independence like meeting with teachers or arranging alternate resources.\n\n4. Allow for exploration and experimentation. Incorporate opportunities for students to explore and experiment with technology tools on their own. Encourage them to think creatively and develop their solutions to unique challenges.\n\n5. Regular evaluation of technology tools. Regularly evaluate the technology tools integrated into classroom activities to ensure they are complementary to students' abilities, and continual feedback with all the parties involved.\n\n6. Creating a collaborative environment. Encourage involvement between classroom participants-the students, teacher, parents, support teams to share learning interests and any alternative strategies.\n\nWhen done correctly, Technology can be incredibly powerful in creating an inclusive classroom, but it should be balanced with other methods of teaching and should never replace the development of social and emotional skills to foster independence among students.",
