So, feel free to suggest podcasts or TV shows that you think might be interesting, and I can provide more information or recommendations based on those topics!\n\nIf you'd like, we could play a game where you suggest a podcast or TV show, and I'll respond with a recommendation or a fun fact related to that topic.
