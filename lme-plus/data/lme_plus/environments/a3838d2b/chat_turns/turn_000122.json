  "content": "That's okay, let's work through it together. We know that x \u2208 U and U \u2286 X \\ (A\u222aB). This implies that U is disjoint from both A and B, as it does not intersect A\u222aB. Therefore, U is also contained in both A^c and B^c, since it does not intersect A or B.\n\nNow, since U is an open set, and x \u2208 U \u2286 A^c, we can say that x belongs to the interior of A^c, which is A^e by definition. Similarly, x \u2208 U \u2286 B^c, which means x belongs to the interior of B^c, which is B^e by definition.\n\nThus, x \u2208 A^e and x \u2208 B^e, which means x \u2208 A^e \u2229 B^e.\n\nWe've now shown that (A\u222aB)^e \u2286 A^e \u2229 B^e. The next step is to prove the reverse inclusion, A^e \u2229 B^e \u2286 (A\u222aB)^e. Can you try to show this using a similar approach?",
