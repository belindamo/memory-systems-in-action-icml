  "content": "Sure, here's an example of how double entry accounting with ledger might be implemented for the sample data:\n\nAssume the following accounts:\n\n* Assets: Inventory (K1)\n* Assets: Accounts Receivable (O1)\n* Assets: Bank Account\n* Liabilities: Accounts Payable (K3)\n* Equity: Revenue (O6)\n* Equity: Cost of Goods Sold (K1, K4)\n\nHere are some example transactions:\n\n1. Customer places an order (O3 -- PlaceOrder --> O1)\n\t* Debit: Accounts Receivable (O1)\n\t* Credit: Revenue (O6)\n2. Order is initiated for procurement (O1 -- InitiatesPurchase --> K5)\n\t* Debit: Inventory (K1)\n\t* Credit: Accounts Payable (K3)\n3. Meal materials are procured (K5 -- ProcuresMealMaterial --> K1)\n\t* Debit: Inventory (K1)\n\t* Credit: Accounts Payable (K3)\n4. Meal is prepared and sold (O2 -- MealContainsMealMaterial --> K1; O2 -- HasPricing --> O4; O1 -- OrderContainsMeal --> O2; O5 -- TransactionForPayment --> Payment; O5 -- TransactionForPurchase --> K4)\n\t* Debit: Cost of Goods Sold (K1, K4)\n\t* Credit: Revenue (O6)\n5. Payment is received (Payment -- PaymentForOrder --> O1)\n\t* Debit: Bank Account\n\t* Credit: Accounts Receivable (O1)\n\nThese transactions can be recorded in a ledger, which would show the debits and credits for each account:\n\n| Date | Description | Debit | Credit |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023-03-01 | Order placed by customer | Accounts Receivable (O1) | Revenue (O6) |\n| 2023-03-01 | Meal materials procured | Inventory (K1) | Accounts Payable (K3) |\n| 2023-03-02 | Meal prepared and sold | Cost of Goods Sold (K1, K4) | Revenue (O6) |\n| 2023-03-03 | Payment received from customer | Bank Account | Accounts Receivable (O1) |",
