Smoothies: Blend fruits like banana and berries with spinach or kale, and adding in some almond milk or yogurt. Kids will love the sweetness of the fruit and won't even realize they are getting vegetables.\n\n2. Pasta sauces: You can blend cooked veggies like carrots, spinach or zucchini into the spaghetti sauce. This adds nutrition and fiber while also increasing the veggie content of the meal.\n\n3. Mashed Sweet Potato with Veggies: Mix in some carrots, peas or green beans while making mashed sweet potatoes with cinnamon, nutmeg and a little honey. This is a great way to incorporate orange and green vegetables together in one creative dish.\n\n4. Cauliflower Rice: You can make a quick, easy and healthy rice substitute by pulsing well-cooked cauliflower in a food processor. Kids will love it for its mild sweetness and rice-like texture, while you're also sneaking in an extra serving of vegetables.\n\n5. Vegetable Quesadillas: Toast a cheese quesadilla and add some vegetable stuffing like onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers, and some spinach to increase the fiber and make it a complete meal.\n\n6. Veggie Tacos: Load up traditional tacos with black beans, lettuce, and pre-cooked cauliflower or zucchini, and some fresh salsa. \n\nThese are easy and yummy ways to add some extra nutrients into meals without sacrificing taste, so your child can have a wholesome and tasty meal.",
