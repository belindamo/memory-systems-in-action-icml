  "content": "Sure, there have been several conflicts between international organizations that have been difficult to resolve. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Conflict between the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC): The UN has been accused of being slow to respond to some atrocities and failing to hold perpetrators accountable. The ICC was formed to address this issue, but there has been friction between the two organizations regarding the role and jurisdiction of the ICC.\n\n2. Conflict between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO): The WTO has come under criticism for its policies on intellectual property and access to medicines, which can undermine the efforts of the WHO to provide affordable access to medicines.\n\n3. Conflict between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank: Both organizations have overlapping responsibilities and sometimes compete for influence within developing countries, which can lead to tension and conflict.\n\n4. Conflict between the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Council of Museums (ICOM): ICOM has been critical of UNESCO's approach to heritage preservation and managing cultural institutions, leading to conflict between the two organizations.\n\n5. Conflict between the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC): The two organizations have different views on labor standards and trade policies, creating friction between them.\n\nThese are just a few examples of conflicts between international organizations. Resolving these conflicts can be challenging due to the diverse interests, priorities, and agendas of each organization.",
