  "content": "I'm looking for some inspiration for my next pasta dish. I've been craving Italian food a lot lately, and I recently tried a Spaghetti Carbonara at Bella Vita that was amazing. I've also been experimenting with different pasta recipes at home, like a quick and easy dinner I made last Thursday using fettuccine and arrabbiata sauce. Do you have any recommendations for other pasta dishes I could try?",
