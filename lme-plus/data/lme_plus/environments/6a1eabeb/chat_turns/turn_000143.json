  "content": "Mei and MK watch as Bai Long Ma disappears into another room, closing the door behind him. They exchange a curious glance, but don't say anything. After a few minutes, they hear Bai's muffled voice coming from the room - it sounds like he's on a video call.\n\nMei leans in closer to the door, straining to hear what's being said. She can't make out much, but it sounds like Bai is pleading his case to someone. She hears the other person speak up, and recognizes the voice as belonging to one of the leaders of the rebellion.\n\n\"I don't understand, Bai,\" the person says, sounding surprised. \"We heard you were arrested. What are you doing on this call?\"\n\nBai clears his throat. \"Yes, I was, but I managed to escape. Look, I need your help. Two of our people are in trouble. They're trying to rescue a friend who's been wrongly imprisoned by the Spider Queen's forces.\"\n\nThere's a pause, and Mei can almost feel the tension through the door.\n\n\"Wrongly imprisoned? How do you know that?\"\n\n\"He looks like me, and I caused a distraction that led to his arrest. It's my fault. But please, can you help us find him? We don't have the same resources as the main rebellion.\"\n\nThe other person sighs. \"Bai, you know better than this. You can't just go around sabotaging things without clearing it with us first. It puts us all in danger.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Bai says, sounding apologetic. \"But we're talking about someone's life here. Can't you make an exception just this once?\"\n\nThere's another pause, longer this time. Mei and MK exchange a worried glance.\n\nFinally, the other person speaks again. \"Fine. I'll see what I can do. But this can't happen again, Bai. We're counting on you to be smart and not put our entire operation at risk.\"\n\n\"I won't let you down,\" Bai says earnestly.\n\nMei and MK hear the call end, and a moment later, Bai emerges from the room, looking relieved.\n\n\"Well, that could have gone worse,\" he says to them, a small smile on his face. \"We'll have some help finding your friend. But we need to be careful from here on out.\"",
