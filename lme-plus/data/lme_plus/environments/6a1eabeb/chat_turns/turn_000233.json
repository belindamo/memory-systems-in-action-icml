Here are some tips to help you achieve that:\n\n1. **Start with a broad search**: Begin with a broad search of the literature to get a sense of the overall landscape in your field. Use keywords, synonyms, and related terms to capture relevant studies.\n2. **Use multiple databases and sources**: Don't rely on a single database or source. Use a combination of academic databases (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar), online libraries, and specialized repositories (e.g., arXiv, DOAJ) to ensure you're covering all the relevant literature.\n3. **Search beyond journals**: Include conference proceedings, books, theses, and grey literature (e.g., technical reports, white papers) in your search to get a more comprehensive view of the field.\n4. **Use citation tracking and alerts**: Set up citation tracking tools (e.g., Google Scholar Citations, Microsoft Academic) to notify you when new papers are published that cite the key studies in your field. This helps you stay up-to-date and identify potential gaps.\n5. **Analyze the citation networks**: Examine the citation networks of key papers in your field to identify clusters, influential authors, and frequently cited studies. This can help you identify gaps and areas that require further investigation.\n6. **Consult with experts and peers**: Discuss your research with experts in the field, peers, and colleagues to gain insights into potential gaps and areas that might have been overlooked.\n7. **Use systematic review methods**: Consider using systematic review methods, such as PRISMA or Cochrane, to ensure a comprehensive and transparent search process.\n8. **Keep a \" parked\" list**: Maintain a list of papers that you've identified as relevant but haven't yet read or incorporated into your review. This helps you keep track of studies that might be important but require further examination.\n9. **Regularly update your search**: Repeat your search at regular intervals (e.g., every 2-3 months) to capture new studies and ensure your review remains current.\n10. **Use tools for literature mapping**: Utilize tools like VOSviewer, CiteSpace, or Sci2 to visualize the literature and identify clusters, trends, and gaps in the research landscape.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to ensuring that your literature review is comprehensive and thorough. Remember to stay organized, and don't hesitate to seek help if you need it.\n\nHow's your experience with Mendeley so far? Have you started organizing your references and creating a structure for your literature review?",
