  "content": "Mei and MK stood in front of Bai Long Ma, both already in their prison worker disguises. They had been practicing their roles for hours, trying to perfect their acting so they wouldn't stand out.\n\n\"We need to know where Ao Lie is,\" Mei said, crossing her arms. \"Do you have any ideas?\"\n\nBai Long Ma hesitated before speaking. \"There is a way,\" he said, looking down at his feet. \"But it's not something we usually do.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" MK asked.\n\nBai Long Ma sighed. \"We have contacts inside the government. People who have been bribed or have their own reasons for wanting to help us. They have access to information that could tell us where Ao Lie is being held.\"\n\n\"So why don't we just use this method?\" Mei asked.\n\nBai Long Ma looked at her seriously. \"It's dangerous,\" he said. \"If we get caught, those contacts will be exposed and they'll be punished. And if we keep using them, eventually the government will catch on and we'll lose our advantage.\"\n\nMei and MK exchanged a worried look. \"But if we don't use it, we might never find Ao Lie,\" MK said.\n\nBai Long Ma nodded. \"I know. But you have to understand, we can't just go around using this method whenever we want. We have to be careful.\"\n\nMei nodded thoughtfully. \"So how do we do it?\"\n\nBai Long Ma looked at her. \"I'll make the arrangements. I'll tell you where to meet the contact and what to say. But you have to promise me, you'll be careful. And if anything goes wrong, you cut and run.\"\n\nMei and MK nodded in agreement. They knew they couldn't afford to take any risks.",
