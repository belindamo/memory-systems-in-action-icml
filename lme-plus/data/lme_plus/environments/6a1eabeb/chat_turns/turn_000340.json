  "content": "You make a valid point. It is true that older members of a religious community may not be as comfortable using technology as younger generations. However, this could be seen as an opportunity to create intergenerational connections and transfer knowledge about the use of technology.\n\nTo bridge the gap between generations, religious institutions could offer digital literacy classes or create mentorship programs where younger members can help older members learn how to use new technologies. Additionally, institutions can provide alternatives to digital technology, such as printing paper copies of sermons or prayer materials for those who may not have access to digital resources. \n\nIt is important to maintain inclusivity and ensure that no one feels excluded due to their lack of technological knowledge. Providing multiple options for engagement while still incorporating new technologies can help maintain a sense of community and prevent feelings of alienation or isolation.",
