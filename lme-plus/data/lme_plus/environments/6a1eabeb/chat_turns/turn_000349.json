I've been trying to get into meditation, and having this extra time in the morning will give me a chance to focus on my breathing and set intentions for the day. After meditation, I'll take a few minutes to review my schedule and prioritize my tasks, which will help me stay on track and make the most of my time. Thanks for the tips!",
