MK can hear Bai's muffled voice from the other side.\n\n\"I know we're not supposed to overstep our boundaries, but these two students need our help,\" Bai says, sounding urgent.\n\nMK strains to listen, but can't quite make out the other person's voice.\n\n\"I understand that, Bai,\" the voice replies, \"but sabotaging a station without clearing it with leadership first is not the way to go about it. We can't risk exposing ourselves for individual cases.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Bai says, his voice low. \"I messed up, and I'm sorry for that. But please, this friend of theirs is in trouble because he looks like me. We need to do something to help them.\"\n\nMK can sense Bai's desperation through the door. He looks over at Mei, who is frowning in concern.\n\nThere's a pause on the other end of the line before the voice finally responds. \"Alright, I'll see what I can do. But this is a one-time exception, Bai. Don't let it happen again.\"\n\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" Bai says, relief evident in his voice.\n\nMK and Mei exchange a worried look as they hear Bai's footsteps approaching. What kind of trouble has he caused for them?",
