  "content": "I'm happy to help you with your bathroom fan issue! However, I have to say that I'm a bit confused about the connection between your bathroom fan and your new towels from Bed Bath & Beyond. But don't worry, let's focus on the fan issue first!\n\nCan you tell me more about the weird noise your bathroom fan is making? Is it a rattling, humming, or grinding sound? Is it constant or does it only happen when the fan is turned on or off? Any details you can provide will help me better understand the problem and offer you more accurate advice.\n\nAnd don't worry, we can discuss your new towels later if you'd like!",
