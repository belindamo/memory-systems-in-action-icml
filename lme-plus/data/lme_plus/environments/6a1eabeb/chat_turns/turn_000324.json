  "content": "The Snake Plant is an excellent choice for low-light conditions, and it's also very forgiving if you forget to water it from time to time. It's a great air purifier, and it's also known for its ability to grow upright, making it a great addition to any room.\n\nSince your living room doesn't get a lot of direct sunlight, you can place the Snake Plant in a spot that receives bright, indirect light. East- or west-facing windows are ideal, but it can also thrive under artificial lighting.\n\nHere are a few more tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Watering**: Water your Snake Plant sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's better to err on the side of caution.\n2. **Temperature**: Snake Plants prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C), which is perfect for most living rooms.\n3. **Humidity**: Snake Plants prefer a relatively low humidity, around 40-50%, which is typical for most indoor spaces.\n4. **Fertilization**: Feed your Snake Plant with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) to promote healthy growth.\n\nBy following these simple care tips, you'll be enjoying the benefits of your Snake Plant in no time!\n\nNow, imagine your cozy living room with a beautiful Snake Plant adding a touch of greenery and freshness. It's the perfect complement to your newly rearranged space!",
