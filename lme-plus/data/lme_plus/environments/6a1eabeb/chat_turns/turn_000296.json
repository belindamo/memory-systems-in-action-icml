Fueling your body for optimal performance is crucial for marathon training. A well-planned nutrition strategy can help you perform at your best, recover faster, and reduce your risk of injury.\n\nHere are some general tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Carbohydrates**: Focus on complex carbs like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which provide energy and fiber.\n2. **Protein**: Include lean protein sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based options like beans, lentils, and tofu to support muscle repair and recovery.\n3. **Hydration**: Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day, and make sure to hydrate during and after your runs.\n4. **Electrolytes**: Include electrolyte-rich foods like bananas (potassium), avocados (potassium), and nuts (magnesium) in your diet to help regulate fluid balance and nerve function.\n5. **Pre-run fueling**: Aim to eat a balanced meal with complex carbs, protein, and healthy fats 1-3 hours before your run.\n6. **Post-run recovery**: Focus on consuming carbohydrates and protein within 30-60 minutes after your run to aid in recovery.\n\nWhat's your current nutrition plan like?
