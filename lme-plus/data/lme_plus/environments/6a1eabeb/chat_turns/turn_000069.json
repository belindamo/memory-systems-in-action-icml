After further research, I couldn't find a video on Redfoo's official YouTube channel titled \"Party Rock Mondays 4\" or a video where he specifically remixes \"Werewolves of London.\" However, Redfoo did perform a live DJ set in 2010 that included a remix of \"Werewolves of London\" along with other songs. It's possible that this set was featured in a video on YouTube. Unfortunately, without more information or a specific link to the video you're referring to, it's hard for me to give you a more precise answer.",
