  "content": "First, we need to convert the given frequency distribution into a cumulative frequency distribution:\n\nU = (X - 130) / 20\n\n| U | No. of persons | Cumulative frequency |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| -2 | 7 | 7 |\n| -1 | 50 | 57 |\n| 0 | 80 | 137 |\n| 1 | 60 | 197 |\n| 2 | 3 | 200 |\n\nThe total number of persons is 200.\n\nTo calculate the median, we need to find the value of U for which the cumulative frequency is 100. From the cumulative frequency distribution, we can see that this occurs between U=-0.5 and U=0, with a cumulative frequency of 57+80=137. We can interpolate to find the exact value of U:\n\nMedian = 130 + 20\\*(100-57)/(80) = 136.25\n\nTo find the lower and upper quartiles, we need to find the values of U for which the cumulative frequencies are 50 and 150, respectively. From the cumulative frequency distribution, we can see that these occur between U=-1 and U=-0.5 for the lower quartile, and between U=0 and U=1 for the upper quartile. We can interpolate to find the exact values of U:\n\nLower quartile = 130 + 20\\*(50-7)/(50+0.5\\*50) = 127.67\n\nUpper quartile = 130 + 20\\*(150-137)/(60) = 134\n\nTo find the 3rd decile, we need to find the value of U for which the cumulative frequency is 0.3\\*200=60. From the cumulative frequency distribution, we can see that this occurs at U=1, with a cumulative frequency of 7+50+80+60=197. We can interpolate to find the exact value of U:\n\n3rd decile = 130 + 20\\*(60-50)/(60) = 131.67\n\nTo find the 98th percentile, we need to find the value of U for which the cumulative frequency is 0.98\\*200=196. From the cumulative frequency distribution, we can see that this occurs between U=1 and U=2, with a cumulative frequency of 197+3=200. We can interpolate to find the exact value of U:\n\n98th percentile = 130 + 20\\*(196-197)/(3) = 128.33\n\nTherefore, the median is 136.25, the lower quartile is 127.67, the upper quartile is 134, the 3rd decile is 131.67, and the 98th percentile is 128.33.",
