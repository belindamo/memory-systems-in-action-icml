Mei spoke up first, \"So, what do you suggest we do then?\"\n\nBai sighed, \"I wish there was more we could do. We're mostly a group of university students who got in trouble for speaking out against the Queen's regime. The rebellion took us in to keep us safe, but we're not as well-equipped as the main group.\"\n\nMK chimed in, \"But we have to do something. Ao Lie is one of us and we can't just leave him there.\"\n\nBai nodded, \"I understand how you feel. We can try to gather some more information, but we have to be careful. We don't want to draw too much attention to ourselves.\"\n\nMei spoke up again, \"Is there anything you can tell us about the prison system? Anything that might help us find Ao Lie?\"\n\nBai thought for a moment before responding, \"I don't know much about the prisons themselves, but I do know that there's one main prison in each major city. It's possible that's where he's being held.\"\n\nMK nodded, \"That's a start. We'll have to gather more information before we can make any moves.\"\n\nMei added, \"And we'll have to be careful not to get caught. We don't want to end up in there with Ao Lie.\"\n\nBai nodded in agreement, \"Yes, that would be counterproductive. I'll do what I can to help you from here, but you'll have to be the ones to take the risk.\"\n\nMei and MK exchanged another look, both determined to save their friend.",
