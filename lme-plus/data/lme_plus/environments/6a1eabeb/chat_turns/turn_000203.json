The personalized touch will make the gift even more special and meaningful to your grandma.\n\nAnd what a wonderful idea to invite your grandma to share a cup of tea with you over a video call! It's a great way to spend quality time together, even if you're apart. I'm sure your grandma will appreciate the thought and the opportunity to connect with you in a more personal way.\n\nRemember, it's the thought and love behind the gift that matters most, not the price tag or the complexity of the gift itself. Your grandma will surely appreciate the effort you're putting into creating a customized tea blend and the thoughtfulness behind it.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you and your grandma a wonderful time celebrating her special day!",
