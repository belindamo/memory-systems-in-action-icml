  "content": "I'm still in the process of analyzing the literature and identifying key themes and debates. However, I've noticed that there seems to be a growing interest in the application of advanced statistical methods to my field of research. I've also come across some debates surrounding the limitations of current methodologies and the need for more innovative approaches. I'm planning to explore these themes further and see how they relate to my research question.\n\nBy the way, I received positive feedback from my advisor exactly one week after submitting my thesis proposal, which has given me a lot of motivation to stay on track with my research.",
