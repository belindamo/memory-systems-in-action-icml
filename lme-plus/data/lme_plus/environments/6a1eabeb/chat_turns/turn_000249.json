For a screenwriter, here are the most important pieces of information to include on your business card:\n\n**Must-Haves:**\n\n1. **Name**: Your full name, as you'd like to be credited or referred to in the industry.\n2. **Contact Information**:\n\t* Email address: A professional email address that you check regularly.\n\t* Phone number: Your cell phone number, or a number where you can be reached.\n3. **Title/Profession**: \"Screenwriter\" or \"Writer\" is sufficient, but you can also include \"Filmmaker\" or \"Storyteller\" if you feel it's relevant.\n\n**Nice-to-Haves:**\n\n1. **Website or Online Portfolio**: If you have a website or online portfolio showcasing your work, include the URL. This can be a great way for others to learn more about your writing and projects.\n2. **Social Media Handles**: If you're active on social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn, consider including your handles. This can help others connect with you and stay up-to-date on your projects.\n3. **Genre or Specialty**: If you have a specific genre or area of expertise (e.g., comedy, horror, animation), you can include it on your card to help others understand your focus.\n4. **Representative or Agency**: If you have a agent, manager, or production company representing you, include their contact information or logo.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n\n1. **Too much information**: Keep your business card clean and easy to read. Avoid cluttering it with too many details or unnecessary information.\n2. **Unprofessional email addresses**: Make sure your email address is professional and not something that may raise eyebrows (e.g., \"partyanimal123@example.com\").\n3. **Outdated information**: Ensure that your business card information is up-to-date and reflects your current contact details and professional status.\n\nHere's an example of what a screenwriter's business card might look like:\n\n**Front:**\n\n* Name: Jane Smith\n* Title: Screenwriter\n* Contact Information:\n\t+ Email: [jane.smith@example.com](mailto:jane.smith@example.com)\n\t+ Phone: 555-123-4567\n\n**Back:**\n\n* Website: janewrites.com\n* Twitter: @jane_writes\n* Genre: Comedy, Drama\n\nRemember to keep your business card design clean, simple, and easy to read.
