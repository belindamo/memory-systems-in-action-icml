Consistency is key, and it's great that you've been able to stick to it for three weeks.\n\nRegarding Habitica, it's an excellent choice! Setting both daily and weekly tasks can be a great way to utilize the app. Here's how you can approach it:\n\n**Daily Tasks:**\n\n* Set a daily task for your 30-minute cleaning routine. This will help you stay consistent and make it a habit.\n* You can also set daily tasks for smaller, quick cleaning tasks, like:\n\t+ Making your bed as soon as you get up\n\t+ Wiping down the kitchen counters after dinner\n\t+ Taking out the trash/recycling\n\n**Weekly Tasks:**\n\n* Set weekly tasks for more significant cleaning tasks, like:\n\t+ Cleaning the bathrooms\n\t+ Mopping the floors\n\t+ Doing laundry\n\t+ Cleaning the kitchen (deep clean)\n\nBy setting both daily and weekly tasks, you'll be able to maintain a consistent daily routine while also tackling more substantial tasks on a weekly basis. This will help you stay on top of cleaning and organization.\n\nIn Habitica, you can create a \"Daily\" habit for your 30-minute cleaning routine and set it to repeat daily. For weekly tasks, you can create a \"To-Do\" list with tasks that need to be completed on specific days of the week.\n\nRemember to start small and be realistic about what you can accomplish in a day or a week. You can always adjust your tasks and habits as needed.\n\nAs you continue using Habitica, don't forget to reward yourself for completing tasks and reaching milestones. This will help motivate you to keep up the good work!\n\nKeep me updated on your progress, and feel free to ask if you have any more questions or need further guidance!",
