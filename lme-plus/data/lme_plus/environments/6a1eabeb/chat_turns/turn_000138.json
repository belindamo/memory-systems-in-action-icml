  "content": "Bai Long Ma goes into another room. From behind the closed door, MK hears Bai talking with someone on what seems to be a video call. Bai insists they need to take advantage of the rebellion's resources to help these two students find their friend, and admits with some embarrassment that he sabotaged a station and this friend got arrested because he looked like Bai. Whoever Bai is talking to is annoyed to hear Bai sabotaged something without clearing it with rebel leadership first. Let's write that scene with details and dialogue.",
