However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal conversations or remember previous interactions, so I didn't know about Whiskers or her ear infection. But I'm happy to provide you with some general recommendations and advice!\n\nFor cat toys, here are some popular and highly-rated options:\n\n1. Wand Toys: These usually consist of a flexible rod with a lure or feather attachment on the end. They allow you to engage your cat in natural hunting behavior and provide exercise. Look for ones with durable materials and replaceable lures.\n2. Interactive Toys: Toys with bells, feathers, or other noise-makers can stimulate your cat's senses. Some popular options include puzzle toys, treat-dispensing toys, and hide-and-seek toys.\n3. Catnip Toys: Many cats love catnip, so consider toys filled with high-quality catnip or coated with catnip oil.\n\nAs for scratching posts, here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. Material: Cats often prefer scratching surfaces made of sisal rope, carpet, or corrugated cardboard.\n2. Height: Taller scratching posts can help stretch your cat's muscles and provide a sense of security.\n3. Stability: Look for scratching posts with a wide base or weighted bottom to prevent them from tipping over.\n4. Texture: Some cats prefer vertical scratching surfaces, while others prefer horizontal or inclined ones.\n\nSome popular online retailers for cat toys and scratching posts include:\n\n1. Amazon\n2. Petco\n3. Chewy\n4. 1800PetMeds\n5. Etsy (for handmade or custom cat toys and scratching posts)\n\nWhen shopping online, read reviews and product descriptions carefully to ensure you're getting a high-quality product that meets your cat's needs.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to rotate your cat's toys regularly to keep them interesting and prevent boredom. You can also try DIY projects or upcycle old items to create new toys and scratching surfaces for your cat!",
