I've also started tracking my meditation and reading habits in the same journal, which has been really helpful in seeing how they affect my overall routine. By the way, I think it was three weeks ago when I decided to start setting my alarm clock 30 minutes earlier every day to give myself some extra time in the morning. Do you have any tips on how to make the most of that extra morning time?",
