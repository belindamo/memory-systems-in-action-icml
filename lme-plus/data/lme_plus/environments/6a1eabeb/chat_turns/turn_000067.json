  "content": "Redfoo, who is a member of the music group LMFAO, did indeed remix \"Werewolves of London.\" His version is called \"New Thang\" and was released in 2014. It features a sample of the distinctive \"ahh-ooo\" howling chorus from \"Werewolves of London\" and combines it with Redfoo's own lyrics and production. The resulting song is an upbeat dance track with a catchy melody and a party vibe.",
