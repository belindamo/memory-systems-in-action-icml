I have now listened to the video you provided, and I can confirm that the song Redfoo is remixing is indeed \"Werewolves of London\" by Warren Zevon.\n\nAs for the specific version he used in this remix, it sounds like a remastered or re-recorded version of the original track. The drums and bass sound slightly different than in the original, and there are some additional sound effects and vocal samples that are not present in the original version. However, it is still the same song and features the same iconic piano riff and howling chorus.\n\nIt's possible that Redfoo used an official remastered version of \"Werewolves of London,\" or he may have created his own remix using stems or samples from the original recording. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any more specific information on the version he used.",
