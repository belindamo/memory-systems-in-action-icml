He can hear Bai's muffled voice, but not the other side of the conversation.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" Bai is saying. \"But these two students, they're our friends. We have to help them find their friend. And besides, we don't even know where he is yet.\"\n\nMK strains to hear the other person's response, but only catches snippets of their conversation.\n\n\"I don't care if it was a small station,\" Bai continues. \"It still caused damage to their system. And our friend got arrested because he looks like me.\"\n\nThere's a pause before the other person responds, and MK can almost hear their irritation through the closed door.\n\n\"You should have cleared it with the leadership before you did something like that,\" the voice says. \"This is exactly why we have protocols in place.\"\n\nBai responds with a sheepish tone. \"I know, I know. I just...I got carried away. And now we have to deal with the consequences.\"\n\nMK hears the sound of the call ending and quickly straightens up as Bai walks back into the room.\n\n\"Everything okay?\" MK asks, trying to sound nonchalant.\n\nBai gives him a small smile. \"Just talking with the higher-ups. They're not thrilled that I sabotaged a station without clearing it with them first.\"\n\nMK raises an eyebrow. \"You did what now?\"\n\nBai looks slightly sheepish. \"I cut the power to one of the soldiers' stations in another city. It was only supposed to be temporary, but it ended up causing a lot more damage than I anticipated. And then, unfortunately, your friend got caught up in it because he looks like me.\"\n\nMK can't help but shake his head. \"You really didn't think this through, did you?\"\n\nBai lets out a rueful laugh. \"No, I guess I didn't. But I'll deal with the consequences. Right now, let's focus on finding your friend.\"",
