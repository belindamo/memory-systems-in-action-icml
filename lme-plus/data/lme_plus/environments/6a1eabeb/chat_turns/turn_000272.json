  "content": "That's great to hear that the hair mask is helping! A hair mask can provide an intense dose of moisture and nourishment to your hair, and using it once a week can be a great addition to your hair care routine.\n\nFinding the right shampoo can be a process, but it's worth it to find one that works well for your hair. Since you're already using a hair mask, you might want to look for a shampoo that complements the ingredients in your mask. Here are a few questions to help me narrow down some recommendations:\n\n1. What type of hair do you have (dry, oily, combination, curly, straight)?\n2. Are there any specific ingredients you're looking for or avoiding in a shampoo (e.g. sulfates, parabens, silicones)?\n3. Do you have any hair concerns besides dryness (e.g. dandruff, itchiness, color-treated hair)?\n4. Are you open to trying a shampoo from a specific brand or price range?\n\nLet me know your answers to these questions and I can give you some personalized shampoo recommendations!",
