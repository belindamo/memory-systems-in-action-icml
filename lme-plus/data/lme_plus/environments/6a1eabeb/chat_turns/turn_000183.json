However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal schedule or calendar, so I don't know when your next soccer game with your coworkers is.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you find out:\n\n1. Check your calendar: Take a look at your personal calendar, whether it's digital or physical, to see if you've written down the date and time of your next soccer game.\n2. Ask a teammate: Reach out to one of your coworkers who is also on the soccer team and ask them when the next game is scheduled.\n3. Check your team's schedule: If you have a team website, group chat, or social media page, you can check the schedule to see when the next game is.\n\nOnce you find out the date and time of your next game, you can plan your fitness schedule around it. Good luck, and have fun playing soccer with your coworkers!",
