      "content": "Business cards are a great way to make a professional impression and make it easy for others to remember you and get in touch. For a screenwriter, here are the most important pieces of information to include on your business card:\n\n**Must-Haves:**\n\n1. **Name**: Your full name, as you'd like to be credited or referred to in the industry.\n2. **Contact Information**:\n\t* Email address: A professional email address that you check regularly.\n\t* Phone number: Your cell phone number, or a number where you can be reached.\n3. **Title/Profession**: \"Screenwriter\" or \"Writer\" is sufficient, but you can also include \"Filmmaker\" or \"Storyteller\" if you feel it's relevant.\n\n**Nice-to-Haves:**\n\n1. **Website or Online Portfolio**: If you have a website or online portfolio showcasing your work, include the URL. This can be a great way for others to learn more about your writing and projects.\n2. **Social Media Handles**: If you're active on social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn, consider including your handles. This can help others connect with you and stay up-to-date on your projects.\n3. **Genre or Specialty**: If you have a specific genre or area of expertise (e.g., comedy, horror, animation), you can include it on your card to help others understand your focus.\n4. **Representative or Agency**: If you have a agent, manager, or production company representing you, include their contact information or logo.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n\n1. **Too much information**: Keep your business card clean and easy to read. Avoid cluttering it with too many details or unnecessary information.\n2. **Unprofessional email addresses**: Make sure your email address is professional and not something that may raise eyebrows (e.g., \"partyanimal123@example.com\").\n3. **Outdated information**: Ensure that your business card information is up-to-date and reflects your current contact details and professional status.\n\nHere's an example of what a screenwriter's business card might look like:\n\n**Front:**\n\n* Name: Jane Smith\n* Title: Screenwriter\n* Contact Information:\n\t+ Email: [jane.smith@example.com](mailto:jane.smith@example.com)\n\t+ Phone: 555-123-4567\n\n**Back:**\n\n* Website: janewrites.com\n* Twitter: @jane_writes\n* Genre: Comedy, Drama\n\nRemember to keep your business card design clean, simple, and easy to read.

      "content": "Including your website and Twitter handle on your business card is a great way to make it easy for others to connect with you online.\n\nRegarding bringing copies of your script to AFI Fest, it's a common debate among screenwriters. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Having a physical copy**: Having a script in hand can be a great conversation starter and show that you're serious about your work.\n2. **Impromptu meetings**: You never know when you might meet someone who's interested in reading your script. Having a copy with you can be a great opportunity to capitalize on the moment.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Coming on too strong**: If you're too pushy or aggressive about sharing your script, it can be off-putting to industry professionals. You want to build relationships, not just pitch your script.\n2. **Unsolicited materials**: Many industry professionals, especially at festivals, are bombarded with scripts and materials. They might not appreciate receiving unsolicited scripts, especially if they're not actively looking for new projects.\n\nHere's a balanced approach:\n\n1. **Bring a few copies**: Bring a limited number of scripts (e.g., 5-10) in case you meet someone who's genuinely interested in reading your work.\n2. **Don't push it**: Don't force your script on anyone or try to pitch it to everyone you meet. Focus on building relationships and having conversations about the industry, films, and storytelling.\n3. **Be prepared to discuss your work**: If someone expresses interest in your script, be prepared to discuss your project, its themes, and your inspiration. This shows you're passionate about your work and willing to engage in a conversation.\n4. **Follow up**: If you do share your script with someone, be sure to follow up with a polite email or message to thank them for their time and interest.\n\nRemember, AFI Fest is a great opportunity to network, learn, and build relationships. Focus on being genuine, respectful, and open to feedback, and you'll be more likely to make meaningful connections that can help your career in the long run."
