      "content": "In this piece of writing, Justin is discussing the concept of delegation or outsourcing and how entrepreneurs often have a hard time passing off tasks to others. He argues that while we may think we can do everything ourselves, the truth is that there are only a few things we can do exceptionally well, and there are certain things we should absolutely outsource. Justin suggests that we drop our ego and consider all the options on the table when life hands us a huge basket of lemons. He argues that outsourcing is simply and effectively getting something done by another company or person and their work, while passing the buck off is handing a situation off to someone with blind ignorance and hoping or assuming it will get done.\n\nJustin shares his experience working at a small print shop where outsourcing was a major part of the business process, and it helped the company to succeed. He also acknowledges that the thought of delegating or outsourcing any part of our business can be difficult for real entrepreneurs who created their business from the ground up. He concludes by saying that sometimes we have to face the fact that most things can be delegated to people who just can't do it exactly the way we would, but they still wind up with the same result, and \"good enough is good enough.\""

      "content": "here's more of Justin's writing. Please write a 2 paragraph summary on the additional facts and writing styles and other info learned from the writing pieces:Building character through dead copywriters and marketing legends\nAs I slammed the cellar shut, to the temple of wisdom, and climbed to the thirteenth step, I discovered something remarkable.\nIt was kind of like a sixth sense.\nThis sort of \u201cinfinite intelligence\u201d went into my mind, almost like the feeling we get when we get an epiphany, or a brilliant idea... a brain fart, so to speak.\nI mean, this was no accident.\nI did do A LOT of reading, writing, watching, and mastering or trying to fully understand everything that was put in front of my sorry mug.\nTrust me, I did a lot of falling, failing, screwed everything up.\nAnyway, I had this thought... like a dream, or a fantasy\u2014mixing my woo-woo spirit energy up in a big cauldron with some mental nuggets and intellectual spice flakes spilling into the mix.\nWhat was the meaning of this?\nI dunno,\nBut, picture you're in your lair. Sipping on a hot cup of tea.\nFeeling miserable, and thoughts just racing through the mind. What the heck am I going to write about today?\nthen in the corner of the desk (more like the kitchen table that nobody really uses...) there's this cylinder tube, which is about the size of a paper towel tube.\nOpen it up and there's this old sea scroll looking piece of paper, like something you would see in an old pirate movie or what the wrote the declaration of independence on.\nThere's lots of cursive writing, and the lettering is all tiny...eyes are getting all fuzzy trying to read the thing.\nThen, looking down, past the text there's this big picture. You see (seven) men sitting around the table, and because delirium is a silent beast, it kinda puts ones eyes in fatigue and then its only natural to go back and read the text.\nI gotta say, one gets very sleepy sipping on Chamomile tea, it doesn't take much at this point to drift off, especially after a long day of work, feeling miserable, and only being able to read with candle light due to the power failure.\nSo sleepy...so, so, sleepy.\nAll of a sudden, at the table...there's this cabinet of people, all in conversation. It was kind of like those round table meetings you see in the movies and such. Only this time it was different. A lot different.\nEach member of the table, emerged, and stood in front of his chair and said his name, and his contribution to society...\nhow they managed to raise themselves out of poverty...\nand, become super successful ,and went through a brief \u201cwar-story\u201d like explanation of the events that occurred in their life, and the purpose of being in this master mind.\nWhoa.\nSo, the first guy introduces himself as Sir Gary Halbert. He goes into having the most success direct mail funnel, his coat-of-arms scheme, like Al Bundy on Married Children would brag about how good he was in high school foot ball... and then you hear the famous \u201cA-Pile vs. B-pile\u201d pitch we are all so familiar with as the crowd shuffles in...\nThen I hear Dale Carnegie. He mentions the importance of having this certain school of literature in all the libraries, how he is putting all kinds of funding into libraries, in order to preserve the long, lost and forgotten truths, that make men (and certain women) very successful.\nHe's turned the most shyest introverts into successful billionaires...\nAnd, that since its Dale, he compliments everyone in the room and makes sure he gets everyone's name right. He can make quite the impression, just in the way he made all these great friends and relationships and his ability to influence people and get others to learn and yield this great power.\nAs they turn to Napoleon Hill, you can see all the men look up and count on their fingers how many times they read his great books. Not to mention his 13 laws that have been pretty much tattooed I, or scratched into the steel of all these great successful men in business. \nIt's amazing, how almost 100 years since Napoleon wrote some of his best material, and all these years later, still holds up. (One can wonder if all the successful folks are just carbon copies of Napoleon Hill.)\nThen there's this breakthrough moment, the advertising legend Eugene Schwartz makes his introduction, and then reads a quote from his note pad that was written by (still alive) Brain Kurtz. Huh?\nAfter Eugene walks into the back of the room and pours himself a cup of coffee, but doesn't put the cream in right away, no he sets the cup down next to his spoon and cup of cream, then goes over to the right of the coffee machine and takes out this kitchen timer and sets it for 33 minutes, then places it back on the mantle, right under a big blown up picture of Dan Kennedy \u2026\nThe desire to acquire the freedom of thought and courage, and clarity with which to express convictions, which has so much distinguished who you are!\nAcquiring the marvelous ability to be patient and the ability to focus, and concentrate the study of \u201ccause and effect...picture: Darwin, himself was also standing in the shadows of this great room.\nThis new desire, to build one's character... have keen sense of justice, a good sense of humor, and not have need to \u201crush\u201d it, and a good understanding of humanity and tough skin, so you can tolerate others behavior.\nWho couldn't be touched by.... and their life work, which has brought so many such happiness and peace of mind.\nOne can really go far in life, by having this ability to get a lot of organized effort together and apply it efficiently and effectively enough to build a grand industrial enterprise.\nI mean just look at the copywriters from the real \u201cMad Men\u201d era...the kinda stuff that went down on Madison Avenue\u2014back in the day....writing these ads. What they did, they essentially supplied us, the whole world of advertising, and many entrepreneurs with A LOT of material to building great ads. Swipe files galore.\nWho couldn't benefit from the persistence, determinations poise, self-confidence these great ad writers had (you know, the one that has the affair at the office, the other guy with the eye patch their, you got another one smoking a pipe and down the hall a guy selling fancy cigars right out of the box.)\nMastering poverty, organizing, simplifying, unifying, to make it easier for others to also follow in the foot steps.\n\nI knew that almost every deep seated desire has the potential of causing on the seek some sort of outward expression through which that very desire can be translated into reality.\nMost of us start to become aware, at some point, that \u201cself-suggestion\u201d is an extremely powerful force and factor in building character, and this is the sole principle through which a character is built.\nThis is everything from a story character, movie character, a character in a show, or a song, it can be a number of things.\n\nTo be continued?\nJustin McDonald"

      "content": "Justin continues to explore his personal development journey through his writing. In this piece, he describes discovering a remarkable, sixth sense-like feeling that he attributes to an \"infinite intelligence\" that he has gained through reading, writing, watching, and trying to understand everything that he can. Justin imagines finding an old scroll in a tube that transports him to a \"round table\" of influential marketers and writers who introduce themselves and share their contributions to society. He recounts the success stories of these figures, including direct mail expert Gary Halbert, author and speaker Dale Carnegie, and advertising legend Eugene Schwartz.\n\nJustin's writing style continues to be highly descriptive and introspective, with a strong focus on his personal experiences and self-improvement goals. He also employs a dreamlike and fantastical tone, describing the experience of finding the old scroll as something akin to a fairy tale or pirate movie. Through his imagined encounter with the round table of successful marketers, Justin emphasizes the importance of building character and gaining a sense of patience, understanding, and humor to achieve success in life. Overall, Justin's writing showcases his unique style and perspective on personal growth and development."
