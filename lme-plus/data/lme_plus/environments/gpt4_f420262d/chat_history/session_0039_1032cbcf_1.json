Your idea for a simple squares game sounds like a great way to get everyone involved and invested in the game. Here are a few suggestions to consider:\n\n**Squares Game Variations:**\n\n1. **Simple Squares**: Your idea of selling squares for a set amount of money is a great way to start. You can divide the grid into 100 squares, and people can buy as many squares as they want.\n2. **Quarterly Payouts**: Instead of just paying out at the end of the game, consider paying out a percentage of the pot at the end of each quarter. This will keep people engaged throughout the game.\n3. **Progressive Payouts**: You could increase the payout amount for each quarter, with the largest payout at the end of the game.\n4. **Multi-Game Squares**: If you're hosting a party with multiple games, consider running a squares game across multiple games. This can add an extra layer of excitement and strategy.\n\n**Betting Pool Ideas:**\n\n1. **Prop Bets**: Offer prop bets on specific aspects of the game, such as the number of touchdowns, field goals, or even the length of the national anthem.\n2. **Over/Under Bets**: Allow people to bet on the total points scored in the game, with options for over or under a certain number.\n3. **MVP Betting**: Let people bet on who will be the MVP of the game, with odds for each player.\n\n**Tips and Tricks:**\n\n1. **Clear Rules**: Make sure to clearly explain the rules of the squares game and betting pool to all participants.\n2. **Set a Budget**: Decide on a budget for the pot and stick to it to avoid any disputes.\n3. **Keep it Fun**: Remember, the goal is to have fun and enjoy the game with friends. Don't let the betting pool or squares game overshadow the actual game.\n\nI hope these ideas help you plan a fun and engaging betting pool and squares game for your party!"
