      "content": "Google Sheets is an excellent choice for your movie watchlist. It's easy to use, collaborative, and accessible from anywhere.\n\nIncluding a column for the date you added the movie to your watchlist is a fantastic idea! This can provide valuable insights into your viewing habits and help you identify:\n\n1. **Long-standing interests:** You might be surprised to see how long some movies have been on your list. This can help you prioritize them or realize that your tastes have changed over time.\n2. **Trends and patterns:** You might notice that you tend to add certain types of movies or genres during specific times of the year or after particular events (e.g., awards season, festivals, or holidays).\n3. **Discovery rates:** By tracking the date added, you can see how quickly you're discovering new movies and adding them to your list.\n\nTo implement this, simply add a column with a header like \"Added to Watchlist\" or \"Date Added.\" You can then use the `TODAY()` function in Google Sheets to automatically populate the current date when you add a new movie to your list.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n| Movie Title | Director | Release Year | Genre | Rating | Watched | Notes | Added to Watchlist |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Am\u00e9lie | Jean-Pierre Jeunet | 2001 | Rom-Com | 8.1 |  |  | =TODAY() |\n\nWhen you add a new movie, the `TODAY()` function will automatically insert the current date in the \"Added to Watchlist\" column.\n\nRemember to format the column to display dates in a readable format, such as MM/DD/YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nNow, go ahead and set up your Google Sheet, and start adding your movies!"
