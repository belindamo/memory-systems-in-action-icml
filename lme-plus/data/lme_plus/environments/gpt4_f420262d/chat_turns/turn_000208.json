  "content": "I remember you mentioning earlier that you finally made it to the indie bookshop last Saturday and that the store is adorable, and the owner is super knowledgeable about literature. You even ended up buying two novels and a book of poetry, and the owner gave you a 10% discount since it was your first purchase. Would you recommend the bookshop to others, and is there anything in particular that you liked about it?",
