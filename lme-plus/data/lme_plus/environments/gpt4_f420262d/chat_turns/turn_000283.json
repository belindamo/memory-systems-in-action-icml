You'll have a better chance of getting tickets and choosing your preferred seats.\n\nHowever, if you're flexible with your concert plans and willing to take a risk, waiting for last-minute deals might work in your favor. Just be prepared for the possibility that tickets might not be available or might be more expensive than you're willing to pay.\n\nIn your case, buying tickets 2 weeks in advance was a good call, considering Imagine Dragons is a popular band and Barclays Center is a large venue. You got to secure your tickets and enjoy the concert with Mike and Emma!\n\nRemember to always research the ticketing website, read reviews, and understand the ticketing policies before making a purchase. Happy concert-going!",
