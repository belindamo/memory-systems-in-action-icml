  "content": "I'm glad you mentioned that delay, but I'm happy to help you with your Spirit Airlines question!\n\nAccording to Spirit Airlines' baggage policy, the maximum size for a personal item is:\n\n* 18 x 14 x 8 inches (45.7 x 35.5 x 20.3 cm)\n\nThis is the maximum size for a personal item that can fit under the seat in front of you. Remember, this is a strict policy, and if your personal item exceeds these dimensions, you might be required to gate-check it or pay for a carry-on bag.\n\nBefore your trip to Fort Lauderdale, I recommend double-checking your luggage dimensions to ensure they meet Spirit's requirements. You can also consider packing light to avoid any potential issues or additional fees.\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you have a wonderful spring break trip!",
