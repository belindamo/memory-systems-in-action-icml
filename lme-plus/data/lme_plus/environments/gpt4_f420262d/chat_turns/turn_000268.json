  "content": "I'm really enjoying the classes, thanks for asking! My instructor Maria is great, and she breaks down the steps really well. I was a bit nervous at first because I'd never taken a dance class before, but she made me feel comfortable. I've been going to the classes regularly, and I've noticed that my footwork has improved a lot. Do you have any recommendations for dance events or festivals in my area? I went to a salsa social at a club downtown last weekend and had a blast, and I'm thinking of attending a bachata festival next month.",
