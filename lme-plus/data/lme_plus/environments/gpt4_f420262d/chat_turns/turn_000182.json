I've been following a few authors and thought leaders in the self-improvement space, and I've been actively engaging with their content by asking questions and sharing my own experiences. One of them, Bren\u00e9 Brown, even responded to my comment on her post about vulnerability, thanking me for sharing my story.\n\nSpeaking of social media, I've been noticing that I tend to engage more on Instagram, where the visual content makes it easier for me to quickly scan and respond to posts. On Twitter, I tend to engage more in discussions and debates, often using hashtags to join larger conversations. Do you think that's a common trend, or is it just me?",
