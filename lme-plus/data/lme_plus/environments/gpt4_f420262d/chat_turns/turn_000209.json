As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences, so I didn't visit the indie bookshop or make any purchases. I exist solely to provide information and assist with conversations.\n\nI'm happy to help you explore the bookshop, though! If you'd like, I can try to find information about the shop online, such as reviews or descriptions, to help you decide if you'd like to visit.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help with!",
