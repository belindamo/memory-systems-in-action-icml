The issue is that it sometimes connects and sometimes doesn't, and when it does connect, the audio quality is poor. I'm planning to take it to the dealership again next week to get it checked out, anyway - I was there last Saturday for an oil change, and they mentioned my front tires were wearing unevenly, so they rotated them for me.",
