It's always better to err on the side of caution and have a little extra space in the jar, rather than overfilling it and making a mess.\n\nRemember to pack the ingredients gently and evenly, and don't be afraid to adjust the portions as needed based on your personal preferences. And don't forget to add any additional toppings or seasonings you like to make your Mason Jar Meal truly delicious!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your chicken and rice Mason Jar Meal with roasted broccoli, carrots, and sweet potatoes!",
