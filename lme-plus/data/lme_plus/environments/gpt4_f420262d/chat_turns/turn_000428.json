Everyone was so into it, and it was amazing to see the Chiefs come back from behind like that. As for food and drink, Alex's party had an incredible spread - there were so many delicious options, but I think my favorite was the nachos. We also had a lot of fun drinks, including some special Super Bowl-themed cocktails.\n\nBut anyway, enough about the Super Bowl (for now, at least!). Back to the party planning... do you have any more ideas for the betting pool or squares game? I was thinking of doing a simple squares game where people can buy squares for a set amount of money, and then the winners get a percentage of the pot at the end of each quarter. What do you think?",
