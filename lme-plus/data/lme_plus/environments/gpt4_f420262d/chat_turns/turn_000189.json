  "content": "Excellent idea on adding the \"Program Since\" column!\n\nAnd, yes, you can definitely set up a reminder system within the spreadsheet to notify you when you're close to reaching a reward threshold. Here are a few ways to do it:\n\n**Method 1: Conditional Formatting**\n\n1. Add a new column, e.g., \"Reward Threshold\"\n2. Enter the reward threshold value for each program (e.g., 200 stars for a free drink at The Daily Grind)\n3. Use conditional formatting to highlight the row when the \"Points/Balance\" value is within a certain range of the reward threshold (e.g., 10-20 points away)\n\t* Format: `=AND(A2>=B2-20, A2<=B2)` (assuming Points/Balance in column A, Reward Threshold in column B, and you want to highlight when within 20 points of the threshold)\n\n**Method 2: Custom Formula Alert**\n\n1. Add a new column, e.g., \"Alert\"\n2. Create a custom formula to check when the \"Points/Balance\" value is close to the reward threshold\n\t* Formula: `=IF(A2>=B2-20, \"ALERT: Close to reward!\", \"\")` (assuming Points/Balance in column A, Reward Threshold in column B, and you want to alert when within 20 points of the threshold)\n3. Use this formula in the \"Alert\" column to display a message when the condition is met\n\n**Method 3: Google Sheets Script (if you're using Google Sheets)**\n\n1. Create a script that checks the spreadsheet for rows where the \"Points/Balance\" value is close to the reward threshold\n2. Set up a trigger to run the script at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly)\n3. Use the script to send you an email notification or create a notification in the spreadsheet when a reward threshold is approaching\n\nHere's an example script:\n```javascript\nfunction checkRewardThresholds() {\n  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();\n  var dataRange = sheet.getDataRange();\n  var values = dataRange.getValues();\n  \n  for (var i = 1; i < values.length; i++) {\n    var row = values[i];\n    var points = row[2]; // assuming Points/Balance in column C\n    var threshold = row[3]; // assuming Reward Threshold in column D\n    var buffer = 20; // adjust the buffer value as needed\n    \n    if (points >= threshold - buffer && points <= threshold) {\n      var message = \"ALERT: You're close to a reward in \" + row[0] + \"!\"; // assuming Program Name in column A\n      MailApp.sendEmail(\"your_email@example.com\", \"Loyalty Program Alert\", message);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nChoose the method that works best for you, and you'll be notified when you're close to redeeming that free drink at The Daily Grind!",
