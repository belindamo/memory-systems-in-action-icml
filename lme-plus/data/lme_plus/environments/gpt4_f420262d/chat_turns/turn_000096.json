Some banks may offer fee-free accounts for students, while others may charge monthly fees.\n2. **Branch and ATM network**: Each bank has its own network of branches and ATMs. Some banks have a more extensive network than others, which might be important if you plan to travel frequently.\n3. **Online and mobile banking**: Banks offer online banking and mobile apps, but the user experience and features may differ.\n4. **Customer service**: Some banks are known for their customer service, while others may have longer wait times or less helpful staff.\n5. **Student-specific services**: Some banks offer special services for international students, such as multilingual support or student-specific accounts.\n\n**Fees to be aware of**\n\n1. **Monthly account fees**: Some banks charge a monthly fee for maintaining an account, which can range from $5 to $30.\n2. **Transaction fees**: You may be charged for certain transactions, such as:\n\t* ATM withdrawals ( domestic or international)\n\t* EFTPOS transactions\n\t* Online transactions\n\t* International money transfers\n3. **Overdraft fees**: If you overdraw your account, you may be charged a fee, which can be significant.\n4. **International transaction fees**: When you use your debit or credit card for international transactions, you may be charged a fee, which can range from 1% to 3% of the transaction amount.\n5. **Currency conversion fees**: When you convert currency, you may be charged a fee, which can vary depending on the bank and the exchange rate.\n\n**Other banking considerations**\n\n1. **Interest rates**: If you plan to save money in your account, look for banks with competitive interest rates.\n2. **Mobile payment options**: Some banks offer mobile payment options like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay.\n3. **Card security**: Look for banks that offer secure debit and credit cards with features like chip technology and contactless payments.\n4. **Multi-currency accounts**: If you expect to receive or send money in multiple currencies, consider a bank that offers multi-currency accounts.\n\n**Waiting until you arrive in Melbourne**\n\nIf you're still having trouble with the online application system, it might be easier to wait until you arrive in Melbourne to open a bank account. You can visit a bank branch in person and get assistance from a representative. Additionally, you'll be able to ask questions and get a better understanding of the bank's services and fees.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that you may need to provide additional documentation, such as a proof of address, which might take some time to obtain. You can also consider opening a temporary account or a travel money card to manage your finances until you open a regular bank account.\n\nI hope this information helps you make an informed decision about banking in Australia!",
