  "content": "In this piece of writing, Justin is discussing the concept of delegation or outsourcing and how entrepreneurs often have a hard time passing off tasks to others. He argues that while we may think we can do everything ourselves, the truth is that there are only a few things we can do exceptionally well, and there are certain things we should absolutely outsource. Justin suggests that we drop our ego and consider all the options on the table when life hands us a huge basket of lemons. He argues that outsourcing is simply and effectively getting something done by another company or person and their work, while passing the buck off is handing a situation off to someone with blind ignorance and hoping or assuming it will get done.\n\nJustin shares his experience working at a small print shop where outsourcing was a major part of the business process, and it helped the company to succeed. He also acknowledges that the thought of delegating or outsourcing any part of our business can be difficult for real entrepreneurs who created their business from the ground up. He concludes by saying that sometimes we have to face the fact that most things can be delegated to people who just can't do it exactly the way we would, but they still wind up with the same result, and \"good enough is good enough.\"",
