When you book your ticket, you'll be assigned a seat randomly. However, you can pay extra to choose your seat in advance, which is called \"Even More Space\" seats. These seats offer more legroom (up to 37 inches) and are available for an additional fee, ranging from $10 to $25 per seat, depending on the flight.\n\nIf you don't want to pay for Even More Space, you can still choose your seat from the remaining available seats for free, but you'll need to do so during check-in, which opens 24 hours before your flight. Keep in mind that seat selection is subject to availability, and popular seats like aisle or window seats might be taken quickly.\n\n**Amenities:**\nJetBlue is known for its modern aircraft and amenities. Here's what you can expect on your flight from BOS to FLL:\n\n* **Free Live TV:** JetBlue offers 36 channels of free live TV, including sports, news, and entertainment programming.\n* **Free Wi-Fi:** You'll have access to fast, free Wi-Fi throughout the flight, so you can stay connected or stream your favorite content.\n* **Snacks and Drinks:** JetBlue offers a selection of free snacks, including Terra Chips, animal crackers, and peanuts. You can also purchase additional snacks and drinks, like sandwiches, salads, and beer, from their in-flight menu.\n* **Comfortable Seats:** JetBlue's seats are designed to be comfortable, with a 32-inch pitch (legroom) and adjustable headrests.\n\n**In-Flight Entertainment:**\nJetBlue's in-flight entertainment system, called \"Fly-Fi,\" is highly rated by passengers. You can access a wide selection of movies, TV shows, and games on your personal device (phone, tablet, or laptop) through their free Wi-Fi network. The system is user-friendly, and you can even pause and resume your content where you left off.\n\nIn comparison to American Airlines, JetBlue's system is generally considered more reliable and user-friendly. However, it's worth noting that JetBlue's system is designed for personal devices, so you won't find seat-back screens like you might on some American Airlines flights.\n\nConsidering your previous experience with American Airlines' in-flight entertainment system, you might appreciate JetBlue's more modern and reliable approach.\n\nHow do you feel about JetBlue's amenities and seat selection process? Are there any other concerns or questions you have before booking your flight?",
