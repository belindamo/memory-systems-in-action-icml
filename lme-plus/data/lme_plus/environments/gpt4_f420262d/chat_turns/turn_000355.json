However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have have access to real-time information, and my knowledge cutoff is around 2021.\n\nAs a result, I don't have information about the headlining acts for this year's Middle of the Map Fest. The festival's lineup is usually announced a few months before the event, and it changes every year.\n\nI recommend checking the official Middle of the Map Fest website, social media channels, or local music blogs for the latest information on this year's lineup. They usually announce the headlining acts and the full schedule in the weeks leading up to the festival.\n\nYou can also sign up for their newsletter or follow their social media accounts to stay updated on the latest announcements and festival news.\n\nI apologize for not being able to provide you with the information you're looking for, but I hope you'll find the perfect way to stay informed about the festival's lineup!",
