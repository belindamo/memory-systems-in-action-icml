This is a common issue for international students, and banks are aware of it. The letter should be on the university's or accommodation provider's official letterhead and include the following information:\n\n1. Your name\n2. Your student ID number (if applicable)\n3. Your address in Melbourne (even if it's a temporary address)\n4. A statement confirming your enrollment or accommodation arrangement\n\nThis letter can serve as a temporary proof of address until you receive a lease agreement or utility bill.\n\n**Opening an account before arrival**\n\nSome banks in Australia allow international students to open an account before arriving in the country, while others may require you to visit a branch in person after arrival. It depends on the bank's policies and procedures.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1. **Check the bank's website**: Look for information on their website about opening an account for international students. Some banks may have specific instructions or online applications for international students.\n2. **Contact the bank's customer support**: Reach out to the bank's customer service department via phone, email, or live chat (if available). Explain your situation and ask if you can open an account before arriving in Australia. They may be able to provide guidance or offer alternative solutions.\n3. **Ask your university's international student support**: Your university's international student support team may have experience with banks and be able to provide advice or assistance.\n\nIf the bank allows you to open an account before arrival, you may need to provide additional documentation, such as:\n\n1. A copy of your student visa\n2. A copy of your passport\n3. A letter from the university or accommodation provider (as mentioned earlier)\n\nKeep in mind that some banks may require you to visit a branch in person within a certain time frame (e.g., 6-12 months) to verify your identity and complete the account opening process.\n\n**Additional tips**\n\n1. **Be prepared to provide extra documentation**: As an international student, you may need to provide additional documentation to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations.\n2. **Check for online banking and mobile app availability**: Ensure the bank's online banking platform and mobile app are user-friendly and accessible from overseas, so you can manage your account before arriving in Australia.\n3. **Ask about international transaction fees**: Understand the fees associated with international transactions, as they may apply when you transfer money to your Australian account from overseas.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things for you! If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",
