  "content": "Ticks are most active during warm weather months, typically from March to November depending on location, but can be active year-round in some areas, depending on the species of ticks. Therefore, it's a good idea to check your horse for ticks year-round to ensure their health and well-being. You may also want to be more vigilant during peak tick season and after your horse has been in tall grass, wooded or brushy areas, or other areas that are known to harbor ticks. Taking these precautions will help to greatly reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases in your horse.",
