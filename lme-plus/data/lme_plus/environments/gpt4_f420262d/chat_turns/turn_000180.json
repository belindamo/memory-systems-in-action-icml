We ended up discussing some of the brands she collaborates with and how they're offering discounts for summer.\n\nThat's a great idea about reaching out to travel influencers! I've been following a few who specialize in beach destinations, and I'll definitely ask them for some insider tips on Hawaii and Cancun. Do you think they might be able to recommend some off-the-beaten-path spots or local secrets that aren't as touristy?",
