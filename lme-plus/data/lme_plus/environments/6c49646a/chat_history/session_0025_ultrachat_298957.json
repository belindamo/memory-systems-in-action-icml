      "content": "The Preakness Stakes, the second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown, had to cope with reduced spectator attendance during the pandemic by implementing a range of measures. First, the event was postponed from May to October 2020, to give organizers more time to plan for a safe event. Then, the number of spectators was limited to 10,000, down from the average of 131,000 in previous years. To achieve this, the organizers used pods or small groups of seats, physically distanced from each other, to control the flow of people and ensure social distancing. The organizers also implemented mandatory mask-wearing, temperature checks, and health screenings before entering the venue. To avoid overcrowding, there were no general admission tickets sold, and only pre-reserved seating was allowed. The organizers also increased their cleaning protocols, installed hand sanitizer stations, and encouraged cashless payments. Finally, to reach a broader audience, the organizers live-streamed the race on various platforms, including NBC Sports, YouTube, and Twitter."

      "content": "Yes, there was a particular horse that stood out during the 2020 Preakness Stakes race. Swiss Skydiver, a three-year-old filly, made history by becoming the sixth filly to win the Preakness Stakes and the first in over a decade. She defeated the favorite, Authentic, in a thrilling stretch duel, finishing the 1 3/16 miles race in 1:53.28. Swiss Skydiver was ridden by jockey Robby Albarado and trained by Kenneth McPeek. Her victory in the Preakness Stakes cemented her status as one of the best three-year-old fillies of the year and put her in the running for the prestigious Horse of the Year award."

      "content": "As a language model, I cannot analyze or predict future events, but it is possible that we may see more female horses competing and winning in major races. Horse racing has historically been male-dominated, with fewer opportunities for female horses to showcase their talents. However, in recent years, there has been a growing trend of female horses competing and winning in major races, as more owners and trainers recognize their potential. Several well-known female horses, such as Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta, have achieved great success and helped pave the way for future generations of female horses. The industry is gradually becoming more inclusive, with more opportunities and support for female horses. It will be interesting to see how this trend continues to develop and whether we will see more female horses achieve great success in prominent races."
