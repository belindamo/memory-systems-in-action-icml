      "content": "Here are some tips to help craft a new headline:\nProposition, or Your \u201cSo What?\u201d\nAs a recruiter, most days I breeze through LinkedIn profiles fast and furiously. If you want my attention, you\u2019ll do yourself a tremendous service if your LinkedIn headline instantly showcases to me your \u201cso what?\u201d Why should I stop and take a closer look at you? Tell me\u2014in your headline.\n\nPMP-certified project manager - Known for successfully leading multi-million dollar projects in developing countries.\n\nIf I were looking for a certified project manager who could take it and run on a challenging international assignment? You\u2019d better believe I\u2019d read further into this guy\u2019s profile. He\u2019s got a good \u201cso what?\u201d The guy whose headline says \u201cProject Manager, [company I haven\u2019t heard of]\u201d\u2014I might pass. (Even if he put \u201cinternational development\u201d in his interests, which I\u2019ll never see.)\n\n2. Speak Directly to the Audience You Want to Entice\nYour LinkedIn headline (and, for that matter, your entire profile) should consider its target audience, and then speak directly to it. What will compel or seduce the decision-maker at the receiving end of your message? What does she likely care most about? Address that your headline.\n\nLet\u2019s assume for this next example that I\u2019m a robotics industry recruiter (which I actually am). I\u2019m a robotics recruiter, and I\u2019m looking for someone who knows how to program the heck out of all types of robots. This headline would catch my eye:\n\nCustomer-focused pro who can program every robot in your manufacturing facility. Specializing in ABB, FANUC, and Kawasaki robots.\n\n3. Be Specific\nAgain, consider who you\u2019re trying to reach with your headline, and how you can stand out from the competition. The more specific you can be, the better.\n\nTireless, caring Registered Nurse who helps pediatric cancer patients and their families feel at ease throughout treatment and recovery.\n\nIf I were looking for a nurse to care for children or cancer patients\u2014you bet I\u2019d give that profile I second look.\n\n4. Worm in the Important Keywords\nWhere don\u2019t keywords matter anymore, really? Indeed, keywords are important when it comes to your LinkedIn headline. What are the most likely terms or phrases someone looking for a \u201cyou\u201d might search to find you on LinkedIn? Embed as many of those as you can into your headline.\n\n5. Be Creative\nMemorable wins, always. (OK, unless it\u2019s scary memorable. That loses.) If you can use some attention-grabbing creativity and get the \u201cso what?\u201d about you across? You\u2019re an all-star.\n\nA couple of excellent examples of headline creativity:\n\nReliable pet-sitter who will find out and report back to you exactly what your dog is up to when you\u2019re not home.\n\nCopywriter who knows how to craft web content that goes viral. Oh, and you\u2019ll never beat me at Scrabble."
