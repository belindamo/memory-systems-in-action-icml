      "content": "It is difficult to satisfactorily predict COE prices for the Open Category, as the prices are determined through open bidding exercises conducted twice a month, and the price can fluctuate based on the demand. According to [[2](https://www.motorist.sg/article/330/11-factors-that-would-affect-coe-price-in-2019)], industry watchers expect COE prices to keep rising, possibly till 2023, after open category premiums hit S$99,999. However, as [[6](https://carbuyer.com.sg/2022-carbuyer-easy-guide-to-certificates-of-entitlement-coe/)], states once COE prices are in print, it is yesterday's news, and prices may change depending on the market behavior of the round that just passed.
