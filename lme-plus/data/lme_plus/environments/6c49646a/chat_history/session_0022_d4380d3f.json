Total savings over 5 years: $20/month \\* 12 months/year \\* 5 years = $1200\n2. ROI: ($1200 - $200) / $200 = 500%\n\nBased on this calculation, the ROI is 500%, which means you can expect to recover your investment in about 4-5 months. After that, you'll be saving money on your electricity bill for the remaining lifespan of the system.\n\n**Additional Benefits:**\n\nWhile the ROI calculation is promising, there are additional benefits to consider:\n\n* **Increased Safety and Security**: Solar-powered lights can improve outdoor safety and security, which can be invaluable.\n* **Environmentally Friendly**: Solar-powered lights reduce your carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.\n* **Low Maintenance**: Solar-powered lights require minimal maintenance, as they don't need to be plugged in or replaced frequently.\n* **Durability**: Many solar-powered lights come with a 5-year warranty or more, ensuring a long lifespan.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSolar-powered lights can be a worthwhile investment, especially considering the potential savings on your electricity bill. While the upfront cost might seem high, the long-term benefits and ROI make it a smart decision. Additionally, the environmental and safety benefits can provide added value to your investment.\n\nBefore making a final decision, be sure to research and compare prices, features, and warranties to find the best solar-powered lighting system for your needs."
