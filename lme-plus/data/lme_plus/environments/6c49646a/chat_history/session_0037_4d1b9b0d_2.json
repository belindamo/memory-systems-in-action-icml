      "content": "I'd be happy to help you find a great prime lens for portraits.\n\nFirst, let me just say that the Canon EOS 80D is a fantastic camera, and you've had some great experiences with it, I'm sure!\n\nNow, when it comes to prime lenses for portraits, there are several excellent options to consider. Here are a few factors to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Focal length**: A focal length between 50mm and 135mm is often ideal for portraits, as it provides a flattering perspective and compression.\n2. **Aperture**: A wide aperture (like f/1.4 or f/1.8) will help create a shallow depth of field, separating your subject from the background and adding a professional look to your portraits.\n3. **Image quality**: Look for lenses with high optical quality, minimal distortion, and good bokeh (out-of-focus area) rendering.\n\nBased on these factors, here are some prime lens recommendations for portraits:\n\n1. **Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM**: A budget-friendly, compact, and lightweight lens with a wide aperture and great image quality.\n2. **Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM**: A classic portrait lens with a medium telephoto focal length, wide aperture, and excellent image quality.\n3. **Sigma 50mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art**: A high-end lens with exceptional image quality, a wide aperture, and a robust build.\n4. **Tamron 45mm f/1.8 Di VC USD**: A versatile lens with a unique focal length, wide aperture, and image stabilization.\n\nAll of these lenses are compatible with your Canon EOS 80D camera. You can check reviews, compare prices, and read more about each lens on B&H Photo's website or other online retailers.\n\nWhich one of these lenses catches your attention, or do you have any specific preferences (e.g., budget, size, weight)?"

The lens is constructed with a combination of metal and high-quality plastic, which provides a solid feel in the hand. The lens mount is made of brass, ensuring a secure attachment to your Canon EOS 80D camera.

      "content": "The autofocus performance of the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary is a great topic.\n\n**Comparison to Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM:**\nThe Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM is a great lens with a reputation for fast and accurate autofocus. The Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary's autofocus performance is similar, but not quite as fast or accurate as the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of the autofocus performance comparison:\n\n* Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM: Very fast and accurate autofocus, with a response time of around 0.1-0.2 seconds in good light.\n* Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary: Fast autofocus, but slightly slower than the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM, with a response time of around 0.2-0.3 seconds in good light.\n\nIn general, the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary's autofocus is still quite reliable and suitable for most photography situations. However, if you're used to the lightning-fast autofocus of the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM, you might notice a slight difference.\n\n**Autofocus Modes:**\nThe Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary supports both One-Shot AF (AF-S) and Continuous AF (AF-C) modes, as well as Manual Focus (MF) mode. The lens also features a focus limiter switch, which allows you to set the focus range to either 0.25m-0.5m or 0.5m-infinity, helping to speed up autofocus in certain situations.\n\n**Low-Light Performance:**\nIn low-light conditions, the autofocus performance of the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary might slow down slightly, but it's still capable of locking focus in most situations. However, if you're shooting in very dim light, you might need to use the camera's AF assist lamp or an external light source to help the lens focus.\n\nOverall, while the autofocus performance of the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary is not quite as fast as the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM, it's still a capable and reliable lens that can deliver great results in a variety of situations.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the autofocus performance or any other aspects of the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary?"
