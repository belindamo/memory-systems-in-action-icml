As a music enthusiast, I love supporting local businesses and discovering unique, handcrafted instruments. I've been thinking about getting a new guitar, and this might be the perfect opportunity to find something special. Do you know if there are any workshops, clinics, or jam sessions happening at the festival that I could participate in? I'd love to meet other musicians and learn from them.",
