The Ukrainian influence in your surname is not uncommon, given the centuries-long history of migration, cultural exchange, and border shifts between Poland and Ukraine. Let's dive into the historical context and explore how it might have affected surnames in the region.\n\n**Historical Background:**\n\n1. **Kievan Rus' and the Middle Ages:** The territory that is now Ukraine and Poland was once part of the Kievan Rus' state (9th-13th centuries). After its dissolution, the region was divided among various principalities, including the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia, which was inhabited by both Ukrainian and Polish populations.\n2. **Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569-1795):** The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a union between Poland and Lithuania that encompassed much of present-day Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Russia. During this period, there was significant migration and cultural exchange between Polish and Ukrainian populations.\n3. **Partitions of Poland (1772-1795):** The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was partitioned and annexed by neighboring powers (Russia, Prussia, and Austria). This led to the displacement of people, and many Ukrainians moved to Polish territories or vice versa.\n4. **Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867-1918):** After the partitions, the region was divided between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Russian Empire. Many Ukrainians lived in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, particularly in the province of Galicia, which is now divided between Poland and Ukraine.\n5. **Interwar Period (1918-1939):** After World War I, Poland regained independence, and the Ukrainian population in Poland was significant. However, the Polish government's policies aimed to promote Polish culture and language, leading to tensions with the Ukrainian minority.\n\n**Surname Patterns and Migration:**\n\n1. **Patronymic Surnames:** In Ukraine, patronymic surnames (based on the father's name) were common, such as \"Kovalenko\" (son of Koval). In Poland, surnames were often based on occupation, place, or characteristic, like \"Kowalski\" (blacksmith).\n2. **Ukrainian Surnames in Poland:** Many Ukrainian surnames were adapted or modified to fit Polish language and spelling patterns. For example, \"Kovalenko\" might become \"Kowalenko\" or \"Kowalewski.\"\n3. **Polish Surnames in Ukraine:** Conversely, Polish surnames were also adopted by Ukrainians, especially in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. These surnames might have been modified to fit Ukrainian language patterns.\n4. **Migration and Assimilation:** As people moved between Poland and Ukraine, they often adopted the dominant culture and language of their new region. This could lead to changes in surnames, as well as the adoption of local customs and traditions.\n\n**Your Surname:**\n\nGiven the historical context, it's possible that your Ukrainian-influenced surname in Poland resulted from:\n\n1. **Ukrainian migration to Poland:** Your ancestors might have migrated from Ukraine to Poland, bringing their Ukrainian surname with them.\n2. **Polish-Ukrainian intermarriage:** Your ancestors might have intermarried with Ukrainians, adopting their surname or modifying it to fit Polish patterns.\n3. **Assimilation and cultural exchange:** Your ancestors might have adopted Ukrainian cultural practices and surnames as a result of living in a region with a significant Ukrainian population.\n\nTo further explore your surname's origins, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Research your family history:** Gather information about your ancestors, including birth and death records, census data, and other documents.\n2. **Analyze your surname:** Look for patterns, such as patronymic or",
