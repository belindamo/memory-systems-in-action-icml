  "content": "It sounds like you have a good foundation for your morning routine, and now we can build upon that.\n\nLet's break down your goals and priorities:\n\n1. **Thesis project**: This is likely your top priority, and you want to ensure you have sufficient time to make progress on it.\n2. **Reading**: You want to make time for reading, which is great for personal growth and relaxation.\n3. **Evening walks**: Taking walks in the evening can help with stress relief and overall well-being.\n\nTo accommodate these goals, I'll suggest a revised daily routine for you:\n\n**7:30 am - Wake up**\n\n* 30 minutes of exercise (you're already doing this, great job!)\n* 30 minutes of social media (you've limited this to 30 minutes, which is a good start)\n\n**8:00 am - Breakfast and planning**\n\n* Take 30 minutes to eat breakfast and plan out your day. Use this time to:\n\t+ Review your thesis project tasks and prioritize them.\n\t+ Identify what you want to accomplish today.\n\t+ Make a to-do list for your project.\n\n**8:30 am - Thesis project work**\n\n* Dedicate a solid block of time to working on your thesis project. Aim for at least 2-3 hours of focused work.\n\n**11:30 am - Break**\n\n* Take a 30-minute break to stretch, grab a snack, or do something that relaxes you.\n\n**12:00 pm - Lunch and reading**\n\n* Take an hour to eat lunch and read something enjoyable or educational. This will help you unwind and recharge.\n\n**1:00 pm - Thesis project work (continued)**\n\n* Another 2-3 hours of focused work on your thesis project.\n\n**4:00 pm - Break**\n\n* Take another 30-minute break to stretch, move around, and refresh your mind.\n\n**4:30 pm - Free time**\n\n* Use this time to relax, take a walk, or do something you enjoy. You can also use this time to catch up on any other tasks or responsibilities you may have.\n\n**6:00 pm - Dinner**\n\n* Take an hour to eat dinner and spend time with family or friends.\n\n**7:00 pm - Evening walk**\n\n* Take a 30-minute walk to clear your mind and get some fresh air.\n\n**7:30 pm - Free time**\n\n* You can use this time to read, relax, or pursue a hobby.\n\n**9:30 pm - Begin winding down**\n\n* Start wrapping up any remaining tasks or activities, and begin winding down for the night.\n\n**11:00 pm - Bedtime**\n\n* Get ready for bed, and aim to be asleep by 11 pm.\n\nThis revised routine allows you to:\n\n* Dedicate a significant amount of time to your thesis project (4-5 hours)\n* Make time for reading and relaxation (1 hour)\n* Take breaks throughout the day to recharge\n* Enjoy an evening walk and some free time\n* Get a good night's sleep\n\nFeel free to adjust this routine to suit your specific needs and preferences.
