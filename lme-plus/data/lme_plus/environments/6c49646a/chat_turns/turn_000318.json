The Polish Genealogical Society (PTG) and Ukrainian Genealogical Society (UGS) resources can provide additional insights and guidance for your research. The Ukrainian Surname Database is a fantastic resource to learn more about the origins and history of your surname in Ukraine.\n\nAs you begin your research, keep in mind the following tips:\n\n1. **Be flexible with surname spellings:** Your surname may have been spelled differently in historical records, so try searching with variations of your surname.\n2. **Use wildcards:** Many online archives and databases allow you to use wildcards (e.g., * or %) to search for partial surname matches.\n3. **Explore different record types:** Don't just focus on birth, marriage, and death records. Also, search for census data, military records, and other types of documents that may mention your surname.\n4. **Translate Polish and Ukrainian records:** If you're not fluent in Polish or Ukrainian, use online translation tools or seek help from a translator to ensure you're understanding the records correctly.\n5. **Organize your findings:** Keep track of your research and organize your findings in a way that makes sense to you. This will help you identify patterns and connections between records.\n\nRemember, researching your surname is just the beginning. As you uncover more information, you may find that your research takes you in unexpected directions. Be open to new discoveries and willing to adapt your research strategy as needed.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you make some exciting discoveries about your Ukrainian-influenced surname in Poland!",
