You can:\n\n* Visit the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) website for up-to-date road conditions and closures.\n* Download the CDOT mobile app for real-time traffic information.\n* Tune into local radio stations or NOAA Weather Radio for updates on road conditions and weather.\n\n**Winter Tires or Chains:**\nIf you're planning to drive on CO-82 E during the winter months (December to April), you may need winter tires or chains.
