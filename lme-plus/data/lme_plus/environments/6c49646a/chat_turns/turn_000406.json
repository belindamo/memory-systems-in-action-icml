  "content": "Tiny homes are small, portable houses that are typically built on wheels and are designed to be energy efficient and sustainable. They are typically much smaller than the average single-family home, with most ranging in size from 100 to 400 square feet.\n\nTiny homes are often used as a way to downsize and simplify one's living situation, as they require much less space and resources than a traditional home. They can also be a more affordable housing option, as they tend to be cheaper to build and maintain than a larger home.\n\nTiny homes can be built using a variety of materials, such as wood, steel, or recycled materials. They often have a minimalist design and may include features such as fold-down tables, murphy beds, and compact appliances. Some tiny homes are designed to be mobile, allowing their owners to easily move them to different locations. Others are designed to be permanently sited on a piece of land.\n\nTiny homes have gained popularity in recent years as a way to live more sustainably and affordably, and there are now a variety of tiny home communities and resources available for those interested in exploring this type of housing.",
