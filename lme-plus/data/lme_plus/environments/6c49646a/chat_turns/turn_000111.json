  "content": "I think it was their energy and stage presence that really caught my attention. They had this infectious enthusiasm that got the whole crowd going. Plus, their folk-rock sound was really well-crafted and catchy. I ended up buying their EP, \"Midnight Sky\", at the festival merchandise booth and have been listening to it non-stop. Anyway, back to the Telluride Bluegrass Festival - do you think I'll be able to find any vinyl records or music gear at the festival? I recently got my Tame Impala vinyl signed after the show at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado, and I'm looking to add to my collection.",
