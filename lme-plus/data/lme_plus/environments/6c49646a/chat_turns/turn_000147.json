Men's vault requires more explosive strength and speed, while women's vault requires more grace and symmetry.\n\nIn men's vault, there are two main techniques used: the handspring and the Yurchenko. The handspring involves a forward approach followed by a handspring onto the vault table, while the Yurchenko involves a roundoff onto the springboard followed by a back handspring onto the vault table. The Yurchenko technique allows for more complex and difficult skills to be incorporated into the routine, which results in higher levels of difficulty.\n\nIn women's vault, the main technique used is the Yurchenko. The Yurchenko technique is similar to the men's technique, but it incorporates a roundoff onto the springboard, followed by a back handspring onto the vault table, and finishes with a flip off the table. Women's vault routines also feature more artistic elements like pointed toes, straight legs, and arm positions.\n\nOverall, men's vault routines tend to be more physically demanding and require greater levels of strength and power, while women's vault routines tend to be more aesthetically pleasing and require greater levels of technique and artistry.",
