It's great that you're considering the original look and feel of the table.\n\nDetermining the original finish can be a bit of detective work, but here are some steps to help you uncover clues:\n\n1. **Examine the table's surface**: Carefully inspect the table's surface, looking for any remaining original finish, patina, or worn areas. Check for signs of old wax, shellac, or varnish.\n2. **Look for hints in the wood**: Study the wood grain, color, and texture. Different types of wood were often associated with specific finishes. For example, oak was often finished with a darker, richer stain in the Arts and Crafts era.\n3. **Check for hardware and fittings**: Examine the table's hardware, such as hinges, drawer pulls, or legs. These can provide clues about the table's age, style, and original finish.\n4. **Research similar tables**: Find images of similar tables from the same era and style. Study their finishes, and take note of any common characteristics, such as color, sheen, or texture.\n5. **Consult with experts**: Reach out to furniture restorers, antique dealers, or experts in oak furniture to get their input on the table's original finish. They may have experience with similar pieces or be able to provide guidance based on their knowledge.\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of the original finish, you can choose a finish that complements the table's style and era. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Stay true to the era**: Choose a finish that was commonly used during the table's era. For example, if your table is from the Arts and Crafts period, consider using a finish like shellac or a dark, rich stain.\n2. **Consider the wood type**: Different woods respond better to certain finishes. For example, oak often looks great with a darker stain, while pine or fir might benefit from a lighter finish.\n3. **Think about the table's purpose**: If the table will be used frequently, you may want to choose a more durable finish, such as a polyurethane or varnish. If it's primarily for display, a more traditional finish like wax or shellac might be suitable.\n4. **Test and sample**: Always test your chosen finish on a small, inconspicuous area of the table to ensure it doesn't damage the wood or affect the appearance.\n5. **Be prepared to compromise**: You may not be able to exactly replicate the original finish, but by following these steps, you can choose a finish that respects the table's history and style.\n\nRemember, the finish is a crucial part of the restoration process, and taking the time to get it right will make a huge difference in the final result.\n\nHow's your research going?
