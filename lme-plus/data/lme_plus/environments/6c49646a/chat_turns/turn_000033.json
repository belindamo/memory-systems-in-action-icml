  "content": "Sure, I would be happy to share another interesting story about Lord Krishna's playful nature:\n\nIn another story from the Mahabharata, Lord Krishna and his childhood friend, Sudama, reunited after many years apart. Sudama was very poor and he brought with him some humble gifts of rice and lentils for his friend, Lord Krishna.\n\nAs soon as Sudama arrived at Krishna's palace, he was overwhelmed by its grandeur and felt ashamed of his humble gifts. But Lord Krishna, who never judged people by their wealth or social status, welcomed Sudama with open arms and greeted him with great love and affection.\n\nKrishna made Sudama feel comfortable, sharing meals with him, and talking about their childhood memories in a playful and lighthearted way. Krishna even teasingly asked Sudama for some of his humble gifts of rice and lentils, which Sudama hesitantly gave to him.\n\nBefore leaving, Sudama felt ashamed to have nothing to give his friend, but Lord Krishna didn't care about material things. He was touched by Sudama's pure heart and sincerity, and blessed Sudama with great wealth and prosperity.\n\nThis story highlights Lord Krishna's playful nature, and his message of treating everyone with love, respect, and kindness, regardless of their social status or material possessions. It also teaches the value of humility, simple living, and the importance of true friendship.",
