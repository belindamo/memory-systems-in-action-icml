  "content": "I'm glad you have fond memories of your Yellowstone trip! 300 miles on the first day is indeed a long drive, but as you said, the scenic views must have been breathtaking. Jackson, Wyoming, is a beautiful town, and I'm sure it was a great starting point for your Yellowstone adventure.\n\nThe drive from Denver to Jackson is quite scenic, with the Rocky Mountains as a stunning backdrop. You must have passed through some picturesque towns and landscapes, like the Snowy Range and the Wind River Canyon. The Grand Teton National Park, just north of Jackson, is also a treat, with its towering peaks and pristine lakes.\n\nIt's great that you prioritized enjoying the views over the long drive. Sometimes, the journey is just as important as the destination, and it sounds like you made the most of your time on the road.\n\nNow, I'm excited for your upcoming trip to Mount Rushmore! With the KOA's shuttle service and the deluxe cabin rental, you'll be all set for a comfortable and convenient trip. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further recommendations.",
