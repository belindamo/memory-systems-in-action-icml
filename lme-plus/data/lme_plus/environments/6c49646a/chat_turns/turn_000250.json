  "content": "Yes, there was a particular horse that stood out during the 2020 Preakness Stakes race. Swiss Skydiver, a three-year-old filly, made history by becoming the sixth filly to win the Preakness Stakes and the first in over a decade. She defeated the favorite, Authentic, in a thrilling stretch duel, finishing the 1 3/16 miles race in 1:53.28. Swiss Skydiver was ridden by jockey Robby Albarado and trained by Kenneth McPeek. Her victory in the Preakness Stakes cemented her status as one of the best three-year-old fillies of the year and put her in the running for the prestigious Horse of the Year award.",
