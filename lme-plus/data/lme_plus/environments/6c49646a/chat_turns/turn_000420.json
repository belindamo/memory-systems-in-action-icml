Here are some tips to guide you through the process:\n\n**The Keepers:**\n\n1. **Frequently used items**: Keep items that you use regularly, such as toilet paper, cleaning supplies, and personal care products.\n2. **Essential items**: Retain items that are essential for plumbing, like a plunger, drain snake, and pipe wrench.\n3. **Unopened or partially used products**: Keep unopened or partially used personal care products, cleaning supplies, or paper products that are still within their expiration dates or have a long shelf life.\n\n**The Tossers:**\n\n1. **Expired or old products**: Discard expired, old, or outdated personal care products, cleaning supplies, and medications.\n2. **Duplicates**: Get rid of duplicate items, like multiple bottles of the same cleaner or extra toilet brushes.\n3. **Broken or damaged items**: Toss broken, damaged, or rusty items, like a leaky faucet or a cracked toilet brush.\n4. **Unused or unwanted items**: Let go of items you no longer use, need, or want, like a hair dryer you haven't used in years or a cleaning product that didn't work well.\n5. **Clutter accumulators**: Remove items that tend to accumulate clutter, such as empty packaging, old rags, or broken containers.\n\n**The Maybes:**\n\n1. **Items with sentimental value**: If you're unsure about keeping an item with sentimental value, consider taking a photo of it and letting it go. You'll still have the memory, but without the clutter.\n2. **Items that can be repurposed**: Think creatively about items that can be repurposed, like using an old container for storage or turning an old towel into a cleaning rag.\n3. **Items that can be donated**: Consider donating gently used or unopened items to a local charity or thrift store.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Check expiration dates**: Regularly check expiration dates on personal care products, cleaning supplies, and medications to ensure they're still safe to use.\n2. **Store items by category**: Organize items by category, such as all cleaning supplies together, to make it easier to find what you need.\n3. **Use storage solutions**: Invest in storage solutions like baskets, bins, or shelves to keep items off the floor and make the most of your cabinet space.\n4. **Keep it tidy**: Set a reminder to clean and organize your cabinet every 3-6 months to maintain your hard work.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to declutter and organize your cabinet under the sink, making it a more functional and peaceful space. Happy decluttering!",
