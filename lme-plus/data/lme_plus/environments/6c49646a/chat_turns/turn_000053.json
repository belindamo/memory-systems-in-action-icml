This is a popular technique known as the \"across-the-room alarm\" or \"out-of-reach alarm.\" By placing your alarm clock far enough away that you have to get out of bed to turn it off, you're creating a physical barrier that makes it harder to hit the snooze button and roll over.\n\nThis technique can be very effective for several reasons:\n\n1. **Forces you to get out of bed:** By having to get out of bed to turn off the alarm, you're more likely to start your day instead of hitting the snooze button.\n2. **Breaks the sleep cycle:** Getting out of bed can help break the sleep cycle and make it easier to wake up feeling more alert and refreshed.\n3. **Increases motivation:** Having to get out of bed to turn off the alarm can give you a sense of accomplishment and motivation to start your day.\n\nJust make sure to place the alarm clock far enough away that you can't reach it from bed, but not so far that you have to stumble around in the dark or trip over anything. A good distance is usually around 5-10 feet away from your bed.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine this technique with your multiple alarm strategy. For example, you could set your first alarm 15 minutes earlier across the room, and then set your second alarm at your target wake-up time next to your bed. This way, you'll have to get out of bed to turn off the first alarm, and then you'll have a few minutes to stretch, relax, or do some light stretching before your second alarm goes off.\n\nGive it a try and see how it works for you!",
