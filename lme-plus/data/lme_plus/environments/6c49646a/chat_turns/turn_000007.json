It's great that you've found a way to stay connected with friends who live far away, and allocating dedicated time for social media in the evening is a great way to prioritize those relationships.\n\nIt's also wonderful that you're being intentional about how you use social media. By setting a specific time for social media, you can avoid mindless scrolling and ensure that you're using the platform in a way that brings value to your life and relationships.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding a balance that works for you. You've taken a great step by limiting your social media use in the morning, and now you've found a way to use it in a way that supports your relationships and priorities.\n\nHow do you think this new routine will impact your daily life and productivity? Are there any other areas you'd like to focus on or improve in the coming weeks?",
