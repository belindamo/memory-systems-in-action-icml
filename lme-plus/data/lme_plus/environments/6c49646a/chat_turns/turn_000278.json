  "content": "That's a great decision! Leaving it up to the teams to decide will indeed make the challenge more exciting and unpredictable. It's a fantastic way to encourage creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving, and it will likely lead to some hilarious and memorable photos.\n\nBy giving teams the freedom to decide, you're also allowing them to take ownership of the challenge and come up with their own solutions. This can lead to a more engaging and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.\n\nRemember to emphasize the importance of being respectful and considerate when approaching strangers, and remind teams to ask permission before taking a photo. With that in mind, I'm sure your scavenger hunt will be a huge success!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you and your team an amazing time on your scavenger hunt adventure!",
