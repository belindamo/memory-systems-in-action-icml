That's a huge step towards creating a more intentional daily routine.\n\nI'd be happy to help you schedule your tasks more efficiently. To get started, can you tell me a bit more about your goals and priorities? What are the most important tasks you want to accomplish on a daily basis? Do you have any specific time constraints or commitments you need to work around (e.g., work hours, family responsibilities, exercise routine)?\n\nAlso, what time do you wake up and go to bed? And what are your morning and evening routines like currently? Knowing this information will help me provide more tailored suggestions for your daily schedule.\n\nLastly, since you've limited your social media use to 30 minutes in the morning, how do you plan to use that time? Is it for catching up on news, responding to messages, or simply scrolling through your feeds?\n\nLet's work together to create a daily routine that aligns with your goals and priorities!",
