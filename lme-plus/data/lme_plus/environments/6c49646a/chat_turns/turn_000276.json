  "content": "What a great idea! Incorporating a challenge that involves interacting with strangers can add an extra layer of excitement and unpredictability to your scavenger hunt.\n\nSpecifying the type of funny hat can be a good idea if you want to:\n\n1. **Add an extra level of challenge**: By specifying a specific type of hat, you're adding an extra layer of difficulty to the challenge. It might be harder for teams to find a stranger wearing a specific hat, making it more exciting and rewarding when they succeed.\n2. **Create a cohesive theme**: If you're going for a specific theme, like a holiday-themed scavenger hunt, specifying a hat type can help tie in with the overall theme. For example, you could ask teams to find a stranger wearing a Santa hat or a St. Patrick's Day-themed hat.\n\nOn the other hand, leaving it up to the teams to decide can:\n\n1. **Encourage creativity**: By not specifying a specific hat type, you're giving teams the freedom to get creative and come up with their own ideas. This can lead to some hilarious and unexpected photos!\n2. **Make it more accessible**: If you don't specify a specific hat type, teams might have an easier time finding a stranger willing to participate. This can be especially helpful if you're running the scavenger hunt in a busy area with limited hat options.\n\nHere's a possible compromise:\n\n**Specify a general category, but leave room for creativity**: You could specify a general category, like \"a funny or oversized hat\" or \"a hat with a unique design,\" and let teams decide what that means to them. This gives teams some guidance while still allowing them to get creative.\n\nExample Clue:\n\n\"Find a stranger wearing a funny or oversized hat and take a team photo together! The wackier, the better!\"\n\nRemember to ensure that teams are respectful and considerate when approaching strangers, and remind them to ask permission before taking a photo.\n\nWhat do you think? Will you specify a hat type or leave it up to the teams to decide?",
