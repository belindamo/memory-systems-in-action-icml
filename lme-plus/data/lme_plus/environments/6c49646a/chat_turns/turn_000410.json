  "content": "Boxabl is a company that was founded by Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk in 2019. The company is focused on developing prefabricated, modular housing units that are designed to be affordable, efficient, and easy to assemble.\n\nBoxabl's modular units are made from lightweight, strong materials and are designed to be shipped anywhere in the world. They can be assembled on site in as little as one day, and can be configured to meet a wide variety of needs and preferences. The company claims that its modular units are 50% cheaper to build and 50% faster to construct than traditional homes.\n\nBoxabl's modular units are intended to be used as an alternative to traditional housing, and the company is targeting a range of markets, including single-family homes, apartments, and hotels. The company's goal is to make high-quality, affordable housing available to people around the world, and to help address the global housing crisis.\n\nAs of 2021, Boxabl is still in the early stages of development and is not yet offering its modular units for sale. The company is currently working on prototypes and testing its manufacturing processes.",
