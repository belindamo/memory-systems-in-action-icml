  "content": "I'm glad you liked the revised routine.\n\nAllocating some time in the evening for social media to stay in touch with friends and family is a great idea. Given your constraints, I think it's reasonable to fit in some social media time in the evening. Here's a revised routine that incorporates social media time:\n\n**7:00 pm - Evening walk**\n\n* Take a 30-minute walk to clear your mind and get some fresh air.\n\n**7:30 pm - Social media and connections**\n\n* Allocate 30 minutes to catch up with friends and family on social media, respond to messages, and stay connected. You can use this time to:\n\t+ Check Facebook and respond to messages or comments.\n\t+ Share updates or photos from your day.\n\t+ Engage with friends and family who live abroad.\n\n**8:00 pm - Free time**\n\n* Use this time to relax, read, or pursue a hobby.\n\n**9:30 pm - Begin winding down**\n\n* Start wrapping up any remaining tasks or activities, and begin winding down for the night.\n\n**11:00 pm - Bedtime**\n\n* Get ready for bed, and aim to be asleep by 11 pm.\n\nBy allocating 30 minutes in the evening for social media, you can stay connected with friends and family while still maintaining a healthy balance with your other priorities. Remember to set a timer or reminder to ensure you don't get sucked into scrolling mindlessly and exceed your allocated time.\n\nThis revised routine should allow you to:\n\n* Stay connected with friends and family on social media\n* Prioritize your thesis project and reading\n* Make time for self-care and relaxation\n* Get a good night's sleep\n\nFeel free to adjust this routine as needed to suit your lifestyle and preferences.",
