It's amazing how a quick wipe-down can make a significant difference in the overall appearance of the bathroom.\n\nUsing a glass cleaner and paper towels is a great way to get the job done.

Here are a few more tips to help you keep your glass surfaces looking their best:\n\n1. **Use a microfiber cloth**: While paper towels work well, microfiber cloths are even better for cleaning glass surfaces.
