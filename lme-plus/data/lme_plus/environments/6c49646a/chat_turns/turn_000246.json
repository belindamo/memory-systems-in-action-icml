  "content": "The Preakness Stakes, the second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown, had to cope with reduced spectator attendance during the pandemic by implementing a range of measures. First, the event was postponed from May to October 2020, to give organizers more time to plan for a safe event. Then, the number of spectators was limited to 10,000, down from the average of 131,000 in previous years. To achieve this, the organizers used pods or small groups of seats, physically distanced from each other, to control the flow of people and ensure social distancing. The organizers also implemented mandatory mask-wearing, temperature checks, and health screenings before entering the venue. To avoid overcrowding, there were no general admission tickets sold, and only pre-reserved seating was allowed. The organizers also increased their cleaning protocols, installed hand sanitizer stations, and encouraged cashless payments. Finally, to reach a broader audience, the organizers live-streamed the race on various platforms, including NBC Sports, YouTube, and Twitter.",
