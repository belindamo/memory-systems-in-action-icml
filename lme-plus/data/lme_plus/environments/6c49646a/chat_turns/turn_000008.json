I'm also hoping that by limiting my social media use, I'll be able to reduce distractions and anxiety.\n\nOne area I'd like to focus on in the coming weeks is tracking my screen time and staying accountable to my goals. I've been thinking about using website blockers or apps that track my screen time to help me stay on track. Do you have any recommendations for tools or apps that might be helpful for this?",
