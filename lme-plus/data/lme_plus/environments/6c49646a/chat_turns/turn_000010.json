  "content": "I think I'll start by setting specific targets for myself, like limiting my social media use to 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening. I'll also set a goal to reduce my overall screen time by a certain amount each day. I've heard that setting specific, measurable goals can help make it more likely that I'll stick to them.\n\nI'm also considering setting up a reward system for myself, where I treat myself to something nice when I reach a certain milestone or complete a task without getting distracted by social media. Do you think that's a good idea?\n\nAnd one more thing - do you have any tips on how to deal with the urge to mindlessly scroll through social media when I'm bored or stressed? I feel like that's when I'm most tempted to reach for my phone and start scrolling.",
