  "content": "As a language model, I cannot analyze or predict future events, but it is possible that we may see more female horses competing and winning in major races. Horse racing has historically been male-dominated, with fewer opportunities for female horses to showcase their talents. However, in recent years, there has been a growing trend of female horses competing and winning in major races, as more owners and trainers recognize their potential. Several well-known female horses, such as Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta, have achieved great success and helped pave the way for future generations of female horses. The industry is gradually becoming more inclusive, with more opportunities and support for female horses. It will be interesting to see how this trend continues to develop and whether we will see more female horses achieve great success in prominent races.",
