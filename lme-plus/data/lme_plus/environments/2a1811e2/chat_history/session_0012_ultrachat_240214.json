      "content": "1. Sterilize your cutting tools: Before you start taking cuttings, make sure your cutting tools are clean and sterile. Use a mixture of one part bleach and nine parts water to clean your tools.\n\n2. Choose healthy stems: When taking cuttings, choose healthy stems with several nodes from which new growth can emerge. Avoid stems that are too old or too thick as they may be less likely to root.\n\n3. Prepare the cutting: Once you have selected the stem, use sharp, clean scissors to cut the stem just below a node. Remove any leaves from the bottom part of the stem that will be placed in water or rooting hormone.\n\n4. Rooting hormone: It is recommended that you use rooting hormone to help the cutting produce roots. Dip the end of the cutting in the rooting hormone and then remove any excess.\n\n5. Water: Place the cutting in a jar of water or in a pot filled with a well-draining orchid mix. Change the water regularly to prevent bacterial growth, and make sure that the cutting is not submerged in water.\n\n6. Light and temperature: The cutting should be placed in a bright location but away from direct sunlight. Maintain the temperature at 65-75\u00b0F to encourage successful rooting.\n\n7. Patience: Rooting success can take anywhere from several weeks to several months. During this time, monitor the cutting regularly and ensure that it is kept moist, but not too wet.\n\n8. Fertilization: Once the cutting has developed roots, start fertilizing with a balanced orchid fertilizer according to the instructions."

      "content": "As a language model AI, I do not have personal preferences or emotions, but I can provide you with the recommended advice regarding changing the water for dendrobium orchid cuttings during propagation. It's important to change the water every 2-3 days to prevent bacterial and fungal growth. If you notice the water looking cloudy or smelling bad, you should replace it immediately. Additionally, you should make sure the cutting is not entirely submerged in water, as it can lead to rot. Only the lower part of the stem should be in water."

      "content": "As a language model AI, I do not have personal preferences or emotions, but I can provide you with some tips on how to keep the cutting upright in the container of water during the rooting process. One way to keep the cutting from falling over in the water is to use a support system. This can be achieved by placing the cutting in a small container, such as a shot glass or a small test tube, and filling the container with water so that only the bottom of the cutting is submerged. This will give the cutting stability and prevent it from falling over. Another option is to use pebbles or aquarium gravel at the bottom of the container to help hold the cutting upright. The pebbles or gravel will keep the cutting from moving around in the water. In addition, you can use a small stick or wooden skewer to support the cutting. Simply insert the stick into the water and lean the cutting against it. No matter which method you choose, make sure the cutting stays in place and avoid any hard pressure that may damage the plant or the cutting."
