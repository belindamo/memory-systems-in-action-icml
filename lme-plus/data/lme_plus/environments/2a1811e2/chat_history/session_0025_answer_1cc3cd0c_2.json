Here are a few:\n\n1. **Bake Sale**: A classic and always a crowd-pleaser. Gather volunteers to bake sweet treats, and set up a booth to sell them. You can also offer pre-orders and delivery for larger quantities.\n2. **Raffle or Silent Auction**: Collect items from local businesses or individuals to raffle off or auction silently. This can include gift cards, experiences, or unique items.\n3. **Food and Drink Sales**: Offer popular items like popcorn, hot dogs, or lemonade. You can also partner with a local food truck or catering service to offer more substantial meals.\n4. **Walk/Run Event**: Organize a fun walk or run event, where participants collect pledges for each lap completed or a flat registration fee.\n5. **Car Wash**: A classic fundraiser that's easy to organize and always in demand, especially during warmer months.\n6. **Sponsorship Opportunities**: Reach out to local businesses to see if they'd be willing to sponsor your event or specific activities.\n7. **Games and Activities**: Host games, face-painting, or other fun activities that attendees can participate in for a small fee.\n8. **T-Shirt Sales**: Design and sell event-themed t-shirts, with a portion of the proceeds going towards your cause.\n9. **Donation Stations**: Set up stations where attendees can make direct donations in exchange for a small reward, like a sticker or button.\n10. **Social Media Campaign**: Utilize social media platforms to raise funds and awareness about your event. Share your story, and encourage others to share theirs, using a branded hashtag.\n\nRemember to stay organized, promote your event well in advance, and express gratitude to your volunteers and donors. Good luck with your fundraising efforts!\n\n(P.S. It's great to hear that Father John's sermon inspired you to give back to the community!)",
