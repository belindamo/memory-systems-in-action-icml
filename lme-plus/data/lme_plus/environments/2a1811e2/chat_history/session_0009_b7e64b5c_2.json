Here are some additional tips to help you save money on toilet paper and paper towels:\n\n1. **Buy in bulk**: Purchasing larger quantities of toilet paper and paper towels can lead to significant cost savings. Consider buying multipacks or value packs, especially if you have storage space.\n2. **Opt for store brands**: Store-brand products, like Target's Up & Up, are often cheaper than name-brand products but similar in quality. You can save up to 20-30% by choosing store brands.\n3. **Look for sales and stock up**: Keep an eye on weekly ads and sales flyers for your local stores. If you see a good deal on toilet paper or paper towels, stock up to last you a few months.\n4. **Use cashback apps**: In addition to digital coupons, consider using cashback apps like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, or Checkout 51, which often offer rebates on household essentials.\n5. **Shop at discount stores**: Stores like Costco, Sam's Club, or Aldi may offer lower prices on toilet paper and paper towels in bulk. If you have a membership or shop there regularly, it might be worth comparing prices.\n6. **Consider alternative products**: If you're not particular about brand names, consider alternative products like bamboo toilet paper or reusable paper towels. These options might be more eco-friendly and cost-effective in the long run.\n7. **Use unit prices**: When comparing prices between different brands or sizes, check the unit price (price per sheet or roll) to ensure you're getting the best deal.\n8. **Don't forget about coupons**: In addition to digital coupons, check websites like Coupons.com or manufacturer websites for printable coupons or sign up for newsletters to receive exclusive offers.\n9. **Stack coupons and sales**: Combine your digital coupon with a sale price or manufacturer's coupon to maximize your savings.\n10. **Shop during sales tax holidays**: If your state offers sales tax holidays, consider shopping during those periods to save even more on your household essentials.\n\nBy following these tips, you can maximize your savings on toilet paper and paper towels.
