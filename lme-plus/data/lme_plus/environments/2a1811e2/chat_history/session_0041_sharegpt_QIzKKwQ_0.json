They will also be responsible for styling the models' hair and makeup, as well as selecting appropriate undergarments and hosiery.\n\nOn the day of the show, the stylist will be responsible for overseeing the preparation of the models and ensuring that they are dressed and ready to walk the runway on time. They will also be present backstage during the show to make any last-minute adjustments or touch-ups.\n\nIn addition to their role in the production of the show, stylists may also be involved in creating editorial content for fashion magazines or other publications.
