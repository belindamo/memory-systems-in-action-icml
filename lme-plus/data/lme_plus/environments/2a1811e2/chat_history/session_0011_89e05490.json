There are a few ways to get to Nikko from Tokyo, but I'll outline the most common and efficient options for you:\n\n**By Train:**\n\n1. **Tobu Railway**: Take the Tobu Railway from Asakusa Station in Tokyo to Tobu Nikko Station.

You can also take the local train (Futsuu), which takes around 2 hours and costs \u00a51,360 (around $12 USD) one way.\n2. **JR East Japan**: Take the JR East Japan train from Tokyo Station or Shinjuku Station to Utsunomiya Station, then transfer to the JR Nikko Line to Nikko Station. The journey takes around 2 hours, and the cost varies depending on the type of train and class.\n\n**By Bus:**\n\n1. **Highway Bus**: Take the highway bus from Tokyo Station's Yaesu Exit or Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal to Nikko Station.
