After that, the quality may start to degrade.\n5. **Reheat safely**: When you're ready to eat, simply microwave the omelet for 20-30 seconds or heat it in a pan with a little oil until warmed through.\n\nNow, about those nuts! Almonds and walnuts are both great choices for snacking and adding to oatmeal.

      "content": "Quinoa salad jars are a fantastic meal prep idea! Congratulations on using up your leftover veggies from Walmart - reducing food waste is a great habit to develop!\n\nTo keep your quinoa fresh and fluffy for the entire week, follow these tips:\n\n1. **Cook quinoa correctly**: Rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove saponins, which can give it a bitter taste. Cook quinoa according to package instructions, and make sure it's not overcooked or mushy.\n2. **Cool quinoa quickly**: After cooking, spread the quinoa on a baking sheet or tray to cool quickly. This helps prevent moisture from building up and making the quinoa soggy.\n3. **Dry quinoa**: Once cooled, place the quinoa in a clean, dry container or bag. If you notice any excess moisture, you can dry it further by spreading it on a paper towel or clean cloth.\n4. **Store quinoa in airtight containers**: Divide the cooled quinoa into individual portions and store them in airtight containers, such as glass jars or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids.\n5. **Keep quinoa refrigerated**: Refrigerate the quinoa containers at a consistent temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). This will slow down bacterial growth and keep the quinoa fresh.\n6. **Use within 5-7 days**: Cooked quinoa can be safely stored in the refrigerator for 5-7 days. If you notice any signs of spoilage, such as an off smell or slimy texture, it's best to err on the side of caution and discard the quinoa.\n7. **Freeze for longer storage**: If you won't be using the quinoa within 5-7 days, consider freezing it. Cooked quinoa can be frozen for up to 3-4 months. Simply thaw frozen quinoa in the refrigerator or at room temperature when you're ready to use it.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your quinoa salad jars throughout the week, and they'll remain fresh and fluffy.\n\nRemember to add your chopped carrots and apples to the quinoa mixture, and feel free to customize with other ingredients like nuts, seeds, or protein sources. Enjoy your meal prep!"
