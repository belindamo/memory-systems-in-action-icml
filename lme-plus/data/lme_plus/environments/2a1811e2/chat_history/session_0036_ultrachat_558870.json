These guidelines regulate the use of natural resources, wildlife, and limit the number of visitors.\n\n2. Engaging in sustainable practices: Communities promote sustainable practices such as using renewable energy sources, recycling and waste management, and reducing water consumption.\n\n3. Implementing carrying capacity management: Communities monitor the number of visitors to ensure that the area is not overburdened with tourists, and the environment can sustainably handle the amount of human activity.\n\n4. Providing education and training: Communities educate visitors on the importance of preserving the environment, and the impact their actions can have. They may also provide training to eco-tourism operators and guides to ensure that they are knowledgeable and responsible concerning sustainable tourism activities.\n\n5. Investing in infrastructure: Communities invest in the development of eco-friendly infrastructure that is designed to minimize the impact on the environment, such as low-impact accommodations, eco-friendly transportation, and wastewater treatment facilities.\n\nOverall, communities that promote eco-tourism put in place measures to balance the benefits of tourism with environmental conservation. By doing so, they can sustainably preserve their natural and cultural resources while creating positive economic and social outcomes for local communities."
