  "content": "Yes, in order to receive accommodations, you will likely need to disclose your learning style or disability to your employer. This is because employers are not required to provide accommodations unless they know about the disability or learning style. However, disclosure of your condition is voluntary. You can decide when and how to disclose it, but it is important to communicate your needs clearly and discuss the necessary accommodations with your employer. You can request confidentiality if you feel uncomfortable sharing information about your condition with your colleagues or supervisors. It is generally best to communicate your needs as early as possible in your employment, make clear what your needs and accommodations are, and be specific about how they will help you succeed in your job.",
