Getting them crispy like restaurant-style requires a few tips and tricks, which I'm happy to share with you:\n\n**Crispy Brussels Sprouts in the Air Fryer:**\n\n1. **Dry them thoroughly**: Pat the Brussels sprouts dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps the air fryer crisp them up better.\n2. **Cut them in half**: Cutting the Brussels sprouts in half exposes more surface area, allowing them to crisp up faster and more evenly.\n3. **Toss with oil and seasonings**: Toss the Brussels sprouts with a small amount of oil (about 1-2 teaspoons), salt, and your desired seasonings (e.g., garlic powder, paprika, or chili flakes).\n4. **Air fryer settings**: Set the air fryer to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and cook for 10-12 minutes, shaking halfway through. You may need to adjust the time based on the size of your Brussels sprouts.\n5. **Crisping stage**: After 8-9 minutes, increase the air fryer temperature to 420\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for an additional 2-3 minutes. This will help crisp up the Brussels sprouts.\n\n**Crispy Sweet Potatoes in the Air Fryer:**\n\n1. **Cut into wedges or sticks**: Cutting sweet potatoes into wedges or sticks helps them cook more evenly and crisp up better.\n2. **Soak in cold water**: Soak the sweet potato wedges in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch. Pat them dry with paper towels before air frying.\n3. **Toss with oil and seasonings**: Toss the sweet potato wedges with a small amount of oil (about 1-2 teaspoons), salt, and your desired seasonings (e.g., paprika, garlic powder, or chili powder).\n4. **Air fryer settings**: Set the air fryer to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and cook for 12-15 minutes, shaking halfway through. You may need to adjust the time based on the size of your sweet potato wedges.\n5. **Crisping stage**: After 10-11 minutes, increase the air fryer temperature to 420\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for an additional 2-3 minutes. This will help crisp up the sweet potatoes.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n* **Don't overcrowd**: Cook the Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes in batches if necessary, to ensure they have enough room to cook evenly.\n* **Shake and stir**: Halfway through the cooking time, shake the air fryer basket or stir the vegetables to ensure even cooking and prevent hotspots.\n* **Monitor and adjust**: Keep an eye on the vegetables' progress and adjust the cooking time and temperature as needed.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve crispy, restaurant-style Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes in your air fryer!",
