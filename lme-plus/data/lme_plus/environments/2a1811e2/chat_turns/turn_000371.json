Checking the wedding website should give you the most up-to-date information about Emma's registry.\n\nAs for your weekend getaway, I'd be happy to help you with that! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location, so I can't provide a specific recommendation for a beach town within a 3-hour drive from where you are.\n\nBut I can suggest a few popular beach towns that are often within a 3-hour drive from many locations:\n\n1. **Outer Banks, North Carolina**: Known for its natural beauty, lighthouses, and wild horses.\n2. **Virginia Beach, Virginia**: A vibrant beach town with a boardwalk, amusement park, and plenty of restaurants.\n3. **Ocean City, Maryland**: A popular beach destination with a lively boardwalk, amusement park, and plenty of seafood restaurants.\n4. **Cape May, New Jersey**: A charming beach town at the southern tip of New Jersey, known for its Victorian architecture and natural beauty.\n5. **Sanibel Island, Florida**: Famous for its shell-filled beaches, wildlife refuge, and laid-back atmosphere.\n\nIf you'd like more specific recommendations, feel free to share your location or the region you're interested in, and I can try to suggest some options!",
