  "content": "I understand that it may seem counterintuitive, but keep in mind that the percentage value for `max-height` is relative to the height of the parent element. If the parent element has a large height, a small percentage value for `max-height` may not have the desired effect of limiting the size of the image.\n\nBy increasing the percentage value for `max-height`, you are effectively limiting the height of the image to a larger percentage of the height of the parent element, which may help achieve the desired result of limiting the size of the image.\n\nIt's worth noting that `max-height` is a maximum limit, so the actual height of the image will still depend on factors such as the aspect ratio of the image and the available space in the parent element.",
