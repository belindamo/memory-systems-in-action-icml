It's always exciting to save money on a purchase, especially when it's something you've been wanting.\n\nYou're also a great example of being mindful of the coupon's expiration date. It's easy to forget about coupons or let them slip through the cracks, but you made sure to use it before it expired on the 15th. That's being a savvy shopper!\n\nEnjoy your new coffee maker and the delicious coffee it will brew for you! Did you get a chance to try it out yet? How do you like it so far?",
