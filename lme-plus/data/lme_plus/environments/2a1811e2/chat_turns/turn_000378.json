  "content": "Yeah, I'll be giving a speech at the wedding, and I'm a bit nervous about it, to be honest. I want to make sure I do justice to our friendship and Rachel's special day. I've been thinking about what I want to say, but I haven't written anything down yet. I'm sure it'll come together eventually!\n\nAs for Rachel, she's getting more excited as the big day approaches. We've had a few disagreements about some of the details, but ultimately, we want what's best for each other. I think she's feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the planning, but she's doing a great job of staying on top of things.",
