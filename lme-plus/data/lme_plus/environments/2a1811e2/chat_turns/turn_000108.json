One way to do this is to use regular expressions to search for patterns in the URLs.\n\nHere's an example Python code that demonstrates how to identify the URL pattern based on a set of links:\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Example set of links\nlinks = [\n    'https://example.com/category/page/1',\n    'https://example.com/category/page/2',\n    'https://example.com/category/page/3',\n    'https://example.com/category/page/4',\n    'https://example.com/category/page/5'\n]\n\n# Try to identify the pattern in the links\npatterns = []\nfor link in links:\n    # Define regular expression to extract page number\n    regex = r'/page/(\\d+)'\n    match = re.search(regex, link)\n    if match:\n        # Extract the page number\n        page_number = match.group(1)\n        # Replace the page number with a regex placeholder\n        pattern = re.sub(regex, r'/page/\\d+', link)\n        pattern = pattern.replace(page_number, r'\\d+')\n        # Add the pattern to the list\n        patterns.append(pattern)\n\n# Print the identified pattern(s)\nif patterns:\n    # Remove duplicates\n    patterns = list(set(patterns))\n    print('Identified pattern(s):')\n    for pattern in patterns:\n        print(pattern)\nelse:\n    print('No pattern found')\n```\nIn this code, we start by defining a set of example links. We then loop through each link and use regular expressions to try to identify the URL pattern. If a pattern is found, we replace the page number with a regex placeholder (`\\d+`) and add the pattern to a list. Finally, we remove duplicates from the list and print the identified pattern(s).\n\nThis code is just an example, and you may need to modify it based on the specific URL patterns and page structure of the website you are scraping.",
