  "content": "Although some efforts have been made to preserve the cultural heritage of K\u00f6nigsberg, there were limited efforts to preserve the religious structures that were destroyed during the war. In many cases, the buildings were demolished to make space for new development.\n\nIn the Soviet era, there was little interest in preserving cultural and religious heritage, and several churches and other religious buildings were repurposed for secular use. For example, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, which was the city's main Lutheran church, was converted into a swimming pool.\n\nHowever, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a renewed interest in preserving cultural and religious heritage in Kaliningrad. Some churches have been restored, and efforts are underway to protect historic buildings, including those with religious significance.",
