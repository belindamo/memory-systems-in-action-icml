  "content": "I think I'll start by setting up my budget categories in Mint and YNAB, and then allocate funds to each category. For discretionary spending categories like dining out and entertainment, I'll use the envelope system to allocate cash. I'll also make sure to update my digital budget whenever I make a purchase using the cash from the envelopes. I'm hoping this combination approach will help me stay on track with my budget and make more intentional purchasing decisions.
