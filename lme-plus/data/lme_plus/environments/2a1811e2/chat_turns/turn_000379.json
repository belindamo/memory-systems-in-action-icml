You know Rachel best, and your words will come from a place of love and friendship. Remember, it's okay to be a little emotional too - it's a special moment!\n\nIt's great to hear that Rachel is getting more excited as the wedding approaches.

Being overwhelmed is a common feeling for many brides, but it sounds like Rachel is handling it well.\n\nAs the maid of honor, you're not only supporting Rachel but also playing a significant role in making her wedding day special. I'm sure she appreciates everything you're doing for her.\n\nNow, back to Emma's gift... did you end up checking the wedding website or getting in touch with Rachel about it?",
