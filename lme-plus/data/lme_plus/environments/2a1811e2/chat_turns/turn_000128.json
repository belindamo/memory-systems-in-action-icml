Use a mixture of one part bleach and nine parts water to clean your tools.\n\n2. Choose healthy stems: When taking cuttings, choose healthy stems with several nodes from which new growth can emerge. Avoid stems that are too old or too thick as they may be less likely to root.\n\n3. Prepare the cutting: Once you have selected the stem, use sharp, clean scissors to cut the stem just below a node. Remove any leaves from the bottom part of the stem that will be placed in water or rooting hormone.\n\n4. Rooting hormone: It is recommended that you use rooting hormone to help the cutting produce roots. Dip the end of the cutting in the rooting hormone and then remove any excess.\n\n5. Water: Place the cutting in a jar of water or in a pot filled with a well-draining orchid mix. Change the water regularly to prevent bacterial growth, and make sure that the cutting is not submerged in water.\n\n6. Light and temperature: The cutting should be placed in a bright location but away from direct sunlight. Maintain the temperature at 65-75\u00b0F to encourage successful rooting.\n\n7. Patience: Rooting success can take anywhere from several weeks to several months. During this time, monitor the cutting regularly and ensure that it is kept moist, but not too wet.\n\n8. Fertilization: Once the cutting has developed roots, start fertilizing with a balanced orchid fertilizer according to the instructions.",
