  "content": "I'm currently active on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. I've been posting a mix of photos, videos, and stories, and my recent topics have been pretty diverse - from personal stuff like my new haircut and morning yoga routine to industry trends and topics like climate change and mental health awareness. As for my interests, I'm passionate about yoga, meditation, and sustainability. My goal is to keep engaging with my audience and build my personal brand. I'd like to post at least 3-4 times a week on each platform, but I'm open to adjusting the schedule based on your recommendations.",
