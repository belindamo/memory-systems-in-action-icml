  "content": "As a language model AI, I do not have personal preferences or emotions, but I can provide you with the recommended advice regarding changing the water for dendrobium orchid cuttings during propagation. It's important to change the water every 2-3 days to prevent bacterial and fungal growth. If you notice the water looking cloudy or smelling bad, you should replace it immediately. Additionally, you should make sure the cutting is not entirely submerged in water, as it can lead to rot. Only the lower part of the stem should be in water.",
