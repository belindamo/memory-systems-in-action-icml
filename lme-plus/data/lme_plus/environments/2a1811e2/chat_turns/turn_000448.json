  "content": "The Metropolitan Museum of Art is an amazing institution, and the \"Women in Art\" exhibition sounds fascinating! However, I have to clarify that there is no permanent \"Women in Art\" exhibition at the Met. The Met's exhibitions are constantly changing, and it's possible that you might have visited a different exhibition or a specific gallery featuring women artists.\n\nThat being said, I can still offer some general tips on visiting the Met and avoiding crowds:\n\n1. **Weekdays:** If possible, plan your visit on a weekday, as weekends tend to be busiest.\n2. **Early morning or late afternoon:** Visit the museum during the early morning hours (it opens at 10:00 AM) or later in the afternoon (around 3:00-4:00 PM). These times tend to be less crowded than the lunchtime rush.\n3. **Avoid school holidays and summer months:** If you can, try to avoid visiting during school holidays, summer months, or peak tourist season (June to August). These periods tend to attract larger crowds.\n4. **Use the museum's website:** Check the Met's website for updates on exhibitions, hours, and special events, which might affect crowd levels.\n5. **Consider a guided tour:** Guided tours can provide valuable insights and help you navigate the museum more efficiently. They might also offer a more peaceful experience, as you'll be moving with a smaller group.\n6. **Take breaks:** The Met is a massive museum, and it's easy to get overwhelmed. Take breaks to rest your feet, grab a snack, or simply step outside for some fresh air.\n\nRegarding Frida Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe's works, the Met has an impressive collection of art from around the world, but it's possible that these specific artists' pieces might not be on display at the time of your visit. You can check the Met's website or contact them directly to inquire about the current exhibitions and collections on display.\n\nEnjoy your visit to the Met, and I hope you have a wonderful time exploring the museum's incredible collections!",
