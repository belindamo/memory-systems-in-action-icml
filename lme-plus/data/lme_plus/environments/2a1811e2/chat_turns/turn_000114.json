Pagination: URLs that represent different pages of a listing, such as search results, news articles, or product pages. These URLs often include a page number or some other identifier that specifies the page being requested.\n\nExample: `https://www.example.com/search?q=keyword&page=2`\n\n2. Category or tag-based URLs: URLs that represent collections of pages that are organized by a particular category or tag. These URLs often include a category or tag identifier.\n\nExample: `https://www.example.com/category/sports`\n\n3. Date-based URLs: URLs that represent pages that are organized by date. These URLs often include a year, month, and day identifier.\n\nExample: `https://www.example.com/2022/02/17`\n\n4. ID-based URLs: URLs that represent specific resources or pages that are identified by a unique identifier, such as a product ID or article ID.\n\nExample: `https://www.example.com/product/1234`\n\n5. Slug-based URLs: URLs that represent resources or pages that are identified by a human-readable identifier or slug. These URLs often include the title or a shortened version of the title of the page.\n\nExample: `https://www.example.com/article/how-to-build-a-website`\n\n6. Hash-based URLs: URLs that use a hash symbol (#) to represent different sections or fragments of a single page. These URLs do not represent a new page or resource.\n\nExample: `https://www.example.com/article/how-to-build-a-website#section2`\n\nThese are just a few examples of the most common URL patterns. Different websites and web applications may use different URL patterns depending on their needs and the types of resources they represent.",
