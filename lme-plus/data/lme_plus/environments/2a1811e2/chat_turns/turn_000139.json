The model divides customer needs into three categories: basic needs, performance needs, and excitement needs.\n\nIn the case of Mahindra and Mahindra's product portfolio in India, we can apply Kano's model as follows:\n\n1. Basic needs: Basic needs are essential features that customers expect from a product or service. In the case of Mahindra and Mahindra's products, some basic needs would include reliability, fuel efficiency, safety, and affordability. These are features that are taken for granted and customers may not even mention them when asked about their preferences.\n2. Performance needs: Performance needs are features that customers consider when evaluating a product or service. In the case of Mahindra and Mahindra's products, some performance needs would include comfort, handling, acceleration, and towing capacity. These are features that customers expect and consider when making a purchase decision.\n3. Excitement needs: Excitement needs are features that go beyond customer expectations and create a unique and memorable experience. In the case of Mahindra and Mahindra's products, some excitement needs would include style, design, and innovative features such as hybrid or electric powertrains. These are features that customers may not expect but would be delighted to see.\n\nBy applying Kano's model to Mahindra and Mahindra's product portfolio, the company can identify which features are basic needs, performance needs, and excitement needs for their customers. This can help them prioritize their resources and investments in product development, marketing, and sales.\n\nFor example, if Mahindra and Mahindra identifies that safety and reliability are basic needs for their customers, they can ensure that all their products meet these requirements without fail. If they identify that customers are looking for better handling and acceleration, they can focus on improving these performance needs in their new product launches. And if they identify that customers are interested in innovative features such as hybrid or electric powertrains, they can invest in research and development in these areas.\n\nIn conclusion, applying Kano's model to Mahindra and Mahindra's product portfolio in India can help the company understand their customers' needs and expectations, and prioritize their operations and strategies accordingly.",
