What specific skills or areas of improvement do you feel you've made progress on through your recent workshops? Was there a particular workshop or instructor that had a significant impact on your growth as a photographer?\n\nSharing your thoughts can help you solidify your understanding and identify areas where you'd like to continue improving. Plus, it can give me a better understanding of your goals and preferences, which can help me provide more tailored recommendations for online courses and resources.\n\nSome questions to consider:\n\n* What were some of the most valuable takeaways from your recent workshops?\n* Were there any specific techniques or concepts that you struggled with at first, but now feel more comfortable with?\n* Are there any areas where you feel like you've plateaued or need more practice?\n* How have your workshops influenced your approach to photography, and what changes have you made to your workflow or creative process?\n\nFeel free to share as much or as little as you'd like, and I'll do my best to help you build upon your progress!",
