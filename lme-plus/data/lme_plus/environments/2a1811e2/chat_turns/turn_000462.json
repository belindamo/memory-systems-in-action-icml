However, it is believed that the basic social structure of horses and ponies is similar across all breeds, with a dominant mare leading and governing the group, and other members of the herd having different roles such as protectors or followers. There may be subtle differences in communication methods and behaviors depending on the breed and the specific dynamics within the group, but the underlying social hierarchy tends to be consistent within equine communities.",
