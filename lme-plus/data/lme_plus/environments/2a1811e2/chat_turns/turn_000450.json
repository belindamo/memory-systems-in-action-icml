The Met does have a vast collection of art, including works by women artists, but it doesn't have a specific exhibition by that title.\n\nMoving on to Frida Kahlo's life and art, her marriage to Diego Rivera is indeed a significant aspect of her story. Frida and Diego had a tumultuous and passionate relationship that spanned over 25 years, with two marriages and one divorce in between.\n\nDiego Rivera was a renowned Mexican muralist, 20 years older than Frida, and already an established artist when they met. Frida was a young, aspiring artist, and Diego became her mentor, friend, and eventually, her husband. They married in 1929, and their relationship was marked by intense passion, mutual admiration, and deep affection.\n\nTheir marriage had a profound impact on Frida's art and life:\n\n1. **Artistic influence:** Diego's muralist style and emphasis on Mexican culture influenced Frida's work, as she began to incorporate more vibrant colors, symbolism, and Mexican folk art elements into her paintings.\n2. **Emotional inspiration:** Diego's infidelities, their tumultuous relationship, and the physical and emotional pain Frida endured (including a devastating bus accident in 1925) all found expression in her art. Her paintings became a way to process her emotions, often depicting her physical and emotional suffering.\n3. **Support and encouragement:** Despite their tumultuous relationship, Diego was a significant source of support and encouragement for Frida's artistic career. He recognized her talent and helped her gain recognition in the art world.\n4. **Competition and rivalry:** The couple's relationship was also marked by a sense of competition and rivalry. Both artists were strong-willed and ambitious, and this tension sometimes fueled their creative output.\n\nFrida's art often reflected her feelings about Diego, their relationship, and the challenges she faced as a woman in a patriarchal society. Her paintings, such as \"The Two Fridas\" (1939) and \"Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird\" (1940), are testaments to the complex and multifaceted nature of their relationship.\n\nI hope this gives you a better understanding of Frida Kahlo's marriage to Diego Rivera and its impact on her art.",
