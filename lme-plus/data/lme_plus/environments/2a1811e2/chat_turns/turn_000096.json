If there's a participating offer on the products you bought, you'll earn cashback in addition to the $5 discount from the digital coupon.\n\nRetailMeNot's cashback feature is separate from the digital coupon, so you can earn cashback on top of the discount you're already getting. This is a great way to stack your savings and maximize your rewards!\n\nJust keep in mind that you'll need to meet the requirements for both the digital coupon and the RetailMeNot offer. Make sure to read the terms and conditions for each to ensure you're eligible for both rewards.\n\nBy combining these two offers, you'll be able to save even more on your household essentials. Happy shopping!",
