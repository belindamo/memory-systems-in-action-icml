  "content": "Antibiotics produced by Streptomyces target bacterial cell walls or membranes through various mechanisms such as:\n\n1. Inhibition of cell wall synthesis: Streptomyces antibiotics like penicillin, cephalosporins, and vancomycin inhibit enzymes involved in the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to weakened cell walls and cell lysis.\n\n2. Disruption of cell membrane integrity: Streptomyces antibiotics like polymyxins and colistin disrupt the integrity of bacterial cell membranes by binding to and destabilizing the lipids in the membrane, leading to cell death.\n\n3. Prevention of bacterial protein synthesis: Streptomyces antibiotics like tetracyclines and macrolides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to ribosomes, leading to inhibition of translation and eventual cell death.\n\nOverall, the antibiotics produced by Streptomyces have a wide range of targets within bacterial cells, making them effective against a variety of bacterial infections.",
