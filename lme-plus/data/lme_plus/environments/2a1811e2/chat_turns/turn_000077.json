I just attended a seminar on sustainable farming practices at the local agricultural center today, and one of the speakers mentioned its importance. I'm trying to set up a new schedule to rotate the animals between our pastures, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you give me some guidance on how to create an effective rotation plan?",
