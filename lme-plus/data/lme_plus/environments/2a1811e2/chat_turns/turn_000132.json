One way to keep the cutting from falling over in the water is to use a support system. This can be achieved by placing the cutting in a small container, such as a shot glass or a small test tube, and filling the container with water so that only the bottom of the cutting is submerged. This will give the cutting stability and prevent it from falling over. Another option is to use pebbles or aquarium gravel at the bottom of the container to help hold the cutting upright. The pebbles or gravel will keep the cutting from moving around in the water. In addition, you can use a small stick or wooden skewer to support the cutting. Simply insert the stick into the water and lean the cutting against it. No matter which method you choose, make sure the cutting stays in place and avoid any hard pressure that may damage the plant or the cutting.",
