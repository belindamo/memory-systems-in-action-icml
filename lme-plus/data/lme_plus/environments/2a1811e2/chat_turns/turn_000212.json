  "content": "I'm considering booking a character breakfast at the Plaza Inn for our corporate event, but I'm not sure if it's suitable for adults. I've been to the Plaza Inn with my family for my niece's birthday and it was a lot of fun, but I'm not sure if it's the right fit for a corporate event. Can you tell me more about character breakfasts at the Plaza Inn and if they can be customized for a corporate event?",
