However, I can tell you that horses and ponies have a natural herd instinct, and they use body postures, vocalizations, and scents to establish dominance and communicate with one another. Within a herd, there is usually a dominant mare who leads and governs the group. Other members of the herd may have different roles, including protectors or followers. Horses and ponies also use social grooming and physical contact to establish bonds within the herd.",
