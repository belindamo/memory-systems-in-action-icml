  "content": "Yes, the steps I outlined can be incorporated into a web scraping Python program to extract data from web pages that use URL patterns to indicate page numbers.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to extract page numbers from URLs using regular expressions:\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Example URL pattern\nurl = 'https://example.com/category/page/3'\n\n# Define regular expression to extract page number\nregex = r'/page/(\\d+)'\n\n# Extract page number from URL using regular expression\npage_number = re.search(regex, url).group(1)\n\n# Print page number\nprint(page_number)\n```\nIn this code snippet, we use the `re` module in Python to define a regular expression that matches the URL pattern containing a page number. We then use the `re.search()` method to search for the pattern in the URL and extract the page number. Finally, we print the extracted page number.\n\nThis code snippet is just an example of how to extract page numbers from URLs using regular expressions. Depending on the specific web scraping task you are trying to accomplish, you may need to modify this code or use additional libraries and tools to extract data from web pages.",
