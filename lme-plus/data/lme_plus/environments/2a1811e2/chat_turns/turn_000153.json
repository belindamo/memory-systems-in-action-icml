  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. To clarify, the issue with your images being too large is likely due to the fact that `max-height` is currently set to only 10% on the `img` selector.\n\nWhen you set `max-height` to a small percentage, the height of the image will be limited to a small percentage of the height of the parent element. If the parent element has a large height, the image may still display at a larger size than you intend.\n\nIn order to limit the size of the images, you should increase the percentage value of `max-height` on the `img` selector. For example, you could try setting `max-height: 50%;` to limit the height of the image to 50% of the height of the parent element.\n\nUsing percentage values for `max-height` is still a good approach to keep designs responsive, especially when working with elements that are intended to resize based on the size of the viewport.",
