As a Halfling, she was small and nimble, which made her an ideal pickpocket and burglar. However, Lily was always fascinated by magic, and she spent hours poring over books on arcane lore in secret.\n\nEventually, Lily's natural curiosity and talent for magic led her to pursue the path of the Arcane Trickster, blending her skills as a rogue with her newfound magical abilities. She became an expert at using illusions and enchantments to distract and confuse her targets, and she honed her skills as a thief to become one of the most notorious and successful burglars in the city.\n\nDespite her success as a thief, Lily is not motivated purely by greed. She is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn, and she enjoys the thrill of pulling off a difficult heist. However, Lily is also fiercely independent and does not take kindly to being told what to do. She trusts few people and is always on the lookout for potential threats or double-crosses.",
