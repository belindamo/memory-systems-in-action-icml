I'd be happy to help you find art supplies that fit her style.\n\n**Paints:**\n\n1. **Acrylic paints:** Frida often used vibrant, bold colors, so look for acrylic paints with high pigment load and a matte finish. Brands like:\n\t* Golden High Flow Acrylics (USA)\n\t* Daler-Rowney System 3 Acrylics (UK)\n\t* Holbein Acryla Gouache (Japan)\n2. **Vibrant colors:** Focus on earthy tones, like ochres, siennas, and umbers, as well as bold reds, blues, and yellows.
