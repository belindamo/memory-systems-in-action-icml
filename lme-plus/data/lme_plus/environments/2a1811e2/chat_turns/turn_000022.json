I've been feeling really inspired by the community theater production of Rent I attended recently, and I'm loving the Latin-inspired rhythms and storytelling in In the Heights. I think I'll start with Freestyle Love Supreme and Once on This Island, since I'm already familiar with Lin-Manuel Miranda's work. Thanks for the recommendations!",
