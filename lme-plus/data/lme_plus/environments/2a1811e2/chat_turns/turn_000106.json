  "content": "Sure! Here are some examples of regular expressions that could be used to extract page numbers from URLs:\n\n1. `/page/(\\d+)` - matches URLs that contain a page number after `/page/`. For example, `https://example.com/category/page/3`.\n2. `page=(\\d+)` - matches URLs that contain a page number after `page=`. For example, `https://example.com/category?page=3`.\n3. `&page=(\\d+)` - matches URLs that contain a page number after `&page=` in a query string. For example, `https://example.com/search?q=term&page=3`.\n4. `/(\\d+)` - matches URLs that contain a page number as the last element of the path. For example, `https://example.com/category/3`.\n5. `=(\\d+)$` - matches URLs that contain a page number at the end of a query string. For example, `https://example.com/search?q=term&page=3`.\n\nNote that the regular expressions provided are just examples, and you may need to adjust them based on the specific URL pattern you are working with. Additionally, some websites may use more complex URL patterns, such as hashes or subdomains, to indicate page numbers, so you may need to customize the regular expressions accordingly.",
