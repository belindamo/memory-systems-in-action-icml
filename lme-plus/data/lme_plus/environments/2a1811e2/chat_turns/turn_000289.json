It's great that you're taking proactive steps to promote your charity event and make it a success.\n\nRegarding your mention of catching up with your cousin Emma at St. Mary's Church, I'm happy to chat with you about it, but I want to clarify again that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or knowledge of specific events or locations, including St. Mary's Church or your personal relationships. I'm here to provide general information and assist with your questions to the best of my abilities.\n\nHowever, it's wonderful that you're staying connected with your cousin and making time for social activities. Social connections are important for our well-being and can bring joy and fulfillment to our lives. Enjoy your brunch meetup with Emma!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance with your charity event, feel free to ask!",
