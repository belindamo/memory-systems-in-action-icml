  "content": "I've actually been thinking about exploring more into portrait photography, specifically working with natural light and capturing candid moments. I've enjoyed the portrait photography workshop I attended, and I feel like there's still so much to learn and improve on. I've also been inspired by some photographers who specialize in capturing authentic, everyday moments, and I'd love to learn more about their approaches and techniques.\n\nWhat do you think about online courses or resources that focus on natural light portrait photography? Are there any recommendations you could provide?",
