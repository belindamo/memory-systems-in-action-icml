After ordering, you can expect to receive your food within a relatively short time frame. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Waiting Time:**\n\n* After ordering, the waiting time for your food is usually around 10-15 minutes during non-peak hours (e.g., weekdays, lunchtime).\n* During peak hours (e.g., dinner time, weekends, holidays), the waiting time might be slightly longer, around 20-25 minutes.\n\n**Food Preparation:**\n\n* Once your order is called, the kitchen staff will expertly prepare your tsukemen and gyoza.

The staff will bring your food to your table as soon as it's ready, and you can expect a constant flow of dishes being served to guests.\n\nTo minimize your waiting time, consider visiting during non-peak hours or making a reservation in advance (if possible).
