  "content": "URL patterns that correspond to page numbers typically follow a specific format that includes a number or identifier that increases or changes as the user navigates through different pages. Here are a few common ways to identify if URL patterns correspond to page numbers:\n\n1. Look for a number or identifier in the URL: Check if the URL contains a number or identifier that changes as you move from one page to another. For example, a URL might include a query parameter such as \"?page=2\" or a path parameter like \"/page/2\". If you see a pattern where this number or identifier increases as you navigate to subsequent pages, it's likely that the URL is indicating page numbers.\n2. Check the website structure: Look at the overall structure of the website's URLs. If the website has a consistent URL structure for different pages, such as \"/category/page-number\" or \"/archive/year/month/page-number\", it's likely that the URLs correspond to page numbers.\n3. Analyze the website's pagination: If the website has a pagination system that displays page numbers, you can compare the URLs of each page to see if they follow a pattern. For example, if the pagination displays \"1 2 3 ... 10\" and the URL for the first page is \"/page/1\", the URL for the second page is likely to be \"/page/2\".\n\nIn general, URLs that correspond to page numbers will have a number or identifier that changes as you navigate to different pages, and will follow a consistent pattern throughout the website.",
