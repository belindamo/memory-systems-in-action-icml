  "content": "Pork belly is an excellent choice for Korean BBQ! It's a popular cut in Korean cuisine, and when done right, it's incredibly tender and flavorful. Yes, prepping the pork belly before marinating is crucial to achieve the best results. Here are some tips to help you prepare the pork belly:\n\n1. **Scoring**: Scoring the fat layer on the pork belly is essential to help the marinade penetrate deeper into the meat. Use a sharp knife to make parallel cuts about 1/4 inch deep and 1 inch apart on the fat side of the pork belly. Be careful not to cut too deep, as you want to avoid cutting into the meat.\n2. **Removing excess fat**: If your pork belly has a thick layer of fat, you may want to trim some of it off to help the meat cook more evenly. Remove any excess fat, but leave about 1/4 inch of fat on the surface to keep the meat moist.\n3. **Pounding or tenderizing**: Pounding the pork belly can help break down the connective tissues and make it more tender. You can use a meat mallet or the back of a heavy knife to gently pound the meat, focusing on the thicker areas. Alternatively, you can use a tenderizer tool or a rolling pin to achieve a similar effect.\n4. **Cutting into smaller pieces**: Cutting the pork belly into smaller pieces, such as 1-2 inch cubes or slices, can help the marinade penetrate more evenly and reduce cooking time. This is especially helpful if you're short on time or want to achieve a more tender texture.\n5. **Salting**: Applying a dry brine or a light salt rub to the pork belly can help enhance the flavor and texture. Rub a mixture of kosher salt, brown sugar, and black pepper onto the meat, making sure to cover all surfaces evenly. Let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour before rinsing off the excess salt and patting the meat dry.\n\nAfter prepping the pork belly, you can proceed with your Korean-style marinade. Make sure to adjust the marinade time according to the size and thickness of your pork belly pieces. A minimum of 2 hours to overnight is recommended for optimal flavor and tenderization.\n\nSome additional tips for cooking the pork belly:\n\n* Use a hot grill or grill pan to achieve a nice char on the outside, which will help lock in the juices.\n* Cook the pork belly to an internal temperature of 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n* Let the pork belly rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving to allow the juices to redistribute.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well on your way to creating delicious, tender, and flavorful Korean-style pork belly BBQ!",
