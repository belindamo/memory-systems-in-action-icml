  "content": "Gochujang sauce is a great addition to many dishes! It adds a wonderful depth of flavor and heat. I'm glad you're experimenting with different sauces and oils to find the perfect combination for your taste.\n\nRegarding all-purpose cooking oils, I'm happy to help you with some recommendations!\n\nThere are many good options available, and the best one for you will depend on your personal preferences, cooking style, and dietary needs. Here are a few popular choices:\n\n1. **Avocado Oil**: Mild, buttery flavor and a high smoke point (520\u00b0F/271\u00b0C) make avocado oil ideal for high-heat cooking, saut\u00e9ing, and roasting.\n2. **Grapeseed Oil**: Neutral flavor, light texture, and a high smoke point (420\u00b0F/220\u00b0C) make grapeseed oil suitable for saut\u00e9ing, baking, and making dressings.\n3. **Canola Oil**: Light, neutral flavor and a high smoke point (468\u00b0F/242\u00b0C) make canola oil a good all-purpose choice for frying, saut\u00e9ing, and baking.\n4. **Peanut Oil**: Strong, nutty flavor and a high smoke point (450\u00b0F/232\u00b0C) make peanut oil perfect for stir-fries, saut\u00e9ing, and making sauces.\n5. **Olive Oil**: While not ideal for high-heat cooking due to its low smoke point (320\u00b0F/160\u00b0C), olive oil is great for low-heat cooking, dressings, and finishing dishes for added flavor.\n6. **Rice Bran Oil**: Light, nutty flavor and a high smoke point (490\u00b0F/254\u00b0C) make rice bran oil a good choice for stir-fries, saut\u00e9ing, and baking.\n\nWhen choosing an oil, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Flavor profile**: Do you prefer a neutral or strong flavor?\n* **Smoke point**: Will you be cooking at high temperatures?\n* **Nutrition**: Are you looking for an oil high in certain nutrients (e.g., omega-3s, antioxidants)?\n* **Budget**: Are you willing to invest in a premium oil or looking for a more affordable option?\n\nIf you're not satisfied with your current oil, you might consider trying a different brand or type of oil. You could also experiment with blending different oils to create a custom flavor profile.\n\nWhat do you think about trying a small batch of a new oil to see how you like it before committing to a larger quantity?",
