  "content": "That sounds like a perfect plan for a relaxing and fun bachelorette party! Sometimes, the simplest activities are the best, and just enjoying each other's company is what matters most. I'm sure Rachel will appreciate the thought and effort you're putting into making it a special weekend for her.\n\nAnd yeah, it's always a good idea to coordinate with others who attended the wedding to avoid duplicate gifts. Rachel might have some valuable insight into what Emma received, or might even have some ideas for a gift that Emma mentioned she wanted but didn't get.\n\nIt's great that you're keeping the surprise activities under wraps for now - I'm sure Rachel will be thrilled when she finds out what you have planned! Are you the maid of honor, or just a close friend helping to plan the celebration?",
