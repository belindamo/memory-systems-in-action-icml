  "content": "That's wonderful! Being the maid of honor is a significant role, and it's clear that you're taking it very seriously. It's great that you and Rachel have a strong friendship, and it's lovely that you're so involved in her wedding planning.\n\nIt's great that you're helping her with the smaller details like wedding favors and addressing invitations. Those tasks can be time-consuming, and it's nice that you're taking some of that load off her shoulders. I'm sure Rachel appreciates all your help and support.\n\nAs the maid of honor, you'll also get to give a speech at the wedding, right? Are you feeling nervous about that, or do you have some ideas already for what you want to say?\n\nAnd how's Rachel feeling about the wedding planning process? Is she getting excited, or is she feeling a bit overwhelmed?",
