The important thing is that you're recognizing the error and taking steps to correct it.\n\nIt's great that you're being honest with yourself about your motivations and priorities. Recognizing the reasons behind your spending habits is a huge step towards making positive changes.\n\nUsing the combination of digital tools and the envelope system will definitely help you make more intentional purchasing decisions. By tracking your spending and allocating cash for discretionary categories, you'll be more mindful of your money and less likely to make impulsive buys.\n\nRemember, it's not about depriving yourself of things you enjoy, but about making conscious choices that align with your goals and values. If you do decide to treat yourself in the future, try to make it a more intentional decision, rather than an impulsive one.\n\nHere's a suggestion: take a moment to reflect on what you could have done differently in that situation. What triggered the impulse to buy the handbag? Was it boredom, stress, or peer pressure? Once you identify the trigger, you can develop a plan to avoid or cope with it in the future.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. You're taking steps towards positive change, and that's something to be proud of! Focus on progress, not perfection.\n\nHow do you think you can apply the lessons you've learned from this experience to future purchasing decisions?",
