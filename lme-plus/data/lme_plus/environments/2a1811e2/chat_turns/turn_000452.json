The Brooklyn Museum does have a strong commitment to showcasing diverse exhibitions and programs, but I couldn't find any information about a recent lecture on Frida Kahlo's life as part of an \"Art and Identity\" series.\n\nIt's possible that you might have attended a different event or lecture, or that the museum has upcoming programs that haven't been announced yet. If you could provide more details about the lecture, such as the date, time, or the speaker, I might be able to help you clarify things.\n\nThat being said, Frida Kahlo's life and art are fascinating topics, and I'm happy to chat with you about them! If you have any questions or topics you'd like to discuss, feel free to ask.",
