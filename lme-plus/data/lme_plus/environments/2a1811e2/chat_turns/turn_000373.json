  "content": "That sounds like so much fun! I'm sure Rachel will appreciate the effort you're putting into planning a memorable bachelorette party for her. Having a beautiful Airbnb in a beach town is a great starting point, and I'm sure you'll have a blast celebrating with your friends.\n\nSeptember is just around the corner, so it's perfect timing to get the girls together and give Rachel a wonderful sendoff before she ties the knot. What kind of activities are you planning for the weekend? Are you thinking of doing any specific beach activities, like surfing or paddleboarding, or maybe some relaxation time with spa treatments and good food?\n\nAlso, don't forget to check in with Rachel about the wedding gift for Emma. You might want to coordinate with her to make sure you're not getting the same gift, or to get some inspiration from her if you're still undecided.",
