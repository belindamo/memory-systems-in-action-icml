Here are some tips to help you keep your Asics Gel-Kayano 28 shoes in top shape:\n\n1. **Clean them regularly**: Use a soft-bristled brush or a clean cloth to remove dirt and debris from the upper material. For tougher stains, you can use a mild soap and water solution. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can damage the materials.\n2. **Dry them naturally**: After cleaning, let your shoes air dry naturally. Avoid direct sunlight, heat, or using a hair dryer to speed up the drying process. This can cause the materials to degrade or become misshapen.\n3. **Store them properly**: Keep your shoes in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. You can store them in a shoe box or bag, but make sure they're not cramped or compressed, which can cause creases and damage.\n4. **Use a shoe tree or stuff them with newspaper**: To maintain the shape of your shoes, use a shoe tree or stuff them with crumpled newspaper when not in use. This will help prevent creases and keep the materials from collapsing.\n5. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Don't leave your shoes in a hot car or in freezing temperatures for extended periods. This can cause the materials to degrade or become brittle.\n6. **Rotate your shoes**: If you have multiple pairs, try to rotate them every few days to give each pair a break. This can help distribute the wear and tear more evenly.\n7. **Check and replace the insoles**: Over time, the insoles can lose their cushioning and support. Check them regularly and replace them if you notice a significant decrease in comfort or performance.\n8. **Use a waterproofing spray**: Apply a waterproofing spray to the upper material to protect it from water and stains. This can help prevent damage and make cleaning easier.\n9. **Avoid over-tightening the laces**: Try not to over-tighten the laces, as this can cause the materials to stretch or become misshapen.\n10. **Get them serviced**: If you notice any issues with the shoes, such as loose stitching or worn-out soles, take them to a reputable shoe repair service to get them fixed.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help extend the life of your Asics Gel-Kayano 28 shoes and keep them performing at their best.\n\nRemember, it's also important to replace your shoes regularly to avoid injuries and maintain optimal performance. The general rule of thumb is to replace your shoes every 300-500 miles or every 3-6 months, depending on your running frequency and intensity.",
