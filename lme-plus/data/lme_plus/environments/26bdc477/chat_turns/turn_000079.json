  "content": "You're thinking strategically about your content! I think it's a great idea to start with a kitchen tour or a meal prep planning session. Here's why:\n\n**Kitchen Tour**:\n\n* A kitchen tour can be a great way to introduce your audience to your cooking space and show them where the magic happens.\n* It can also help establish your credibility and expertise as a cook and meal prep enthusiast.\n* You can point out your favorite kitchen tools, gadgets, and appliances, and share why you love them.\n* A kitchen tour can be a more relaxed and conversational format, which can help your audience get to know you better.\n\n**Meal Prep Planning Session**:\n\n* A meal prep planning session can be a great way to showcase your process and provide valuable information to your audience.\n* You can walk your audience through how you plan your meals for the week, including how you decide on recipes, make a grocery list, and shop for ingredients.\n* This can be a very informative and engaging format, as your audience will be able to see how you think and plan your meals.\n* You can also share tips and tricks for meal planning, such as how to save time, reduce food waste, and stay organized.\n\n**Why not start with a meal prep cooking session?**\n\n* While a meal prep cooking session can be a great way to showcase your cooking skills and provide a recipe, it may not be the best starting point for your meal prep content.\n* A cooking session may not provide as much context or background information about your meal prep process, which can make it harder for your audience to follow along.\n* By starting with a kitchen tour or meal prep planning session, you can provide more context and background information, which can make your cooking session more informative and engaging.\n\nSo, I think starting with a kitchen tour or meal prep planning session is a great way to introduce your meal prep content and provide value to your audience. Once you've established your process and provided context, you can move on to more cooking-focused content.",
