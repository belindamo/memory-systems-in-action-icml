  "content": "Thank you so much for the recommendations! I think I'll start with Yoga with Adriene on YouTube, I've heard great things about her channel and it's free, which is a big plus. And I'll definitely take your advice and start with Hatha or Yin yoga to begin with.\n\nI'm excited to get started, but I have one more question: what if I'm not flexible at all? I'm not exactly the most bendy person, and I'm worried that I'll struggle with some of the poses. Should I be worried about that, or is it okay if I can't do every pose perfectly?\n\nAnd one more thing: what kind of equipment do I need to get started? Do I need a yoga mat, blocks, straps, or anything else?",
