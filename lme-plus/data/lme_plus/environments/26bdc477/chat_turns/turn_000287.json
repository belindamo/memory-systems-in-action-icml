  "content": "As a kid, I was lucky to have access to great chess coaches and a wealth of information on the internet to learn strategies and techniques. This allowed me to eventually reach the title of international master. But it wasn't just about the accolades for me. I wanted to use my passion for chess to inspire and teach others. I started volunteering at local schools and community centers, teaching kids the game and showing them the benefits of strategic thinking and problem-solving.\n\nIn addition to teaching chess, I also found myself drawn to helping others. I became a volunteer for 7 Cups, a counseling organization that connects people in need with trained listeners. As a listener, I provided support to teens struggling with mental health issues, especially during the pandemic. This experience taught me the importance of community-building and the impact it can have on individuals and society as a whole.\n\nAs I continued to learn and grow, I became interested in computer science. I saw it as a way to use my skills to build solutions to real-world problems. I took advanced placement computer science in high school and continued my studies in community college, where I took courses in data science and assembly language. I also interned at a mobile development company, where I gained hands-on experience in building web applications.\n\nNow, as I prepare to transfer to the university, I am excited to continue my studies in computer science and use my skills to make a positive impact on campus and in the wider community. I plan to use my community-building skills to connect with fellow students and work together on projects that benefit the university and society. I also hope to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in computer science, so that I can develop solutions to some of the most pressing problems facing our world today.\n\nIn short, my diverse experiences in chess, mental health, and computer science have given me a unique perspective and set of skills that I believe make me a strong candidate for the university's computer science program. I am passionate about using these skills to make a positive impact on the world and I am excited to continue learning and growing at the university.",
