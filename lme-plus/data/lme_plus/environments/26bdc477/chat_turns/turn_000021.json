That's a great accomplishment.\n\nNow, let's talk about finding the perfect coffee table to fit your mid-century modern style. Wooden finishes with clean lines are a great choice, and there are many options available. Here are some tips to consider when choosing a coffee table:\n\n1. **Wood type**: Mid-century modern often features woods like oak, walnut, and teak. These woods have a warm, rich tone that adds depth to the space. You can also consider reclaimed or sustainably sourced woods for an eco-friendly option.\n2. **Leg design**: Look for tables with tapered legs or hairpin legs, which are characteristic of mid-century modern design. These legs create a sense of lightness and elegance.\n3. **Top shape**: A rectangular or oval shape can work well in a living room, while a round or hexagonal shape can add visual interest.\n4. **Size**: Consider the scale of your furniture and the room. A larger coffee table can anchor the space, while a smaller one can create a cozier feel.\n5. **Storage**: If you need storage, look for a coffee table with a shelf or drawers. This can help keep clutter at bay and keep your living room organized.\n6. **Budget**: Set a budget and stick to it. You can find affordable options at IKEA or West Elm, or invest in a higher-end piece from a designer brand.\n\nSome popular online retailers for mid-century modern-inspired coffee tables include:\n\n* West Elm\n* Crate & Barrel\n* Room & Board\n* CB2\n* AllModern\n\nYou can also check out online marketplaces like Etsy or Chairish for unique, vintage, or custom pieces.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider the following questions:\n\n* How will you use the coffee table? (e.g., will you be placing drinks, snacks, or laptops on it?)\n* What is the color scheme and style of your living room?\n* Do you have any specific design elements you want to incorporate (e.g., metal accents, glass top)?\n\nBy considering these factors, you'll be able to find a coffee table that fits your style and meets your needs. Happy shopping!",
