However, we recommend spending at least 3-5 days in the region to fully experience its culture, history, and natural beauty.\n\nDuring this time, you can visit some of the region's top attractions, such as the coastal towns of Llanes and Cudillero, the Picos de Europa National Park, and the historic city of Oviedo. You can also enjoy the local cuisine, take part in outdoor activities like hiking or cycling, or simply relax on the region's beautiful beaches.\n\nOf course, if you have more time, you can explore even further and discover hidden gems throughout the region. Additionally, if you're interested in visiting other parts of Spain, Asturias is well-connected to other regions by train and air, so it's easy to extend your trip and explore more of the country.",
