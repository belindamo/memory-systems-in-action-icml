  "content": "Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Corey Carter, founded his record label, Roc-A-Fella Records, in 1995. At the time, he was signed to another label, but he and his partners, Damon Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, wanted to have more control over their music and career.\n\nWith a $1 million investment from Priority Records, Roc-A-Fella Records was born. The label's first album was Jay-Z's debut album, \"Reasonable Doubt,\" which was released in 1996 and became an instant classic. The album was a critical and commercial success, and it set the stage for Jay-Z and Roc-A-Fella's continued growth in the music industry.\n\nOver the years, Roc-A-Fella signed other successful hip-hop artists, including Kanye West, Cam'ron, Beanie Sigel, and Memphis Bleek. Jay-Z's business acumen and ability to cultivate talent were key factors in the label's success. He was involved in every aspect of the label's operations, from A&R to marketing and promotion.\n\nIn 1998, Roc-A-Fella signed a distribution deal with Def Jam Recordings, which gave the label even greater exposure and resources. Jay-Z eventually became the president and CEO of Def Jam, further expanding his impact on the music industry.\n\nIn 2008, Jay-Z left Def Jam and Roc-A-Fella Records to start his own label, Roc Nation. Roc-A-Fella continued to operate under Dash and Burke for a few years before disbanding.\n\nOverall, Jay-Z's ability to identify and develop talent, coupled with his business savvy, helped make Roc-A-Fella Records one of the biggest and most influential hip-hop labels in the music industry.",
