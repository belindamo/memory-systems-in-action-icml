These styles focus on holding poses for longer periods, which can help you build strength, flexibility, and balance. They're also great for relaxation and reducing stress.\n\nAs for finding a yoga video or app, I think it's a fantastic idea! Following along with a video or app can help you learn proper form and technique, and it can also keep you motivated and accountable.\n\nThere are many great yoga apps and websites out there, but some popular ones for beginners include:\n\n* Yoga with Adriene (YouTube channel)\n* Down Dog (app)\n* YogaGlo (app and website)\n* DoYouYoga (app and website)\n\nYou can start with some beginner-friendly videos or classes, and then gradually move on to more challenging ones as you become more comfortable with the poses and sequences.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to listen",
