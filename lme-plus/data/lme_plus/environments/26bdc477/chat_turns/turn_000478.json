While revenue-backed loans offer an attractive alternative for covering part or all of the costs, there are some potential drawbacks to the proposed loan structure that should be taken into account.\n\nFirstly, the borrower is the community water board, which may pose a challenge in terms of their ability to repay the loan. Community water boards in developing countries often lack the resources and expertise needed to manage a loan effectively, increasing the risk of default. This is a key concern for lenders, as default would result in financial losses for both parties.\n\nSecondly, the loan is secured by the assignment and pledge of net revenues of the water system pursuant to the loan agreement between the borrower and the lender. While this provides some security for the lender, it also puts pressure on the borrower to generate sufficient revenue to meet the debt service requirements. The borrower must covenant in the loan agreement that tariffs (i.e., water fees) will be set so that annual net revenues (gross revenues less uncollectable bills less operating and maintenance expenses) are equal to 120% of annual debt service (principal and interest). This could lead to a situation where the borrower must increase tariffs to unsustainable levels, which could be detrimental to the community's access to water.\n\nThirdly, any net revenues left after payment of interest and principal on the loan will be placed in a maintenance reserve fund to be used for capital plant renewal. While this provision is intended to ensure the long-term sustainability of the water system, it could limit the borrower's ability to allocate funds to other pressing community needs.\n\nFinally, periodic and auditable financial reports are required to be prepared by the borrower. While this provision is essential to monitor the borrower's compliance with the loan agreement, it could also place an additional burden on the borrower's administrative resources.\n\nOverall, while revenue-backed loans have the potential to provide an alternative funding source for low-cost rural water systems, the proposed loan structure should be evaluated carefully from both the lender's and borrower's perspectives. The potential risks associated with the borrower's ability to repay the loan and the borrower's ability to generate sufficient revenue while maintaining affordable tariffs should be taken into account. The long-term sustainability of the water system should also be carefully considered, along with the potential impact of allocating funds to the maintenance reserve account on other pressing community needs.",
