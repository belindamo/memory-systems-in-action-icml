  "content": "I have always been grateful for the privilege that has allowed me to pursue my passions and interests. Growing up, I had access to great coaches and resources that helped me become an international master in chess. I was able to learn from the best players in the world and develop strategies that helped me succeed in competitive tournaments.\n\nBut as I progressed in my chess career, I realized that my privilege also gave me a responsibility to give back to my community. I took on the role of a coach and mentor for younger players, and I was able to see the impact that my guidance had on their growth and development. I learned the importance of community-building and how it can help individuals achieve their goals and dreams.\n\nI continued to apply these principles in my work with 7 cups, an organization that provides mental health support to teenagers. As a volunteer, I spent over 150 hours connecting with teens and supporting them through difficult times. I learned about the different mental illnesses and psychotherapies that can help individuals cope with their struggles. I also mentored other volunteers and taught them how to provide support to those in need.\n\nIn addition to my community-building skills, I have also pursued my passion for solving real-world problems through my studies in computer science. I took AP Computer Science and several courses at a community college that allowed me to explore the depths and complexity of the field. I also gained practical experience through an internship where I learned about software development and the different frameworks that are used to build applications.\n\nI plan on using all of these skills and experiences to make a positive impact at the university. As a computer science student, I will bring my passion for solving problems and my community-building skills to the campus. I will work on projects that address pressing issues in society and strive to make a difference in the lives of others. I will continue to use my privilege to help those who are less fortunate and work towards creating a better world for everyone.",
