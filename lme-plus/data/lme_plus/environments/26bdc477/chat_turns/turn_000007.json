That's a great game, and it's even more special when you get to share it with family.\n\nNow, let's get to some game night suggestions for your group of 4-5 friends! Here are a few recommendations that are perfect for a fun and engaging evening:\n\n1. **Codenames**: A word-guessing game where players try to identify words based on one-word clues given by their teammate. Great for larger groups and encourages teamwork and creative thinking.\n2. **Settlers of Catan**: A classic board game of strategy and resource management. Players collect resources, build roads, and trade with each other to build settlements and cities on an island. Easy to learn, but with depth for experienced players.\n3. **Mysterium**: A cooperative game where one player takes on the role of a ghost trying to communicate with the other players (psychic mediums) to solve a murder mystery. Great for groups who enjoy teamwork and deduction.\n4. **Pandemic**: Another cooperative game where players work together to stop the spread of diseases and save the world. Each player has a unique role with different abilities, making it a great game for groups with diverse strengths.\n5. **Deception**: A social deduction game where one player takes on the role of a spy, and the others must figure out who it is through a series of questions and accusations. Great for groups who enjoy bluffing and deduction.\n6. **Wits & Wagers**: A trivia game that's more about guessing the answers of your friends than knowing the correct answers yourself. A fun, light-hearted game that's perfect for a casual game night.\n7. **Forbidden Island/Forbidden Desert**: A cooperative game where players work together to retrieve four treasures from an island/desert before it sinks/gets buried in sand. Easy to learn, but with increasing difficulty as the game progresses.\n8. **Taboo**: A fast-paced word-guessing game where players take turns describing a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases. Great for groups who enjoy wordplay and quick thinking.\n\nThese games offer a mix of strategy, teamwork, and social interaction that should appeal to a group of 4-5 friends. You can choose one or two games to play depending on the time you have available and the interests of your group.\n\nWhich one of these games catches your attention, or do you have any specific preferences (e.g., strategy, party game, cooperative)?",
