  "content": "I think I'm going to give it a try. I'll start with a 10-minute yoga routine, 3 times a week, and see how it goes. I'll try to do it at 8:00 am, right after I wake up, and then have my coffee and check my emails afterwards.\n\nI'm a bit worried that I might not be able to wake up earlier, but I'll try to go to bed a bit earlier tonight to make up for the lost sleep. And if I miss a day or two, I won't be too hard on myself. I'll just get back on track as soon as I can.\n\nDo you think it's a good idea to find a yoga video or app to follow along with, or should I just wing it and do some simple stretches on my own?\n\nAlso, what kind of yoga would you recommend for a beginner like me? Should I start with something gentle like Hatha or Yin, or try something more dynamic like Vinyasa or Ashtanga?",
