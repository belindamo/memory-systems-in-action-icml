  "content": "Growing up, I was lucky to have access to some of the best chess coaches and resources available. I spent hours on end studying different strategies, pouring over games from some of the greatest players in history, and practicing my own skills. My dedication paid off and I eventually earned the title of International Master.\n\nBut becoming an International Master wasn't just about my own personal success. I knew that I had been given a great privilege in being able to learn and grow in the game of chess, and I wanted to give back to my community. I began volunteering as a chess coach, teaching kids and inspiring them to reach their full potential. Through this experience, I learned the importance of community building and working together to achieve a common goal.\n\nIn addition to my work as a chess coach, I also volunteered with 7 Cups, a counseling organization that helps teens struggling with mental health issues. The pandemic has only amplified the need for mental health support, and I was proud to be able to help in any way I could. I connected with teens as a listener, providing support and guidance during difficult times. This experience taught me the importance of empathy and understanding, and how even the smallest gestures can make a big difference in someone's life.\n\nAs I began to explore my interests in college, I found myself drawn to the field of computer science. I was fascinated by the potential for CS to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on society. I enrolled in a series of challenging courses, and even completed an internship in mobile development, where I learned the ins and outs of building polished and user-friendly apps. I also participated in hackathons, where I was able to put my skills to the test and work on projects that I was passionate about.\n\nNow, as I prepare to transfer to the university, I am excited to bring all of these experiences and skills to campus. I know that I have a lot to offer, and I am eager to use my knowledge of chess and my community-building skills to make a positive impact at the university. I am also looking forward to continuing my studies in computer science, where I know I will be able to solve even more complex and pressing problems.\n\nI am confident that my background and experiences have prepared me well for success at the university. I am ready to hit the ground running and make the most of every opportunity that comes my way. I am excited to be a part of the university community, and I am determined to make a positive difference in any way that I can.",
