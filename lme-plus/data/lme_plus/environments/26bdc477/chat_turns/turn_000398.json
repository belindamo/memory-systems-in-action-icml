It's wonderful that you had a fun experience and helped raise funds for the local children's hospital. You should definitely feel proud of yourself and the impact you've made.\n\nI think trying out both Strava and MapMyRide is a great idea. You'll get to experience their different features and interfaces, and see which one resonates with you more. Both apps have their strengths, and it's not uncommon for cyclists to use multiple apps depending on their needs.\n\nRemember to take advantage of the features that help you track your progress, set goals, and connect with other cyclists. You might find that one app is better suited for planning routes, while the other is more geared towards tracking your performance and progress.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any more questions or need further recommendations. And don't hesitate to share your experiences with the apps \u2013 I'd love to hear about your adventures and offer any additional tips or advice!\n\nKeep riding, and I hope you have many more fun and fulfilling experiences on your bike!",
