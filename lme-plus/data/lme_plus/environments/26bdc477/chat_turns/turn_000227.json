  "content": "The Altalena affair, a significant and controversial event in the early history of the State of Israel, resulted in the deaths of 16 people. The conflict arose from a disagreement between the newly-established Israeli government, led by David Ben-Gurion, and the Irgun (also known as the Etzel), a militant Zionist organization that had played a role in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The Irgun resisted the government's demand that the Altalena, a ship carrying arms and other supplies for the Irgun, be turned over to the Israeli military. The conflict between the two sides resulted in a confrontation, and 16 people were killed in the ensuing violence.\n\nThe Altalena affair is remembered as a significant and controversial event in Israeli history and is often cited as a key moment in the consolidation of power by the newly-established Israeli government. The conflict was eventually resolved with the intervention of the Israeli military, and the Irgun eventually agreed to dissolve itself and join the mainstream Zionist movement. Menachem Begin, the leader of the Irgun, later went on to play a significant role in Israeli politics and served as Prime Minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983.",
