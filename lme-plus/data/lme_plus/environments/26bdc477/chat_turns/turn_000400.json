  "content": "Strava's Route Builder is a powerful tool that can help you create custom routes tailored to your preferences. Here are some tips to help you use it effectively:\n\n1. **Start with a goal in mind**: Before you begin, think about what you want to achieve with your route. Do you want to ride a certain distance, explore a new area, or tackle a specific type of terrain? Having a clear goal in mind will help you focus your route-building efforts.\n2. **Use the map view**: Strava's map view is incredibly detailed, and you can zoom in and out to get a better sense of the terrain, roads, and features. Use this view to get a sense of the lay of the land and identify potential routes.\n3. **Draw your route**: Click and drag to draw your route on the map. You can add waypoints, adjust the route, and even use the \"Snap to Road\" feature to ensure you're following actual roads.\n4. **Use the elevation profile**: The elevation profile is a game-changer for route planning. It shows you the ups and downs of your route, helping you plan for challenging climbs or avoid steep hills. You can even use the \"Elevation Filter\" to limit the amount of climbing or descending.\n5. **Take advantage of Strava's route suggestions**: Strava's algorithm can suggest routes based on your preferences, such as distance, elevation gain, and terrain. You can use these suggestions as a starting point and then customize them to fit your needs.\n6. **Add waypoints and notes**: Add waypoints to mark important points along your route, like water stops, scenic views, or challenging sections. You can also add notes to remind yourself of specific tips or warnings.\n7. **Save and name your route**: Once you've created your route, save it and give it a descriptive name. This will help you keep track of your routes and share them with others.\n8. **Test and refine**: Before you head out on your ride, test your route by previewing it on Strava's map or using the \"Simulate Ride\" feature. This will help you identify any issues or areas for improvement.\n9. **Share and export**: Share your route with friends or export it as a GPX file for use with other devices or apps.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create custom routes that meet your specific needs and preferences. Happy route-building, and I hope you enjoy your ride!",
