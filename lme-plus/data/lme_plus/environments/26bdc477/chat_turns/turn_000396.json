The app has a strong focus on cycling and offers features like:\n\t* Route planning with elevation profiles and distance markers\n\t* Real-time GPS tracking with audio cues\n\t* Performance analytics and segment leaderboards\n\t* Integration with many cycling devices and wearables\n2. **MapMyRide**: MapMyRide is another well-known app that's specifically designed for cyclists. It offers:\n\t* Route planning with elevation profiles and distance markers\n\t* Real-time GPS tracking with audio cues\n\t* Performance analytics and nutrition tracking\n\t* Integration with many cycling devices and wearables\n\t* A large community of users who share and discover routes\n3. **Ride with GPS**: Ride with GPS is a popular app among cyclists, especially those who prefer a more traditional GPS-style interface. It offers:\n\t* Route planning with elevation profiles and distance markers\n\t* Real-time GPS tracking with audio cues\n\t* Turn-by-turn directions and voice prompts\n\t* Integration with many cycling devices and wearables\n\t* A large library of user-generated routes\n4. **Google Maps**: While not specifically designed for cycling, Google Maps is a great option for route planning. It offers:\n\t* Route planning with elevation profiles and distance markers\n\t* Real-time traffic updates and road closures\n\t* Integration with Google's vast mapping data\n\t* Ability to export routes as a GPX file for use with other apps or devices\n\nAll of these options have a user-friendly interface and are available on both desktop and mobile devices. You can try out a few to see which one works best for you.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider the following features when choosing a mapping tool or app:\n\n* **GPX file support**: If you plan to use a GPS device or another app, look for tools that allow you to export routes as GPX files.\n* **Offline mode**: If you'll be riding in areas with limited internet connectivity, consider an app that allows offline mode or caching of maps.\n* **Elevation profiles**: If you're concerned about hills or want to plan routes with specific elevation gain, look for tools that provide elevation profiles.\n* **Community features**: If you want to connect with other cyclists, share routes, or join challenges, consider apps with strong community features.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect mapping tool or app for your bike route planning needs!",
