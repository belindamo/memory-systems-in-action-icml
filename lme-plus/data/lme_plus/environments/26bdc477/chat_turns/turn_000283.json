  "content": "As a kid growing up in the Bay Area, I was fortunate enough to have the resources and support to learn and excel at chess. By the time I was 16, I had achieved the title of International Master. But it wasn't just about the personal accomplishment for me \u2013 I wanted to share my love for the game with others and inspire them to learn as well.\n\nI started teaching chess to elementary school students at my local community center and quickly realized the importance of community building. It wasn't just about teaching them the rules and strategies of the game \u2013 it was about creating a safe and supportive space where they could learn, grow, and have fun.\n\nAs the pandemic hit, I shifted my focus to helping teens cope with the challenges of remote learning and isolation through the organization 7 Cups. I spent over 150 hours as a listener, supporting them through mental health issues and providing a listening ear during difficult times. Through this experience, I learned even more about the importance of community and the crucial role it plays in supporting individuals and helping them thrive.\n\nIn parallel to my community building efforts, I also discovered a passion for computer science. I was drawn to the field because of its potential to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact in society. I took a variety of courses at community college and completed a mobile development internship, where I learned about the development process and how to build polished products.\n\nNow, as I prepare to transfer to the University, I am excited to use my community building skills and technical expertise to make a positive impact on campus. I hope to continue to learn and grow as a computer scientist, and eventually use my skills to tackle some of the most pressing issues facing our society, such as improving access to mental health resources and addressing social inequality.",
