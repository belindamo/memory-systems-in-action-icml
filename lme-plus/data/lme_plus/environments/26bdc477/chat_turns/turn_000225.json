  "content": "Menachem Begin, who later served as Prime Minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983, was aboard the Altalena when it arrived in Israel in June 1948. Begin was the leader of the Irgun (also known as the Etzel), a militant Zionist organization that had played a role in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The Altalena was a ship that was used to bring arms and other supplies to the newly-established State of Israel in the aftermath of the war, and Begin was aboard the ship when it arrived in Israel.\n\nThe Altalena affair was a significant and controversial event in the early history of the State of Israel that arose from a conflict between the newly-established Israeli government, led by David Ben-Gurion, and the Irgun. The Irgun resisted the government's demand that the ship's cargo be turned over to the Israeli military, leading to a confrontation between the two sides. The conflict was eventually resolved with the intervention of the Israeli military, and the Irgun eventually agreed to dissolve itself and join the mainstream Zionist movement. Menachem Begin later went on to play a significant role in Israeli politics, serving as Prime Minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983.",
