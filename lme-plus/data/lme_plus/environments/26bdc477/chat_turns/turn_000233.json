  "content": "Yitzhak Rabin, who later served as Prime Minister of Israel from 1974 to 1977 and again from 1992 until his assassination in 1995, played a role in the Altalena affair, a significant and controversial event in the early history of the State of Israel. At the time of the Altalena affair, Rabin was a military officer in the newly-established Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).\n\nThe Altalena affair arose from a conflict between the Israeli government, led by David Ben-Gurion, and the Irgun (also known as the Etzel), a militant Zionist organization that had played a role in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The Irgun resisted the government's demand that the Altalena, a ship carrying arms and other supplies for the Irgun, be turned over to the Israeli military, leading to a confrontation between the two sides.\n\nAs a military officer, Rabin played a role in the resolution of the Altalena affair. It is not clear exactly what his specific role was, but it is possible that he may have been involved in negotiations or in the planning and execution of military operations related to the conflict. The Altalena affair was eventually resolved with the intervention of the Israeli military, and the Irgun eventually agreed to dissolve itself and join the mainstream Zionist movement. Rabin later went on to play a significant role in Israeli politics and served as Prime Minister of Israel on two occasions.",
