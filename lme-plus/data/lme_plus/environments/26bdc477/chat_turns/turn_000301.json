Working with fondant can be a bit tricky, but with some tips and tricks, you'll be a pro in no time!\n\n**Tips for Working with Fondant:**\n\n1. **Knead the Fondant:** Before working with fondant, knead it until it becomes pliable and easy to work with. This will help remove any air pockets and make it more manageable.\n2. **Dust Your Surface:** Dust your work surface with cornstarch or powdered sugar to prevent the fondant from sticking.\n3. **Use the Right Tools:** Invest in a set of fondant tools, such as a fondant smoother, fondant cutter, and a ball tool. These will help you shape and smooth out the fondant.\n4. **Work in Small Sections:** Divide the fondant into smaller sections, and work on one section at a time. This will prevent the fondant from drying out and becoming too stiff.\n5. **Keep it Hydrated:** If the fondant becomes too dry, you can revive it by adding a small amount of water or shortening.

This will help you create a more realistic tassel.\n\n**Tips for Creating a Graduation Cap:**\n\n1. **Use a Template:** Create a template of a graduation cap using paper or cardstock.
