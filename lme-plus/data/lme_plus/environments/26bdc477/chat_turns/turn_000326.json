  "content": "Wukong stormed into the alcove cage, his face contorted in anger. Without hesitation, he threw Macaque aside and lunged at MK, grabbing him by the throat and lifting him off the ground.\n\n\"You're not going anywhere this time,\" Wukong snarled. \"I won't have you be rescued again.\"\n\nMK gasped for air, trying to free himself from Wukong's grip. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest as he realized the gravity of the situation. This time, there was no one coming to save him.\n\n\"Wukong, please!\" Macaque cried out, trying to intervene. \"Don't do this!\"\n\nBut Wukong was too far gone. He ignored Macaque and focused all his attention on MK.\n\n\"You were fun while it lasted,\" Wukong sneered. \"But now it's time for you to pay for your crimes.\"\n\nMK's mind raced as he struggled to break free, but it was no use. He was completely at Wukong's mercy.\n\n\"Please... I didn't mean to do anything wrong,\" MK gasped, his voice barely audible. \"I didn't know...\"\n\nWukong's grip tightened, cutting off MK's words.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Wukong growled. \"You knew enough to betray me. And now, you'll pay the price.\"\n\nMK's eyes widened in terror as he realized Wukong was going to kill him. He looked over at Macaque, who was standing a few feet away, helpless.\n\nThis was it, MK thought. This was the end.",
