  "content": "That sounds like a great plan! You're setting yourself up for success by committing to a specific time block, using a Pomodoro timer, and eliminating distractions. Don't forget to be kind to yourself if you struggle at first \u2013 it takes time to develop new habits and adjust to the technique.\n\nI'm glad to hear that you're excited to try out the Pomodoro Technique! Remember to review and adjust your approach as needed. You might find that you need to make changes to your Pomodoro duration, break lengths, or work sessions to fit your unique needs.\n\nNow, I'm curious \u2013 what did Dr. Smith recommend to help you process your emotions and gain perspective? I'm all ears!",
