Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Energy boost**: Exercise releases endorphins, which can help increase your energy levels and wakefulness, making it easier to tackle the day.\n2. **Improved mental clarity**: Morning exercise can help increase blood flow to the brain, making you more alert and focused.\n3. **Reduced stress**: Exercise is a natural stress-reducer, and starting your day with a calming activity like yoga can help set a positive tone.\n4. **Increased motivation**: Accomplishing a short workout or walk in the morning can give you a sense of accomplishment and motivation to tackle the rest of your day.\n\nTo incorporate exercise into your morning routine, you could try the following:\n\n1. **Start small**: Begin with a manageable 10-minute routine and gradually increase the duration or intensity as you become more comfortable.\n2. **Schedule it**: Treat your morning exercise as a non-negotiable part of your routine, just like brushing your teeth or taking a shower.\n3. **Find an activity you enjoy**: Choose an exercise that you enjoy, whether it's yoga, walking, jogging, or even some light stretching. This will make it more likely that you'll stick to your routine.\n4. **Make it convenient**: Find a way to fit exercise into your existing routine. If you're already having coffee at 8:00 am, try doing a quick 10-minute yoga routine or taking a short walk around the block before or after your coffee.\n\nHere's an example of how you could modify your morning routine to include exercise:\n\n7:50 am - Wake up\n8:00 am - 10-minute yoga or short walk\n8:10 am - Shower and get dressed\n8:20 am - Have coffee and check emails/respond to urgent messages\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust your routine as needed. If you're not a morning person, you might need to start with a shorter exercise routine and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable.\n\nHow does this sound? Are you ready to give it a try?",
