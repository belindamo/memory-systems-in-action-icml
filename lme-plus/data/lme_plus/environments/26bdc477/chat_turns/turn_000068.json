And don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two - just get back on track as soon as you can.\n\nAlso, don't forget to listen to your body and take rest days when you need them. It's important to balance activity with rest and recovery to avoid burnout.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you all the best on your new morning routine and yoga journey!\n\nNow, I have a question for you: how do you usually plan your day? Do you use a planner, app, or just wing it?",
