  "content": "As a privileged international chess master, I have had the resources and opportunities to develop my skills and become a top player. However, I didn't want to keep these advantages to myself. I wanted to inspire and teach others, particularly those from underprivileged communities, to learn and excel in chess. I began volunteering as a chess coach at a local after-school program, and it was there that I realized the importance of community building and supporting each other.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I joined 7 Cups, a counseling organization, where I worked with teens struggling with mental health issues. Through my conversations with them, I learned how to provide emotional support and how to listen actively. I also took online classes in psychology and read books on different psychotherapies to better understand the challenges my clients were facing. I mentored other volunteers and taught them how to provide support to others.\n\nAs I continued to volunteer and learn, I realized that I wanted to use my skills and knowledge to create solutions to real-world problems. That's when I decided to pursue a degree in computer science. I enrolled in community college and took several computer science courses, including Data Science, where I used Python libraries to perform data analysis, and Assembly, where I learned how code is executed on a CPU. I also completed an internship at a tech company, where I worked on a web development project and learned about programmatic collaboration and agile development.\n\nNow, as I prepare to transfer to the university, I am excited to use my community-building skills and technical knowledge to make a positive impact on campus. I plan on joining clubs and organizations that focus on social justice and community service, and using my skills in computer science to build solutions to help others. For example, I could use my data analysis skills to support a mental health organization and create a platform for teens to connect with mental health",
