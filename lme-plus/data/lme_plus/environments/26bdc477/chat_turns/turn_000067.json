  "content": "Thank you so much for putting my mind at ease about the flexibility thing! I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do yoga because I'm not super flexible, but it's great to know that it's not about that at all.\n\nAnd thank you for the advice on equipment - I'll definitely invest in a good quality yoga mat to start with, and then add props as I need them. I'm excited to get started and see how it goes!\n\nI think I'm all set to start my new morning routine tomorrow. I'll make sure to set my alarm a bit earlier, and then do my 10-minute yoga routine before having my coffee and checking my emails. Fingers crossed that I can stick to it and make it a habit!\n\nThanks again for all your help and advice - I really appreciate it!",
