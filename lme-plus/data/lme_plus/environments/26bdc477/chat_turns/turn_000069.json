  "content": "I'm a digital person, so I usually plan my day using a task management app called Todoist. I love it because I can access it from my phone, computer, or tablet, and it syncs across all my devices. I can create tasks, set deadlines, and prioritize them according to importance and urgency. It also has a habit tracker feature, which I'm planning to use to track my yoga practice and morning routine.\n\nI also use Google Calendar to schedule meetings and appointments, and I try to block out dedicated time for focused work and breaks throughout the day. I find that having a clear plan and schedule helps me stay on track and manage my time more effectively.\n\nHow about you? Do you have a preferred method for planning your day or staying organized?",
