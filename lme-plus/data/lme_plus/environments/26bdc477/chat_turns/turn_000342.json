Protecting consumers: Policymakers can ensure that consumers are protected by implementing mechanisms such as consumer protection laws and affordable pricing standards.\n\n3. Encouraging innovation: Policymakers can encourage innovation by supporting research and development, providing incentives for investment in new technologies and improving access to funding for start-ups in the telecommunications sector.\n\n4. Promoting access to essential services: Policymakers can ensure that all consumers have access to essential telecommunications services, such as broadband internet and phone service, by implementing regulatory measures such as universal service funding and support.\n\n5.
