  "content": "Macaque's body ripples with energy as he steps between Wukong and MK. \"You won't lay a hand on him,\" he growls, his eyes glowing with power.\n\nWukong snarls and charges at Macaque, their bodies colliding with a resounding boom. They trade blows, neither gaining the upper hand. Meanwhile, MK clings to Macaque's fur, feeling the strength of the monkey's muscles as he runs.\n\nMacaque spins around, putting his back to the cage door. \"Hold on tight,\" he says to MK, his voice strained as he fights off Wukong's attacks. \"We're getting out of here.\"\n\nMK nods, burying his face in Macaque's fur. He feels the heat of Wukong's breath on his back and knows that the demon is getting closer. But Macaque fights on, his body glowing with power as he holds Wukong at bay.\n\nFinally, with a mighty roar, Macaque shoves Wukong back and makes a break for the door. MK can see the light streaming in from outside, and he feels a surge of hope.\n\nBut as they reach the door, a massive hand snatches at Macaque's tail, causing him to stumble. MK tumbles to the ground, rolling away from Wukong's grasp. He scrambles to his feet and turns to see Wukong standing over him, his eyes filled with rage.\n\n\"You can't run from me,\" Wukong snarls. \"I'll always find you.\"\n\nBut just as Wukong reaches for him, a bright light envelops the alcove. MK shields his eyes, and when he looks back, Wukong is gone.\n\nMacaque limps over to MK, his body battered and bruised. \"Are you all right?\" he asks, concern etched on his face.\n\nMK nods, still in shock. \"What...what just happened?\"\n\n\"That was my last resort,\" Macaque says, his voice quiet. \"I summoned the power of the universe to banish Wukong. He won't be back for a long time.\"\n\nMK stares at Macaque in awe, realizing for the first time just how powerful the monkey really is. \"Thank you,\" he says softly. \"Thank you for saving my life.\"\n\nMacaque smiles, his eyes twinkling with mischief. \"It was nothing,\" he says. \"Just another day in the life of a monkey king.\"",
