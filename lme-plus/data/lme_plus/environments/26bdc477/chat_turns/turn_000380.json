  "content": "Yes, you can rent mopeds in Asturias to get around. Mopeds are a fun and convenient way to explore the region, especially in more urban areas like Gij\u00f3n or Oviedo.\n\nThere are several rental companies throughout Asturias that offer moped rentals, and you can often find them in tourist areas or near popular attractions. Rental prices can vary depending on the duration of your rental, the model of the moped, and other factors, but you can expect to pay around \u20ac20-\u20ac30 per day.\n\nBefore renting a moped, make sure to check the local traffic laws and regulations, wear appropriate safety gear like a helmet, and always follow safe driving practices. Additionally, be aware that some rural areas or mountain roads may not be suitable for moped travel, so it's always a good idea to check local conditions before setting out.",
