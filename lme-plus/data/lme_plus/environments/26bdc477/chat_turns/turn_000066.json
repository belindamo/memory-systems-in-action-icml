  "content": "That's a great question about flexibility! Don't worry if you're not flexible at all - yoga is for every body, regardless of flexibility level. The beauty of yoga is that it's not about being able to touch your toes or do fancy poses; it's about listening to your body and honoring its limitations.\n\nYou can always modify poses to suit your needs, and many yoga classes and videos will offer modifications for beginners or those with limited flexibility. You can also use props like blocks, straps, or even a wall to help you get into poses that might be challenging for you.\n\nAs for equipment, a good quality yoga mat is a must-have. It will provide grip, cushioning, and support for your joints. You can also consider getting a few props like blocks, straps, and a blanket to help with modifications. But don't feel like you need to invest in a lot of equipment right away - you can always add to your collection as you become more comfortable with your practice.\n\nBy",
