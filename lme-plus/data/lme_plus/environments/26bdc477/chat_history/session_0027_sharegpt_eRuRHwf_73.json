      "content": "As a kid growing up in the Bay Area, I was fortunate enough to have the resources and support to learn and excel at chess. By the time I was 16, I had achieved the title of International Master. But it wasn't just about the personal accomplishment for me \u2013 I wanted to share my love for the game with others and inspire them to learn as well.\n\nI started teaching chess to elementary school students at my local community center and quickly realized the importance of community building. It wasn't just about teaching them the rules and strategies of the game \u2013 it was about creating a safe and supportive space where they could learn, grow, and have fun.\n\nAs the pandemic hit, I shifted my focus to helping teens cope with the challenges of remote learning and isolation through the organization 7 Cups. I spent over 150 hours as a listener, supporting them through mental health issues and providing a listening ear during difficult times. Through this experience, I learned even more about the importance of community and the crucial role it plays in supporting individuals and helping them thrive.\n\nIn parallel to my community building efforts, I also discovered a passion for computer science. I was drawn to the field because of its potential to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact in society. I took a variety of courses at community college and completed a mobile development internship, where I learned about the development process and how to build polished products.\n\nNow, as I prepare to transfer to the University, I am excited to use my community building skills and technical expertise to make a positive impact on campus. I hope to continue to learn and grow as a computer scientist, and eventually use my skills to tackle some of the most pressing issues facing our society, such as improving access to mental health resources and addressing social inequality."

      "content": "As a privileged international chess master, I have had the resources and opportunities to develop my skills and become a top player. However, I didn't want to keep these advantages to myself. I wanted to inspire and teach others, particularly those from underprivileged communities, to learn and excel in chess. I began volunteering as a chess coach at a local after-school program, and it was there that I realized the importance of community building and supporting each other.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I joined 7 Cups, a counseling organization, where I worked with teens struggling with mental health issues. Through my conversations with them, I learned how to provide emotional support and how to listen actively. I also took online classes in psychology and read books on different psychotherapies to better understand the challenges my clients were facing. I mentored other volunteers and taught them how to provide support to others.\n\nAs I continued to volunteer and learn, I realized that I wanted to use my skills and knowledge to create solutions to real-world problems. That's when I decided to pursue a degree in computer science. I enrolled in community college and took several computer science courses, including Data Science, where I used Python libraries to perform data analysis, and Assembly, where I learned how code is executed on a CPU. I also completed an internship at a tech company, where I worked on a web development project and learned about programmatic collaboration and agile development.\n\nNow, as I prepare to transfer to the university, I am excited to use my community-building skills and technical knowledge to make a positive impact on campus. I plan on joining clubs and organizations that focus on social justice and community service, and using my skills in computer science to build solutions to help others. For example, I could use my data analysis skills to support a mental health organization and create a platform for teens to connect with mental health"
