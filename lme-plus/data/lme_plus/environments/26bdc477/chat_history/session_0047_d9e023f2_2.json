      "content": "The Atlantic does have a print edition, and it's a beautiful one at that. They publish 10 print issues per year, with a mix of feature articles, essays, and columns.

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I apologize for the confusion! The Atlantic is not a monthly magazine, but rather a bi-monthly magazine. This means you'll receive a new issue every 2 months, or 6 times a year.\n\nAs a subscriber, you can expect to receive a new issue of The Atlantic every 2 months, with the following schedule:\n\n* January/February issue: shipped in late December or early January\n* March/April issue: shipped in late February or early March\n* May/June issue: shipped in late April or early May\n* July/August issue: shipped in late June or early July\n* September/October issue: shipped in late August or early September\n* November/December issue: shipped in late October or early November\n\nThis bi-monthly schedule allows The Atlantic to focus on in-depth, well-researched articles and features, which often require more time and effort to produce. The slower pace also gives readers a chance to digest and reflect on the content, rather than feeling overwhelmed by a weekly or monthly deluge of new issues.\n\nSo, if you subscribe to The Atlantic, you can expect to receive 6 issues per year, spaced out every 2 months."
