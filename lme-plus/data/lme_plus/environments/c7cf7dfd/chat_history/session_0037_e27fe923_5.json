      "content": "What a lovely gift! Congrats on the Nordstrom gift card!\n\nI'd be happy to help you find a great handbag that complements your new work wardrobe. Before I can provide recommendations, could you please tell me a bit more about your personal style and preferences?\n\nHere are some questions to consider:\n\n1. What's your work style? (e.g. corporate, creative, business casual)\n2. What's the dominant color palette of your new work clothes? (e.g. neutrals, brights, pastels)\n3. Do you have a preferred material in mind for the handbag (e.g. leather, suede, fabric)?\n4. What's your budget range with the gift card? (Nordstrom has a wide range of prices, so it's good to narrow it down)\n5. Do you prefer a specific shape or size of handbag (e.g. tote, shoulder bag, crossbody, small, medium, large)?\n6. Are there any particular brands you're interested in or have considered?\n7. Do you want a bag that's more functional (e.g. lots of pockets, laptop sleeve) or stylish (e.g. fashion-forward design, statement piece)?\n\nAnswering these questions will help me provide you with more tailored recommendations for a handbag that fits your needs and style.\n\nHappy shopping!"

My new work clothes are mostly neutral colors like black, white, and navy, with some subtle patterns. I've been looking at leather handbags, and I think a sleek, black tote would be a great addition to my wardrobe."

      "content": "The Frye Melissa Tote is a fantastic choice!\n\nThe Frye Melissa Tote is a medium-sized tote that's designed to be functional and stylish. Here are the dimensions:\n\n* Height: 11.5 inches (29 cm)\n* Width: 14.5 inches (37 cm)\n* Depth: 4.5 inches (11 cm)\n* Strap drop: 9 inches (23 cm)\n\nIn terms of capacity, the tote has a spacious interior with a dedicated laptop sleeve that can fit a 13-inch laptop.
