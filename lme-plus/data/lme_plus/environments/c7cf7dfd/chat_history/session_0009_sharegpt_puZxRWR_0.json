When a track is playing you can hold down the 33 1/3 RPM button and at the same time press the 45 RPM button. The speed will increase to 45 RPM but when you use it with tiny little pushes you can perform an un hearable positive pitch-bend.\""

      "content": "The given context appears to be referring to a technique used by some people to adjust the pitch of a vinyl record while it's playing. Here are some additional details that may be helpful:\n\n* 33 1/3 RPM (revolutions per minute) and 45 RPM are two common speeds at which vinyl records can be played. Most full-length albums are designed to be played at 33 1/3 RPM, while 45 RPM is typically used for singles or shorter tracks.\n* Pitch-bending is a technique used by DJs and other music professionals to adjust the pitch of a track in real time. It involves changing the speed of the record slightly to make the pitch go up or down. Pitch-bending can be used to create interesting effects or to match the tempo of different tracks so they can be mixed together seamlessly.\n* The pitch-bend trick described in the context involves holding down the 33 1/3 RPM button (presumably on a record player or DJ controller) and simultaneously pressing the 45 RPM button. This causes the speed to increase to 45 RPM, which will raise the pitch of the music. However, the context suggests that the pitch-bend should be done with \"tiny little pushes,\" meaning that the 45 RPM button should be pressed and released quickly and repeatedly to make very small adjustments to the pitch. This can create a subtle pitch-bend effect that is barely audible to the listener."
