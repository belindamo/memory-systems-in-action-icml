  "content": "So, you used a total of 5 coupons last time, which saved you $5. That's a great start!\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* 3 coupons for $1 off Tide = $3 saved\n* 2 coupons for 50 cents off Bounty = $1 saved\n* Total savings: $3 + $1 = $4\n\nWait, I think there might be a small mistake. You mentioned you saved $5, but the calculation above only adds up to $4. Could you double-check your receipts or remember how you saved the extra $1?\n\nOnce we clear this up, we can move forward with planning your next shopping trip to make the most of your remaining coupons!",
