  "content": "There are several political parties in Ireland that have more progressive immigration policies than Fianna F\u00e1il. The Green Party, for example, has advocated for more generous refugee resettlement policies and for a streamlined asylum application process. The Social Democrats have also focused on improving conditions for refugees and asylum seekers in Ireland, including advocating for an end to direct provision (a system that provides accommodation for asylum seekers while their applications are processed). Other parties, such as Sinn F\u00e9in and Labour, have taken similar positions on immigration and refugees in Ireland.",
