  "content": "With your requirements, I'd recommend the following cable management systems that can handle a lot of cables and offer good cable routing options:\n\n1. **Cable Management Panel with Cable Ties and Organizers**: This is a popular option for managing multiple cables. It usually consists of a panel with pre-drilled holes and cable ties or organizers to keep cables tidy. You can find pre-assembled panels with various sizes and configurations.\n\nExample: CableOrganizer's Cable Management Panel (around $50-$100)\n\n2. **Modular Cable Management System**: These systems consist of interlocking modules that can be customized to fit your specific needs. They often include cable ties, cable organizers, and sometimes even built-in USB hubs or power distribution units (PDUs).\n\nExample: CableTiesPlus' Modular Cable Management System (around $100-$150)\n\n3. **Cable Management Box with Advanced Features**: These boxes are designed to manage a large number of cables and often come with features like built-in cable ties, cable organizers, and sometimes even fans or USB hubs.\n\nExample: Anker's Cable Management Box (around $100-$150)\n\n4. **Cable Management Tray with Adjustable Height Settings**: These trays are designed to manage cables vertically, making it easy to route cables behind your desk or along walls. They often come with adjustable height settings and cable ties or organizers.\n\nExample: 3M's Cable Management Tray (around $50-$100)\n\nAll of these options should fit within your budget of $100-$200. Since you're open to pre-assembled solutions, I'd recommend exploring the first three options. If you're comfortable with DIY projects, you could consider building your own cable management system using cable ties, cable organizers, and a wooden or plastic panel.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Cable capacity**: Make sure the system can handle the number of cables you need to manage.\n* **Cable routing options**: Look for systems with adjustable cable ties or organizers that can accommodate different cable lengths and types.\n* **Durability**: Choose a system made from high-quality materials that can withstand regular use.\n* **Aesthetics**: Consider the design and color scheme of the system to ensure it fits with your workspace decor.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect cable management system for your gaming PC!",
