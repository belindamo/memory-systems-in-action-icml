However, generally speaking, Fianna F\u00e1il's stance on immigration has been controversial and has likely affected its appeal to certain voters in Ireland. Some voters may support the party's stricter policies on immigration and believe that it will benefit Ireland's economy and culture. Others may view Fianna F\u00e1il's stance as xenophobic and exclusionary, and may choose to vote for other parties with more progressive immigration policies. Ultimately, the impact of Fianna F\u00e1il's position on immigration will depend on the specific views and priorities of individual voters.",
