There are people and organizations that care about your success and are willing to help. Don't hesitate to reach out to them, and don't give up on your dreams.\n\nAs you navigate these resources, I want to leave you with a quote from Malala Yousafzai, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and refugee herself: \"One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world.\"\n\nYou have the power to create positive change in your life and the lives of those around you. Keep pursuing your educational goals, and remember that you're capable of achieving great things.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask.
