Honey can be a great addition to savory recipes, and pizza sauce is no exception. Here are some tips to consider:\n\n**Using honey in savory dishes:**\n\n1. **Balance the flavors:** Honey can add a rich, depth of flavor to savory dishes, but it's essential to balance it with other ingredients to avoid overpowering the other flavors.\n2. **Choose a robust honey:** For savory dishes, you'll want to use a robust, darker honey (e.g., buckwheat, manuka, or wildflower) that can stand up to the bold flavors.\n3. **Start with a small amount:** Begin with a small amount of honey (about 1-2% of the total sauce volume) and adjust to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess honey.\n4. **Consider the other ingredients:** Honey pairs well with tangy, acidic ingredients like tomatoes, citrus, and vinegar. It can also complement umami flavors like mushrooms, soy sauce, or miso.\n\n**Honey in pizza sauce:**\n\n1. **Enhance the tomato flavor:** Honey can bring out the natural sweetness in tomatoes and add a rich, caramel-like flavor to the sauce.\n2. **Balance the acidity:** A small amount of honey can balance the acidity in tomato sauce, creating a more harmonious flavor profile.\n3. **Add depth and complexity:** Honey can add a layer of complexity to the sauce, making it more interesting and engaging.\n\nHere's a rough guideline for using honey in pizza sauce:\n\n* Start with 1-2 tablespoons of honey per 2 cups of tomato sauce.\n* Adjust the amount based on your personal taste preferences and the other ingredients in the sauce.\n\nRemember, when working with honey in savory dishes, it's all about balance and subtlety. You want to enhance the flavors, not overpower them.\n\nFeel free to experiment with honey in your pizza sauce recipe and see how it turns out!",
