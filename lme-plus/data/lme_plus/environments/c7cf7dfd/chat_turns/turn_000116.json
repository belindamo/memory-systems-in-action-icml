It is typically a written program that includes several key components, such as a risk assessment process where covered accounts are identified, methods to open and access covered accounts are documented, and the financial institution's previous experiences with identity theft are pinpointed. The program may also include board oversight, red flags identification, employee training, and oversight of third-party service providers. An identity theft program is designed to help financial institutions protect their customers from identity theft and to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and other applicable laws and regulations. It is important for financial institutions to have an effective identity theft program in place and to ensure that it is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the financial industry and in identity theft threats.",
