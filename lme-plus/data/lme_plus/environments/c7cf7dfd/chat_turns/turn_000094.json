  "content": "Dear [CEO\u2019s name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I came across the Director of Business Development role for ResProp's Austin market and was impressed by the company's vision to provide premier property management service to investors and owners of residential real estate. After researching ResProp and your leadership, I am confident that my entrepreneurial drive, love for real estate, and proptech experience would be a great fit for this role.\n\nAs an experienced entrepreneur, I have been involved in the coworking and real estate industry for many years. My strengths in team leadership, business development, and strategic partnerships align with the responsibilities of the Director of Business Development role. Additionally, my experience in projective coworking advisory for landlords and advising office property owners to set up full coworking management systems and business models will provide valuable insights to ResProp's goal of evolving into a tech-forward property management service.\n\nI have reviewed ResProp's job description and believe that my skills in establishing a robust pipeline of 3rd party property management opportunities, owning the deal process from the first interaction with the property owner until the property is fully handed over at close, and driving success by providing leadership and innovative strategies to teammates on the 3rd party business development team align with the role's requirements.\n\nI recently moved to Austin from New York City and am excited about the opportunity to work with ResProp. I would love to have the opportunity to speak with you or the hiring manager for further discussion about my qualifications for this role. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
