  "content": "Let's add a column to calculate the total hours played for each game.\n\n**Updated Spreadsheet:**\n\n**Columns:**\n\n1. **Date** (mm/dd/yyyy)\n2. **Game** (title of the game you played)\n3. **Start Time** (HH:MM)\n4. **End Time** (HH:MM)\n5. **Session Hours** (calculated column)\n6. **Total Game Hours** (new column)\n7. **Notes** (optional, for any additional comments or observations)\n\n**Example Row:**\n\n| Date | Game | Start Time | End Time | Session Hours | Total Game Hours | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10/12/2023 | Assassin's Creed | 19:00 | 21:00 | 2 | 2 | Started the game! |\n| 10/13/2023 | Assassin's Creed | 19:30 | 22:00 | 2.5 | 4.5 | Completed Sequence 2 |\n| 10/14/2023 | Assassin's Creed | 20:00 | 22:30 | 2.5 | 7 | Found all the collectibles in Sequence 3 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n1. **Session Hours**: `=END TIME - START TIME` (same as before)\n2. **Total Game Hours**:\n\t* For the first row of each game, enter `=Session Hours` (e.g., `=B2-C2` for the first row).\n\t* For subsequent rows, use the formula: `=IF(A3=A2, D2+E3-D3, E3)` (assuming your data starts from row 2).\n\nHere's how the formula works:\n\n* `A3=A2` checks if the game title in the current row is the same as the previous row. If true, it means we're still playing the same game.\n* `D2+E3-D3` adds the current session hours to the total hours played in the previous row, minus the current session hours (to avoid double-counting).\n* If the game title is different, the formula simply returns the current session hours (`E3`).\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to copy the formula down to the rest of the rows for each game.\n* You can use the `SUMIF` function to calculate the total hours played for each game across multiple rows. For example: `=SUMIF(B:B, \"Assassin's Creed\", E:E)` sums up all the session hours for Assassin's Creed.\n* If you want to display the total hours played for each game at the bottom of the table, you can use a summary row with the `SUMIF` function.\n\nNow you can easily track your progress and see how many hours you've invested in each game!",
