Jewelry: Vintage jewelry such as chunky bracelets, statement earrings, and long pendants can add an authentic touch to your outfit. 2. Hats: A broad-brimmed floppy hat or a small pillbox hat can add a chic touch and give an extra flair to your outfit. 3. Scarfs: A colorful, patterned scarf can be styled around your neck, in your hair, or tied around your waist for an added touch of color and texture. 4. Sunglasses: A pair of oversized, round-frame sunglasses can add a retro touch and protect your eyes from the sun. 5. Handbags: A small clutch, shoulder bag, or handbag with a polished or mod design can complete your look. 6. Shoes: Platform shoes or bold-colored ankle boots were popular in the 1960s and can be paired with most 1960s vintage outfits.
