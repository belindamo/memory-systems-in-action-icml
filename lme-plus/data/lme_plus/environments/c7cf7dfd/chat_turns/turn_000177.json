I hope everything went smoothly and that Thunder is adjusting well to his new surroundings.\n\nIt's great that you're prioritizing his care and making sure he's getting the attention he needs. Regular vet visits are essential for maintaining his health and catching any potential issues early on.\n\nHow's Thunder liking the new stable so far? Is it a big change from his previous home, or are there some similarities that are making the transition easier for him?\n\nAnd how about you? Are you enjoying the new stable and the amenities it has to offer? Sometimes a change of scenery can be beneficial for both horses and their owners!",
