  "content": "The Frye Melissa Tote is a fantastic choice!\n\nThe Frye Melissa Tote is a medium-sized tote that's designed to be functional and stylish. Here are the dimensions:\n\n* Height: 11.5 inches (29 cm)\n* Width: 14.5 inches (37 cm)\n* Depth: 4.5 inches (11 cm)\n* Strap drop: 9 inches (23 cm)\n\nIn terms of capacity, the tote has a spacious interior with a dedicated laptop sleeve that can fit a 13-inch laptop. You can easily fit your laptop, a few files, and some daily essentials like your wallet, phone, and keys. However, it's not a massive tote, so it's not ideal for carrying a ton of bulky items.\n\nHere's a rough idea of what you can fit inside:\n\n* 13-inch laptop\n* 1-2 files or folders\n* Wallet\n* Phone\n* Keys\n* Small makeup bag or pouch\n* Water bottle (depending on size)\n\nThe tote has a structured shape, which means it will hold its form even when it's empty. The interior is also lined with a durable, easy-to-clean material, and there are several pockets and compartments to keep your belongings organized.\n\nOverall, the Frye Melissa Tote is a great choice for daily use, whether you're heading to work, running errands, or meeting with clients. It's stylish, functional, and made from high-quality leather that will last for years to come.\n\nI hope that helps! Do you have any other questions about the tote, or are you ready to make a decision?",
