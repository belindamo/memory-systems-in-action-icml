  "content": "Apologies for the misunderstanding. Here's a revised Costco grocery list to feed two people for a week, considering the larger quantities that Costco offers:\n\n1. Fresh produce:\n\t* 1 bag of mixed greens (use for salads, sandwiches, and wraps throughout the week)\n\t* 1 bunch of bananas (you can freeze any leftovers for smoothies)\n\t* 1 bag of baby carrots (snack on these throughout the week or use in meals)\n\t* 1 bag of frozen mixed vegetables (cook as needed for meals)\n2. Proteins:\n\t* 1 pack of boneless, skinless chicken breasts (freeze half for future use)\n\t* 1 dozen eggs (use for breakfast or in recipes)\n\t* 1 tub of Greek yogurt (use in smoothies, as a snack, or in recipes)\n3. Grains:\n\t* 1 loaf of whole grain bread (freeze half if you won't use it all in a week)\n\t* 1 bag of brown rice or quinoa (store excess in the pantry for future use)\n4. Pantry items:\n\t* 1 jar of marinara sauce (use for pasta dishes, as a dipping sauce, or on sandwiches)\n\t* 1 jar of peanut butter (use for sandwiches or as a snack)\n\t* 1 bag of almonds (snack on these or use in recipes)\n5. Snacks:\n\t* 1 box of whole grain crackers (consume throughout the week as needed)\n6. Beverages:\n\t* 1 case of bottled water (drink throughout the week)\n\t* 1 pack of almond milk or other non-dairy milk (use in smoothies or with cereal)\n7. Breakfast items:\n\t* 1 large container of oatmeal (store excess in the pantry for future use)\n\nSince Costco's quantities are larger, consider meal prepping or freezing any leftovers to avoid food waste. Additionally, you can adjust the list to suit your dietary preferences and needs.",
