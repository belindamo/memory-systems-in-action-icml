  "content": "As a beginner playing as the Operations Expert, here are some strategies and tips to help you get started:\n\n**1. Focus on moving players to hotspots:** Identify cities with high disease cube counts or potential outbreak risks. Move players to these locations to contain outbreaks, treat diseases, or discover cures.\n\n**2. Optimize player movements:** Think about the most efficient way to move players around the board. Try to move multiple players at once, or move players to locations that will allow them to take advantage of their unique abilities.\n\n**3. Coordinate with your team:** Communicate with your teammates about where they need to be moved and when. This will help you make the most of your ability and ensure everyone is working together effectively.\n\n**4. Prioritize moving players with critical abilities:** If a player has a crucial ability, such as the Medic's ability to remove all disease cubes of one color, prioritize moving them to a location where they can use that ability effectively.\n\n**5. Keep an eye on the infection deck:** Pay attention to the infection deck and anticipate where outbreaks might occur. Move players to these locations proactively to contain the disease.\n\n**6. Use your ability to set up for future turns:** Think about how you can use your ability to set up your teammates for success on their next turns. For example, moving a player to a city with a research station can enable them to discover a cure on their next turn.\n\n**7. Don't forget about yourself:** As the Operations Expert, you're not just a taxi service for your teammates. Make sure to use your own actions to contribute to the team's efforts, whether it's treating diseases, discovering cures, or moving yourself to a critical location.\n\n**8. Be mindful of the number of players:** With more players, your ability becomes more valuable, as you can move multiple players at once. However, with fewer players, your ability might be less effective, and you'll need to focus on moving individual players to critical locations.\n\n**9. Adapt to the game's progression:** As the game unfolds, adjust your strategy based on the diseases' spread, the number of outbreaks, and the team's progress. Be prepared to change your focus from containment to cure-finding or vice versa.\n\n**10. Practice makes perfect:** Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right immediately. As you play more games, you'll develop a better sense of when to use your ability, how to coordinate with your team, and how to optimize your movements.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a master Operations Expert and helping your team save the world from deadly diseases!",
