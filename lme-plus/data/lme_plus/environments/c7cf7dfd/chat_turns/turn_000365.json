Energy balls: Blend dates, nuts, and seeds in a food processor, then roll into bite-sized balls for a sweet and healthy snack.\n\n2. Vegan banana bread: Mash bananas and mix with flour, baking powder, and other ingredients for a moist and flavorful banana bread.\n\n3. Chocolate avocado mousse: Blend avocado, cocoa powder, maple syrup, and vanilla extract for a rich and creamy chocolate dessert.\n\n4. Chia pudding: Soak chia seeds in dairy-free milk, vanilla extract, and sweetener like maple syrup. Add to a parfait with fruit and granola for a satisfying breakfast or dessert.\n\n5. Baked apples: Slice apples and sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg, then bake until tender for a warm and comforting dessert.\n\n6. Chocolate chip cookies: Mix flour, sugar, vegan butter, and chocolate chips for a classic cookie recipe that is plant-based.\n\n7. Nice cream: Blend frozen bananas with dairy-free milk for a healthy and dairy-free ice cream substitute that can be flavored with cocoa powder, fruit, or nut butter.\n\nI hope these ideas give you some inspiration for delicious plant-based sweets!",
