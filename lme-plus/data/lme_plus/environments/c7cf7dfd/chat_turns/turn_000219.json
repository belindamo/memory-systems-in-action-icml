  "content": "Kiwi Crate is a great choice! While Kiwi Crate is known for its more complex projects, they do offer some flexibility to accommodate different skill levels and interests. Here are a few ways you can customize your subscription:\n\n1. **Age-based subscriptions**: Kiwi Crate offers different lines of crates tailored to specific age ranges:\n\t* Kiwi Crate (5-10 years old): Their flagship line, which is generally more challenging and focuses on STEAM-based projects.\n\t* Koala Crate (2-4 years old): Designed for younger children, with simpler, more playful projects that introduce basic skills like sorting and matching.\n\t* Doodle Crate (9-16 years old): Geared towards older kids, with more advanced projects that focus on art, design, and creativity.\n2. **Project selection**: When you sign up, you can choose from a range of project themes and categories, such as:\n\t* Art & Design\n\t* Science & Engineering\n\t* Imagination & Play\n\t* Tinker & Create\n\t* Explore & Discover\n\t* Seasonal & Holiday-themed projects\n3. **Project level adjustment**: Kiwi Crate allows you to adjust the project level for your child. When you log in to your account, you can select \"Project Level\" and choose from three options:\n\t* Easy: Simplifies the project, making it more accessible for younger or less experienced children.\n\t* Medium: The standard project level, which is suitable for most children in the recommended age range.\n\t* Challenging: Increases the difficulty level, adding more complexity and depth to the project.\n4. **Skip or pause a project**: If you feel a particular project is too challenging or not engaging for your nieces and nephews, you can skip it or pause the subscription for a month.\n5. **Customer support**: Kiwi Crate's customer support team is available to help you adjust the subscription or provide guidance on project modifications. You can reach out to them via email or phone.\n\nWhile Kiwi Crate doesn't offer complete customization, these options should help you tailor the subscription to your nieces' and nephews' skill levels and interests. If you're still unsure, you could start with a single crate or a shorter subscription period to gauge their engagement and adjust accordingly.",
