  "content": "Let's add a column to track the days played for each game.\n\n**Updated Spreadsheet:**\n\n**Columns:**\n\n1. **Date** (mm/dd/yyyy)\n2. **Game** (title of the game you played)\n3. **Start Time** (HH:MM)\n4. **End Time** (HH:MM)\n5. **Session Hours** (calculated column)\n6. **Total Game Hours** (calculated column)\n7. **Days Played** (new column)\n8. **Streak** (new column)\n9. **Notes** (optional, for any additional comments or observations)\n\n**Example Row:**\n\n| Date | Game | Start Time | End Time | Session Hours | Total Game Hours | Days Played | Streak | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10/12/2023 | Assassin's Creed | 19:00 | 21:00 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | Started the game! |\n| 10/13/2023 | Assassin's Creed | 19:30 | 22:00 | 2.5 | 4.5 | 2 | 2 | Completed Sequence 2 |\n| 10/14/2023 | Assassin's Creed | 20:00 | 22:30 | 2.5 | 7 | 3 | 3 | Found all the collectibles in Sequence 3 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n1. **Days Played**:\n\t* For the first row of each game, enter `1`.\n\t* For subsequent rows, use the formula: `=IF(A3=A2, IF(B3-B2=1, D2+1, 1), 1)` (assuming your data starts from row 2).\n\t* This formula checks if the current row is for the same game and if the date difference is 1 day. If true, it increments the days played by 1. Otherwise, it resets to 1.\n2. **Streak**:\n\t* Use the formula: `=IF(C2=C3, D2+1, 1)` (assuming your data starts from row 2).\n\t* This formula checks if the current row is for the same game and increments the streak by 1 if true. Otherwise, it resets to 1.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can use the `MAX` function to display the longest streak for each game. For example: `=MAX(IF(B:B=\"Assassin's Creed\", I:I, 0))` displays the longest streak for Assassin's Creed.\n* To highlight the current streak, you can use conditional formatting. For example, select the entire **Streak** column, go to Conditional Formatting > New Rule, and enter the formula `=I2=MAX(IF(B:B=B2, I:I, 0))`. Format the cell to highlight the current streak.\n* You can also use the **Days Played** column to calculate the average playtime per day for each game. For example: `=E2/F2` divides the total game hours by the days played.\n\nNow you can track your daily progress and see how many days you've been playing each game in a row!",
