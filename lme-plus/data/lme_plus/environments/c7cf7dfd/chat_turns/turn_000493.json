With a few weeks to go before they expire, you've got some flexibility to plan your shopping trip.\n\nSince you'll be going to your local supermarket, I'll assume they accept manufacturer coupons like the ones you have. Here's a quick plan to help you make the most of your remaining coupons:\n\n1. **Tide coupons:** You have 2 coupons for $1 off Tide each. Try to find a sale or promotion on Tide at your supermarket that will stack with your coupons. Look for a price around $2-$3 per unit, so you can get a good deal. If you can find a sale, you might be able to get Tide for around $1-$2 per unit after the coupon.\n2. **Bounty coupon:** You have 1 coupon for 50 cents off Bounty. Again, look for a sale or promotion on Bounty at your supermarket. If you can find a price around $1-$2 per unit, you can get a decent deal with the 50-cent coupon.\n\nTo maximize your savings, consider the following tips:\n\n* Check the supermarket's weekly ad or website to see if they have any sales or promotions on Tide or Bounty.\n* Look for bundle deals or bulk packs that might be cheaper per unit than individual items.\n* If you have a loyalty program or digital coupons through your supermarket's app, check if they have any additional discounts or offers that can stack with your manufacturer coupons.\n* Try to buy the items in quantities that will use up your coupons, so you don't let them expire.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to get a good deal on Tide and Bounty using your remaining coupons. Happy shopping!",
