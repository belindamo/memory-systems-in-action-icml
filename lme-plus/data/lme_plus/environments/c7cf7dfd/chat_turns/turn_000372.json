Before I can provide recommendations, could you please tell me a bit more about your personal style and preferences?\n\nHere are some questions to consider:\n\n1. What's your work style? (e.g. corporate, creative, business casual)\n2. What's the dominant color palette of your new work clothes? (e.g. neutrals, brights, pastels)\n3. Do you have a preferred material in mind for the handbag (e.g. leather, suede, fabric)?\n4. What's your budget range with the gift card? (Nordstrom has a wide range of prices, so it's good to narrow it down)\n5. Do you prefer a specific shape or size of handbag (e.g. tote, shoulder bag, crossbody, small, medium, large)?\n6. Are there any particular brands you're interested in or have considered?\n7. Do you want a bag that's more functional (e.g. lots of pockets, laptop sleeve) or stylish (e.g. fashion-forward design, statement piece)?\n\nAnswering these questions will help me provide you with more tailored recommendations for a handbag that fits your needs and style.\n\nHappy shopping!",
