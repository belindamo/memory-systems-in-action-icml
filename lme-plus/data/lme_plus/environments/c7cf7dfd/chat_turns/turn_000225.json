Here are some exercises and resources to help you get started:\n\n**Pronunciation Exercises:**\n\n1. **Listen to native speakers**: Listen to French speakers, either in person, online, or through TV shows/movies. Pay attention to the sounds, intonation, and rhythm of their speech.\n2. **Record yourself**: Record yourself speaking French and compare it to a native speaker.

Listen to recordings of Parisian speakers to get a sense of their accent and intonation.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n1. **Forvo**: A great online resource for pronunciation practice. Listen to native speakers and record yourself to compare.\n2. **Duolingo**: A popular language learning app that includes French lessons with pronunciation exercises.\n3. **French podcasts**: Listen to French podcasts, such as \"Coffee Break French\" or \"French Pod 101,\" to get used to the sound and rhythm of the language.\n4. **YouTube channels**: Channels like \"French with Lucy\" and \"French for Beginners\" offer pronunciation lessons and exercises.\n5. **Accent coaching videos**: Search for videos on YouTube or Vimeo that focus on French accent coaching for actors.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Immerse yourself in the language**: Watch French movies, listen to French music, and try to speak with native speakers as much as possible.\n2. **Practice regularly**: Set aside time each day to practice your French accent and pronunciation.\n3. **Focus on the story**: Remember that your accent is just one aspect of your performance.
