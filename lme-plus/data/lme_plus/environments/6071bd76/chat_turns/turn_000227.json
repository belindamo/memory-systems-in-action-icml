Here are some tips on how to store your leftover chicken parmesan and salad:\n\n**Chicken Parmesan:**\n\n1. **Cooling:** Let the chicken parmesan cool completely to room temperature before refrigerating or freezing. This helps prevent bacterial growth and keeps the chicken moist.\n2. **Refrigeration:** Store the cooled chicken parmesan in airtight, shallow containers (like glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids) in the refrigerator. Use within 3 to 4 days.\n3. **Freezing:** Wrap the cooled chicken parmesan tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then place it in a freezer-safe bag or container. Frozen chicken parmesan can be stored for up to 3 months. When reheating, bake in the oven at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until crispy and hot.\n\n**Italian Garden Salad:**\n\n1. **Refrigeration:** Store the salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator, making sure to press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the salad to prevent moisture from accumulating.
