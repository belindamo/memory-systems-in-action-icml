Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Baseball cube display**: A baseball cube display is a popular way to showcase a single baseball. These cubes are usually made of glass or acrylic and have a small pedestal or base to hold the baseball in place. They're easy to find online or at sports memorabilia stores.\n2. **Shadow box with a baseball holder**: You can also use a shadow box with a built-in baseball holder. These holders usually have a small indentation or a clip to secure the baseball in place, allowing you to add other items like photos, cards, or jerseys around it.\n3. **Baseball display case**: If you have multiple baseballs, consider a baseball display case that can hold 3-6 balls. These cases often have individual compartments to keep each baseball separate and protected.\n4. **Acrylic baseball display stand**: A stand-alone acrylic display stand can hold a single baseball and add a touch of elegance to your display. These stands usually have a small base and a curved or angled design to cradle the baseball.\n5. **Wall-mounted baseball display**: If you want to save space, consider a wall-mounted baseball display. These displays usually have a small plate or holder that attaches to the wall, and the baseball is secured in place with a small clip or magnet.\n\nTips for displaying baseballs:\n\n* **Use a UV-protected display**: Just like with jerseys, it's essential to protect your signed baseball from UV light, which can cause fading or discoloration over time.\n* **Keep it clean**: Dust and dirt can accumulate on the baseball, so make sure to clean it gently with a soft cloth and mild soap solution.\n* **Avoid touching the baseball**: Oils from your skin can damage the autograph or the baseball itself, so try to handle it by the edges or use gloves when cleaning or moving it.\n* **Consider a riser or pedestal**: Adding a small riser or pedestal under the baseball display can elevate it and create a more dynamic visual effect.\n* **Group with other memorabilia**: Don't be afraid to group your Mike Trout baseball with other Angels or baseball-related memorabilia, such as photos, cards, or game-used items.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to showcase your signed Mike Trout baseball proudly and enjoy it for years to come!",
