It's possible that you may have attended a different event or workshop, or maybe it was a fictional event?\n\nAdditionally, I'm a large language model, I'm not aware of any \"local track\" that you might be referring to, as I don't have information about your location. However, I'm happy to provide general tips on suspension tuning and drifting techniques if you're interested!\n\nSuspension tuning is a complex topic, and it's great that you're interested in learning more about it. Here are some general tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Understand your vehicle's suspension system**: Before making any adjustments, it's essential to understand how your car's suspension system works, including the type of suspension, spring rates, and damping characteristics.\n2. **Identify your goals**: Determine what you want to achieve with your suspension tuning. Are you looking to improve handling, reduce body roll, or enhance ride comfort?\n3. **Start with baseline settings**: Begin with the manufacturer's recommended settings and gradually make adjustments based on your testing and feedback.\n4. **Use data logging and analysis**: Invest in a data logger or use a smartphone app to collect data on your car's acceleration, braking, and cornering performance. Analyze the data to identify areas for improvement.\n5. **Make incremental changes**: Don't make drastic changes to your suspension settings at once. Make small adjustments and test them thoroughly before making further changes.\n6. **Test and iterate**: Suspension tuning is an iterative process. Test your car, gather feedback, and make adjustments based on your findings.\n\nAs for drifting techniques, here are some general tips:\n\n1. **Master the basics**: Ensure you have a good understanding of basic car control, including braking, acceleration, and steering.\n2. **Choose the right car**: Drifting requires a rear-wheel drive car with a suitable power-to-weight ratio and suspension setup.\n3. **Start slow**: Begin with slow, low-speed drifts and gradually increase your speed and angle as you gain confidence and skill.\n4. **Focus on weight transfer**: Drifting is all about weight transfer. Practice shifting your weight from one axle to the other to initiate and maintain a drift.\n5. **Practice, practice, practice**: Drifting takes time and practice to master. Be patient, and don't be afraid to make mistakes \u2013 they're an essential part of the learning process.\n\nI hope these tips are helpful!
