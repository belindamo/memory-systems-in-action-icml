  "content": "French press is a great brewing method for bringing out the rich, bold flavors of your new coffee beans.\n\nRegarding storing coffee beans, I'm happy to share some tips to help preserve their freshness:\n\n1. **Airtight container**: Store your coffee beans in an airtight container, such as a glass or ceramic container with a tight-fitting lid. This will prevent air, light, and moisture from affecting the beans.\n2. **Cool, dark place**: Keep the container in a cool, dark place, like a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing coffee beans near a heat source, oven, or direct sunlight.\n3. **Room temperature**: Store coffee beans at room temperature (around 60-70\u00b0F/15-21\u00b0C). Avoid storing them in the refrigerator or freezer, as the moisture and temperature fluctuations can affect the beans.\n4. **Use within 2 weeks**: Try to use your coffee beans within 2 weeks of opening the bag or container. This ensures the beans are at their peak flavor and aroma.\n5. **Freeze for longer storage**: If you won't be using the beans within 2 weeks, consider freezing them. Place the beans in an airtight container or freezer bag, making sure to remove as much air as possible before sealing. Frozen coffee beans can be stored for up to 3-6 months.\n6. **Grind just before brewing**: Grind your coffee beans just before brewing to ensure the freshest flavor. Pre-ground coffee can sit on a shelf for weeks or months, losing its flavor and aroma.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to preserve the freshness and flavor of your coffee beans and enjoy a delicious cup every time!\n\nHave fun experimenting with your new beans and citrus notes in your French press!",
