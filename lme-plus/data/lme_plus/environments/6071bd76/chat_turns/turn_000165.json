However, it is widely believed that a combination of various approaches adopted by different political leaders played an essential role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland. Thatcher's hardline stance helped to quell the IRA's campaign of violence and restore law and order. Adams' leadership of Sinn Fein helped to bring the IRA to the negotiating table and secure a ceasefire. Blair's diplomacy and persuasive skills helped to broker the Good Friday Agreement. Paisley's eventual willingness to share power with Sinn Fein helped to cement peace and stability in Northern Ireland. Cameron's continued commitment to the peace process and focus on economic development was also important. Effective leadership, combined with sustained engagement from all sides, paved the way for a peaceful and prosperous future for Northern Ireland.",
