Some questions you might consider asking:\n\n* What's the tone of these podcasts? Are they more horror-focused or do they have a mix of genres?\n* How do the hosts or narrators contribute to the atmosphere and storytelling?\n* Are there any specific themes or topics that these podcasts explore?\n* How do the podcasts handle pacing and tension? Are they fast-paced or more slow-burning?\n\nIf you'd like more recommendations, I can suggest other podcasts that might appeal to you based on your interests.
