  "content": "Each country in Asia with significant Buddhist art and architecture has something unique and exceptional to offer. However, if you are looking for a place to start, I would suggest visiting India, as it is considered the birthplace of Buddhism and has numerous important Buddhist sites, including the Buddhist circuit that covers Bodhgaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar, all associated with the life of the Buddha. India has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, and your visit to such sites will offer you a fascinating insight into the art and architecture of Buddhism.",
