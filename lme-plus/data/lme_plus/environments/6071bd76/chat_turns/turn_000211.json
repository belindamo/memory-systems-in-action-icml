Here are some tips to help you store your tea leaves fresh:\n\n1. **Airtight containers**: Store tea leaves in airtight containers, such as glass jars or ceramic canisters, to prevent air from entering and spoiling the tea.\n2. **Dark containers**: Use containers that block out light, as light can cause tea to lose its flavor and aroma. Dark glass or ceramic containers are ideal.\n3. **Cool, dry place**: Store tea leaves in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and moisture. Avoid storing tea near a stove, oven, or radiator.\n4. **Avoid humid environments**: Keep tea away from humid environments, such as basements or attics, as moisture can cause tea to become stale or develop mold.\n5. **Don't store tea near strong-smelling foods**: Tea can absorb odors from nearby foods, so store it away from pungent ingredients like onions, garlic, and spices.\n6. **Keep tea away from heat sources**: Heat can cause tea to lose its flavor and aroma, so avoid storing it near heaters, ovens, or microwaves.\n7. **Use a tea tin or canister with a tight-fitting lid**: If you're using a tea tin or canister, make sure it has a tight-fitting lid to prevent air from entering.\n8. **Store tea in small quantities**: Divide your tea into smaller quantities (e.g., 1-2 ounces) and store them in separate containers to prevent exposure to air and light.\n9. **Use a tea storage box or chest**: Consider investing in a tea storage box or chest with individual compartments to store different teas and keep them organized.\n10. **Check on your tea regularly**: Regularly inspect your stored tea for signs of staleness, mold, or pest infestation. If you notice any issues, it's time to refresh your tea supply.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can enjoy your tea at its best and maintain its flavor, aroma, and quality.",
