While they're great for casual wear, you're right that you may need something more formal for the office.\n\nFinding comfortable dress shoes can be a challenge, especially if you have sensitive heels. Here are some tips and recommendations to help you find a pair that fits your needs:\n\n**Look for shoes with:**\n\n1. **Soft, cushioned insoles**: A soft, breathable insole can make a big difference in comfort. Look for shoes with removable insoles, which can be replaced with custom orthotics or arch supports if needed.\n2. **Padded collars and tongues**: A padded collar and tongue can reduce pressure on your heels and ankles.\n3. **Wide toe boxes**: A spacious toe box can help reduce pressure on your toes and prevent blisters.\n4. **Low to moderate heels**: Avoid high heels, which can put pressure on your heels and Achilles tendon. Opt for shoes with a low to moderate heel (less than 1.5 inches).\n5. **Soft, flexible materials**: Leather or suede uppers can be more comfortable than stiff, synthetic materials.\n\n**Recommended dress shoes for sensitive heels:**\n\n1. **Clarks**: Clarks is a great brand for comfortable dress shoes.
