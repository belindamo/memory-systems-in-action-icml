Completing the Pok\u00e9dex is a challenging but rewarding task, and it's great that you're aiming to catch 'em all!\n\nReaching the third gym is a good milestone, and I'm sure you're enjoying the journey so far. The Wild Area is such a great addition to the series, and it's amazing to see how the Pok\u00e9mon roam freely in the wild.\n\nWhich starter Pok\u00e9mon did you choose? Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble? And have you found any rare or shiny Pok\u00e9mon yet?\n\nCompleting the Pok\u00e9dex is a long-term goal, but it's so much fun to explore the Galar region, battle gym leaders, and catch new Pok\u00e9mon. You'll have to be strategic about which Pok\u00e9mon to catch, trade, and breed to complete your collection.\n\nIf you need any tips or advice on completing the Pok\u00e9dex or tackling the gyms, feel free to ask! What's your favorite Pok\u00e9mon so far, and which ones are you looking forward to catching next?\n\nAlso, have you considered playing Pok\u00e9mon Shield as well, or are you focusing on Sword for now?",
