  "content": "Citrus notes are a great addition to coffee! You've got a good starting point with your French press ratio, now let's explore some coffee beans that would complement citrus flavors nicely.\n\nWhen it comes to pairing coffee with citrus, you'll want beans that have bright, vibrant acidity and flavor profiles that won't overpower the citrus notes. Here are some coffee bean options that might fit the bill:\n\n1. **Kenyan coffee**: Kenyan beans are known for their bright acidity and complex flavor profiles, which often feature citrus notes like lemon, orange, and grapefruit. Look for beans from regions like Nyeri, Kiambu, or Muranga.\n2. **Ethiopian Yirgacheffe**: Ethiopian coffees are renowned for their floral and citrus flavors. Yirgacheffe beans, in particular, offer a delicate, tea-like body with notes of lemon, bergamot, and citrus blossoms.\n3. **Colombian Gesha**: Gesha beans from Colombia often exhibit a citrusy flavor profile, with notes of orange, lemon, and lime. They tend to have a medium to high acidity, which will cut through the richness of the citrus.\n4. **Guatemalan Antigua**: Guatemalan Antigua beans can have a balanced acidity and flavor profiles that feature citrus notes like orange, lemon, and citrus peel. Look for beans from farms in the Antigua region.\n5. **Rwanda Bourbon**: Rwandan Bourbon beans are known for their bright acidity and flavors of citrus, berries, and stone fruits. They can add a nice balance to citrus notes in your coffee recipe.\n\nWhen experimenting with citrus-infused coffee, consider the type of citrus fruit you're using and how you're incorporating it. Are you adding juice, zest, or slices to your coffee? This will help you determine the best coffee bean to pair with it.\n\nFor your French press, you might want to adjust the grind size and steeping time to bring out the optimal flavor from your chosen coffee beans. A medium-coarse grind and a 3-4 minute steeping time could be a good starting point.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different roasts, too. A lighter roast might accentuate the citrus notes, while a darker roast could add a richer, more balanced flavor.\n\nHave fun exploring these options, and I hope you find the perfect coffee-citrus combination!",
