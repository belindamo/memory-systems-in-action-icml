  "content": "Great choices! **Hana Yori Dango** and **Death Note** are both iconic Japanese dramas that have gained international recognition.\n\nRegarding **Death Note**, it's a thought-provoking and suspenseful series, but it's not excessively gory or violent. The focus is more on the psychological battle between the protagonist, Light Yagami, and the detective, L, rather than on gratuitous violence. The themes of morality, justice, and the consequences of power are explored in a way that's more cerebral than graphic.\n\nThat being said, if you're not typically a fan of thrillers, you might find some scenes or plot twists unsettling or intense. However, the show is well-paced, and the suspense is more mental than visceral. If you're willing to step out of your comfort zone, you might find **Death Note** to be a thought-provoking and engaging watch.\n\nIt's great to hear that you had a deep conversation with your cousin about your personal struggles. Sometimes, sharing our struggles with someone who understands can be incredibly cathartic. It's wonderful that you're maintaining a strong connection with your cousin despite the physical distance.\n\nIf you do decide to watch **Death Note**, I'd love to hear your thoughts on it! And if you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask.",
