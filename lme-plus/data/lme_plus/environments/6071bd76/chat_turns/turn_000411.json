It's possible that you might be referring to a local or national drifting competition, or maybe it's a fictional event?\n\nHowever, I'm happy to help you with your drifting skills, including throttle control and transitions! \n\nImproving throttle control and transitions are crucial skills to master in drifting. Here are some tips to help you:\n\n**Throttle Control:**\n\n1. **Sensitivity**: Practice modulating your throttle input to control the amount of power sent to the wheels. Focus on smooth, gradual inputs rather than abrupt ones.\n2. **Feathering**: Learn to \"feather\" the throttle, gradually increasing or decreasing power to maintain speed and control.\n3. **Throttle-on oversteer**: Practice inducing oversteer by applying gentle throttle input while turning. This will help you develop the feeling for when the rear wheels start to lose traction.\n4. **Throttle-off oversteer**: Practice suddenly lifting off the throttle while turning to induce oversteer. This will help you develop the feeling for when the rear wheels regain traction.\n\n**Transitions:**\n\n1. **Smooth inputs**: Focus on making smooth, gradual transitions between acceleration, braking, and steering. Avoid abrupt inputs, which can upset the car's balance.\n2. **Look where you want to go**: Keep your eyes focused on the direction you want the car to go, and make subtle steering corrections to maintain your desired path.\n3. **Weight transfer**: Practice shifting weight from one axle to the other by braking, accelerating, or steering. This will help you develop a better feel for the car's dynamics.\n4. **Practice different transitions**: Practice transitioning from acceleration to braking, braking to acceleration, and from one turn to another. Focus on smooth, seamless transitions.\n\n**General Drifting Tips:**\n\n1. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with your car's dynamics and the better you'll develop your skills.\n2. **Focus on car control**: Drifting is all about car control. Focus on controlling your speed, angle, and trajectory rather than just trying to drift.\n3. **Start slow**: Begin with slow, low-speed drifts and gradually increase your speed and angle as you gain confidence and skill.\n4. **Analyze your runs**: Review your runs, either by video or with a data logger, to identify areas for improvement.\n\nRemember, drifting takes time and practice to master. Be patient, stay focused, and don't be afraid to make mistakes \u2013 they're an essential part of the learning process.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or would like more information on drifting techniques, feel free to ask!",
