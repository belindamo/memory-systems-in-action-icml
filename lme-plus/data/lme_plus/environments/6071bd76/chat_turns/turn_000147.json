  "content": "In TV Time, \"Skipped\" and \"Paused\" serve distinct purposes, helping you manage your episode tracking effectively.\n\n**Skipped:**\n\nMark an episode as \"Skipped\" when:\n\n1. You've decided not to watch a particular episode.\n2. You're not interested in a specific episode or story arc.\n3. You've missed an episode and don't plan to catch up.\n\nWhen you mark an episode as \"Skipped,\" TV Time will:\n\n* Remove the episode from your \"Next Episode\" queue.\n* Not prompt you to watch it again.\n* Allow you to move on to the next episode in the series.\n\n**Paused:**\n\nMark an episode as \"Paused\" when:\n\n1. You've started watching an episode but haven't finished it.\n2. You need to take a break from a show for a while.\n3. You're waiting for a friend or family member to catch up before continuing.\n\nWhen you mark an episode as \"Paused,\" TV Time will:\n\n* Keep the episode in your \"Next Episode\" queue.\n* Display a \"Paused\" indicator, reminding you where you left off.\n* Allow you to easily resume watching from where you paused.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* \"Skipped\" means you're intentionally bypassing an episode.\n* \"Paused\" means you're temporarily halting your progress, intending to return to the episode later.\n\nBy using these features correctly, you'll be able to manage your episode tracking efficiently and maintain a clean, organized watchlist.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using TV Time or tracking your shows?",
