  "content": "I think Light Yagami is a complex character and can be seen as both a villain and an anti-hero. His intentions might have started as good, but his methods and actions became more and more extreme as the series progressed. It's interesting to think about how his character raises questions about justice and morality. By the way, I've been meaning to ask, do you think social media has an impact on our perception of justice and morality? I've been noticing lately how social media can shape our opinions and influence our worldview.",
