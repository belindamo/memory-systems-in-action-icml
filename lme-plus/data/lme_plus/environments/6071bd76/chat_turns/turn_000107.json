Here are some tips to help you pick a wonderful gift:\n\n1. **Consider the couple's style and interests**: Think about the couple's tastes, hobbies, and preferences. Do they love to cook, travel, or entertain? This can give you ideas for a gift that's personalized and meaningful.\n2. **Check the registry**: Many couples create a wedding registry to make gift-giving easier. Look for the registry information on the wedding invitation or the couple's website. This will give you an idea of what they need and want.\n3. **Think practicality vs. sentimentality**: While a sentimental gift can be lovely, practical gifts like kitchen appliances, linens, or cookware are often appreciated and used frequently.\n4. **Set a budget**: Decide how much you're comfortable spending on a gift. The traditional rule of thumb is to spend $100 to $200 per person, but this can vary depending on your relationship with the couple and your financial situation.\n5. **Consider experiences over material gifts**: Give the gift of a shared experience, like a wine tasting, cooking class, or weekend getaway. This can create lifelong memories for the couple.\n6. **Personalize it**: A monogrammed or customized gift, such as engraved picture frames, cutting boards, or champagne flutes, shows you put thought into the gift.\n7. **Cash or gift cards are always appreciated**: Let's face it, many couples need help with their honeymoon, new home, or other expenses. A cash gift or gift card to their favorite store can be a thoughtful and practical choice.\n8. **Group gifts**: If you're part of a group of friends or family members, consider pooling your resources to give a more substantial gift.\n9. **Timing is everything**: Try to send your gift within a few weeks of the wedding, or even before the wedding day if you're attending a destination wedding.\n10. **Include a thoughtful note**: A heartfelt, handwritten note expressing your congratulations and well-wishes can make the gift even more special.\n\nSome popular wedding gift ideas include:\n\n* Kitchen appliances or cookware\n* Fine china, crystal, or linens\n* Personalized items, such as monogrammed towels or picture frames\n* Experiences, like a wine tasting or weekend getaway\n* Honeymoon fund contributions\n* Cash or gift cards\n* Subscription services, like a wine club or meal delivery\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that comes from the heart and shows your love and support for the happy couple.",
