It's even more impressive that you've been continuing to cook regularly since then. Keep up the good work!\n\nTteok is a fantastic choice to end your meal, and I'm sure your guests will appreciate the traditional Korean touch. It's a simple yet elegant dessert that pairs well with the savory flavors of Japchae and Bulgogi.\n\nIf you have any questions or need any clarification on the Tteok recipe, feel free to ask. I'm here to help. Otherwise, I hope you have fun making it and that it turns out delicious!\n\nBy the way, what inspired you to take cooking classes in the first place? Was there a particular cuisine or dish that sparked your interest in cooking?",
