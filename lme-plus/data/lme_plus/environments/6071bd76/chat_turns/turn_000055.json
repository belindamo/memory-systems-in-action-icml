It's wonderful that you're involved in babysitting duties and getting to spend quality time with your little nephew.\n\nCreating a thoughtful gift basket with essential and useful items will surely be appreciated by your sister. Since Liam is just three weeks old, I've compiled a list of popular baby products that are suitable for his age:\n\n1. Diapering Essentials:\n\t* Diapers (size 1 or 2, depending on his weight)\n\t* Diaper cream or ointment\n\t* Diaper wipes\n2. Skincare and Bath Time:\n\t* Gentle baby wash or body wash\n\t* Baby oil or lotion\n\t* Baby towels (soft and absorbent)\n\t* Baby washcloths\n3. Feeding and Burping:\n\t* Bottles and nipples (if not breastfeeding exclusively)\n\t* Pacifiers (if needed)\n\t* Burp cloths (soft and absorbent)\n\t* Bibs (for drooling and feeding)\n4. Comfort and Soothing:\n\t* Soft toys or stuffed animals (machine washable)\n\t* Baby blankets or swaddles\n\t* White noise machine or a mobile with soothing sounds\n\t* Baby books or board books with simple, high-contrast images\n5. Practical Items:\n\t* Baby carriers or slings (for hands-free parenting)\n\t* Baby monitor or baby movement tracker\n\t* Nursing pads (if breastfeeding)\n\t* Breast pump (if breastfeeding and expressing milk)\n\nRemember to consider your sister's personal preferences and the baby's specific needs when selecting items for the gift basket. You can also include some comforting treats for your sister, like chocolates, tea, or a cozy throw blanket.\n\nLastly, since Liam is still very little, it's essential to ensure that any items you choose are safe and suitable for newborns. Always check the product reviews, labels, and manufacturer's instructions before adding them to the gift basket.\n\nI hope this helps you create a thoughtful and practical gift basket for your sister and baby Liam!",
