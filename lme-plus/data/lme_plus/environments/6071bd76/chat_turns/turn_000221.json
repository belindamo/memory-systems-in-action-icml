Here are some tips to help you prepare this dish ahead of time:\n\n**Breading Station Prep**:\n\n* Prepare the breading station components (flour, eggs, breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, etc.) the day before or a few hours before you plan to bread the chicken. This will save you time when you're ready to assemble the dish.\n\n**Chicken Prep**:\n\n* Prepare the chicken breasts by pounding them to an even thickness and seasoning them with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings a day or two in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\n* If you want to take it a step further, you can bread the chicken breasts up to a day in advance, but make sure to store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator to prevent the breadcrumbs from getting soggy.\n\n**Sauce and Cheese Prep**:\n\n* Make the marinara sauce and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 3 months. Reheat it when you're ready to assemble the dish.\n* Grate the mozzarella cheese and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\n\n**Assembly and Baking**:\n\n* Assemble the chicken parmesan by breading the chicken, placing it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and topping it with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese.\n* You can prepare the assembled chicken parmesan up to a few hours in advance, but make sure to keep it refrigerated until you're ready to bake it.\n* Bake the chicken parmesan just before serving to ensure it's hot and melted.\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n\n* Make sure to label and date all the components you prepare in advance, so you know what you have and how long it's been stored.\n* Consider setting up a \"assembly line\" with all the components ready to go, making it easier to assemble the dish quickly and efficiently.\n* Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it, and have fun!\n\nI hope these tips help you prepare your mom's famous chicken parmesan with ease. Enjoy your dinner party, and I'm sure your guests will love the dish!",
