  "content": "As the Arabian Peninsula evolved, the importance of poetry and storytelling remained significant but their roles and functions have gone through several changes. One of the most notable changes may have occurred during the Islamic Golden Age, which was a period of cultural, scientific, and artistic flourishing that began in the 8th century CE. During this period, poetry and storytelling still played an important role in preserving cultural traditions, but also began to reflect Islamic values, beliefs, and ideals.\n\nThe Arab poets of this age sought to use their craft not only to entertain their listeners but also to educate them about Islam's teachings. This led to the emergence of a genre of religious poetry known as na'at, which praised the Prophet Muhammad and celebrated Islamic religious practices. Similarly, Islamic thinkers like Al-Ma'arri and Al-Farabi used storytelling to convey moral and ethical lessons through their literary works.\n\nAnother significant change occurred in the 20th century, as the Arabian Peninsula underwent a process of modernization and cultural transformation. With the spread of education and technology, the oral tradition of storytelling began to give way to written literature and mass media. Nonetheless, even as the oral tradition faded, poetry remained an important part of Arab culture and was often used to express revolutionary ideas, as well as to celebrate national and regional pride.\n\nIn conclusion, while the role of poetry and storytelling in preserving cultural heritage and identity has remained constant over time, their functions have undergone changes to reflect the changing dynamics of society and culture on the Arabian Peninsula.",
