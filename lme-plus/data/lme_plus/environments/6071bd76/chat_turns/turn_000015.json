  "content": "Kenyan coffee is an excellent choice.\n\nFor tea pairing with citrus flavors, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Earl Grey**: A classic choice, Earl Grey tea is flavored with bergamot oil, which is a natural citrus flavor. The bergamot will complement and enhance the citrus notes in your coffee, creating a lovely harmony.\n2. **Green Tea with Lemon Myrtle**: A light and refreshing green tea paired with the citrusy flavor of lemon myrtle can create a beautiful balance. Lemon myrtle is a native Australian herb that adds a sweet, citrusy flavor without being overpowering.\n3. **White Peony**: This Chinese white tea is known for its delicate, floral flavor profile, which can help to balance out the brightness of citrus. Its subtle sweetness will also complement the acidity in the coffee.\n4. **Genmaicha**: This Japanese green tea blend combines the freshness of green tea with the nutty flavor of roasted brown rice. The subtle citrus notes in the green tea will pair nicely with the citrus flavors in your coffee.\n5. **Lady Grey**: Similar to Earl Grey, Lady Grey tea is flavored with citrus fruits like orange, lemon, and bergamot. However, Lady Grey tends to have a more delicate flavor profile, making it a great option if you prefer a lighter citrus note.\n\nWhen pairing tea with citrus-infused coffee, consider the type of citrus fruit you're using and the strength of the flavor. For example, if you're using a strong citrus like lemon or orange, a more delicate tea like White Peony or Genmaicha might be a better fit. If you're using a more subtle citrus like grapefruit or lime, a stronger tea like Earl Grey or Lady Grey could work well.\n\nRemember, tea and coffee pairing is all about experimentation and personal preference. Feel free to try different combinations to find your perfect match!",
