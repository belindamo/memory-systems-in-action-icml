Indian cuisine is so diverse and varied, with different regions and cultures having their own unique styles and flavors. Have you tried making any Indian flatbreads, like naan or roti?\n\nMaking pasta from scratch is a great skill to have, and it's wonderful that you've noticed the difference it makes in flavor and texture. Fresh pasta is a game-changer, and it's amazing how much more flavorful and tender it is compared to store-bought pasta. Have you experimented with different pasta shapes and flavors, like adding herbs or spices to the dough?\n\nMushrooms are a fantastic ingredient, and shiitake and oyster mushrooms are both excellent choices for adding depth and umami flavor to dishes. They pair really well with a variety of ingredients, from meat and vegetables to grains and legumes. Have you tried using them in any specific dishes or recipes that you'd recommend?\n\nBy the way, have you considered combining your love of Indian cuisine and pasta-making to create some Indian-inspired pasta dishes? That could be a really interesting and delicious fusion of flavors and techniques!",
