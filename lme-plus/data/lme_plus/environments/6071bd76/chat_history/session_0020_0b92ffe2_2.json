Here are some tips to help you prepare this dish ahead of time:\n\n**Breading Station Prep**:\n\n* Prepare the breading station components (flour, eggs, breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, etc.) the day before or a few hours before you plan to bread the chicken. This will save you time when you're ready to assemble the dish.\n\n**Chicken Prep**:\n\n* Prepare the chicken breasts by pounding them to an even thickness and seasoning them with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings a day or two in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\n* If you want to take it a step further, you can bread the chicken breasts up to a day in advance, but make sure to store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator to prevent the breadcrumbs from getting soggy.\n\n**Sauce and Cheese Prep**:\n\n* Make the marinara sauce and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 3 months. Reheat it when you're ready to assemble the dish.\n* Grate the mozzarella cheese and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\n\n**Assembly and Baking**:\n\n* Assemble the chicken parmesan by breading the chicken, placing it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and topping it with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese.\n* You can prepare the assembled chicken parmesan up to a few hours in advance, but make sure to keep it refrigerated until you're ready to bake it.\n* Bake the chicken parmesan just before serving to ensure it's hot and melted.\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n\n* Make sure to label and date all the components you prepare in advance, so you know what you have and how long it's been stored.\n* Consider setting up a \"assembly line\" with all the components ready to go, making it easier to assemble the dish quickly and efficiently.\n* Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it, and have fun!\n\nI hope these tips help you prepare your mom's famous chicken parmesan with ease.
