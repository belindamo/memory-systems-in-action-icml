By the way, I've been experimenting with my French press and I've found that 1 tablespoon of coffee for every 6 ounces of water is the perfect ratio for me.",

      "content": "Citrus notes are a great addition to coffee! You've got a good starting point with your French press ratio, now let's explore some coffee beans that would complement citrus flavors nicely.\n\nWhen it comes to pairing coffee with citrus, you'll want beans that have bright, vibrant acidity and flavor profiles that won't overpower the citrus notes. Here are some coffee bean options that might fit the bill:\n\n1. **Kenyan coffee**: Kenyan beans are known for their bright acidity and complex flavor profiles, which often feature citrus notes like lemon, orange, and grapefruit. Look for beans from regions like Nyeri, Kiambu, or Muranga.\n2. **Ethiopian Yirgacheffe**: Ethiopian coffees are renowned for their floral and citrus flavors. Yirgacheffe beans, in particular, offer a delicate, tea-like body with notes of lemon, bergamot, and citrus blossoms.\n3. **Colombian Gesha**: Gesha beans from Colombia often exhibit a citrusy flavor profile, with notes of orange, lemon, and lime. They tend to have a medium to high acidity, which will cut through the richness of the citrus.\n4. **Guatemalan Antigua**: Guatemalan Antigua beans can have a balanced acidity and flavor profiles that feature citrus notes like orange, lemon, and citrus peel. Look for beans from farms in the Antigua region.\n5. **Rwanda Bourbon**: Rwandan Bourbon beans are known for their bright acidity and flavors of citrus, berries, and stone fruits. They can add a nice balance to citrus notes in your coffee recipe.\n\nWhen experimenting with citrus-infused coffee, consider the type of citrus fruit you're using and how you're incorporating it. Are you adding juice, zest, or slices to your coffee? This will help you determine the best coffee bean to pair with it.\n\nFor your French press, you might want to adjust the grind size and steeping time to bring out the optimal flavor from your chosen coffee beans. A medium-coarse grind and a 3-4 minute steeping time could be a good starting point.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different roasts, too. A lighter roast might accentuate the citrus notes, while a darker roast could add a richer, more balanced flavor.\n\nHave fun exploring these options, and I hope you find the perfect coffee-citrus combination!",

      "content": "Kenyan coffee is an excellent choice.\n\nFor tea pairing with citrus flavors, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Earl Grey**: A classic choice, Earl Grey tea is flavored with bergamot oil, which is a natural citrus flavor. The bergamot will complement and enhance the citrus notes in your coffee, creating a lovely harmony.\n2. **Green Tea with Lemon Myrtle**: A light and refreshing green tea paired with the citrusy flavor of lemon myrtle can create a beautiful balance. Lemon myrtle is a native Australian herb that adds a sweet, citrusy flavor without being overpowering.\n3. **White Peony**: This Chinese white tea is known for its delicate, floral flavor profile, which can help to balance out the brightness of citrus. Its subtle sweetness will also complement the acidity in the coffee.\n4. **Genmaicha**: This Japanese green tea blend combines the freshness of green tea with the nutty flavor of roasted brown rice. The subtle citrus notes in the green tea will pair nicely with the citrus flavors in your coffee.\n5. **Lady Grey**: Similar to Earl Grey, Lady Grey tea is flavored with citrus fruits like orange, lemon, and bergamot. However, Lady Grey tends to have a more delicate flavor profile, making it a great option if you prefer a lighter citrus note.\n\nWhen pairing tea with citrus-infused coffee, consider the type of citrus fruit you're using and the strength of the flavor. For example, if you're using a strong citrus like lemon or orange, a more delicate tea like White Peony or Genmaicha might be a better fit. If you're using a more subtle citrus like grapefruit or lime, a stronger tea like Earl Grey or Lady Grey could work well.\n\nRemember, tea and coffee pairing is all about experimentation and personal preference. Feel free to try different combinations to find your perfect match!",

This will prevent air, light, and moisture from affecting the beans.\n2. **Cool, dark place**: Keep the container in a cool, dark place, like a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing coffee beans near a heat source, oven, or direct sunlight.\n3. **Room temperature**: Store coffee beans at room temperature (around 60-70\u00b0F/15-21\u00b0C). Avoid storing them in the refrigerator or freezer, as the moisture and temperature fluctuations can affect the beans.\n4. **Use within 2 weeks**: Try to use your coffee beans within 2 weeks of opening the bag or container. This ensures the beans are at their peak flavor and aroma.\n5. **Freeze for longer storage**: If you won't be using the beans within 2 weeks, consider freezing them. Place the beans in an airtight container or freezer bag, making sure to remove as much air as possible before sealing. Frozen coffee beans can be stored for up to 3-6 months.\n6. **Grind just before brewing**: Grind your coffee beans just before brewing to ensure the freshest flavor. Pre-ground coffee can sit on a shelf for weeks or months, losing its flavor and aroma.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to preserve the freshness and flavor of your coffee beans and enjoy a delicious cup every time!\n\nHave fun experimenting with your new beans and citrus notes in your French press!",
