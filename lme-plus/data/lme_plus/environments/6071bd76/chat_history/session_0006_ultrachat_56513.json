Studies have shown that prolonged social isolation can lead to symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \n\nThe following are some ways to alleviate the psychological effects of social isolation:\n\n1. Stay connected: Though you can\u2019t physically be with people, you can stay social by using technology or other means. Schedule video chats with family, friends, or colleagues. These virtual interactions can help you feel less lonely, even when you are physically isolated.\n\n2. Maintain a schedule: Set up a routine for your day-to-day activities, including regular meals and sleep, work, and leisure time. It can help provide a sense of structure to prevent feelings of restlessness and anxiety.\n\n3. Engage in hobbies: Hobbies can be a great way to relieve stress, and it provides an opportunity for you to engage in activities that you might not have had time for in the past.\n\n4. Exercise regularly: Exercise is essential for you to maintain a healthy mind and body. Physical activity has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms significantly.\n\n5. Practice mindfulness: Practice mindfulness techniques like meditation or yoga to reduce stress and anxiety. \n\n6. Seek professional help: If you're struggling with coping on your own, consider seeking professional help. Teletherapy is available, and many mental health professionals are offering virtual support during this time. \n\nIt's essential to remember that social isolation doesn't have to cause long-term psychological harm. By staying connected, engaging in meaningful activities, and seeking professional help if needed, you can alleviate the negative psychological effects of social isolation."

Place the pot back on the stove over low heat and add the olive oil, bacon pieces, and spaghetti into the pot. 6. Next, add the eggs and Parmesan mixture into the pot with the spaghetti, stirring quickly to combine. 7. You may have to add reserved pasta water to the spaghetti to make the sauce creamier. 8.
