      "content": "CHAPTER TWO\n Jeremy\u2019s Story\n From Jeremy\nI got into the business of healing back pain because I had serious back pain myself, as a young man, caused by a series of athletic injuries. I got into chiropractic and related whole-body disciplines because nothing else worked for me. I went on to develop my own, very different variations on familiar chiropractic practices over time. I do not \u201cpop\u201d backs or any of that, but I draw heavily on the basic elements of the discipline, as well as my reading of the scientific literature generally and my own considerable experience as a practitioner.\nI grew up in a traditional medical household, and fully expected to go to medical school and then into practice. My grandfather was a medical doctor, my father is a medical doctor, my mom is a nurse, my aunt is a nurse, my uncle was a pharmaceutical salesman. I was as deeply immersed in traditional Western medicine as one could possibly be, and I had\u2014and still have\u2014tremendous respect for it. When I was little, I was used to having people come up to me and tell me how much my grandfather had done to save this or that child from some grim fate. He was one of those doctors that they don\u2019t really make anymore. He performed surgeries, delivered babies, made house calls, and was a master diagnostician. And he was also a terrific guy whom I admired a lot. Later I heard the same things about my parents from their patients. \nSo I grew up believing there wasn\u2019t much that modern medicine could not fix, and I couldn\u2019t wait to become a part of it. I emphasize all this because, eventually, I am going to sound a bit reserved about traditional Western medicine and back pain, and I don\u2019t want you to be confused: I revere traditional medicine and understand it better than most. It\u2019s just that it generally isn\u2019t great at curing back pain. And back pain is what I had as a young man . . . a lot of it. And it has been my life ever since. \nMy Personal Pain: Part One \nWhen I was a teenager, I thought I was going to be a professional skateboarder. If you are over fifty, do not snap the book closed at this point; skateboarding is a terrific sport. But it is a slightly dangerous sport and I took many, many falls, some of them pretty bad. I did not become a professional skateboarder; I might have been good enough, but long before that could happen I became a very young man with extremely serious back pain. When that happened, I went the traditional medical route. I went to regular doctors (good ones, as you\u2019d expect) and was poked and prodded; I had ultrasounds and MRIs and blood tests and you-name-it. They talked about an extraordinary range of possible causes, including \u201cslipped discs,\u201d \u201cruptured discs,\u201d \u201cpinched nerves,\u201d maybe cancer. Wow! But they could not fix my pain. I was somewhat medically astute, even as a kid, and I became increasingly convinced that a lot of these well-meaning, well-trained doctors didn\u2019t really know an awful lot about my back pain. Sounds harsh, but it has turned out to be true of quite a few conventional doctors. \nIn near desperation, I turned to less traditional medicine\u2014to chiropractors. And darned if I didn\u2019t find at least some symptomatic relief. That was huge, and it opened my head to the possibility of going in that direction. I should mention that those particular chiropractors weren\u2019t perfect, either. They didn\u2019t begin to teach me how to make fundamental changes. They didn\u2019t talk about changing my own behaviors or suggest how to take control of my own health or do any of the things that are at the heart of my practice today. But they did show me that the pain could be affected with simple muscle and joint work, and I was deeply impressed by that. Chiropractic treatment has its place in back care and offers many benefits when done properly. Skilled chiropractors use manual (with their hands) therapy to restore normal joint movement and muscle function through chiropractic adjustments and other techniques such as stretching and joint mobilization. This therapy can be invaluable, especially in the short term. But even today many chiropractors do not teach their patients how to make the necessary behavioral changes to permanently relieve back pain. \nI decided to train in chiropractic, because I wanted to dig deeper into what I already recognized as the real causes\u2014and perhaps the real treatment\u2014of serious back pain: behavior and behavioral change. That drove my very medical family crazy, as you can imagine, but in retrospect it was exactly the right decision. \nMy education was a long and complex process. I took guidance from a range of experts in the chiropractic and other fields. But I eventually developed my own analyses and my own approach to permanently ending back pain in my patients. Traditional medicine takes a basically deconstructivist approach: It generally takes complex problems apart, analyzes the pieces with exquisite care, then identifies and cures the particular problem. That deconstructivist approach works miraculously for many, many medical problems, but not for back pain. For back pain you want an integrationist approach. You want whole-body solutions.\nMy Personal Pain: Part Two \nI had a second round of back pain, long after I should have known better, and I want to tell you that embarrassing story for several reasons. First, because the pain was so dreadful, and I want you to know just how deeply I understand and empathize with significant pain. Second, I want to stress just how vulnerable all of us are to default behaviors that can raise holy hell with our backs, including people like me, who surely should have known better. And third, I want to show how quickly and effectively you can deal with even the gravest back pain, once you know what you\u2019re doing. \nThe time is seven years ago. I was working part of the time on a very promising medical start-up venture. For six months, I was absolutely obsessed with it. I worked regular ten- and twelve-hour days with few breaks for leisure or exercise. Most of the time, I was bent over my computer. I worked like an absolute lunatic and did not think twice about my back. Pathetic. \nOne morning, after a particularly grueling stretch of days and nights, I woke up at six and started to sit up to go to the john. I was smacked by the most ferocious pain I\u2019ve ever had in my life, even worse than anything from my skateboarding days. I was knocked flat on my back and could not budge. Even when I was lying absolutely still, the pain continued, unabated, at a fierce level. If I tried to move, it was much, much worse. I lived alone back then, and all I could do was lie there and wonder, in near panic: What in the world is going on? Just how bad is this? Am I going to die, for heaven\u2019s sake? Not only was I in terrible pain; I was seriously scared. \nI remembered how \u201cnormal\u201d back pain felt, a bad spasm or whatever. But this seemed to be way beyond that. So what was it? A ruptured disc would be the good news. At the other end of the spectrum, perhaps it was some weird cancer, somewhere in my spine. \nThat was ridiculous, but truly severe pain leads to some wild and unpredictable thoughts. I was sweating and breathing hard and was on the edge of panic. And that went on for what seemed like forever. At last my long scientific training and experience took over. The first step was to ask myself the questions I ask all my patients: How did this happen? What \u201cbehavior\u201d might have caused this? It\u2019s interesting just how often the sufferer knows intuitively what he or she had done (at least the triggering event) and I was no different. It did not take long to conclude that it was probably those months of nonstop work, bent over a computer. Of course! For someone with my history, that was nuts. And step one was to stop doing what had caused the pain in the first place. (If I ever managed to sit or stand again.) The problem right now was to ease the pain and move. With more than a little agony, I rolled onto my side to see if I could stand. I couldn\u2019t. The pain ratcheted up to new levels and slapped me flat on my back again. It felt as if someone were stabbing me in my kidneys and dragging the knife down into my buttocks. It literally took my breath away. \nThen it was back to basics: I did what I always do in those relatively rare cases when I\u2019m there during a patient\u2019s attack. I told myself to tense my abdominal muscles a little and slowly pick up my left foot. I am lying flat in bed and picking up one foot, just a little bit. That simple first step, which I have counseled so many times, was bearable. It almost always is. I set that foot down and picked up the right foot, continuing to tense my abdominal muscles. That also was doable. Good. Then on to the next phase: I walked carefully, very gently, in place\u2014lying on my back and not lifting my feet very far\u2014for perhaps five minutes. The pain slowly lessened. I stopped, and did it again several times. I was \u201cwalking off\u201d the pain. And I was easing what almost certainly was a particularly bad muscle spasm, somewhere near my lumbar spine. \nEventually, I felt ready to stand. I lightly tensed the muscles in my abdomen to support my spine and keep it still and rolled onto my side. As you will soon learn, this tensing of those muscles is called locking down or engaging your core. This time I could do it. I was careful to keep my lower back still and my abdomen braced throughout the movement. It was not pain-free, but I made it to my knees, then my feet. I was mighty careful to keep my lumbar spine still and my core engaged throughout, because I knew that, in the wake of an attack like this, the spasm and the pain were just waiting to come roaring back. Then I tried walking erect. And, yes, I could walk. I walked back and forth across the room carefully, keeping my core tight. I did that for quite a while and the spasm and pain calmed down. \nFor the rest of that day, I was very careful about how I moved, and my back continued to get better. I knew from experience that those first steps would work because I had taught them to so many others. For the rest of the day, I took it easy and did no more than a little easy walking. By tomorrow, I assured myself, my back will slowly loosen up. It will take a week to return to normal, because the spasm was so strong. But in a week, I will be there. Then I will resume my regular exercise regimen, and stick to it religiously. I will not sit at the computer for more than thirty minutes at a time without taking a break and walking around. And so on and so forth. In fact, I did all that. In a week, I was moving and living normally. I did not let the intensity of my work interfere with my exercise regimen ever again. And the pain never returned. \nWith my horror story behind us, I want to visit four other sufferers. But first, let Chris take you on a stroll down your own spine, and tell you about how your spine works and how it can go wrong."
