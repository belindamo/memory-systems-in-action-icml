      "content": "Wedding gifts can be tricky to navigate! It's great that you're thinking about the price of the gift, as it's always important to consider the couple's preferences and your own budget.\n\nAs for the crystal vase from Bed Bath & Beyond, the price can vary depending on the specific item and brand. However, a crystal vase can be a beautiful and elegant gift for a wedding. If you're unsure about the price, you could consider a few things:\n\n1. Check the price range: Compare the price of the vase to other similar items online or in-store. This can help you determine if it's within a reasonable range for a wedding gift.\n2. Consider the couple's style: If your cousin and their partner have a more formal or elegant style, a crystal vase might be a fitting gift. On the other hand, if they're more casual or minimalist, they might appreciate a different type of gift.\n3. Think about the occasion: A wedding is a special occasion, and a nicer gift is often expected. However, it's also important to consider your own budget and financial situation.\n\nAs for your love of The Vintage Closet, it's great that you've found a store that you enjoy! Thrifting and vintage shopping can be a fun and sustainable way to find unique gifts or personal items.

If you're still unsure about the vase, you could consider adding a personal touch, like a heartfelt note or a small, sentimental item, to make the gift feel more thoughtful and special."
