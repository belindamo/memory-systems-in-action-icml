Here are some examples:\n\n- In the 18th century novel \"Tom Jones\" by Henry Fielding, the eponymous protagonist travels to Uxbridge and stays at the Crown Inn, which is still standing today. The inn is described as \"a large old-fashioned house, which had formerly been a palace for the bishops of London\".\n- In the 19th century novel \"Pickwick Papers\" by Charles Dickens, the character Sam Weller spends a night at the Angel Inn in Uxbridge, which was a popular coaching inn at the time. Dickens describes the inn as \"a white-fronted house with a green door and window-shutters\".\n- The poet John Milton lived in Uxbridge in the 17th century and is said to have written parts of his masterpiece \"Paradise Lost\" while staying at his cottage in the town. The cottage is now a museum dedicated to Milton's life and work.\n- The Uxbridge Canal, which was built in the 18th century to transport goods between Uxbridge and the Grand Junction Canal, is mentioned in several books about the history of canals and waterways in England. One such book is \"Canals across Scotland and Ireland\" by Charles Hadfield, which includes a map of the Uxbridge Canal and its route through the town.\n- The Battle of Uxbridge in 1644, which was a pivotal moment in the English Civil War, is referenced in many historical books and novels. One example is \"The Cavaliers\" by Frances Parkinson Keyes, which tells the story of a fictional family caught up in the conflict."
