Trader Joe's (week before): $50\n3. Instacart (earlier this month): $80\n4. Costco (last month): $15\n5. Indian grocery store (last week): $20\n\n**Categories:**\n\n1. **Grocery stores**: Walmart, Trader Joe's, and Instacart\n2. **Warehouse clubs**: Costco\n3. **Specialty stores**: Indian grocery store\n\n**Weekly Spending:**\n\nTo calculate your weekly spending, we'll need to adjust the receipts to fit into a weekly timeframe. Since you have receipts from different weeks, we'll average them out.\n\n1. Grocery stores: ($120 + $50 + $80) / 3 = $83.33 per week\n2. Warehouse clubs: $15 (this is a one-time purchase, so we'll divide it by 4 to get a weekly average) = $3.75 per week\n3. Specialty stores: $20 (this is a one-time purchase, so we'll divide it by 4 to get a weekly average) = $5 per week\n\n**Total Weekly Spending:**\n\n$83.33 + $3.75 + $5 = $92.08 per week\n\nSo, your average weekly grocery spending is around $92.08. This will give you a good baseline to work with as you continue to track your spending and make adjustments to your grocery shopping habits.\n\nSome questions to consider:\n\n* Are there any areas where you'd like to cut back on spending?\n* Are there any categories where you feel like you're overspending?\n* Are there any ways you can optimize your shopping habits to reduce waste or save money?\n\nRemember, tracking your spending is just the first step. The key is to use this information to make conscious decisions about your grocery shopping and meal planning.",
