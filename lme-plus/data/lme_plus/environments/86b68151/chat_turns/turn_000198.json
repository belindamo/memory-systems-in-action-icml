However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I can't provide specific recommendations for local art classes in your neighborhood.\n\nBut don't worry! Here are some suggestions to help you find local art classes:\n\n1. **Online Search**: Try searching for \"art classes near me\" or \"art classes in [your city/neighborhood]\" on Google or other search engines. This should give you a list of local art schools, studios, and instructors offering classes.\n2. **Social Media**: Check social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter for local art schools, studios, or instructors. Many of them have online presence and post about their classes, workshops, and events.\n3. **Community Centers**: Reach out to local community centers, recreation centers, or libraries in your area. They often offer art classes, workshops, or programs for adults and children.\n4. **Local Art Supply Stores**: Visit local art supply stores or craft stores in your area and ask if they know of any art classes or instructors in the area.
