  "content": "With that information, I can suggest a suitable replacement bulb for you.\n\nSince you're currently using a 60W LED bulb, you can consider a similar wattage or a slightly lower wattage bulb, as LEDs are more energy-efficient. Warm white is a cozy and relaxing color temperature, which is usually around 2700K-3000K.\n\nHere are some options to consider:\n\n1. **Philips LED Soft White Bulb** (60W equivalent, 2700K, 800 lumens): This bulb is a popular choice, dimmable, and has a warm white color temperature. It's usually priced around $8-$10.\n2. **LIFX LED Soft White Bulb** (60W equivalent, 2700K, 800 lumens): This bulb is also dimmable and has a warm white color temperature. It's a bit more expensive, but it's a high-quality option. Price: around $10-$12.\n3. **GE Soft White LED Bulb** (40W equivalent, 2800K, 450 lumens): This bulb is a more budget-friendly option, still offering a warm white color temperature. It's not dimmable, but it's a great value for the price. Price: around $5-$7.\n4. **Sylvania Smart+ LED Bulb** (60W equivalent, 2700K, 800 lumens): This bulb is a smart bulb option that's compatible with smart home systems like Alexa and Google Assistant. It's dimmable and has a warm white color temperature. Price: around $10-$12.\n\nAll of these options should provide a similar brightness and color temperature to your current bulb. Since you don't have a specific brand in mind, I've suggested a few popular options that fit your budget.\n\nBefore making a final decision, you can check the prices and reviews on online marketplaces like Amazon, Home Depot, or Lowe's to find the best deal.",
