  "content": "In Catholic teachings, charity and giving to those in need are considered moral obligations. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that \"almsgiving, according to the Gospel, is not mere philanthropy. Rather it is a concrete expression of charity, a way of assisting in a immediate needs of our neighbors and showing solidarity with them\" (2447).\n\nCatholic social teaching emphasizes the importance of caring for the poor and vulnerable and promoting the common good, and Catholics are encouraged to live a life of solidarity with those in need. While there is no specific obligation to donate a certain amount of money or to avoid spending money on luxury items, Catholics are called to use their resources and talents to promote the dignity of all human beings and to work for the well-being of others.\n\nIn short, while there may not be a specific mandate to donate a certain percentage of one's income or to avoid luxury items altogether, Catholics are encouraged to prioritize charity and the needs of others in their financial decisions and to use their resources in a way that promotes the common good.",
