Although it's primarily designed for Google Ads, it can also be used for hashtag research on social media platforms like Instagram.\n\n**How to use Google Keyword Planner for hashtag research:**\n\n1. **Access Google Keyword Planner**:\n\t* Go to [ads.google.com](http://ads.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.\n\t* Click on \"Tools\" and select \"Keyword Planner\" from the drop-down menu.\n2. **Set up a new campaign**:\n\t* Click on \"New campaign\" and select \"Website traffic\" as the campaign type.\n\t* Enter a campaign name, and for the website, enter a random URL (it doesn't matter what URL you enter).\n\t* Click \"Continue\" to proceed.\n3. **Get to the keyword research tool**:\n\t* In the campaign setup process, you'll see a section called \"Keywords.\" Click on \"Get started\" next to it.\n\t* This will take you to the Keyword Planner tool.\n4. **Enter your seed keywords**:\n\t* In the \"Find keywords\" section, enter a seed keyword related to your niche or topic. For example, if you're in the fitness industry, you could enter \"fitness motivation.\"\n\t* You can enter multiple keywords separated by commas.\n5. **Get keyword ideas**:\n\t* Click on the \"Get ideas\" button to generate a list of keyword ideas.\n\t* You'll see a list of keywords, along with their average monthly searches, competition level, and suggested bid price.\n6. **Filter and refine your results**:\n\t* Use the filters on the left side to refine your results. You can filter by keyword type, competition level, average monthly searches, and more.\n\t* Look for keywords with a moderate to high search volume (e.g., 1,000 to 10,000 searches per month) and low to medium competition.\n7. **Identify relevant hashtags**:\n\t* Go through the list of keywords and identify the ones that can be used as hashtags on Instagram.\n\t* Look for keywords that are concise, easy to remember, and relevant to your content.\n8. **Save your research**:\n\t* Save your keyword research in a spreadsheet or document for future reference.\n\n**Tips and variations:**\n\n* Use long-tail keywords: Instead of targeting broad keywords like \"fitness,\" try using long-tail keywords like \"fitness motivation for women\" or \"home workout routines.\"\n* Use quotes: If you want to search for an exact phrase, put it in quotes. For example, \"fitness inspiration\" will search for the exact phrase.\n* Use the \"Keyword suggestions\" tab: This tab provides additional keyword ideas based on your seed keywords.\n* Use the \"Ad group ideas\" tab: This tab provides ideas for ad groups, which can help you identify broader themes and topics related to your niche.\n\nBy using Google Keyword Planner, you can discover new hashtags and keywords that can help you reach a wider audience on Instagram. Remember to always keep your target audience and content in mind when selecting hashtags.",
