  "content": "The chirp signal is a type of signal in digital signal processing that has a frequency that changes over time. In this problem, we aim to develop a MATLAB function called chirpTone that generates a column vector consisting of a sine wave with a growing frequency, also known as a chirp tone.\n\nTo create the chirp tone, the chirpTone function takes four inputs: the duration T in seconds, the initial frequency f1 in Hz, the final frequency f2 in Hz, and the sampling rate fs in samples per second. The function generates a column vector output, which contains the chirp tone with the given parameters.\n\nTo generate the chirp tone, we first need to create a time vector t that ranges from 0 to T using the sampling rate fs. We can do this by dividing the duration T into fs equally spaced time intervals, or samples, using the sampling period ts=1/fs.\n\nNext, we need to create a frequency vector f that grows linearly from f1 to f2 over the duration of the chirp tone. We can do this by using the formula f = f1 + (f2-f1)/(length(t)-1) \\* (0:length(t)-1), which generates a frequency vector f with the same length as the time vector t, where the first element is f1 and the last element is f2, and the intermediate values grow linearly over time.\n\nFinally, we can generate the chirp tone output by computing the sine of the product of 2\u03c0f(t) and t, where f(t) is the frequency vector we defined earlier. We can accomplish this using the formula output = sin(2*pi*f.\\*t).\n\nTo validate our function, we can execute it with the specified inputs and store the result in a variable x. For example, x = chirpTone(10,1000,2000,4000) generates a chirp tone with a duration of 10 seconds, beginning at 1000 Hz and ending at 2000 Hz, and sampled at 4000 samples per second. We can listen to the chirp tone by using the soundsc function.",
