  "content": "That's great to hear that you're making progress with your English language learning! Watching TV shows with subtitles on Netflix is an excellent way to improve your listening and reading skills, and it's even more effective when combined with regular ESL classes.\n\nIt's also fantastic that your teacher, Mrs. Johnson, recommended some English language learning apps to supplement your learning. Having a supportive teacher who provides personalized recommendations can make a big difference in your language learning journey.\n\nCould you tell me more about the apps that Mrs. Johnson recommended? Which ones are you using, and how are you finding them? Are there any particular features or exercises that you find helpful?\n\nAdditionally, how do you find the ESL classes at the community center? Are there any specific areas of English language learning that you're focusing on, such as grammar, vocabulary, or conversation?",
