In this question, we implement a function in MATLAB that generates a column vector containing a sine wave with a growing frequency, also known as a chirp tone.\n\nThe function that we will create is called chirpTone, and it takes four inputs: the duration T in seconds, the initial frequency f1 in Hz, the final frequency f2 in Hz, and the sampling rate fs in samples per second. The output of the function is a column vector output containing a chirp tone with the specified parameters.\n\nTo generate the chirp tone, we first need to define the time vector t using the sampling rate fs. We can do this by dividing the duration T into fs equally spaced time intervals, or samples, using the sampling period ts=1/fs. This will give us a time vector t ranging from 0 to T with length(t) samples.\n\nNext, we need to define the frequency vector f that grows linearly from f1 to f2 over the duration of the chirp tone. We can do this using the formula f = f1 + (f2-f1)/(length(t)-1) \\* (0:length(t)-1). This formula creates a frequency vector f with the same length as the time vector t, where the first element is f1 and the last element is f2, with the intermediate values growing linearly over time.\n\nFinally, we can generate the chirp tone output by taking the sine of the product of 2\u03c0f(t) and t, where f(t) is the frequency vector we just defined. We can do this using the formula output = sin(2\\*pi\\*f.\\*t).\n\nTo test our function, we can call it with the desired inputs and store the output in a variable x. For example, x = chirpTone(10,1000,2000,4000) generates a chirp tone with a duration of 10 seconds, starting at 1000 Hz and ending at 2000 Hz, sampled at 4000 samples per second. We can listen to the chirp tone using the soundsc function.",
