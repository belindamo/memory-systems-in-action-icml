  "content": "I'd be happy to help you find a suitable replacement bulb for your lamp.\n\nTo recommend an energy-efficient bulb, I'll need to know a few details about the lamp and your preferences. Please answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the wattage of the current bulb in the lamp? (Check the packaging or the manufacturer's website if you're unsure.)\n2. What type of bulb is currently used in the lamp (e.g., incandescent, halogen, LED, CFL)?\n3. Do you have a preferred brightness level or color temperature for the new bulb? (e.g., warm white, cool white, daylight)\n4. Are you looking for a specific brand or price range for the new bulb?\n5. Do you have any special requirements, such as dimmability or smart bulb features?\n\nBased on your answers, I can suggest an energy-efficient bulb type that fits your needs:\n\n* LED bulbs are generally the most energy-efficient option, using up to 90% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs.\n* CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) bulbs are another energy-efficient option, using about 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs.\n* Halogen bulbs are slightly more energy-efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs but are being phased out in some regions.\n\nOnce I have more information, I can provide a specific recommendation for a suitable replacement bulb.",
