  "content": "I'm also curious about the logistics of the guided tours. Are there any specific rules or guidelines that participants need to follow, such as staying on designated trails or not approaching birds too closely? And what kind of equipment is provided, if any, such as binoculars or spotting scopes? By the way, speaking of spotting scopes, I've been getting some great use out of my new one, which has been a game-changer for me - I've been using it to observe the nesting habits of a pair of American Robins in my backyard.",
