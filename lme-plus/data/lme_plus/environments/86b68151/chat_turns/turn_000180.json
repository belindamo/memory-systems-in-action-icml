  "content": "Skipping installation and maintenance steps for your air conditioning unit can result in significant consequences. Doing so can lead to a lack of efficiency, increased energy consumption, higher electricity bills, and overall decreased cooling performance. \nMoreover, air flowing through a dirty filter may carry allergens and dust to other parts of the home, which can impact the air quality and contribute to health issues. Running an air conditioning unit without proper maintenance can also increase the risk of a complete system failure, which can be costly to repair or replace. Therefore, it is highly recommended to follow proper installation and maintenance guidelines for your air conditioning unit to ensure it operates efficiently and effectively while providing clean, cool air to your home or office.",
