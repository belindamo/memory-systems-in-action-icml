  "content": "I'm interested in learning more about landscape photography, particularly capturing sunset scenes. During the photography workshop I attended, we did an outdoor photo shoot on the second day, and it was really helpful to practice in a real-world setting. The instructor gave us tips on how to capture interesting compositions and work with natural light. Do you have any additional tips on how to capture stunning sunset photos?",
