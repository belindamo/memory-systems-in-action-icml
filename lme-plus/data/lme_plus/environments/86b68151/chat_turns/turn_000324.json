Adjusting your bedtime can take some time to get used to, but it's a great step towards establishing a consistent sleep schedule.\n\nRemember, it's not just about the bedtime itself, but also about creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down. Try to stick to your routine, including progressive muscle relaxation, and make adjustments as needed.\n\nKeep in mind that it may take some time for your body to adjust to the new sleep schedule, so be patient and don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. It's a process, and it's okay to make tweaks along the way.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck on your sleep schedule journey!",
