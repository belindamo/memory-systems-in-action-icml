This might help reduce the shadow.\n3. **Use a lamp with a longer arm**: If your lamp has a shorter arm, it might be casting a more pronounced shadow. Consider replacing it with a lamp that has a longer arm, which can provide more flexibility in terms of placement and shadow reduction.\n4. **Consider a lamp with a different light source**: Some lamps, like those with a LED strip or a circular light source, can provide more even lighting and reduce shadows.\n\nIf you're in the market for a new lamp, here are some types that might be suitable for reading and minimizing shadows:\n\n1. **Architect lamp**: These lamps have a long, curved arm that can be adjusted to provide light from above, reducing shadows.\n2. **Swing arm lamp**: These lamps have a jointed arm that allows you to adjust the direction and height of the light, making it easier to position the light to minimize shadows.\n3. **Torchiere lamp**: These lamps have a tall, slender design and often feature a circular or oval-shaped light source, which can provide more even lighting and reduce shadows.\n4. **LED floor lamp with adjustable head**: Some LED floor lamps have an adjustable head that can be tilted and rotated to direct the light exactly where you need it, reducing shadows.\n\nSome popular brands that offer high-quality, adjustable floor lamps include:\n\n1. **Lumiy Lightology**: Known for their sleek, modern designs and adjustable arms.\n2. **Artemide**: Offers a range of stylish, adjustable floor lamps with high-quality light sources.\n3. **Herman Miller**: Provides a variety of adjustable floor lamps with a focus on task lighting and reducing eye strain.\n\nRemember to check the product reviews and specifications to ensure the lamp you choose meets your needs and preferences.",
