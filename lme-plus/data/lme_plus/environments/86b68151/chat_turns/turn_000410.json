I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to share your vegan recipes and cooking experiments with the world.\n\nRegarding your question, #veganfood is a great hashtag, but it is quite broad and competitive. With over 100 million posts, it can be challenging to stand out and get noticed. Using a more specific hashtag like #veganrecipes or #plantbasedcooking can be a better strategy, especially when you're just starting out.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Less competition**: Niche hashtags like #veganrecipes or #plantbasedcooking have fewer posts, which means less competition for your content.\n2. **More targeted audience**: These hashtags attract a more targeted audience that's specifically interested in vegan recipes or plant-based cooking, increasing the chances of engagement and attracting followers who are relevant to your content.\n3. **Better visibility**: Using a more specific hashtag can help your content appear in the \"Top Posts\" section, which can drive more visibility and attract new followers.\n\nThat being said, it's not a bad idea to use #veganfood occasionally, especially if you're posting a recipe that's particularly unique or visually appealing. Just be sure to mix it up and use a variety of hashtags to reach different audiences.\n\nHere are some additional hashtag suggestions for you:\n\n* #vegancooking\n* #plantbasedrecipes\n* #veganinspiration\n* #crueltyfreefood\n* #veganlifestyle\n* #foodie Finds\n* #veganfoodshare\n\nRemember to keep your hashtags relevant to the content you're posting, and don't overdo it. Using 5-10 hashtags per post is a good starting point. You can always experiment with different hashtags and see which ones work best for your account.\n\nGood luck with your new account, and I hope these tips help you grow your audience and share your passion for vegan recipes and cooking experiments with the world!",
