Here are some popular ones you can try:\n\n1. **Deep Breathing**: Focus on slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try a 4-7-8 pattern: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and breathe out for 8 seconds.\n2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head. Hold each muscle group for 5-10 seconds before releasing.\n3. **Mindfulness Meditation**: Focus your attention on the present moment, without judgment. You can use a guided meditation app or simply pay attention to your breath, body sensations, or the sensation of your feet on the ground.\n4. **Visualization**: Imagine yourself in a peaceful, relaxing environment, such as a beach or a forest. Use all your senses to create a vivid mental picture.\n5. **Body Scan**: Lie down or sit comfortably, and bring your attention to different parts of your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head.
