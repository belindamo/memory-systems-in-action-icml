  "content": "Sentiment analysis is a fascinating area of research! Deep learning has made significant contributions to this field, and there are many excellent papers and researchers worth exploring. Here are some popular papers and researchers to get you started:\n\n**Papers:**\n\n1. **Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification** by Yoon Kim (2014) - This paper introduced the use of CNNs for sentence-level sentiment analysis and achieved state-of-the-art results at the time.\n2. **Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification** by Sepp Hochreiter and J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber (1997) - This paper introduced the concept of recurrent convolutional neural networks, which has been widely used in sentiment analysis.\n3. **Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis: A Survey** by Rui Xia and Erik Cambria (2019) - This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis, including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.\n4. **Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning** by Minqing Hu and Bing Liu (2004) - This paper introduced the concept of aspect-based sentiment analysis, which involves identifying sentiment towards specific aspects or features of an entity.\n5. **BERT-based Sentiment Analysis** by Jacob Devlin and Ming-Wei Chang (2019) - This paper demonstrated the effectiveness of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis tasks.\n\n**Researchers:**\n\n1. **Yoav Goldberg** - A prominent researcher in natural language processing and deep learning, Goldberg has made significant contributions to sentiment analysis, including the development of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset.\n2. **Bing Liu** - A leading researcher in sentiment analysis and opinion mining, Liu has published numerous papers on aspect-based sentiment analysis and has developed several popular datasets and tools.\n3. **Erik Cambria** - Cambria is a researcher and entrepreneur who has worked extensively on sentiment analysis and affective computing. He is the founder of the SenticNet project, which provides a suite of tools and resources for sentiment analysis.\n4. **Christopher Potts** - A researcher at Stanford University, Potts has worked on various aspects of natural language processing, including sentiment analysis, pragmatics, and lexical semantics.\n5. **Rada Mihalcea** - A researcher at the University of Michigan, Mihalcea has made contributions to sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and multimodal processing.\n\n**Conferences and Journals:**\n\n1. **ACL (Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics)**\n2. **EMNLP (Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing)**\n3. **NAACL (Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics)**\n4. **Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)**\n5. **Computational Linguistics**\n\nThese resources should provide a good starting point for your project. Remember to explore recent papers and researchers, as the field of sentiment analysis is constantly evolving. Good luck with your project!",
