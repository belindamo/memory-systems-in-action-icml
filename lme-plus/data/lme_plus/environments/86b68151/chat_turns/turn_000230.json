We will provide services related to talent acquisition, competency evaluation, and personalized training to these businesses at a premium price.\n\nIn addition to B2B, we also have a B2C revenue model through our participation in the K-digital Training project, which is a government-backed initiative to train the next generation of digital workers. Through this program, we offer intensive bootcamps and other courses to individuals at a lower cost, with the goal of increasing the pool of talented workers available to the industry.\n\nWe also plan to monetize our data through partnerships with other companies and organizations in the talent development industry. By providing access to our large and diverse pool of student data, we can help other businesses improve their talent transformation processes and provide more personalized and effective training to their own employees.\n\n2-a) Market size\n\nTo estimate the market size for our talent transformation platform, we must consider both the global adult education market and the job market. According to market research firm HolonIQ, the global market for education and training is estimated to be worth $7 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, the global job market is expected to grow to 3.5 billion workers by 2030, with an increasing demand for workers with digital skills.\n\nAssuming that our talent transformation platform can capture just 1% of the global market for education and training, and assuming an average cost of $5,000 per student, our potential revenue could reach $35 billion. However, given our focus on B2B and our unique capabilities in talent transformation, we believe we have the potential to capture a larger share of the market and generate even more revenue.\n\n2-b-i) Status, pros and cons of other players in the market\n\nWhen it comes to talent development and incubation, there are a number of players in the market, ranging from global educational platforms to career transformation platforms like LinkedIn. Some of the key players in the market include:\n\n* Udacity: A leading online education platform with a focus on tech skills and digital transformation. Udacity offers a variety of programs and courses designed to upskill workers and prepare them for the jobs of the future.\n* Coursera: Another popular online education platform that offers a wide range of courses and programs in various fields. Coursera partners with universities and companies to provide high-quality education to learners around the world.\n* LinkedIn: A career-focused social media platform that offers a variety of tools and resources for job seekers and professionals. LinkedIn also provides learning opportunities and certification programs to help workers upskill and stay competitive in the job market.\n\nEach of these players has their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Udacity has a strong focus on tech skills and digital transformation, but may not have the same level of experience and expertise in talent development as Codestates. Coursera has a wide range of courses and partnerships, but may not have the same level of customization and personalization as Codestates. LinkedIn has a large and active user base, but may not have the same level of in-depth training and evaluation as Codestates.\n\n2-b-ii) Competitive advantage of Codestates\n\nCodestates has a number of competitive advantages in the talent development and incubation market, including:\n\n* Unique student data: Codestates has been collecting student data for many years, which provides a wealth of insights into the competencies and potential of digital workers. This data can be used to develop more accurate and effective competency evaluation models, as well as personalized training programs.\n* Personalized education curriculum: Codestates offers a wide variety of modularized contents that can be",
