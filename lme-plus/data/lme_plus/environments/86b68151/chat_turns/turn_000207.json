I recently met a vendor at a street festival selling handmade jewelry, and we had a great conversation about the craftsmanship behind her pieces. I was thinking of asking her if she'd be willing to teach me some jewelry-making techniques, but I'm not sure how to approach her. Do you have any tips on how to ask someone for a favor?",
