  "content": "Congratulations on your research paper and upcoming presentation! That's exciting news!\n\nAs for the researchers I mentioned, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to their personal schedules or attendance plans. However, I can suggest a few ways to find out if they might be attending the conference:\n\n1. **Check the conference website**: Look for the conference program, speaker list, or attendee list on the official website. If the researchers are attending or presenting, their names might be listed.\n2. **Social media and online profiles**: Check the researchers' social media profiles (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, or Academia.edu) to see if they've mentioned attending the conference or posted about their travels.\n3. **Research institution websites**: Visit the websites of the researchers' institutions to see if they've announced their attendance or presentation at the conference.\n4. **Reach out to the researchers directly**: If you're interested in meeting them or discussing your research, consider sending a polite email or message to the researchers directly. They might respond with their attendance plans or availability for discussion.\n5. **Attend the conference sessions and networking events**: Even if you can't confirm their attendance beforehand, attend the conference sessions and networking events related to sentiment analysis and deep learning. You might still have the opportunity to meet them or other experts in the field.\n\nRemember to prepare for your presentation and enjoy the conference! It's a great opportunity to share your research, learn from others, and network with experts in the field.",
