It's like when you hear a bird chirp - the pitch changes as it sings. So, in this problem, we want to make a computer program that creates a chirp sound, which starts at one pitch and gradually changes to another pitch.\n\nTo make this chirp sound, we need to use a programming language called MATLAB. We'll make a special function called \"chirpTone\" that creates the chirp sound. This function needs four pieces of information: how long the sound should last (in seconds), what pitch it should start at (in Hertz), what pitch it should end at (also in Hertz), and how many samples to use per second.\n\nOnce we have these pieces of information, we can start making the chirp sound. First, we need to create a list of time values that the computer can use to create the sound. We do this by dividing the total time by the number of samples per second. This gives us a bunch of evenly spaced time values that we can use to create the sound.\n\nNext, we need to create a list of pitch values that change over time. We do this by figuring out how much the pitch needs to change between the start and end of the sound, and then dividing that change by the number of time values we created earlier. This gives us a list of pitch values that start at the beginning pitch, gradually change over time, and end at the ending pitch.\n\nFinally, we can create the chirp sound by multiplying the time values and pitch values together, and then taking the sine of that product. This creates a sound wave that starts at one pitch and gradually changes to another pitch over time.\n\nTo test our program, we can tell it how long we want the sound to be, what pitch it should start at, what pitch it should end at, and how many samples to use per second. Then we can listen to the chirp sound that the program creates.\n\nSo that's how we can make a chirp sound using MATLAB! It's a really cool way to create sounds that change over time, and it's used in all kinds of applications like music and radar systems.",
