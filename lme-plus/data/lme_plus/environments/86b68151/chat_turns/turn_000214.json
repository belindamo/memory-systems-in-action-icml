Since I don't have specific information about the sanctuary you're visiting, I'll provide general guidance and suggestions. I recommend checking the sanctuary's website, contacting them directly, or visiting their visitor center to get the most up-to-date and detailed information.\n\nTypically, sanctuaries and nature reserves have trails that cater to birding and wildlife viewing. Look for trails that:\n\n1. Follow wetlands, rivers, or lakeshores: These areas often attract waterfowl, shorebirds, and birds that depend on aquatic habitats.\n2. Wind through forests or woodlands: Forests can be hotspots for warblers, sparrows, and other songbirds during migration.\n3. Traverse grasslands or prairies: These habitats are ideal for spotting birds like meadowlarks, sparrows, and hawks.\n\nSome sanctuaries may have specific trails or areas known for certain species, such as:\n\n* Warbler trails: Some sanctuaries have trails specifically designed to maximize warbler sightings during peak migration.\n* Raptor viewing areas: Look for platforms or observation decks that offer views of open fields or skies, perfect for spotting hawks, eagles, and falcons.\n* Waterfowl blinds: Some sanctuaries have hidden blinds or observation areas near ponds or lakes, allowing you to get up close and personal with ducks, geese, and other waterfowl.\n\nRegarding guided tours and birding events, many sanctuaries offer programs during peak migration periods. These can be an excellent way to:\n\n1. Learn from experienced guides and birders\n2. Increase your chances of spotting specific species\n3. Gain insights into habitat management and conservation efforts\n\nSome common events during spring migration include:\n\n* Guided bird walks or hikes\n* Birding workshops or classes\n* Migration counts or bird surveys\n* Bird banding demonstrations\n* Special events focused on specific species, like warblers or raptors\n\nBe sure to check the sanctuary's website, social media, or contact them directly to inquire about:\n\n* Trail maps and guides\n* Guided tours and event schedules\n* Birding tips and recommendations from staff or volunteers\n* Any specific rules or regulations regarding birding, photography, or trail access\n\nBy doing your research and planning ahead, you'll be well-prepared for a fantastic birding experience at the sanctuary!",
