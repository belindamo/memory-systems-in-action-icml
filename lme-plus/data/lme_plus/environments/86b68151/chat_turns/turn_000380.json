  "content": "Great choices! Using leftover veggies from your Chinese food order is a fantastic way to reduce waste and add some extra nutrients to your curry sauce. Broccoli and carrots will cook down nicely and add a nice texture and flavor to the dish.\n\nAnd yay for trying out new restaurants! Bella Vita sounds like a great spot, and veggie lasagna is always a delicious option. Italian food is one of my favorites, and it's awesome that you're supporting local businesses.\n\nBy the way, since you mentioned Bella Vita, I have to ask: Have you tried making your own lasagna at home? It's actually quite easy and can be a fun weekend project. I can give you some tips and recipe ideas if you're interested!\n\nBut back to your curry sauce: With the leftover broccoli and carrots, you can chop them up and saut\u00e9 them with some onions and garlic to add extra flavor. Then, just add the curry powder, coconut milk, and your choice of protein (in this case, salmon), and let it simmer until everything is cooked through.\n\nHow does that sound?",
