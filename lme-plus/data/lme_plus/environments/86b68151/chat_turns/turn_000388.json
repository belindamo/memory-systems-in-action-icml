  "content": "That's a great idea! It's always a good idea to check if you have any spare bulbs lying around before buying a new one. You might be surprised to find that you already have a replacement bulb that you can use.\n\nIf you do find a spare bulb, make sure to check its expiration date or manufacturing date to ensure it's still usable. LED bulbs typically have a long lifespan, but it's still important to check the date to ensure it's not past its prime.\n\nIf you don't have any spare bulbs, you can always come back to the options I suggested earlier. And if you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask!\n\nRemember to also check the packaging or manufacturer's website for any specific information on the bulb's compatibility with your lamp, such as voltage, wattage, and socket type. This will ensure that the new bulb works properly and safely with your lamp.",
