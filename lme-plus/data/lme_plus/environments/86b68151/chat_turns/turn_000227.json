  "content": "In Pyomo, a solution is a set of variable values that satisfies all constraints and optimizes the objective function. In this case, the problem is a binary integer programming problem with only two variables, and the objective function is linear. Because the problem is relatively small, the solver was able to find an optimal solution quickly.\n\nThe reason that the number of solutions displayed is zero is because the optimal solution to the problem is a unique solution. In other words, there is only one set of variable values that optimizes the objective function and satisfies all constraints. Since there is only one solution, the solver doesn't need to enumerate or display any additional solutions.\n\nTo access the variable values of the solution, you can use the `model.x.value` and `model.y.value` attributes, like this:\n```python\nprint('x =', model.x.value)\nprint('y =', model.y.value)\n```\nThese attributes return the values of the `x` and `y` variables in the optimal solution, respectively.",
