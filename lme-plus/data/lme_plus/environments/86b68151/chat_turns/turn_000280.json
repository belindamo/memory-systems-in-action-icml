  "content": "As per my knowledge and research, none of the parks in Minden have a lake or pond nearby for cooling off after sun-bathing. However, there are some nearby lakes and beaches you can visit for swimming and water sports. Lake Tahoe is about an hour and a half drive from Minden and is a popular destination for swimming, boating, and fishing. There are also several beaches along the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe, including Sand Harbor Beach, King's Beach, and Incline Beach, among others. Lake Topaz, located about 25 miles southeast of Minden, is another option for swimming and boating.",
