I'll also use the web clipper to save research articles and inspiration for my stories. For my writing challenge submissions, I'll create a separate notebook in Evernote and a board in Trello, with lists for each prompt and cards for my ideas and drafts. Do you have any suggestions for how to brainstorm and develop characters for my stories?",
