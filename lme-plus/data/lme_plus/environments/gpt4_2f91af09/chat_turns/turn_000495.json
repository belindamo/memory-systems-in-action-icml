  "content": "If the hero that defeated the gods was later revealed to be a hidden Satan, it's likely that Pyrrhos would feel conflicted and confused. On one hand, he may have been grateful that the hero had defeated the gods and potentially saved his life, but on the other hand, he would be dismayed to learn that the hero was actually an agent of evil.\n\nDepending on his personal beliefs and values, Pyrrhos may feel a sense of betrayal or anger at the hero and the gods for allowing the deception to take place. He may also feel a sense of despair or hopelessness if he believed that the hero's actions had ultimately led to the destruction of his world.\n\nIn any case, the revelation that the hero was actually a Satan would likely leave Pyrrhos questioning his beliefs and his understanding of the world around him.",
