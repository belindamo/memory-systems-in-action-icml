In the flood or earthquake scenarios, it's possible that Pyrrhos and his family, along with the animals, would have been unable to survive the catastrophe without some form of protection.\n\nIn the fire scenario, Pyrrhos was able to create a stone tower that could withstand the heat, so it's possible that he may have been able to find some other form of shelter that would have allowed him to survive. However, without some form of protection, it's likely that Pyrrhos and his family would have been unable to survive the disaster.",
