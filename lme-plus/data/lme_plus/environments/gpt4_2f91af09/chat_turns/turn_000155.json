  "content": "The Beaver Ponds Trail is a wonderful hike.\n\nAs for lunch or snacks, there are a few options near the trailhead:\n\n1. **Mammoth Hot Springs General Store**: This general store is located near the trailhead and offers a limited selection of snacks, drinks, and sandwiches. It's a good place to grab a quick bite or pick up some trail mix and water before you head out.\n2. **Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel**: The hotel has a restaurant and a deli that serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The menu includes burgers, salads, soups, and sandwiches. It's a bit more expensive than the general store, but it's a great option if you want a hot meal or a more substantial snack.\n3. **Food Trucks**: During the peak season (June to August), there are usually food trucks parked near the Mammoth Hot Springs General Store. They offer a variety of food options, including burgers, tacos, and ice cream.\n\nKeep in mind that these options are subject to change, and it's always a good idea to check with the park's website or the Mammoth Hot Springs visitor center for up-to-date information on food services.\n\nIf you're planning to hike the Beaver Ponds Trail, I recommend packing your own lunch or snacks to bring with you. The trail is about 5 miles round trip, and it's always a good idea to have plenty of water and energy-rich snacks on hand. There are also picnic tables and restrooms near the trailhead, so you can enjoy your meal before or after your hike.\n\nEnjoy your hike on the Beaver Ponds Trail!",
