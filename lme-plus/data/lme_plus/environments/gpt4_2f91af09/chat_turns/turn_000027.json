  "content": "I don't have access to specific data or records on the lewisham council's efforts to address systemic environmental issues. however, here are some possible examples of how the council can address systemic issues and make real change on a larger scale:\n\n1. advocacy and coalition building: the council can use its position to advocate for systemic change at higher levels of government, collaborate with other councils and organizations to create a united front, and lobby businesses to adopt more sustainable policies.\n\n2. policy and regulatory changes: the council can take action to influence policy and regulatory changes at the local, national, and international levels. for example, the council can adopt sustainability policies that go beyond legal requirements and promote regulatory changes.\n\n3. green procurement: the council can use its purchasing power to support environmentally sustainable products and services. by procuring sustainable products, the council can promote the growth of sustainable markets, encouraging businesses to adopt more sustainable practices.\n\n4. education and community engagement: the council can educate and engage the community to raise awareness of systemic environmental issues and promote behavior change. for example, they can launch education campaigns on the impacts of climate change, encouraging individuals to make more sustainable choices.\n\nit is important to note that systemic and long-lasting environmental issues require a holistic and collaborative approach. while individual councils certainly can take action to address these issues, they need to work with other organizations, governments, and businesses to create large-scale, effective solutions.",
