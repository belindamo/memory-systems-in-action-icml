Working with natural light is an essential skill for portrait photographers, and it's great that you had the opportunity to learn from Rachel.\n\nUsing available light to create flattering portraits can be a game-changer. It's all about understanding how to position your subject, manipulate the light, and adjust your camera settings to capture the desired effect.\n\nHere are some additional tips to build upon what you learned from Rachel:\n\n1. **Golden hour**: Take advantage of the soft, warm light during the golden hour (just before sunset) to create stunning portraits with a warm, natural glow.\n2. **Open shade**: Look for open shade, especially during midday when the sun is high. This can help soften harsh shadows and create a more even lighting.\n3. **Backlight**: Experiment with backlighting to create a beautiful rim of light around your subject's hair and shoulders. This can add depth and dimension to your portraits.\n4. **Reflectors**: Use reflectors to bounce light onto your subject's face or body to fill in shadows and add highlights.\n5. **Cloudy days**: Don't be discouraged by overcast skies. Cloudy days can provide a soft, diffused light that's perfect for capturing portraits with minimal shadows and reflections.\n6. **Pay attention to direction**: Be mindful of the direction of the light source and how it affects your subject's face and body. Adjust your positioning and camera angle accordingly.\n7. **Experiment with angles**: Don't be afraid to experiment with different angles and perspectives to add variety to your portraits.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect. Keep working with natural light, and you'll develop an eye for spotting the best lighting conditions and adapting to different situations.\n\nWhat do you think is the most challenging part of working with natural light for portrait photography?",
