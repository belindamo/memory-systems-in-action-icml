  "content": "Setting up the trigger for a goal in Google Analytics can be a bit tricky, but I'll break it down for you.\n\n**Setting up a trigger for a form submission goal**\n\nTo track form submissions as a goal, you'll need to set up an event trigger in Google Analytics. You have two options:\n\n**Option 1: Using Google Tag Manager (GTM)**\n\nIf you have Google Tag Manager (GTM) set up on your website, you can create a trigger in GTM to send an event to Google Analytics when the form is submitted. Here's a high-level overview of the process:\n\n1. In GTM, create a new tag for Google Analytics (if you haven't already).\n2. Create a new trigger for the form submission event. You can use the \"Form Submission\" trigger type.\n3. Configure the trigger to fire when the form is submitted. You may need to specify the form's ID or class in the trigger settings.\n4. In the tag settings, enable the \"Send event\" option and specify the event category, action, and label (e.g., \"Form\", \"Submission\", \"Contact Form\").\n5. Publish the GTM container to update your website's tags.\n\n**Option 2: Using Google Analytics event tracking code**\n\nIf you don't have GTM set up, you can add a small piece of JavaScript code to your website's form submission handler. This code will send an event to Google Analytics when the form is submitted.\n\n1. In your Google Analytics account, go to the \"Admin\" section and select the property you want to track.\n2. Click on \"Tracking Info\" and then \"Event Tracking.\"\n3. Copy the event tracking code snippet provided by Google Analytics.\n4. Add the code to your website's form submission handler, typically in the \"onsubmit\" event or after the form submission is successful.\n5. Update the code with the event category, action, and label you want to track (e.g., \"Form\", \"Submission\", \"Contact Form\").\n\nHere's an example of the event tracking code:\n```javascript\nga('send', 'event', 'Form', 'Submission', 'Contact Form');\n```\n**No code changes required for Destination goals**\n\nIf you're setting up a Destination goal (e.g., tracking visits to a specific thank-you page), you don't need to add any code to your website. Simply specify the URL of the destination page in the goal setup, and Google Analytics will track visits to that page as conversions.\n\nI hope this helps!
