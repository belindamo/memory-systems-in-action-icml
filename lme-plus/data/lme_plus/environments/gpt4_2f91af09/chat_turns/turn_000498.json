I've been writing a lot lately, including short stories and poetry, and I'd like to keep track of my progress. By the way, I've also just started participating in a writing challenge on a social media platform, where we're given a prompt every week and have to write a short piece in response. Last week's prompt was \"forgotten memories\", and I wrote a piece titled \"The Smell of Old Books\".",
