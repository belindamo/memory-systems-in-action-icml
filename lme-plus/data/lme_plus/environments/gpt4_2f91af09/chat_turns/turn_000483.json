  "content": "In the story I created, Pyrrhos did not bear a grudge against the gods, but rather saw the events as a test of his faith and an opportunity to prove his worthiness. However, in a different story or interpretation, it's certainly possible that a character like Pyrrhos might feel anger or resentment toward the gods if they perceived the end of the world as an unfair or unjust punishment. Ultimately, it would depend on the specific beliefs and values of Pyrrhos's culture and religion.",
