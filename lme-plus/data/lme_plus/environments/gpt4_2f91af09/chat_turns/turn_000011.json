  "content": "When you make smaller cookies, they'll bake faster due to their smaller size and larger surface area. To ensure they don't overcook, you'll want to reduce the baking time.\n\nFor 1-inch diameter cookies, I'd recommend baking them for 12-14 minutes, or until they're lightly golden around the edges. Keep an eye on them after 10 minutes, as they can go from perfectly baked to overcooked quickly.\n\nHere are some general guidelines for adjusting baking time based on cookie size:\n\n* 1-inch diameter cookies: 12-14 minutes\n* 1.5-inch diameter cookies: 15-17 minutes\n* 2-inch diameter cookies: 18-20 minutes (as per the original recipe)\n\nRemember, these are just guidelines. The actual baking time will depend on your oven, the thickness of the cookies, and your personal preference for doneness. It's always better to err on the side of caution and check the cookies frequently to avoid overcooking.\n\nWhen you're checking for doneness, look for a light golden color around the edges and a firm, set surface. If you're unsure, it's always better to bake for a minute or two less and check again, rather than risking overcooking.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like any further guidance.",
