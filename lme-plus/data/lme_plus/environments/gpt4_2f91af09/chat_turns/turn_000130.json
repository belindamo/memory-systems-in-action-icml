  "content": "I was really struck by Amira's story, especially since it resonated with my own family's experiences. She told me about her family's journey from Casablanca to Paris, and eventually, to the United States. It's amazing to think about the similarities between our stories, despite being from different countries. I'm curious, can you tell me more about the experiences of Moroccan immigrants in Paris, and how it compares to their experiences in the US?",
