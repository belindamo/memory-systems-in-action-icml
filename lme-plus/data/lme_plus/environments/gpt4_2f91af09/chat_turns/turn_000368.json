Getting a new keyboard for your niece is a great way to encourage her to continue learning and enjoying music.\n\nBoth Yamaha and Casio are excellent brands for beginner keyboards, and I'd be happy to recommend some options. Before I do, I just want to clarify that you're looking for a keyboard, not a digital piano. Keyboards are more portable, lightweight, and often more affordable, while digital pianos tend to mimic the feel and sound of an acoustic piano.\n\nHere are some beginner-friendly options from Yamaha and Casio:\n\n**Yamaha:**\n\n1. **Yamaha PSR-E263**: A great starter keyboard with 61 full-sized keys, 400 built-in sounds, and 100 rhythms. It's compact, easy to use, and has a headphone jack for quiet practice. ($99)\n2. **Yamaha PSR-E363**: Similar to the E263, but with additional features like touch sensitivity, which allows for more expressive playing. ($149)\n\n**Casio:**\n\n1. **Casio SA-46**: A fun, compact keyboard with 32 mini keys, 100 tones, and 50 rhythms. It's perfect for little hands and includes a headphone jack. ($25)\n2. **Casio SA-76**: A step up from the SA-46, with 44 mini keys, 100 tones, and 50 rhythms. It's still compact and easy to use. ($40)\n3. **Casio LK-190**: A more advanced keyboard with 61 full-sized keys, 400 tones, and 150 rhythms. It also features a lighted keyboard to help with learning. ($129)\n\nAll of these options are great for beginners and are relatively affordable. If you're looking for more advanced features or a more authentic piano experience, you may want to consider higher-end models or digital pianos.\n\nBy the way, I'm glad you were able to get your guitar strings delivered within 5 days! Online shopping can be convenient, but it's always nice to receive your items quickly.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect keyboard for your niece!",
