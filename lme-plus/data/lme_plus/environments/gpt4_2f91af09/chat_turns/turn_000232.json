  "content": "I'm really interested in exploring more books that feature complex characters and explorations of memory and identity. Since I recently attended a book reading event at the local library where author Sarah Johnson read from her debut novel \"The Weight of Memory\", I'm curious about books that share similarities with her writing style. Can you recommend any books that combine these elements, particularly in terms of atmosphere and character development, and also feature magical realism or fantastical elements?",
