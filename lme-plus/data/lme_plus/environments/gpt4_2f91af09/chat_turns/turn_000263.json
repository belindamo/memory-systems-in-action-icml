  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot have an opinion or make predictions, but I can provide some context. Leibniz's political philosophy was indeed idealistic, and it is unlikely that his vision of a utopian society could be realistically achieved in its entirety. However, his ideas did influence later thinkers and political movements, and some of his concepts, such as the importance of reason and cooperation between nations, have been influential in the development of international relations and politics.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Leibniz's vision of a just and rational society was based on the belief that human beings were capable of understanding and living in accordance with the principles of reason and order. While this may be difficult to achieve on a large scale, it is possible for individuals and small groups to live according to these principles and work towards creating a better society through their actions.\n\nOverall, while Leibniz's idealistic vision of a utopian society may not be achievable in its entirety, his ideas continue to be influential and relevant in modern political thought.",
