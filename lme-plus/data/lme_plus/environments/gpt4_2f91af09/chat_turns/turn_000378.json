Here's why:\n\n1. **Introduce yourself**: A brief introduction can help the organizer know who you are, what you're looking for in a meetup, and what you can bring to the group.\n2. **Get a sense of the group**: By reaching out, you can get a better understanding of the group's dynamics, skill level, and what to expect from the meetups.\n3. **Ask questions**: You can ask about the group's focus (e.g., beginners, advanced, specific styles), the format of the meetups, and any other questions you might have.\n4. **Confirm details**: You can confirm the meetup details, such as the location, time, and any necessary equipment or materials.\n\nA simple message or email to the organizer can go a long way in making you feel more comfortable and prepared for the meetup. You can say something like:\n\n\"Hi [Organizer's Name], I'm interested in attending the ukulele meetup on [Date]. I'm a beginner/ intermediate player looking to learn and improve my skills. Could you tell me a bit more about the group and what to expect from the meetups? Also, is there anything I need to bring or prepare?\"\n\nAs for just showing up to a meeting, it's not recommended, especially if you're new to the group. You might feel lost or overwhelmed, and the organizer might not be prepared for new attendees. By reaching out beforehand, you can ensure a smoother and more enjoyable experience for both yourself and the group.\n\nRemember to be respectful of the organizer's time and the group's dynamics. If you do decide to reach out, be prepared to introduce yourself, be open-minded, and have fun!",
