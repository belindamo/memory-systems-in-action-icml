  "content": "The NCCAOM exam can be challenging, and the difficulty level may vary depending on the individual's prior education and training. The exam covers a broad range of topics related to acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture theory and techniques, herbal medicine, nutrition, and diagnostic skills. The exam consists of four parts: Foundations of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Acupuncture, Biomedicine, and Chinese Herbology. Each part is made up of multiple-choice questions and case studies. Candidates are given four hours to complete each part, and the total testing time ranges from 5-7 hours depending on the number of parts taken.\n\nMany students who have completed accredited master's or doctorate programs in acupuncture and Oriental medicine feel well-prepared for the exam after their education and clinical training. However, students may need to devote additional time and effort to studying and preparing for the exam, and many students find it helpful to take review courses or utilize study materials in order to prepare adequately.",
