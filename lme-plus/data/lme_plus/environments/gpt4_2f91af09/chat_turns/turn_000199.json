Use a high temperature: Roasting vegetables at a high temperature (around 400-450\u00b0F) will help them get crispy on the outside while staying tender on the inside. Make sure your oven is fully preheated before adding the vegetables. 2. Cut the vegetables into even pieces: Cutting your vegetables into evenly sized pieces will help them cook evenly and get crispy all over. 3. Dry the vegetables: Before roasting, make sure to pat the vegetables dry with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture. This will help them get crispy instead of steaming. 4. Use enough oil: Toss your vegetables with enough oil to lightly coat them. This will help the vegetables get crispy on the outside and prevent them from sticking to the pan. 5. Use a baking sheet with low sides: Using a baking sheet with low sides will allow the heat to circulate around the vegetables and help them get crispy all over. If you don\u2019t have a sheet pan, a cast iron skillet or a shallow roasting pan will also work. 6. Space the vegetables out: Make sure the vegetables are spaced out in a single layer on the baking sheet. This will prevent them from steaming and help them get crispy on all sides. 7. Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan: Overcrowding the pan can cause the vegetables to steam instead of roast. If you have too many vegetables, use two pans instead of one. I hope these tips help you achieve perfectly crispy roasted vegetables!",
