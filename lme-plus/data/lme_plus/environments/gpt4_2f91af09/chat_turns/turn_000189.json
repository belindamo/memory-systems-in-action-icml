Look for bread flour or pizza flour. 2. Let the dough rest: After kneading the dough, let it rest for at least an hour, or up to overnight. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to shape. 3. Keep the dough at room temperature: Cold dough is harder to stretch and shape. Make sure the dough is at room temperature before working with it. 4. Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go (usually around 500-550\u00b0F) and let it preheat for at least 30 minutes. This will ensure your crust gets crispy and bubbly. 5. Use a pizza stone or steel: Place a pizza stone or steel in the oven while it preheats. This will help your crust cook evenly and get crispy. 6. Don't overload your toppings: Too many toppings can weigh down your crust and make it soggy. Stick to a few toppings and a light layer of sauce. 7. Brush the crust with olive oil: Before putting it in the oven, brush the outer edge of your crust with olive oil. This will give it a nice golden crust. 8. Let it cool for a minute: After taking your pizza out of the oven, let it cool for a minute before cutting into it. This allows the cheese to set and makes it easier to slice. Hope these tips help you make the perfect pizza crust!",
