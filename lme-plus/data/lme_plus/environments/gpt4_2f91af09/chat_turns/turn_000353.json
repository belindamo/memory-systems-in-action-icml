  "content": "Excellent question!\n\nConsidering your recent progress with squats, I'd recommend a more structured approach to continue making gains. Here's a revised leg day plan for Fridays:\n\n**Friday (Legs and Shoulders):**\n\n1. Warm-up: 5-minute cardio (treadmill or elliptical)\n2. Squats:\n\t* Warm-up set: 1 set of 8-10 reps with a weight that's 10-15% lighter than your current 1RM (1-Rep Max)\n\t* Working sets: 3 sets of 6-8 reps with your current 1RM\n\t* Progressive overload: Aim to increase the weight by 2.5-5 pounds every two weeks, or as soon as you feel you can handle more\n3. Leg Press:\n\t* 3 sets of 10-12 reps\n4. Standing Military Press:\n\t* 3 sets of 8-12 reps\n5. Lateral Raises:\n\t* 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n6. HIIT Cardio: 20-30 minutes, following the same format as Monday\n7. Cool-down: 5-minute stretching\n\nFor squats, we'll focus on a strength-based approach, aiming to increase the weight you lift over time. With your recent progress, it's essential to continue challenging yourself to make further gains.\n\n**Rep Range and Sets:**\n\n* The 6-8 rep range is ideal for building strength and muscle mass. This range allows you to lift heavier weights while still completing the desired number of reps.\n* Three sets will help you build overall volume and fatigue in your legs, which is essential for growth and strength gains.\n\n**Progressive Overload:**\n\n* Increase the weight by 2.5-5 pounds every two weeks, or as soon as you feel you can handle more. This will continue to challenge your legs and promote strength gains.\n* If you're unable to increase the weight, focus on increasing the number of reps or sets. For example, if you're doing 3 sets of 6 reps, try to increase it to 3 sets of 7 reps.\n\nRemember to focus on proper form and technique throughout each exercise, and don't sacrifice form for heavier weights. With consistent effort and progressive overload, you'll continue to make gains and reach your goals.",
