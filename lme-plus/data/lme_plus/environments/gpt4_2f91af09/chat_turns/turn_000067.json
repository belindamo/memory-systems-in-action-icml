This approach can help you:\n\n1. **Make direct progress**: You'll be working directly on your writing project, making progress and moving forward.\n2. **Stay focused**: Without the distraction of writing prompts or exercises, you can maintain your focus on your writing project.\n\nHowever, if you're struggling to get started or feeling stuck, using writing prompts or exercises can be a helpful way to overcome these obstacles.\n\n**Ultimately, it's up to you:**\n\nExperiment with both approaches and see what works best for you.
