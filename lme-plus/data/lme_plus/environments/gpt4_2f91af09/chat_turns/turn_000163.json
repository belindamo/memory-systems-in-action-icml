Dressing them up with a nice top and heels is a fantastic way to create a stylish and chic outfit for a wedding. Here are some suggestions to consider:\n\n**Top Options:**\n\n1. **Blouse:** A silk or cotton blouse in a light, airy fabric will add a touch of elegance to your outfit. Look for one with some subtle details like ruffles, bell sleeves, or a soft pattern.\n2. **Peplum top:** A peplum top can add a playful, feminine touch to your outfit. Pair it with a fitted blazer or cardigan to balance out the volume.\n3. **Lace or crochet top:** A lace or crochet top can add a romantic, whimsical touch to your outfit. Pair it with a simpler bottom to avoid overwhelming the look.\n4. **Tailored button-down:** A crisp, white or light-colored button-down shirt can create a chic, sophisticated look when paired with heels and a statement necklace.\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n1. **Statement jewelry:** Add a bold, eye-catching necklace or earrings to elevate your outfit. Pearls, crystals, or metallic accents can add a touch of glamour.\n2. **Clutch or small bag:** A small, elegant clutch or crossbody bag can complement your outfit while keeping your hands free.\n3. **Heels:** Choose a pair of heels that complements the color and style of your top. Strappy sandals, pumps, or block heels can all work well.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Dress for the venue:** Consider the wedding venue and dress accordingly. If it's a more formal affair, you may want to opt for a more elegant top and heels. If it's a more casual outdoor wedding, you can get away with a more relaxed, yet still stylish, outfit.\n2. **Balance the look:** Make sure your top and heels are balanced in terms of volume and style. If your top is busy or voluminous, pair it with simpler heels. If your heels are bold, opt for a simpler top.\n3. **Consider the time of day:** If the wedding is during the day, you may want to opt for lighter colors and fabrics. If it's an evening wedding, you can go for darker, more dramatic colors and heavier fabrics.\n\nHere's an example outfit idea:\n\n* Black high-waisted jeans from Zara\n* A light blue silk blouse with subtle ruffles and a fitted silhouette\n* A pair of strappy heels in a neutral color (e.g., nude, black, or metallic)\n* A simple clutch or small crossbody bag in a neutral color\n* A statement necklace or earrings with pearls or crystals\n\nFeel free to mix and match these suggestions to create an outfit that makes you feel confident and stylish!",
