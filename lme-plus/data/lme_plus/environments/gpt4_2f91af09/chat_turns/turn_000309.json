Portrait photography is a fascinating genre, and attending a workshop in San Francisco must have been a fantastic opportunity to learn from experts and network with like-minded photographers.\n\nI'm curious, what did you learn about portrait photography during the workshop? Did you have a favorite instructor or a particular technique that resonated with you?\n\nAlso, since you've had your Nikon D750 since 2018, I'm assuming you've had a chance to explore its capabilities and features.
