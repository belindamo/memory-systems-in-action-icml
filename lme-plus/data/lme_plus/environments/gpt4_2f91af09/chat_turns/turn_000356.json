  "content": "Yes, that helps a lot! I think I understand how to estimate my 1RM and calculate the warm-up weight now. Just to confirm, for my squat warm-up set, I should do 1 set of 8-10 reps with a weight that's 10-15% lighter than my current 1RM, and then do 3 working sets with my current 1RM, correct? And I should aim to increase the weight by 2.5-5 pounds every two weeks, or as soon as I feel I can handle more.",
