  "content": "International trade played a significant role in exacerbating the effects of the Great Depression by intensifying the economic interdependency between nations. The primary factor was the imposition of trade barriers, such as tariffs and import quotas, by many countries in an effort to protect their domestic industries and reduce imports. These barriers reduced the flow of goods and services, which led to a decrease in export revenue and ultimately contributed to global economic contraction.\n\nMoreover, many nations engaged in competitive devaluations of their currencies, which worsened the depression. Devaluation reduced the foreign price of a nation's exports, making them more competitive in international markets, but it also increased the cost of imports, fueling inflation and reducing the purchasing power of consumers. This led to an overall reduction in world trade and further contraction of the global economy.\n\nAdditionally, the Great Depression led to rising nationalism and protectionism, which made international trade more difficult. The rise of authoritarian regimes in Europe saw the adoption of autarkic policies, which resulted in reduced trade and further slowed down global economic recovery. Overall, international trade aggravated the effects of the Great Depression by reducing economic cooperation between nations and resulting in a prolonged economic downturn.",
