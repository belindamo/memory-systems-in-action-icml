Let's calculate your daily calorie needs based on your goals and activity level.\n\n**Daily Calorie Needs:**\n\nTo support muscle growth and weight loss, you'll need to ensure you're consuming enough calories to fuel your workouts and daily activities. A safe and sustainable rate of weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week, which requires a calorie deficit of 500-1000 calories per day.\n\nBased on your height, weight, and activity level, here's an estimate of your daily calorie needs:\n\n* Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR): 1,987 calories (based on your height and weight)\n* Daily Activity Level: Moderate (3-5 days of moderate-intensity exercise per week) = 1.55 multiplier\n* Daily Calorie Needs: BMR x Daily Activity Level = 1,987 x 1.55 = 3,081 calories\n\nTo support muscle growth and weight loss, I recommend a daily calorie intake of:\n\n* 3,500-4,000 calories per day, with a macronutrient breakdown of:\n\t+ Protein: 1.6-2 grams per kilogram of body weight (so, around 120-140 grams for you)\n\t+ Carbohydrates: 2-3 grams per kilogram of body weight (so, around 160-200 grams for you)\n\t+ Fat: 0.5-1 gram per kilogram of body weight (so, around 40-50 grams for you)\n\n**Meal Frequency and Timing:**\n\nAim to eat 5-6 meals per day, spaced out every 2-3 hours, to keep your muscles fueled and support muscle growth. This includes 3 main meals, 2-3 snacks, and 1 post-workout shake or meal.\n\n**Example Meal Plan:**\n\nHere's an example meal plan to help you get started:\n\n* Breakfast: 3 whole eggs, 2 egg whites, 2 slices of whole wheat toast, and a banana (400 calories, 30g protein)\n* Snack: Greek yogurt with berries and almonds (200 calories, 20g protein)\n* Lunch: Grilled chicken breast, brown rice, and steamed vegetables (500 calories, 40g protein)\n* Snack: Apple slices with peanut butter (150 calories, 8g protein)\n* Pre-Workout: Banana with almond butter and honey (200 calories, 8g protein)\n* Post-Workout: Protein shake with whey protein, banana, and almond milk (300 calories, 30g protein)\n* Dinner: Grilled salmon, sweet potato, and steamed broccoli (500 calories, 40g protein)\n* Snack (optional): Cottage cheese with cucumber slices (150 calories, 20g protein)\n\nRemember, this is just an example meal plan, and you should adjust the portion sizes and food choices based on your personal preferences and dietary needs.\n\n**Tracking Progress:**\n\nMonitor your weight, body fat percentage, and measurements regularly to track your progress. Adjust your calorie intake and macronutrient ratios as needed to achieve your goals.\n\nHow does this sound? Are you ready to take your nutrition to the next level and support your workout routine?",
