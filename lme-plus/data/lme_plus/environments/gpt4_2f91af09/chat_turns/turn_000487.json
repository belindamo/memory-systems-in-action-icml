  "content": "In the story, Pyrrhos may have obeyed the gods because he believed in their power and authority, and he may have believed that their will should be followed. Additionally, Pyrrhos may have recognized that disobeying the gods could have dire consequences for him, his family, and his world, and so he may have chosen to obey in order to protect them. It's also possible that Pyrrhos may have felt a sense of devotion and gratitude towards the gods, and wanted to honor and please them through his actions. Ultimately, the exact reasons for Pyrrhos's obedience may depend on the specific details of the story and his character.",
