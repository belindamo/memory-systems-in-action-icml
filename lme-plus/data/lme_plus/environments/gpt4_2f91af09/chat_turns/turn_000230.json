  "content": "I'd like to explore more books that feature atmospheric settings, complex characters, and explorations of memory and identity. Since I recently attended a book reading event at the local library where author Sarah Johnson read from her debut novel \"The Weight of Memory\", I'm curious about books that share similarities with her writing style. Can you recommend any books that combine these elements, particularly in terms of atmosphere and character development?",
