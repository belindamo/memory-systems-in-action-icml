DJs typically perform live at parties, clubs, and other events, and may also produce and release their own music.\n\nDJing has a long history, dating back to the early days of radio broadcasting and dance clubs in the 1920s and 1930s. Today, DJing has become a popular hobby and profession, with many people learning to DJ and producing their own music. If you're interested in DJing, there are many resources available online and in-person that can help you get started."
