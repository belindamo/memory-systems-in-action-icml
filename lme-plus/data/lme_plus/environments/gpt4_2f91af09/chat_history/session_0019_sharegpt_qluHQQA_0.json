I seek to explore this tension in my work, often using organic forms and intricate patterns to create a sense of both movement and stability. My goal is to invite the viewer to engage with my pieces on a deeper level, to consider the ways in which these opposing forces exist within us and the world around us. Through my art, I hope to inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity, encouraging the audience to look beyond the surface and discover the hidden beauty and meaning within."
