  "content": "Yes, there are several pieces of music written just for string quartet that feature the \"Dies Irae\" melody. One example is the String Quartet No. 8 in C minor, Op. 110 by Dmitri Shostakovich, which incorporates the \"Dies Irae\" melody in the second movement. Another example is the String Quartet No. 14 in D minor, D. 810, also known as \"Death and the Maiden,\" by Franz Schubert. While it does not feature the \"Dies Irae\" melody explicitly, the quartet's second movement is based on Schubert's song \"Death and the Maiden,\" which shares a similar theme of death and mortality.",
