Based on this information, we have initiated the design of systems that are specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of your business.\nOur approach remains holistic and aims to encompass the entire organization, with the goal of prioritizing and sequencing the necessary changes. This will ensure that the final systems implemented are effective and efficient, meeting the needs of all teams and workflows.\nOur next step is to focus on prototyping system changes for the creative teams, which will allow us to test and refine the changes before rolling them out to other teams and workflows. An iterative approach is key, and we will continue to codify workflows and design systems around each team, as outlined in previous discussions. Additionally, we will make recommendations for consistent terminology throughout the platform to eliminate confusion and ease the adaptation process for your employees.\nWe are confident that this process will result in systems that are tailored to meet the specific needs of each team and workflow. Next week, we will provide a visual map that aligns expectations, designs, and timelines for 7Ave's review.\nWhile we understand that the process of adapting the Teamwork platform takes time and patience, rest assured that we are working diligently to lay a solid foundation for the systems we are implementing. Although the immediate benefits may not be immediately apparent, we are confident that the end result will be worth the wait. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Your cooperation and understanding is greatly appreciated.\"",
