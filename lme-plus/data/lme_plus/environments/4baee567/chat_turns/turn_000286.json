  "content": "One of Bob Dylan's later songs that was heavily influenced by \"Blowin' in the Wind\" is \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", which was released in 1964. Like \"Blowin' in the Wind\", the song became an anthem for social change and was embraced by the civil rights movement. The lyrics are filled with powerful imagery and call for a new era of social justice and equality. The melody is similarly simple, with a repetitive chord progression that emphasizes the urgency and gravity of the lyrics. \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\" showcases how Dylan continued to draw inspiration from the themes and styles of his earlier songs, while also pushing the boundaries of his craft.",
