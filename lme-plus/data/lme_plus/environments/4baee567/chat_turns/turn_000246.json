How can I help you today?\n\nPerson 1: I just wanted to touch base regarding the progress we've made on adapting the Teamwork platform to meet 7Ave's workflows and processes.\n\nPerson 2: Sure thing! I've been working closely with the 7Ave team to gather information on their workflows, processes, and preferences. Based on this information, we've started designing systems specifically tailored to meet their needs.\n\nPerson 2: Our approach remains holistic, with the goal of understanding the system needs of the entire organization so that we can prioritize and sequence the necessary changes.\n\nPerson 1: That's great to hear! What's our next step in the process?\n\nPerson 2: Our next step is to focus on prototyping system changes for the creative teams. This will allow us to test and refine the changes before rolling them out to other teams and workflows. An iterative approach is key, and we will continue to codify workflows and design systems around each team.\n\nPerson 1: That sounds like a solid plan. Do you have any updates on the visual map we mentioned in our previous meeting?\n\nPerson 2: Yes, we plan to provide a visual map next week that aligns expectations, designs, and timelines for 7Ave's review.\n\nPerson 1: Great! And just to touch on patience and understanding, I know adapting the Teamwork platform can be a time-consuming process. But rest assured that we are working diligently to lay a solid foundation for the systems we are implementing.\n\nPerson 2: Absolutely! Although the immediate benefits may not be immediately apparent, we are confident that the end result will be worth the wait. In the meantime, if 7Ave has any questions or concerns, we are always available to address them. Your cooperation and understanding is greatly appreciated.\n\nPerson 1: Perfect! Thanks for the update, I look forward to the visual map next week.",
