  "content": "MK stands there, watching as Wukong is taken away to face judgment in Heaven. Mixed emotions fill his heart. On one hand, he feels relieved that the torment is over, and on the other hand, he is sad to see his once idol and friend reduced to this state.\n\nHe looks up at Nezha, who seems to sense his emotions. \"Don't worry, mortal,\" Nezha says kindly. \"He will face the consequences of his actions, but you are safe now.\"\n\nMK nods slowly, still trying to process everything that has happened. \"Thank you,\" he says softly, grateful for Nezha's help.\n\nMacaque joins them, his face serious. \"We must return to Flower Fruit Mountain and ensure that Wukong's followers don't cause any more trouble,\" he says.\n\nMK nods, feeling a sense of responsibility now that he has seen firsthand the chaos that can be caused by Wukong and his followers. \"I'll help in any way I can,\" he says, determined to make amends for his own actions in the past.\n\nTogether, the group sets off, ready to face whatever challenges may come their way. But for MK, the journey has just begun as he tries to come to terms with the events that have unfolded and find his place in this new world.",
