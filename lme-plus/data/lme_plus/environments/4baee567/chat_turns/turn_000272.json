In a 2018 article titled \"The Future of the Middle East,\" journalist Michael T. Klare argues that the region is being redrawn by a growing struggle for power and influence between Saudi Arabia and Iran. He also notes the rising influence of Russia and China in the region, and the ways in which the Trump administration's policies are exacerbating tensions.\n\n2. The Nation has also covered the impact of globalization on Latin America, particularly in terms of trade agreements like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In a 2016 article titled \"The TPP, the Left, and Latin America,\" journalist Laura Carlsen argues that these agreements have led to lower wages, weakened labor protections, and environmental degradation in the region. She also notes that the TPP would have strengthened corporate power and undermined democracy.\n\n3. In a 2019 article titled \"Africa's Digital Revolution,\" journalist Addis Ababa looks at the ways in which technology is transforming the continent, from mobile banking to e-commerce. She argues that Africa is leapfrogging over traditional development models and creating new industries and opportunities. However, she also notes that this digital revolution is exacerbating inequality and leaving many behind.\n\nOverall, The Nation has covered the complexities of globalization and shifting geopolitical dynamics in a variety of regions and countries, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges that arise from these changes.",
