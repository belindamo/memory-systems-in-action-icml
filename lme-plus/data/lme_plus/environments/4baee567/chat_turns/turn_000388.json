  "content": "The Buffalo Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals are two teams that are part of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL).\n\nAs of my knowledge cut-off in 2021, The Buffalo Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals have played each other 25 times since their first meeting in 1968. The Bills have won 13 games, while the Bengals have won 12 games.\n\nIn terms of games played at New Era Field, which is the home stadium of the Buffalo Bills, the two teams have played 11 games. The Bills have won 7 games, while the Bengals have won 4 games.\nI don't have information on the specific margin of victory for each of those games, but the Bills have a good record when they host the Bengals at their home stadium.\nIt is worth mentioning that these statistics are based on regular season games only, not including playoffs games.\nKeep in mind that my knowledge cut-off is 2021, and these statistics may have changed since then.",
