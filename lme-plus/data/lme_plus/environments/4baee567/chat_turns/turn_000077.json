  "content": "Nezha nods in agreement and turns his chariot towards the city. As they fly over the rooftops, he asks MK about Pigsy and how he came to be with Wukong.\n\nMK tells Nezha about how he had been kidnapped by Wukong and taken to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, where he was put in the alcove cage. He explains how Macaque had helped him escape and how they had been hiding out at Pigsy's noodle shop ever since.\n\nNezha listens intently, his expression grave. \"I'm sorry you had to go through that,\" he says. \"But I'm glad you're safe now.\"\n\nAs they approach the noodle shop, Nezha gently sets the chariot down in the street. MK hops out and runs inside. Pigsy is there, cooking noodles as usual. When he sees MK, he drops his ladle and runs over to give him a big hug.\n\n\"Thank goodness you're safe!\" Pigsy says, tears in his eyes. \"I was so worried about you.\"\n\nMK tells Pigsy about everything that happened, about how Macaque had saved him and how Nezha had helped them. Pigsy listens in amazement, his eyes widening with each new detail.\n\nNezha steps inside the shop and nods at Pigsy. \"I'm glad to see you're both doing well,\" he says.\n\nPigsy looks at Nezha with a mixture of fear and awe. \"Thank you for everything you've done,\" he says. \"I don't know how to repay you.\"\n\nNezha smiles. \"You don't need to repay me. I did what I did because it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nPigsy nods, still looking a bit overwhelmed. \"I understand. Thank you again.\"\n\nMK looks up at Nezha, his eyes shining. \"Thank you for bringing me home,\" he says.\n\nNezha ruffles MK's hair affectionately. \"Of course. Take care of yourself, okay?\"\n\nWith that, Nezha steps back into his chariot and takes off into the sky. Pigsy and MK watch him go, their hearts filled with gratitude and wonder at the amazing events that had just transpired.",
