  "content": "As Nezha finishes repairing the diamond snare, Wukong suddenly appears out of nowhere and attacks the chariot. He grabs onto the side and starts climbing up, using his staff to smash through the protective barriers that surround it.\n\nNezha reacts quickly, summoning his own weapon, the Red Armillary Sash. He wraps it around Wukong's neck and tries to pull him off the chariot, but the Monkey King is too strong and manages to break free.\n\nMacaque joins the fray, launching himself at Wukong from the other side of the chariot. The two monkeys grapple with each other in midair, their fists and feet flying as they try to gain the upper hand.\n\nMK watches in amazement as the chariot sways back and forth, buffeted by the force of their blows. He realizes that Wukong is still after him and wonders if he'll ever be safe from the vengeful monkey.\n\nNezha, seeing that the situation is getting out of control, decides to take drastic action. He whispers a few words to his sash and it begins to glow with an intense red light.\n\nWukong, still locked in combat with Macaque, doesn't notice until it's too late. The sash suddenly expands, enveloping him in a fiery cocoon that traps him in midair.\n\nMacaque and Nezha release their holds on Wukong, and he falls from the sky, the sash still wrapped around him like a snake. The chariot steadies itself and continues on its way, leaving the fallen Monkey King far behind.\n\nMK breathes a sigh of relief, grateful that he's out of harm's way. But he knows that this is only the beginning, and that there are still many dangers and challenges ahead.",
