  "content": "Thank you for the clarification. The description you provided could possibly match the \"Danse Macabre\" (Dance of Death), a piece for solo violin and orchestra composed by French composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns in 1874. The work includes the \"devil's interval\" and features a melody that imitates death's dance with skeletons. The piece also includes a section in which the violin simulates the sound of death knocking on the door, as you described. Does that sound like the piece you are thinking of?",
