  "content": "I think I'll set up a few stations, like the flower crown station and the vintage garden games, and also have a few lawn games like croquet and bocce ball. I'll also create a scavenger hunt list with items for guests to find in the garden. I like the idea of having a tea leaf reader, too - that will add a nice touch of whimsy to the party. And, of course, I'll have a photobooth set up with props like flowers, hats, and parasols. That will be a lot of fun!",
