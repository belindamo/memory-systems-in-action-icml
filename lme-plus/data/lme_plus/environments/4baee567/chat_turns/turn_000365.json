Chris hit the ground running and quickly became one of the most productive members of Yoshi. His contributions to Classes (RIP) and Late Cancellations updates have been invaluable, and his ability to learn new technologies and take on challenging tasks has made him a valuable asset to our team. We are so grateful to have Chris on our team and look forward to continuing to work with him in the future. Great job, Chris!\n\nCan we try to make it shorter and snappier.",
