  "content": "The \"Danse Macabre\" by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns has been arranged and transcribed for various instrumental combinations, including for solo violin and piano, violin and orchestra, and for multiple violins. However, the original version is a tone poem for orchestra, which features a solo violin part as well as other solo instruments. The piece has also been adapted for other settings, such as chamber music and ballet. It's possible that one of these arrangements or adaptations is the version you heard.",
