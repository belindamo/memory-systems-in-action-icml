He didn't really have anything he wanted except to go home to Pigsy. \"Can I go home?\" he asked quietly. \"To my friend, Pigsy?\"\n\nNezha's expression softened. \"Of course,\" he replied. \"I will take you to him.\"\n\nMK's face lit up with gratitude. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"Thank you so much.\"\n\nNezha nodded, gesturing for MK to climb aboard his chariot once more. \"We will leave immediately,\" he said, and with a flick of his wrist, the chariot lifted off the ground.\n\nAs they soared through the air, Nezha turned to MK. \"I must admit, I'm surprised,\" he said. \"I would have thought you would want something more... substantial, after all you've been through.\"\n\nMK shook his head. \"All I ever really wanted was to go home,\" he said. \"And to see Pigsy again.\"\n\nNezha smiled. \"I understand,\" he said. \"And I admire your loyalty to your friend.\"\n\nThey flew in silence for a while longer, the wind whipping through their hair. Finally, Nezha pointed ahead. \"Look,\" he said. \"There is your home.\"\n\nMK looked down and saw the familiar landscape of Flower Fruit Mountain. He couldn't believe he was finally going home. \"Thank you so much,\" he said to Nezha. \"You don't know what this means to me.\"\n\nNezha just smiled. \"I am happy to have been of service,\" he said. \"Now go, mortal. Your friend awaits.\"\n\nWith that, Nezha landed the chariot and helped MK down. MK turned and waved goodbye to Nezha, then ran down the path to Pigsy's house, his heart full of gratitude and relief.",
