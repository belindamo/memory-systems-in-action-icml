Here are some tips to help you keep it in pristine condition:\n\n1. **UV Protection**: Direct sunlight can cause the autograph to fade or become discolored over time. Place the display case away from direct sunlight or use UV-filtering glass or acrylic to minimize exposure.\n2. **Temperature Control**: Extreme temperatures (above 70\u00b0F or below 50\u00b0F) can cause the football to deteriorate. Keep your man cave at a consistent, moderate temperature between 60\u00b0F to 70\u00b0F (15\u00b0C to 21\u00b0C).\n3. **Humidity Control**: High humidity can lead to mold, mildew, or warping of the football. Maintain a relative humidity of 40-50% in your man cave. You can use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity level.\n4. **Dust Protection**: Dust can accumulate on the football and autograph, causing damage over time. Use a soft, dry cloth to gently dust the display case regularly. Avoid using chemical cleaners or polishes, as they can damage the football's surface.\n5. **Handling**: Handle the football with clean, dry hands. Avoid touching the autograph or the surface of the football as oils from your skin can damage the signature. If you must handle the football, wear gloves to prevent oils from transferring.\n6. **Display Case Maintenance**: Regularly clean the display case with a soft cloth and mild soap solution. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can scratch the glass or acrylic.\n7. **Avoid Direct Contact**: Keep the football away from direct contact with the display case's walls or shelves. Use foam inserts or risers to create a buffer zone and prevent scratching or pressure marks.\n8. **Authentication**: Consider getting your autograph authenticated by a reputable company like Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) or James Spence Authentication (JSA). This will increase the value and authenticity of your signed football.\n9. **Storage**: If you need to store the football, use a sturdy, acid-free storage box specifically designed for footballs. Place the box in a cool, dry location, away from direct sunlight.\n10. **Insurance**: Consider insuring your signed football against damage, loss, or theft. This will provide financial protection and peace of mind.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your signed Aaron Rodgers football for years to come, while preserving its value and condition.",
