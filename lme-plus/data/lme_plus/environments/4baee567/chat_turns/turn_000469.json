  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have first-hand experience, but based on my training data, here are some common challenges that Best Way engineers face when troubleshooting product issues:\n\n1. Lack of information: It can be challenging for engineers to troubleshoot product issues when they don't have enough information about the problem.\n\n2. Complexity of the product: Best Way engineers may face challenges when trying to troubleshoot highly complex products that involve multiple components and processes.\n\n3. Limited access to data sources: Troubleshooting product issues requires access to data sources, such as logs, reports, and testing results. Engineers may face challenges accessing this information or interpreting the data.\n\n4. Time constraints: There may be time constraints when troubleshooting product issues, especially if the product is critical or has a short production cycle.\n\n5. Unforeseen issues: Engineers may face challenges when they encounter issues that they have not encountered before or that are not documented. \n\n6. Customer satisfaction: Engineers need to consider the impact of product issues on customer satisfaction, which can make troubleshooting more complex.\n\n7. Technical knowledge: Engineers need to have in-depth technical knowledge of the product they are troubleshooting, which may require constant learning and updates to stay current.",
