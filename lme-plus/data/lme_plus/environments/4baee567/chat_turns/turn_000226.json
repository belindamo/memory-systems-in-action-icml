  "content": "Local phrases in Northern Ireland have the power to unite people across the country, according to Dr. Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University. The use of slang and colloquialisms is important to those from Northern Ireland, and it often varies depending on the location within the country. Slang is an integral part of language, and it has the ability to transcend distinctions of high and low culture, says writer Gail McConnell. The use of local language in popular culture, such as in TV shows like Derry Girls and Line of Duty, also helps to create a sense of community and familiarity. The power of language in Northern Ireland is such that even hearing a phrase or term from home while on holiday can evoke a strong sense of place and belonging. While the use of slang can be a source of comedy and entertainment, it has also been politicised by the face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots. Despite this, the varied language of Northern Ireland remains a rich legacy of the country and an important part of its identity.",
