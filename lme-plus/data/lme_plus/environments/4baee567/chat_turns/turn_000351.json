  "content": "I'm looking forward to discussing these topics with Dr. Smith and getting her input on how to better manage my anxiety at night. I think it would be really helpful to explore some additional relaxation techniques and strategies for winding down before bed. Maybe we can also discuss some ways to make my sleep environment more conducive to relaxation, like using a white noise machine or blackout curtains. I'm also curious to learn more about mindfulness and self-compassion and how they can help me cope with anxiety.",
