  "content": "I really like the idea of mixing and matching materials, and incorporating vintage decor to give the party a more personal touch. For the flowers, I think peonies and roses would be beautiful, and I love the idea of using sweet peas to add a fragrant and charming touch to the garden. Can you give me some ideas for vintage-inspired food and drinks that would fit well with this theme?",
