Based on this information, we have started to design systems that are specifically tailored to meet the needs of your business. \n\nOur approach remains holistic, with the goal of understanding the system needs of the entire organization so that we can prioritize and sequence the changes we make.\n\nOur next step is to focus on prototyping system changes for the creative teams. This will allow us to test and refine the changes to make sure they meet your requirements before we move on to other teams and workflows. This process will ensure that the final systems we implement are effective and efficient, meeting the needs of the entire organization.\n\nAn iterative approach is key so that as we roll out more changes the results will be of consistent quality. \n\nIn addition, we will continue to codify workflows and design systems around each team as outlined below. This will ensure that the final systems we implement are tailored to meet the specific needs of each team and workflow.\n\nWe plan to also make recommendations for consistent terminology throughout the platform as to eliminate confusion and make it easier for employees to adapt. \n\nNext week we will provide a visual map for 7Ave to align expectations, design, and timelines\n\nWe understand that the process of adapting the Teamwork platform to meet your needs takes time and patience. Rest assured, we are working diligently to lay a strong foundation for the systems we are implementing. Although the immediate benefits may not be immediately apparent, we are confident that the end result will be worth the wait. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Your cooperation and understanding is greatly appreciated.\n\"",
