  "content": "I remain neutral on this topic, but i can provide you with some information. while the global trade environment is currently challenging and uncertain, there are some recent positive developments. for example, the united states and china recently signed a phase one trade deal, which could potentially reduce tensions between the two largest economies in the world. additionally, countries such as canada, mexico, and the european union have been exploring free trade agreements with each other, which could help to reduce the impact of protectionist policies. these developments suggest that there is a willingness among some countries to work towards more stable and predictable global trade. however, it's essential to note that it will take much more work and cooperation between nations to establish a more stable and sustainable global trade environment.",
