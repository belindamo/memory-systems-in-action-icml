  "content": "Safety razors are a fantastic option for a close, comfortable shave while reducing waste.\n\nAs for finding safety razors at Home Depot, I'm afraid they might not carry them. Home Depot is primarily a home improvement store, and their focus is on tools, building materials, and home decor. They might not typically carry personal care items like safety razors.\n\nHowever, you can find safety razors at various online retailers, such as:\n\n1. Amazon: Offers a wide selection of safety razors from various brands, with customer reviews and fast shipping.\n2. West Coast Shaving: A specialty online retailer that focuses on traditional wet shaving products, including safety razors.\n3. The Art of Shaving: A high-end grooming brand that offers a range of safety razors and shaving accessories.\n4. Walmart: Some Walmart stores may carry safety razors, but the selection might be limited. You can also check their website.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Home Depot for that toilet paper holder, you might want to check out their online catalog or website to see if they have any sales or discounts on the item you're looking for. Maybe you can even find a toilet paper holder with a clever design that'll keep the roll in place!\n\nWhen you're ready to purchase a safety razor, make sure to choose one that suits your needs and budget. You might also want to consider buying a starter kit, which usually includes the razor, blades, and a shaving brush.\n\nDo you have any other questions about safety razors or traditional wet shaving? I'm here to help!",
