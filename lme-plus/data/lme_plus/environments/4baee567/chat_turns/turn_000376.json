  "content": "Negatively geared and positively geared properties refer to the cash flow of a rental property. A negatively geared property is one where the rental income is less than the expenses, such as mortgage payments, property management fees, and maintenance costs. This means that the owner of a negatively geared property is effectively subsidizing their rental income with their own money.\n\nA positively geared property, on the other hand, is one where the rental income exceeds the expenses, providing a positive cash flow for the owner.\n\nThe value of a property is generally determined by the real estate market conditions, the location of the property, the quality of the property, and the level of demand for rental properties in that area. In Australia, positively geared properties are considered more valuable than negatively geared properties, because they provide a steady and reliable income stream and are less risky for the owner. However, it also depends on the investor's strategy and goals. Some investors prefer negatively geared properties because they can claim the losses as tax deductions and the potential capital growth in the long run.",
