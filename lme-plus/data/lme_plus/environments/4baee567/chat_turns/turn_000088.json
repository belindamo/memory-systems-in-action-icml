You can try adding some debugging output to the script to see if it is successfully sending the request and receiving a response from the API. You can also check the SparkPost API logs to see if there are any error messages related to the requests being sent from your script.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that the SparkPost API key you're using is valid and has the necessary permissions to send emails.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, feel free to provide more information about the issue you're experiencing and I can try to help further.",
