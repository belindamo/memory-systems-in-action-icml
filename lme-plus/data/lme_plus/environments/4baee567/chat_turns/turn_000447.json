Here are some soundbars that should fit your needs:\n\n1. **Yamaha YAS-209 Soundbar**: As I mentioned earlier, this is a great mid-range option with excellent sound quality, clear dialogue, and decent bass. It's a 2.1 channel system with a wireless subwoofer, and it's compact enough to fit under most TVs. It also has built-in Alexa support, so you can control it with voice commands. ($250)\n2. **Polk Command Bar**: This soundbar is a great option if you want a system that's specifically designed for voice clarity. It's a 2.1 channel system with a wireless subwoofer, and it has a dedicated center channel speaker for clear dialogue. It also has built-in Alexa support and a sleek, compact design. ($250)\n3. **JBL Bar 3.1**: This soundbar is a great option if you want a system with a bit more oomph. It's a 3.1 channel system with a wireless subwoofer, and it's designed to produce more bass than some of the other options in this price range. It also has a sleek, compact design and supports Bluetooth connectivity. ($250)\n4. **Samsung HW-R450 Soundbar**: This soundbar is a great option if you want a system that's specifically designed to work with Samsung TVs (like yours!). It's a 2.1 channel system with a wireless subwoofer, and it has a sleek, compact design that's easy to set up. It also supports Bluetooth connectivity and has a built-in USB port for playing music from a flash drive. ($230)\n\nAll of these options should provide great sound quality and fit your budget. If you want to prioritize voice clarity, the Polk Command Bar might be the way to go. If you want a system with a bit more bass, the JBL Bar 3.1 might be the way to go. If you want a system that's specifically designed to work with your Samsung TV, the Samsung HW-R450 might be the way to go.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more recommendations!",
