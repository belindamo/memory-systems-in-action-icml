  "content": "I think those self-care suggestions are really helpful. I've been trying to prioritize my well-being, especially since I had that panic attack in the middle of the night a while back, which was really scary and left me feeling shaken. I've been making an effort to take care of myself, but it's good to be reminded of the importance of self-care when working on a big project like this. I think I'll try to schedule self-care into my daily routine, like taking short breaks to stretch or practice deep breathing exercises. And I'll also try to prioritize sleep and exercise, as I know those are important for my overall well-being.",
