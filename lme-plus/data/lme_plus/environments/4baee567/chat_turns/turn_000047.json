It's great to hear that you're focusing on protein-rich foods to support your muscle growth and recovery.\n\nProtein is an essential nutrient for muscle growth and repair, and consuming adequate amounts after your strength training sessions can help promote muscle protein synthesis. Aim to consume 15-20 grams of protein within 30-60 minutes after your workout, and then again at your next meal.\n\nSome high-protein foods that you might find helpful include:\n\n* Lean meats: chicken, turkey, lean beef, pork tenderloin\n* Fish and seafood: salmon, tilapia, shrimp, cod\n* Eggs and dairy: eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese\n* Legumes: lentils, chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans\n* Nuts and seeds: almonds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, protein powder\n\nIn addition to protein, don't forget to also focus on complex carbohydrates and healthy fats to support your overall nutrition and recovery.\n\nIt's also great to hear that you're making progress on the leg press machine! Three sets is a great achievement, and I'm sure you'll continue to see improvements as you stick to your training routine. Keep pushing yourself and celebrating your small wins!",
