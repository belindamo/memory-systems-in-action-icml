  "content": "The Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants are two teams that are part of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL).\n\nAs of my knowledge cut-off in 2021, The Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants have played each other 149 times since their first meeting in 1933. The Eagles have won 72 games, while the Giants have won 76 games.\n\nIn terms of games played at Lincoln Financial Field, which is the home stadium of the Philadelphia Eagles, the two teams have played 17 games. The Eagles have won 12 games, while the Giants have won 5 games.\nI don't have information on the specific margin of victory for each of those games, but the Eagles have a good record when they host the Giants at their home stadium.\nIt is worth mentioning that these statistics are based on regular season games only, not including playoffs games.\nKeep in mind that my knowledge cut-off is 2021, and these statistics may have changed since then.",
