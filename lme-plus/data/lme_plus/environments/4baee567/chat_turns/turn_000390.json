  "content": "The San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys are two teams that are part of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL).\n\nAs of my knowledge cut-off in 2021, The San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys have played each other 28 times since their first meeting in 1970. The 49ers have won 17 games, while the Cowboys have won 11 games.\n\nIn terms of games played at Levi's Stadium, which is the home stadium of the San Francisco 49ers, the two teams have played 2 games. The 49ers have won 1 game, while the Cowboys have won 1 game.\nI don't have information on the specific margin of victory for each of those games, but the 49ers and the Cowboys have a tied record when the 49ers host the cowboys at their home stadium.\nIt is worth mentioning that these statistics are based on regular season games only, not including playoffs games.\nKeep in mind that my knowledge cut-off is 2021, and these statistics may have changed since then.",
