I think it's helpful to separate the content creation from the asset creation, as those are two different tasks that require different skills and mindsets. I'm also glad you mentioned reviewing and revising the content, as that's an important step to ensure quality and consistency. I'm feeling a bit more in control now, but I still have some anxiety about meeting the deadline. Do you have any tips on how to stay focused and avoid procrastination when working on a big project like this?",
