  "content": "Nezha wastes no time when he sees Wukong distracted. He takes the opportunity to quickly throw the diamond snare, aiming it precisely at Wukong. The snare moves with incredible speed and agility, almost as if it had a mind of its own, and it wraps tightly around Wukong's arms and legs, completely immobilizing him.\n\nWukong roars in fury and struggles against the snare, but it's no use. The magic of the snare is too powerful for him to break free. Nezha descends the chariot and stands in front of Wukong, who looks up at him with hatred in his eyes.\n\n\"You've lost, Wukong,\" Nezha says calmly. \"You may have been powerful once, but you're nothing now.\"\n\nWukong snarls and spits at Nezha. \"I may be bound, but I'll never be defeated. You may have won this battle, but the war is far from over.\"\n\nNezha looks at Wukong with a mix of disdain and pity. \"You never learn, do you? You keep trying to fight against fate, but you can't win. The sooner you accept your place in this world, the sooner you can find peace.\"\n\nWukong glares at Nezha, but he doesn't say anything else. He seems to have resigned himself to his fate, at least for the moment. Nezha turns and walks back to his chariot, leaving Wukong bound and alone on the ground.",
