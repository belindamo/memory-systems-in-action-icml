I'll also ask my friend Sarah to check in with me daily to see how I'm doing and if I need any support. And, I'll make sure to schedule regular sessions with Dr. Smith to review my progress and make any necessary adjustments to my coping plan. Oh, and by the way, I've been experiencing anxiety attacks around 3-4 times a week, especially at night, and I'm hoping that these new habits will help reduce their frequency.",
