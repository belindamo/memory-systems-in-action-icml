  "content": "I've actually been seeing a therapist, Dr. Smith, once a week for the past six weeks, and we've been working on identifying patterns of negative thinking and reframing them in a more positive light. Last week, we worked on creating a coping plan for when I feel overwhelmed, which involves taking a short walk outside, doing some stretching, and calling a friend or family member to talk through my feelings. I'm hoping to use these resources in conjunction with my therapy sessions to better understand my anxiety patterns. Do you think it's possible to set reminders for these coping mechanisms, so I don't forget to practice them when I need to?",
