Set realistic goals: Start with small and achievable goals, such as exercising for 10 minutes daily or taking a daily walk. Over time, you can gradually increase the duration and intensity of your workouts.\n\n2. Make exercise enjoyable: Find activities that you enjoy doing or combine exercise with an activity you already enjoy, such as dancing or hiking with friends.\n\n3. Exercise with a friend: Having a workout buddy can be motivating and make exercise more enjoyable.\n\n4. Create a schedule: Set a regular exercise schedule, and try to stick to it like you do with other important appointments.\n\n5. Use motivational tools: Set up reminders or motivational quotes or images in places you frequently visit, such as your phone or computer.\n\n6. Be kind to yourself: Remember that every day won\u2019t be perfect or easy, but the important thing is to keep moving forward, take small steps, and to be kind to yourself.\n\n7. Consult a healthcare professional: If you're struggling with motivation, consider discussing the issue with a healthcare professional. They can help you identify the root cause and develop a plan to overcome it.\n\nRemember, the most crucial thing is to start somewhere, no matter how small or insignificant the start may seem.",
