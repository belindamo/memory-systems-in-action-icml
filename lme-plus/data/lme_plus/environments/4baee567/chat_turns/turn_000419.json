The \"Dies Irae\" is a Latin hymn, and has been used by many composers, so it could be the basis for the piece you are thinking of. Some classical works that feature the \"Dies Irae\" melody prominently include Verdi's Requiem Mass, Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, and Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.",
