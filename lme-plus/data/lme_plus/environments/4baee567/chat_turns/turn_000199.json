  "content": "I think I'll try to schedule self-care into my morning routine, maybe right after waking up or during my lunch break. I've found that taking a few minutes to stretch or practice deep breathing exercises can really help set a positive tone for the day. I might also try to take short walks outside during my breaks to get some fresh air and clear my head.\n\nI've also been thinking about trying some new self-care activities, like journaling or drawing. I've heard that creative activities can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety, and I've always been interested in exploring my creative side.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for journaling or drawing prompts that might be helpful for reducing stress and anxiety? I'm not really sure where to start, but I'm open to trying new things.",
