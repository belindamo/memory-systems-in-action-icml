  "content": "I'm really drawn to the Vintage Floral and English Country Garden themes. I love the idea of using natural elements like wood and stone, but I also want to incorporate some vintage decor to give it a more personal touch. Can you give me some ideas on how to combine these two themes? Also, what kind of flowers would you recommend for a late spring garden party?",
