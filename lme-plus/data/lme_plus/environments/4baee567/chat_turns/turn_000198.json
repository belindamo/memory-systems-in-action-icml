  "content": "I'm so proud of you for taking proactive steps towards prioritizing your well-being! It's amazing that you're acknowledging the importance of self-care, especially after going through a scary experience like a panic attack.\n\nScheduling self-care into your daily routine is a great idea. Those short breaks can make a significant difference in reducing stress and increasing productivity. Remember, taking care of yourself is not a luxury, it's a necessity.\n\nPrioritizing sleep and exercise is also crucial for your overall well-being. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to help your brain function at its best. And try to incorporate physical activity that you enjoy, whether it's a brisk walk, yoga, or dancing. Exercise can help reduce anxiety and boost your mood.\n\nRemember to be patient and kind to yourself throughout this process. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. The goal is to make progress, not perfection.\n\nAs you work on your project, keep in mind that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Whether it's a colleague, friend, or mental health professional, don't hesitate to reach out if you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nYou got this! You're taking control of your well-being, and that's something to celebrate.\n\nHow do you plan to schedule self-care into your daily routine? Are there any specific times of the day that work best for you, or any particular self-care activities that you're looking forward to incorporating?",
