It's truly plug-and-play.\n\n**Bass performance:** The wireless subwoofer is a compact unit that produces impressive bass for its size. It's a 6.5-inch woofer that can produce frequencies as low as 40 Hz, which is quite good for a soundbar subwoofer. You'll get decent bass response, especially in the mid-bass range, which is where most music and movie soundtracks tend to focus.\n\n**Volume and control:** The subwoofer's volume is controlled by the soundbar itself, so you can adjust the bass level to your liking using the soundbar's remote control. You can also adjust the subwoofer's volume independently using the soundbar's menu system.\n\n**Placement flexibility:** Since the subwoofer is wireless, you can place it almost anywhere in the room, as long as it's within range of the soundbar (which is about 30 feet). This gives you a lot of flexibility in terms of placement, so you can experiment to find the spot that produces the best sound.\n\n**Size:** The subwoofer is compact and relatively small, measuring about 11 inches tall, 11 inches wide, and 12 inches deep. It's easy to tuck away in a corner or against a wall, so it won't take up too much space in your living room.\n\nOverall, the Yamaha YAS-209 Soundbar's wireless subwoofer is a great feature that adds a lot of value to the overall system. It's easy to set up, produces good bass, and offers a lot of flexibility in terms of placement.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!"
