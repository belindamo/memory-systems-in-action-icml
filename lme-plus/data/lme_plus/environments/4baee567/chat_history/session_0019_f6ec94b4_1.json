I think it's helpful to separate the content creation from the asset creation, as those are two different tasks that require different skills and mindsets.

Here are some tips to help you stay focused and avoid procrastination:\n\n1. **Time-block your tasks**: Schedule specific times for each task in your calendar, and stick to it. This will help you avoid multitasking and minimize distractions.\n2. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: Work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This technique can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n3. **Create a conducive work environment**: Identify the things that distract you the most (e.g., social media, email, chatty colleagues), and remove or minimize them while you work. Consider using website blockers like Freedom or SelfControl.\n4. **Break tasks into smaller chunks**: Divide larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. This will make them less overwhelming and help you make progress, which can boost your motivation.\n5. **Set realistic goals for each session**: Define what you want to achieve in each work session. This will help you stay focused and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each task.\n6. **Use a \"Stop Doing\" list**: Identify tasks that are not essential or can be delegated, and eliminate them. This will help you prioritize your time and energy on the most critical tasks.\n7. **Take care of yourself**: Don't forget to take breaks, exercise, and eat well. Taking care of your physical and mental health will help you stay energized and focused.\n8. **Get accountability**: Share your goals and progress with a friend or accountability partner. This can provide an added motivation to stay on track.\n9. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress along the way. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged throughout the project.\n10. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes. Don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks or encounter difficulties. Instead, learn from them and move forward.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following anxiety-reducing tips:\n\n* Take a few deep breaths before starting each work session to calm your nerves.\n* Use positive self-talk to reassure yourself that you're capable of completing the project.\n* Visualize yourself successfully completing the project and feeling proud of your accomplishment.\n\nRemember, it's normal to feel some level of anxiety when working on a big project.
