      "content": "Sure, here is the requested information for the research project on the topic of personal product customization and its impact on the buying decision of the customer, using Nike and NikeID (shoe customization) as the company for the study:\n\n1. Research Topic: Personal product customization and its impact on the buying decision of the customer\n2. Research Question: How does personal product customization, using NikeID, affect the buying decision of the customer?\n3. Company/Organization: Nike, a multinational corporation that designs, develops, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment; NikeID, a service offered by Nike that allows customers to customize their own shoes\n4. Bottom Line: This topic is important because personal product customization has the potential to impact customer purchasing behavior and satisfaction. Understanding the impact of customization on the buying decision of the customer can inform strategies for improving the customer experience and increasing sales for Nike.\n5. Independent variable: Personal product customization using NikeID\n6. Dependent variable: Purchasing decision\n7. Hypothesis: Customers who are able to customize their products using NikeID will be more likely to make a purchase than customers who are not able to customize their products.\n8. Method (Quantitative): Field experiment\n9. Operationalization of all relevant variables:\n* Personal product customization using NikeID: Customers in the experimental group will be able to customize their products using NikeID. Customers in the control group will not be able to customize their products.\n* Purchasing decision: The number of purchases made by each group will be measured.\n1. Statistical Analysis: The data collected from the field experiment will be analyzed using appropriate statistical tests, such as t-tests or ANOVA tests, to determine if there is a significant difference between the control and experimental groups in terms of purchasing behavior."
