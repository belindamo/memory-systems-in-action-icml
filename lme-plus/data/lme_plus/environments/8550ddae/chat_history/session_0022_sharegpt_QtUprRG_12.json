You are deliberately thinking \u201cin a different context\u201d elsewhere.\nThe idea is to draw upon external views that are not implicated in our situation, from people who have a fresh, naive, distant, out-of-the-box view on our issue: celebrities.\nFor example, you can ask yourself what Bill Gates, Frank Sinatra or Mother Theresa would do if they had to solve our issue. It\u2019s all about imagination.\nAvoid choosing people with a direct link to your issue or your field of activity. The more people are removed from it, the more productive the technique will prove to be.\nHow to go about it?\n1\u00b0) Write down the names of ten different celebrities, who are quite different from one another.\nE.g.,: Albert Einstein, Jennifer Lopez, Sophia Loren, Mickey Mouse, Joan of Arc, Richard Branson, Prince William, Pablo Picasso, Christopher Columbus and Nelson Mandela.\n2\u00b0) Take the first person on your list and ask yourself what this person would do in your shoes, if confronted with your problem ?\nE.g.: What would Jennifer Lopez do in our place ?\n3\u00b0) When no more ideas are forthcoming, do the same for the second celebrity. 4\u00b0) And so forth.\nGREAT RISK!\nThat participants will start describing the celebrity, special characteristics, his or her work .\nInstead, they need to think of concrete or imaginary solutions to their own problem, which the celebrity would have proposed, if he would have been faced with the question that is occupying us today.\n 24\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\nTECHNIQUE No.3 EXOTIC ANIMALS\nMuch like the celebrity technique, this technique invites us to look for ideas in unusual surroundings, which are beyond our usual mental framework. Here too, the goal is to deliberately think \u00ab elsewhere \u00bb .\nTry to avoid thinking of animals such as apes, dolphins and bees.\nHow to go about it?\n1\u00b0) Write down the names of about ten exotic animals.\nE.g. : giraffe, lion, elephant, boa constrictor, tiger, tapir, humming-bird, rhinoceros, zebra and the gnu\n2\u00b0) Choose one animal from the list and try to enumerate ten characteristics of this animal E.g. : the zebra. The zebra\u2019s characteristics:\n- white and black - vegetarian\n- lives in Africa\n- gregarious\n- peaceful - stripes\n- etc.\n3\u00b0) Use the first characteristic as your \u00ab source of inspiration \u00bb, i.e., ask yourself \u00ab and if the solution to our problem involved something..., which ideas would we think of ?\u00bb.\nE.g., if the solution to our problem involved something \u00abblack and white \u00bb,which new ideas would we think of \u00bb\nWhen you have run out of ideas, do the same for the second characteristic. 4\u00b0) And so forth.\n5\u00b0) When you have run out of ideas, choose another animal from the list and do the same all over again.\n 25\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\nTECHNIQUE No.4 LE VERSUS\nThe technique of opposites is fundamentally different from the celebrity technique, the letter technique and the exotic animal technique. The three techniques all use \"sources of inspiration\", which have strictly nothing to do with the problem that is being examined.\nThe versus technique asks whether there are any solutions to be found where you wouldn\u2019t usually look for them. This is the opposite of logic, the technique that goes against the dominant paradigm.\nHow to go about it?\n1\u00b0) Write down ten good and evident solutions to the challenge at hand.\n2\u00b0) Ask yourself for each of the evident solutions, what would happen if you would look for a solution in a completely opposite direction. Write down all the solutions, even the most absurd ones, as this technique generates a lot of completely unusable solutions since you are thinking against the paradigm.\nComments: this technique is less spontaneous and less playful than the previously proposed techniques. Nevertheless, it can extremely efficient for those who manage to think against the grain. It is to some extent the \"Haagen-Dazs\" strategy :\u201dWhile the market is demanding the lightest possible ice creams that are as inexpensive as possible, what new product can we come up with?\u201d asked themselves a few decades ago the directors of the company that became Haagen-Dazs.\n 26\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\n 27\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\nTECHNIQUE No.5 CREA-TRENDS\nThe celebrity, exotic animal and letter techniques draw their inspiration from aspects that are quite removed from the problem. The versus technique explores solutions that are the opposite of the dominating paradigm. But the crea-trends technique is all about reality.\nIt uses topical trends to find solutions.\nHow to go about it?\n1\u00b0) Write down about ten trends that are not related to the challenge in question.\n2\u00b0) Take the first trend on the list and ask yourself what are all the solutions possible by taking advantage of this trend.\n3\u00b0) Explore all ten trends one by one.\n 28\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\nHOW TO IDENTIFY NEW TRENDS?\n1. Be aware of new expressions, try to find them in the media and ask yourself what they are the\nportents of. Which emerging reality is hiding behind these new words?\n2. Why not take a \u00ab shopping trip \u00bb to Barcelona, London or Berlin \u2013 or even Sidney ! \u2013 and visit trendy restaurants, stores, galleries and bars. Take a camera and a little notebook with you to note down things that amaze you, that are unusual. Spend a lot of time in emerging trendy neighbourhoods, where trends are still being created.\n3. Pay particular attention to novelties that annoy you, or that you really do not understand.\n4. Have a discussion with a group of adolescents about their likes and dislikes, what sets them apart from adults according to them, and ask them what they think they will be doing tomorrow (and what they wouldn't be caught dead doing). Be interested in their values, their dreams, their ambitions, their idols and their cult objects.\n5. Take a look at the catwalk shows of the French, Italian and English designers and try to decode the messages and intuitions that they convey. Fashion designers like designers and architects, are extremely sensitive to the signs of the times, and often anticipate tomorrow's trends.\n6. Regularly visit the \u00ab Trends and Novelties \u00bb pages of websites such as www.thefuturlaboratory.com, www.gridskipper.com, www.fastcodesign.com, www.trendhunter.com.\n7. Buy ten trendy magazines\\* and cut out all the articles and photos regarding novelties, innovations, and change in every domain: beauty, technology, transport, leisure, the environment, etc. Make a big collage with those photos that seem futuristic and you will have created your own trend board. (\\*Wall Paper, Ideat, Fast Company, Icon ...)\n8. Invite an anthropologist, a sociologist or a futurologist to talk about changes in society. What are the roads leading to the future, according to him or her? Never forget that the future is always uncertain and that it can only be read in plural.\n9. Meet with trend-watchers, those specialists who track down, follow and study trends and their development. Do not hesitate to invite a trend-watcher who specialises in a sector that is not yours.\n10. And why not simply listen to your intuition?"
