I'm pretty flexible with my travel dates, but I definitely need to be in Chicago for the ceremony. I'd prefer to fly into O'Hare since it's closer to the city. As for budget, I'm hoping to spend around $200-300 for flights and $100-150 per night for a hotel. I don't have any specific area in mind, but it would be great to stay somewhere close to the graduation venue. Can you suggest some options?"

Here are some options:\n\n* American Airlines: Round-trip flights from [your city] to O'Hare (ORD) for around $220-$280, depending on the dates.\n* United Airlines: Round-trip flights from [your city] to O'Hare (ORD) for around $240-$300, depending on the dates.\n* Southwest Airlines: Round-trip flights from [your city] to O'Hare (ORD) for around $250-$320, depending on the dates.\n\nKeep in mind that prices may vary depending on the time of booking and availability. I recommend setting up price alerts or tracking prices on websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or directly on the airlines' websites.\n\n**Hotels:**\n\nSince you'd like to stay close to the graduation venue, could you please provide me with more information about the ceremony's location? That way, I can suggest hotels within a reasonable distance.\n\nHowever, here are some general options in different neighborhoods that might be convenient:\n\n* **The Loop/Downtown:** Hotels like the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Chicago, Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago, or the Renaissance Chicago Downtown Hotel might be good options.

However, I can try to help you gather more details if needed.\n\nCould you please ask your friend or their sister about the following:\n\n1. **Ceremony Location:** Is the graduation ceremony being held at the law school itself, or is it taking place at a different venue, such as a convention center, auditorium, or outdoor location?\n2. **Ceremony Time:** What time is the graduation ceremony scheduled to start? Is it a morning, afternoon, or evening event?\n3. **Ceremony Date:** You mentioned the ceremony is next month, but could you confirm the exact date?\n\nHaving this information will help me provide more tailored recommendations for flights, hotels, and even transportation to and from the ceremony.\n\nOnce you have these details, I can assist you in finding a hotel that's conveniently located near the ceremony venue, and also suggest the best transportation options to get you there on time."

With that information, I can provide you with more specific recommendations.\n\n**Hotel Options:**\n\nSince the Auditorium Theatre is located in the Loop area, I'll suggest some hotels within walking distance or a short ride away:\n\n1. **The Congress Plaza Hotel**: This hotel is about a 5-minute walk to the Auditorium Theatre. Prices start around $120-$150 per night.\n2. **The Palmer House Hilton**: This historic hotel is about a 10-minute walk to the Auditorium Theatre. Prices start around $130-$160 per night.\n3. **Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago**: This hotel is about a 10-minute walk to the Auditorium Theatre. Prices start around $140-$170 per night.\n4. **Kimpton Hotel Allegro**: This hotel is about a 12-minute walk to the Auditorium Theatre.

If you prefer not to walk, you can take a short taxi or ride-share ride, which should cost around $5-$10.\n\n**Flight Options:**\n\nI recommend booking your flight to arrive at O'Hare International Airport (ORD) on the Friday before the ceremony, so you can have a relaxed morning and get to the venue on time. You can take a taxi, ride-share, or public transportation (CTA Blue Line) from the airport to your hotel.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Be sure to book your hotel and flight as soon as possible, as prices may increase closer to the ceremony date.\n* Plan to arrive at the Auditorium Theatre at least 30 minutes before the ceremony to account for security checks and finding your seat.\n* Consider grabbing lunch or brunch near the hotel or ceremony venue before the event, as you might not have time to eat afterwards.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm confident you'll have a great time supporting your friend's sister at her law school graduation ceremony!"
