Breakfast is a great meal to prep ahead, and I've got some healthy ideas that'll satisfy your cravings without breaking the bank (or your diet).\n\nSince you mentioned your indulgent breakfast at the caf\u00e9, I'll provide some lighter, balanced options that still pack flavor and nutrition. Here are 5 healthy breakfast ideas you can prep on Sundays for the weekdays:\n\n**1.** **Mason Jar Overnight Oats**: Layer rolled oats, milk, and your choice of nuts, seeds, or fruit in a mason jar. Refrigerate overnight and enjoy in the morning. You can prep 5 jars at once and customize each with different toppings.\n\n**2.** **Scrambled Egg Muffins**: Whisk eggs with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs (e.g., parsley, chives). Pour into muffin tin cups and bake at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes. Add veggies like bell peppers, mushrooms, or spinach for extra nutrition. Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\n\n**3.** **Avocado Toast Prep**: Toast whole-grain bread, mash avocado, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Store the toasted bread in an airtight container and the mashed avocado in a separate container. Assemble in the morning with a fried or poached egg, if desired.\n\n**4.** **Greek Yogurt Parfait**: Layer Greek yogurt, fresh berries, and granola in small containers. You can also add a sprinkle of chia seeds or honey for extra nutrition and flavor. Prep 5 containers at once and refrigerate for up to 5 days.\n\n**5.** **Breakfast Burritos**: Scramble eggs, cook sausage (or use a vegetarian alternative), and warm tortillas. Assemble burritos with shredded cheese, salsa, and your choice of veggies (e.g., bell peppers, onions, mushrooms). Wrap individually and store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\n\nTips to reduce food waste:\n\n* Plan your meals around what you already have in your pantry and fridge.\n* Shop for ingredients in bulk and use them throughout the week.\n* Use up leftovers in creative ways, like turning last night's dinner into tomorrow's lunch.\n* Store prepped meals in airtight containers to keep them fresh and visible in your fridge.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create healthy, delicious breakfasts that'll fuel your weekdays!"
