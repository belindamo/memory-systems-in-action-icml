Here are some cocktail pairing recommendations that will complement these dishes nicely:\n\n**Eggs Benedict:**\n\n1. **Bloody Mary:** A classic brunch cocktail that pairs perfectly with eggs benedict. The spicy and savory flavors of the Bloody Mary will complement the richness of the eggs and hollandaise sauce.\n2. **Champagne Cocktail:** A simple yet elegant cocktail made with champagne, cognac, and a sugar cube. The acidity and effervescence of the champagne will cut through the richness of the dish.\n3. **Corpse Reviver #2:** A complex and herbal cocktail featuring gin, Lillet Blanc, Cynar, and a splash of absinthe. The bitter and herbal flavors will balance the richness of the eggs benedict.\n\n**Avocado Toast:**\n\n1. **Cucumber Gimlet:** A refreshing and light cocktail made with gin, lime juice, and cucumber puree. The cucumber will complement the creaminess of the avocado, while the gin will add a crisp, herbal note.\n2. **Pimm's Cup:** A classic British cocktail featuring Pimm's No. 1, lemon-lime soda, and garnished with cucumber and mint.
