  "content": "I've been really enjoying learning the Azonto dance style, which is from Ghana. There's this one move called the \"Azonto bump\" that I've been trying to master - it's all about the hip movement and isolations. I've also been working on my polyrhythms, trying to get my arms and legs to move independently to the different drum patterns. It's not easy, but it's so much fun to challenge myself and see improvement over time.",
