  "content": "With your current system and budget, you have a solid foundation for playing Cyberpunk 2077. Here's a breakdown of your options:\n\n**Upgrading your current graphics card:**\n\n* Your Intel Core i5-11600K is a strong CPU that can handle the game's CPU-intensive tasks.\n* Your ASRock B460M Steel Legend Micro ATX motherboard is a good match for your CPU and has a PCIe 3.0 x16 slot, which can accommodate a newer graphics card.\n* Your 16 GB of DDR4 RAM at 3200MHz is sufficient for most modern games.\n\nTo play Cyberpunk 2077 at its highest settings, you'll want a graphics card that can handle 1440p (2560x1440) or 4K (3840x2160) resolutions with high graphics settings. Considering your budget, here are some options:\n\n* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: This card would be a significant upgrade from your current RTX 2060 and should handle 1440p with high graphics settings. It's available for around $500.\n* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti: This card is a slight step up from the RTX 3070 and would provide even better performance for 1440p and 4K gaming. It's available for around $600.\n* AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT: This card is a strong competitor to the NVIDIA options and might offer better performance for 1440p gaming. It's available for around $400.\n\nKeep in mind that you might need to upgrade your power supply unit (PSU) to support the increased power draw of these newer graphics cards. A 650W or 750W 80+ Gold certified PSU would be a good starting point.\n\n**Building a new gaming PC:**\n\nWith your budget, you could build a new system that would easily handle Cyberpunk 2077 at its highest settings. Here's a possible build:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X (around $300) or Intel Core i7-11700K (around $350)\n* Motherboard: A compatible motherboard for your chosen CPU (around $150-$200)\n* RAM: 16 GB or 32 GB of DDR4 RAM at 3200MHz or higher (around $60-$100)\n* Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 or RTX 3070 Ti (around $500-$600)\n* Storage: 1 TB NVMe SSD (around $100-$150)\n* Case: A mid-tower case with good airflow (around $50-$70)\n* Power Supply: A 650W or 750W 80+ Gold certified PSU (around $80-$120)\n\nThis build would provide a significant performance boost over your current system and would be future-proof for upcoming games.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on your budget and current system, I'd recommend upgrading your graphics card to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 or RTX 3070 Ti. This would provide a significant performance boost for Cyberpunk 2077 and other modern games, and you wouldn't need to worry about upgrading other components.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to invest in a new system, building a new gaming PC with a stronger CPU, motherboard, and other components would provide even better performance and future-proofing.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
