And, of course, I'd be happy to recommend some brunch cocktails that would pair perfectly with your quinoa salad and roasted vegetables.\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Cucumber-Lime Refresher:** A light and refreshing cocktail made with gin, cucumber-infused simple syrup, lime juice, and a splash of soda water. The cucumber will complement the freshness of your quinoa salad nicely.\n2. **Spicy Pineapple Spritz:** A fruity and spicy cocktail featuring tequila, pineapple juice, lime juice, and a dash of cayenne pepper. The spiciness will pair well with the roasted vegetables.\n3. **Grapefruit-Rosemary Fizz:** A tangy and herbaceous cocktail made with vodka, grapefruit juice, rosemary syrup, and a splash of soda water. The bitterness of the grapefruit will cut through the richness of the quinoa salad.\n4. **Cranberry-Orange Spritzer:** A fruity and bubbly cocktail featuring cranberry juice, orange liqueur, and prosecco. The cranberry will add a nice tartness to the dish.\n5. **Blackberry-Basil Martini:** A sweet and savory cocktail made with vodka, blackberry puree, lime juice, and basil syrup. The basil will complement the herbal notes in your quinoa salad.\n\nWhen it comes to pairing cocktails with quinoa salad and roasted vegetables, consider the following tips:\n\n* Balance the flavors: Look for cocktails that balance sweet, sour, and savory flavors to complement the dish.\n* Consider the herbs: If your quinoa salad features fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro, look for cocktails that incorporate similar herbal notes.\n* Don't forget the acidity: A splash of citrus or a tangy ingredient like cranberry can help cut through the richness of the quinoa and roasted vegetables.\n\nFor your citrus-infused mimosa bar, you can offer a variety of juices like orange, grapefruit, lemon, and lime, along with different garnishes like fruit slices, mint, and edible flowers. This will allow your guests to create their own unique flavor combinations.\n\nI hope these recommendations help you plan a fantastic brunch gathering!",
