  "content": "1. Look for sunscreen with physical blockers: Choose creams with physical blockers like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as they deflect UV rays away from the skin.\n\n2. Check for fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products: For sensitive skin, fragrance could trigger an allergic reaction or a rash. So, stick with hypoallergenic or fragrance-free sunscreens.\n\n3. Find a higher SPF: A higher level of SPF will give more protection to the skin, preventing sunburn for extended periods.\n\n4. Pick the right formula: For sensitive skin, it\u2019s best to choose a lotion or cream rather than sprays or powders, which may irritate the skin or eyes.\n\n5. Do a patch test: Before using the sunscreen, always do a patch test to check for any negative reactions. Apply a small amount to a particular area on your skin, and wait for 24 hours to check for any reaction.\n\n6. Consult with a dermatologist: Work with a dermatologist to find the best product for your skin type, tone, and sensitivity level.",
