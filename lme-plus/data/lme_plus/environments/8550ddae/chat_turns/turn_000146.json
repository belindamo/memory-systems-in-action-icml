  "content": "It is not recommended to use regular body lotion as a substitute for sunscreen on your sensitive skin. Regular body lotion does not provide adequate sun protection and may not have the necessary ingredients to protect against UV rays. Sunscreen is specially formulated to protect the skin from harmful UV rays and minimize the risk of skin damage.\n\nAdditionally, some regular body lotions may contain ingredients that can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, which can cause sunburn and other skin issues. Therefore, if you have sensitive skin, it is best to use a sunscreen specifically designed for sensitive skin.\n\nAlways choose an SPF 30 or higher and a lotion or cream formulation for your sensitive skin. Reapply the sunscreen every two hours or as directed on the product label, especially if you are sweating or swimming.",
