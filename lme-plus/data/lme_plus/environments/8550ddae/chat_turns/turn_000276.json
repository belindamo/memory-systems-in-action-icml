  "content": "I wake up at 7:00 AM, but since the daylight saving time change last month, I've been having trouble getting out of bed before 7:30 AM. I usually get to work by 8:30 AM. My top priorities are usually responding to urgent emails and tackling the most important tasks for the day. I have a team meeting on Fridays at 2:00 PM, so I try to get as much work done as possible before then. I feel stuck around 3:00 PM when I start to feel sluggish and my energy levels drop. I want to make time for meditation and exercise, but it's hard to fit them in.",
