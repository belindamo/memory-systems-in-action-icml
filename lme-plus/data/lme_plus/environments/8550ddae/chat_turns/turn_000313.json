In a small saucepan, combine the water and sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.\n2. Remove from heat and add the smoked paprika. Let it steep for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.\n3. Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean glass bottle. Discard the solids.\n\n**To make the Smokey Mango Mule:**\n\n1. Fill a copper mug or highball glass with ice.\n2. Add the tequila, mango puree, lime juice, ginger liqueur, and agave syrup.\n3. Add 2-3 dashes of the smoked paprika-infused simple syrup, depending on your desired level of smokiness.\n4. Top with ginger beer and stir gently.\n5. Garnish with a lime wheel and mint sprig.\n\n**Using Citrus Vinaigrettes in Cocktails:**\n\nCitrus vinaigrettes can add a wonderful brightness and depth to cocktails. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Citrus-Ginger Fizz:** Mix a citrus vinaigrette (like your citrus vinaigrette for the quinoa salad) with ginger beer, vodka, and a squeeze of lime juice for a refreshing and citrusy cocktail.\n2. **Blood Orange Spritz:** Combine blood orange vinaigrette with prosecco, vodka, and a splash of grenadine for a fruity and bubbly cocktail.\n3. **Lemon-Herb Collins:** Mix lemon vinaigrette with gin, lemon juice, and a splash of soda water, garnished with a sprig of rosemary or thyme.\n4. **Grapefruit-Rosemary Sour:** Combine grapefruit vinaigrette with bourbon, grapefruit juice, and a splash of honey syrup, garnished with a rosemary sprig.\n\nWhen using citrus vinaigrettes in cocktails, start with a small amount (about 1/4 oz) and adjust to taste, as the acidity and flavor can quickly overpower the other ingredients.\n\nI hope you enjoy the Smokey Mango Mule and experimenting with citrus vinaigrettes in your cocktails!",
