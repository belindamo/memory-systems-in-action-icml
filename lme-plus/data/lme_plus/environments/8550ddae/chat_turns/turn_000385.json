  "content": "The graduation ceremony is next month, and I'd like to arrive a day or two before to catch up with my friend and her family. I'm pretty flexible with my travel dates, but I definitely need to be in Chicago for the ceremony. I'd prefer to fly into O'Hare since it's closer to the city. As for budget, I'm hoping to spend around $200-300 for flights and $100-150 per night for a hotel. I don't have any specific area in mind, but it would be great to stay somewhere close to the graduation venue. Can you suggest some options?",
