Smith is the new CEO.\"\n* Avoiding titles altogether: \"Jane Doe, CEO\" instead of \"Ms. Jane Doe, CEO\"\n* Using descriptive titles: \"Software Engineer\" instead of \"Mr. Software Engineer\" or \"Ms. Software Engineer\"\n\n**Gender-Neutral Language:**\n\n* Using \"everyone\" or \"all\" instead of \"guys\" or \"girls\": \"Everyone, please join the meeting at 2 PM.\"\n* Avoiding gendered language in job descriptions: \"The successful candidate will...\" instead of \"The successful man/woman will...\"\n* Using gender-neutral language in marketing materials: \"Our products are designed for people of all ages and abilities.\" instead of \"Our products are designed for men and women.\"\n\n**Other Examples:**\n\n* Using \"partner\" instead of \"husband\" or \"wife\": \"My partner and I are excited to announce...\"\n* Avoiding gendered language in greetings: \"Hello, everyone!\" instead of \"Hello, ladies and gentlemen!\"\n* Using gender-neutral language in forms and surveys: \"What is your preferred name?\" instead of \"What is your first name (male/female)?\"",
