  "content": "If you still get a sunburn despite using sunscreen for sensitive skin, there are a few steps you can take to relieve the discomfort and promote healing:\n\n1. Cool the skin: Take a cool bath or use cool compresses to soothe the skin.\n\n2. Moisturize the skin: Apply a moisturizing lotion or aloe vera to soothe and hydrate the burned skin.\n\n3. Take pain relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help alleviate pain and discomfort.\n\n4. Stay out of the sun: Avoid further sun exposure until your skin has fully healed.\n\n5. Consult with a doctor: If the sunburn is severe, accompanied by a fever or blistering, or if you experience headache, nausea, or confusion, seek medical attention immediately. \n\nRemember that prevention is the best policy when it comes to sunburns, so be sure to reapply sunscreen frequently and stay in the shade when possible.",
