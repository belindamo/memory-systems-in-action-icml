It's always fun to discover new things about our loved ones, isn't it? Maybe you can even ask her to add some notes or comments to the photos in the shared album, so you can both relive the memories together.\n\nSpeaking of the shared album, have you thought about what you'll name it? You could call it something like \"Emma's Visit 2023\" or \"Sisterly Love\" to make it easy to find and remember.",
