  "content": "I think that's a great idea! I've been meaning to experiment with lavender in my cocktails more, and using it in a gin and tonic sounds like a fantastic way to do so. I'll definitely look into making a lavender syrup or infusion to add to my Bombay Sapphire and Fever-Tree elderflower tonic. Do you have any tips on how to make a good lavender syrup, or should I just experiment with different ratios of lavender to sugar and water?",
