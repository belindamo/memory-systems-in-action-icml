The number of referrals one can make is unrestricted, and the amount of rewards earned will rise proportionately to the number of successful referrals. The program is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, requiring minimal participation requirements. Users need only share their unique referral link with friends and family, and upon connecting their web3 wallet on our platform, both the referrer and referred user will earn rewards. The magnitude of rewards is generated by the buy and sell tax of token, and the percentage increases with the referral amount. By participating in the referral program, users not only earn rewards, but they also contribute to the expansion of the TrustBit community, and the enhancement of the platform's liquidity and trading volume.\n\nTrustBit is a decentralized, self-custodial exchange that allows users to trade, earn, and farm on one platform.\n\nIt offers zero price impact trading with up to 50x leverage and aggregated liquidity. The exchange is built on Arbitrum, optimized for everyone.\n\nTrustBit enables users to trade directly via their Web3 wallets, ensuring self-custody of their assets.\n\nThe exchange routes positions to suited liquidity sources, allowing users to trade on any deployed networks with the same unified liquidity depth.\n\nTrustBit's AI Trading Assistant provides optimized order execution speed, and its TrueSight technology analyzes on-chain data, trading volumes, and price trendlines to discover tokens that could be trending in the near future.\n\nThe exchange also offers a multichain bridge that enables seamless cross-chain transactions and the ability to buy crypto by credit card.\n\nTrustBit's referral program rewards users for referring friends to the platform. The number of referrals is unrestricted, and the amount of rewards earned rises proportionately to the number of successful referrals.\n\nThe referral program has multi-tiered rewards, and users can claim their bonus in a staking pool.\n\nTrustBit has a comprehensive tokenomic roadmap, with a focus on community-driven initiatives and continuous development.",
