I'd be happy to provide you with some tips and recommendations.\n\n**Making Simple Syrup:**\n\n1. **Ratio:** The classic ratio for simple syrup is 1 part sugar to 1 part water (1:1). You can adjust this ratio to suit your taste, but this is a good starting point.\n2. **Sugar:** Use granulated sugar or superfine sugar, as they dissolve easily. You can also experiment with different types of sugar, like turbinado or Demerara, for unique flavor profiles.\n3. **Water:** Use filtered or bottled water to prevent any impurities or flavors from affecting your syrup.\n4. **Method:** Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat the mixture over low heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let cool.\n5. **Cooling:** Allow the syrup to cool to room temperature before storing it in the refrigerator. This helps prevent the growth of bacteria and mold.\n6. **Storage:** Store your simple syrup in a clean glass bottle with a tight-fitting lid in the refrigerator. It will keep for several weeks.\n\n**Tips for Making Simple Syrup with Honey:**\n\nIf you want to use honey as a substitute for sugar, keep the following in mind:\n\n1. **Ratio:** Use a 1:1 ratio of honey to water, but be aware that honey is sweeter than sugar, so you may want to adjust the amount to your taste.\n2. **Dissolving:** Honey can be more difficult to dissolve than sugar. Heat the mixture gently, whisking constantly, until the honey dissolves.\n3. **Flavor:** Honey will impart a distinct flavor to your syrup, which can be desirable or not, depending on your recipe. Consider using a mild honey, like clover or acacia, for a more neutral flavor.\n\n**Commercial Simple Syrup Options:**\n\nIf you prefer to buy simple syrup, there are many excellent brands available. Here are a few popular ones:\n\n1. **Monin:** A well-known brand in the bartender community, Monin offers a range of flavored simple syrups, including a classic 1:1 simple syrup.\n2. **Finest Call:** Another popular brand, Finest Call offers a simple syrup made with pure cane sugar and filtered water.\n3. **Small Hand Foods:** This artisanal brand offers a range of flavorful simple syrups, including a classic 1:1 and a honey-based syrup.\n\nFor your Lavender Dream cocktail, you can use either a homemade or store-bought simple syrup. If you're using honey, keep in mind that it will add a distinct flavor profile to your cocktail.\n\nNow, let's get back to your Lavender Dream! How did you infuse your gin with lavender, and what ratio of gin to lavender did you use? I'd be happy to help you refine the recipe.",
