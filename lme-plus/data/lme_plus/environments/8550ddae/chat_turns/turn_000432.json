However, I can report that Delta Air Lines implements a variety of security training programs to ensure the safety of their passengers and employees.\n\nDelta Air Lines is required by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide annual security awareness training to all employees who have access to restricted areas at airports. This training may cover topics such as identifying and reporting suspicious behavior, controlling access to secure areas, and responding to security incidents.\n\nIn addition to the TSA and FAA requirements, Delta Air Lines may also provide specialized security training to employees in certain roles or locations. This training could include anti-terrorism awareness, emergency response, or cyber security awareness.\n\nDelta Air Lines may also partner with government agencies or security experts to develop and deliver specialized training programs. For example, the airline has worked with the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security on programs such as the TSA PreCheck\u00ae expedited screening program and the Secure Flight program.\n\nOverall, Delta Air Lines takes security very seriously and invests in a variety of training programs to ensure that their employees are prepared to identify and respond to potential security threats.",
