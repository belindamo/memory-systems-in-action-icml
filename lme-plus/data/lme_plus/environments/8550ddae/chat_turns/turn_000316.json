  "content": "I'm excited to try out these citrus-based cocktails, especially the Citrus Sunrise and Triple Citrus Collins. Speaking of citrus fruits, I've been thinking of hosting a brunch at my place soon, and I was thinking of serving a citrus-infused mimosa bar with different juices like orange, grapefruit, and lemon. Do you have any recommendations for other brunch cocktails that would pair well with a quinoa salad and roasted vegetables?",
