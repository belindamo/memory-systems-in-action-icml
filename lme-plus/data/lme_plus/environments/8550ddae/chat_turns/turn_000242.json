They're well-suited for fast-paced games, and their QHD resolution provides a great balance between detail and performance.\n\n**Which one to choose?**\n\nIf you prioritize a slightly higher peak brightness and a wider color gamut, the ASUS PG279QM might be the better choice. However, if you're on a tighter budget and still want a high-performance QHD monitor, the Acer Predator XB273U is an excellent option.\n\nKeep in mind that both monitors are high-quality options, and you can't go wrong with either one.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these monitors, or would you like to know more about their features?",
