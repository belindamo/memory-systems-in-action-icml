I think I'll try out some of the options you mentioned, like nuts and seeds, fresh fruits, and protein-rich snack balls. I've also been meaning to start incorporating more meditation and exercise into my daily routine, so I'll definitely make sure to schedule those in. Do you have any tips on how to stay motivated to stick to my daily routine and make these new habits a part of my lifestyle?",
