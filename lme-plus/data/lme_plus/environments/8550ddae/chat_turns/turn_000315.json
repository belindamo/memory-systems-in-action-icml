And, of course, I'd be happy to recommend some citrus-based cocktails that incorporate multiple citrus fruits!\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Citrus Sunrise:** A refreshing cocktail that combines tequila, orange liqueur, freshly squeezed orange and lemon juices, and a splash of grenadine. Garnish with a slice of orange and a cherry for a beautiful sunrise effect.\n2. **Triple Citrus Collins:** A variation of the Tom Collins, made with gin, lemon juice, lime juice, and grapefruit juice, topped with soda water and garnished with a lemon wheel and sprig of rosemary.\n3. **Citrus-Ginger Fizz:** A twist on the classic Dark 'N' Stormy, featuring ginger beer, rum, freshly squeezed lime and orange juices, and a splash of grapefruit juice. Garnish with a lime wheel and slice of orange.\n4. **Sunset Sour:** A citrusy take on the classic Whiskey Sour, made with bourbon, freshly squeezed orange and lemon juices, and a splash of grenadine. Garnish with a slice of orange and cherry.\n5. **Citrus-Herb Spritz:** A refreshing and fruity spritz made with prosecco, vodka, lemon-lime soda, and a mix of citrus juices (such as orange, lemon, and grapefruit). Add a splash of basil syrup and garnish with a sprig of basil for a unique twist.\n\nWhen working with multiple citrus fruits in cocktails, it's essential to balance the flavors and avoid overpowering the other ingredients. Here are some tips:\n\n* Start with a dominant citrus flavor (e.g., orange or grapefruit) and balance it with smaller amounts of other citrus juices.\n* Consider the sweetness and acidity levels of each citrus fruit and adjust accordingly.\n* Don't be afraid to experiment and adjust the proportions of each citrus juice to find the perfect balance for your taste.\n\nI hope these ideas and tips inspire you to create some amazing citrus-based cocktails!",
