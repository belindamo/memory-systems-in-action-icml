  "content": "I apologize for not asking about the ceremony details earlier!\n\nSince you mentioned you're attending your friend's sister's law school graduation, I'm assuming you might have some information about the ceremony. However, I can try to help you gather more details if needed.\n\nCould you please ask your friend or their sister about the following:\n\n1. **Ceremony Location:** Is the graduation ceremony being held at the law school itself, or is it taking place at a different venue, such as a convention center, auditorium, or outdoor location?\n2. **Ceremony Time:** What time is the graduation ceremony scheduled to start? Is it a morning, afternoon, or evening event?\n3. **Ceremony Date:** You mentioned the ceremony is next month, but could you confirm the exact date?\n\nHaving this information will help me provide more tailored recommendations for flights, hotels, and even transportation to and from the ceremony.\n\nOnce you have these details, I can assist you in finding a hotel that's conveniently located near the ceremony venue, and also suggest the best transportation options to get you there on time.",
