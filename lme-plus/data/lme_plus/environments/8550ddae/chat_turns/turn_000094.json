Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Use a gentle and calming meditation**: Choose a meditation that is specifically designed for sleep or relaxation. Avoid meditations that are stimulating or energizing, as they might make it harder to fall back asleep.\n2. **Keep the volume low**: Make sure the volume is low enough not to disturb your partner or others in the household. You can also use earbuds or headphones to keep the sound contained.\n3. **Use a short and sweet meditation**: Opt for a shorter meditation, around 5-15 minutes, to help you relax and fall back asleep quickly. You can try a body scan, deep breathing, or a gentle guided imagery meditation.\n4. **Try a \"back to sleep\" meditation**: Some apps offer meditations specifically designed for falling back asleep in the middle of the night. These meditations are usually shorter and more gentle, and can help you relax and drift off to sleep quickly.\n5. **Avoid screens before meditating**: Try to avoid looking at your phone or any other screens for at least 10-15 minutes before meditating. The blue light emitted from screens can suppress melatonin production and make it harder to fall asleep.\n6. **Get comfortable and relaxed**: Get back into a comfortable sleeping position, and take a few deep breaths to relax. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body.\n7. **Don't worry if you don't fall asleep immediately**: It's normal if you don't fall asleep immediately after the meditation. Sometimes, it takes a few minutes for your body to relax and drift off to sleep. Be patient, and remember that the meditation is helping you relax and prepare for sleep.\n\nSome popular guided meditation apps that offer \"back to sleep\" meditations or sleep-focused content include:\n\n* Calm: \"Sleep Stories\" and \"Sleep Music\" sections\n* Headspace: \"Sleep\" section with meditations and relaxing sounds\n* Insight Timer: \"Sleep\" and \"Relaxation\" sections with guided meditations and music\n* Slumber: \"Back to Sleep\" meditations and relaxing sounds\n\nRemember, the goal is to help you relax and fall back asleep, not to stay awake and engaged. Keep the meditation gentle, short, and calming, and you'll be drifting off to dreamland in no time!",
