In this case, it seems that you are trying to remove a WebSocket that is not in the list of subscribers.\n\nTo fix this error, you can add a check before removing the WebSocket from the subscribers list to make sure that it exists in the list:\n```python\nasync def unsubscribe(self, websocket):\n    if websocket in self.subscribers:\n        self.subscribers.remove(websocket)\n```\nThis will only remove the WebSocket from the list if it exists in the list, avoiding the ValueError.",
