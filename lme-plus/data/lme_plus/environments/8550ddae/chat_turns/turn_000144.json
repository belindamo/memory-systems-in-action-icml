  "content": "It is not recommended to mix different types of sunscreen on your sensitive skin as it can negate the protective benefits of both products. Different types of sunscreens have different active ingredients, and they may not work well together or may cause irritation to the skin.\n\nIf you need to reapply your sunscreen, it's best to use the same brand and type of sunscreen. You can also consult with a dermatologist to determine the best type of sunscreen for your sensitive skin and how to use it effectively to avoid any adverse reactions. Remember to always patch test a new sunscreen before using it on your skin to check for any allergic reactions.",
