  "content": "Let's calculate the temperature rise (\u0394T) using the provided values:\n\nQ = 2.53 J (heat generated, as calculated earlier)\nm = 24000 kg (mass of the affected concrete)\nc = 880 J/kg\u00b0C (specific heat capacity of the concrete)\nT\\_initial = 30\u00b0C (initial temperature of the concrete, assuming summer temperature)\n\nUsing the formula \u0394T = Q / (m \\* c), we can calculate the temperature rise:\n\n\u0394T = Q / (m \\* c)\n\u0394T = 2.53 J / (24000 kg \\* 880 J/kg\u00b0C)\n\u0394T \u2248 1.19 \u00d7 10^-7 \u00b0C\n\nThe temperature rise is approximately 1.19 \u00d7 10^-7 \u00b0C. Now, let's add this temperature rise to the initial temperature to get the final temperature:\n\nT\\_final = T\\_initial + \u0394T\nT\\_final = 30\u00b0C + 1.19 \u00d7 10^-7 \u00b0C\nT\\_final \u2248 30\u00b0C\n\nThe final temperature is approximately 30\u00b0C, which is well within the allowable temperature range of 65-93\u00b0C for concrete. The temperature rise is extremely small in this case, and the final temperature remains essentially unchanged.",
