  "content": "The specific heat capacity for concrete is approximately 880 J/kg\u00b0C, which means it takes 880 Joules of heat energy to raise the temperature of one kilogram of concrete by one degree Celsius\u200b[1](https://knowledgeburrow.com/what-is-the-specific-heat-capacity-for-concrete/)\n\n[What is the specific heat capacity for concrete?](https://knowledgeburrow.com/what-is-the-specific-heat-capacity-for-concrete/)\u200b.To determine whether the temperature rise in the concrete is within the allowable temperature range of 65-93\u00b0C, we need to calculate the temperature rise (\u0394T) using the following formula:\n\n\u0394T = Q / (m \\* c)\n\nWhere:\n\u0394T = Temperature rise in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C)\nQ = Heat generated in Joules (J) = 2.53 J (as calculated earlier)\nm = Mass of the affected concrete in kilograms (kg) (this value is needed for the calculation)\nc = Specific heat capacity of the concrete in Joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J/kg\u00b0C) = 880 J/kg\u00b0C\n\nOnce we have calculated the temperature rise (\u0394T), we can add it to the initial temperature of the concrete to get the final temperature. We can then compare this final temperature to the allowable temperature range of 65-93\u00b0C to verify if it is within the acceptable limits.\n\nPlease note that we need to know the mass (m) of the affected concrete in the area where the heat is generated to perform this calculation accurately. The mass of the affected concrete will depend on the dimensions of the area and the density of the concrete.",
