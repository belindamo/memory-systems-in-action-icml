  "content": "Thanks for the tips on making simple syrup! I think I'll try making my own this weekend. For the Lavender Dream, I actually didn't infuse my gin with lavender, I just found a recipe online that called for lavender syrup and gin. I didn't have lavender syrup, so I tried to make a lavender gin fizz instead, but like I said, it didn't turn out so well. Anyway, I was thinking of experimenting with different gin brands for my summer dinner party. Can you recommend any good ones?",
