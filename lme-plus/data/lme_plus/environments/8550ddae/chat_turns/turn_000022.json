  "content": "I think experimenting with different types of milk or non-dairy alternatives would be a great idea! I've been wanting to try out some non-dairy yogurt options, especially since I've been hearing so much about the benefits of plant-based diets. Almond milk, soy milk, and coconut milk are all good options, but I've also been curious about oat milk and cashew milk.\n\nDo you have any experience with making yogurt from non-dairy milks? I've heard it can be a bit trickier than making yogurt from cow's milk, but I'm willing to give it a shot.\n\nAlso, have you tried making any other dairy-free or vegan products, like cheese or ice cream? I've been wanting to experiment with some vegan cheese recipes, but I'm not sure where to start.",
