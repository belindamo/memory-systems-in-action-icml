  "content": "I like the suggestions, especially the classic black tie and little black dress ideas. I'm thinking of pairing the dress with a statement piece of jewelry, like a luxury designer blouse. I recently bought a beautiful silk blouse from Alexander McQueen that cost around $800, and I think it would really elevate the overall look. Do you have any tips on how to style it with a dress?",
