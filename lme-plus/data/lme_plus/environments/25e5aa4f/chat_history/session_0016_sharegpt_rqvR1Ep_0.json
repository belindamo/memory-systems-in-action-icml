      "content": "One exercise that could be helpful during a 30-minute session is to guide the students through the SMART goal-setting framework. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Here are some steps you could take:\n\n1. Start by explaining the SMART framework and giving examples of how it can be applied to career goals.\n2. Ask the students to think about their career aspirations and what they want to achieve in the next year. Encourage them to be as specific as possible, such as \"I want to get an internship in my field of interest\" or \"I want to earn a certain grade in a particular course.\"\n3. Once they have a general idea of their goals, ask them to refine them using the SMART criteria. For example, if their goal is to get an internship, they could make it SMART by adding specifics like \"I want to secure a marketing internship with a major company by submitting at least 10 applications per week for the next two months.\"\n4. Encourage the students to assess the feasibility of their goals by considering factors like their current skills, resources, and opportunities. For example, if a student wants to earn a certain grade in a course, they should consider whether that grade is realistic based on their current academic performance and workload.\n5. Help the students set timelines and benchmarks for their goals. For example, if a student wants to secure an internship by the end of the year, they should set intermediate goals such as submitting applications by specific deadlines or networking with industry professionals.\n6. Finally, have the students write down their SMART goals and review them periodically to track their progress and make adjustments as needed.\n\nThis exercise can help students clarify their career goals, break them down into manageable steps, and develop a concrete plan of action. By using the SMART framework, they can set realistic and achievable goals that will help them make meaningful progress toward their long-term aspirations."

The second column outlines the specific actions the student will take to achieve each goal, such as applying to at least 10 internships per week, attending public speaking workshops, attending networking events, and taking up a leadership role in a student organization.\n\nThe third column outlines the metrics that the student will use to measure their progress towards each goal, such as securing an internship with a major company, delivering a confident and clear presentation, adding 50 new contacts to their professional network, and successfully planning and executing events as a leader of a student organization.\n\nThe fourth column outlines the timeline for each goal, with specific deadlines for achieving intermediate benchmarks and ultimately achieving the goal within one year. By mapping out their goals in this way, the student can create a concrete plan of action and track their progress over time."

By breaking down the plan into smaller chunks, the student can focus on short-term goals while keeping their long-term aspirations in sight. Additionally, this approach allows for flexibility in case the student needs to adjust their goals or priorities as they progress through the year."
