Don't be afraid to try new things! Street food is a big part of Bangkok's culture, and trying new dishes is a great way to experience the local way of life. 3. Carry small bills and change, as many street vendors might not have a lot of change. 4. If you are concerned about hygiene, look for stalls that are clean and have a high turnover of food. 5. Remember that street food is often much cheaper than restaurants, so don't be afraid to try a few different dishes. 6. If you are unsure about what to order, don't be afraid to ask the vendor for recommendations or advice. 7. It's always a good idea to carry a bottle of water with you as spicy dishes can be quite hot."
