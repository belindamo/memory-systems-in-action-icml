In fact, a World Economic Forum report predicts that by 2022, 75 million jobs may be displaced, but 133 million new jobs may emerge that are more adaptable to the AI-driven economy.\n\n**In-demand skills:** To thrive in an AI-driven job market, it's essential to develop skills that are complementary to AI and automation. Some of the most in-demand skills include:\n\n1. **Data Science and Analytics:** With the increasing amount of data being generated, companies need professionals who can collect, analyze, and interpret data to inform business decisions.\n2. **Machine Learning and AI Development:** As AI continues to advance, companies need experts who can develop, train, and deploy AI models.\n3. **Creative Problem-Solving:** AI can automate routine tasks, but it often requires human creativity to solve complex, open-ended problems.\n4. **Critical Thinking and Analysis:** Professionals who can think critically, analyze complex information, and make informed decisions will be in high demand.\n5. **Emotional Intelligence and Empathy:** As AI takes over routine tasks, human skills like empathy, emotional intelligence, and social skills will become more valuable.\n6. **Lifelong Learning:** The ability to continuously learn, adapt, and upskill will be crucial in an AI-driven job market.\n7. **Digital Literacy:** Basic understanding of digital tools, programming languages, and data analysis will be essential for many jobs.\n8. **Soft Skills:** Skills like communication, collaboration, and project management will remain valuable as AI augment human capabilities.\n\n**Emerging job roles:** Some new job roles that may emerge in the AI-driven job market include:\n\n1. **AI Ethicist:** Ensuring AI systems are developed and used in an ethical and responsible manner.\n2. **Data Detective:** Investigating and resolving data quality issues to ensure AI systems are accurate and reliable.\n3. **AI Trainer:** Training and fine-tuning AI models to perform specific tasks and improve their accuracy.\n4. **Virtual Reality Experience Designer:** Creating immersive experiences that combine AI, VR, and human interaction.\n5. **Autonomous Systems Engineer:** Designing and developing autonomous systems that can operate safely and efficiently.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just a few examples, and the job market is constantly evolving.
