It seems like you're planning to work on your \"racking\" skills, but I'm assuming you meant to say \"racing\" or \"track riding\" skills?\n\nAssuming that's the case, recording your practice session is an excellent idea! Video analysis can be a powerful tool to help you improve your riding skills. By reviewing your footage, you can:\n\n1. **Identify areas for improvement**: Slow down and analyze specific sections of the course to identify areas where you can improve, such as braking points, turn-in points, or acceleration zones.\n2. **Analyze your body position**: Check your body position, bike setup, and control inputs to ensure you're maintaining proper technique and making adjustments as needed.\n3. **Refine your line choice**: Review your line selection and identify opportunities to improve your path through the course, which can help you shave off precious seconds.\n4. **Develop a more efficient riding style**: By analyzing your riding style, you can identify areas where you can be more efficient, such as smoother transitions, more precise braking, or more aggressive acceleration.\n\nTo get the most out of video analysis, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Use a high-quality camera**: Mount a high-quality camera, such as a GoPro or similar action camera, to capture clear and stable footage.\n2. **Mount the camera strategically**: Position the camera to capture a clear view of your riding, such as on your helmet, bike, or from a trackside vantage point.\n3. **Record from multiple angles**: If possible, record from multiple angles to get a more comprehensive view of your riding.\n4. **Review and analyze with a critical eye**: Take the time to review your footage carefully, focusing on specific areas of improvement and making notes on what you need to work on.\n\nRemember to stay safe and focused during your practice session, and I hope you and Mike have a great time at the autoshop!",
