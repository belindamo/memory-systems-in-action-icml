  "content": "While both outdoor and indoor exercises can benefit your general health, being outdoors and engaging in activities like hiking and camping may provide additional benefits that could improve eye health. For example, hiking and camping allow you to enjoy natural light and a range of distances, which can help to maintain proper eye focusing and reduce eye strain. Additionally, outdoor activities often involve exposure to fresh air and natural scenery, which can help to reduce stress and improve overall well-being. However, it's important to note that indoor exercises, such as yoga or pilates, can also have positive benefits for overall health and stress reduction, and may also be a part of a healthy lifestyle. Ultimately, the key is to find activities that you enjoy and that work for you, and to ensure that you are taking steps to protect your eyes when you are outside or engaging in any physical activity.",
