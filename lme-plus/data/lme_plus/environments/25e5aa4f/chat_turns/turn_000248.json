The strip-set imitates a fleeing baitfish, which can trigger an aggressive response from trout.\n\n**Strip-set technique for Lake Michigan trout in the spring:**\n\n* **Quick, short strips**: Use quick, short strips of about 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) to imitate a baitfish darting away.\n* **Vary the speed**: Experiment with different strip speeds to find what the trout respond to. You can try fast, aggressive strips or slower, more subtle strips.\n* **Add some pause**: After a few strips, pause for a moment to let the streamer sink or suspend in the water. This can give the trout a chance to catch up and strike.\n* **Mix it up**: Combine the strip-set with other retrieval actions, such as a steady retrieve or a pause-and-strip sequence, to keep the trout guessing.\n\nThe strip-set technique can be particularly effective in the spring when trout are more aggressive and actively chasing baitfish. Lake Michigan trout are known to be aggressive, so they may respond well to this type of presentation.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Use the right line**: A sink-tip or sinking line can help you get your streamer down to the desired depth quickly, and then you can use the strip-set technique to retrieve it.\n* **Choose the right streamer**: A smaller, more agile streamer like a Woolly Bugger can be ideal for the strip-set technique, as it can move quickly and erratically through the water.\n* **Pay attention to the water**: Adjust your strip-set technique based on the water conditions. In clearer water, you may need to use a more subtle presentation, while in murkier water, you can be more aggressive.\n\nBy incorporating the strip-set technique into your streamer fishing repertoire, you'll be well-equipped to entice those Lake Michigan trout into striking. Good luck, and have fun experimenting with different retrieval speeds and actions!",
