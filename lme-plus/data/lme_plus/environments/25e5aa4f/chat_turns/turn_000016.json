  "content": "I'd say my personal style is more modern and minimalist. The apartment is around 700 sq ft, it's a one-bedroom, and the layout is pretty open-plan. I'm really into neutral colors like beige, gray, and white, so I think I'll stick to those for the main color palette. I'm not really sure about specific design elements yet, but I do know I want to make the most of the natural light. Budget-wise, I'm looking to spend around $2,000 to $3,000. By the way, I recently turned 30 and I'm feeling like it's time to take my life more seriously, so I want my apartment to reflect that.",
