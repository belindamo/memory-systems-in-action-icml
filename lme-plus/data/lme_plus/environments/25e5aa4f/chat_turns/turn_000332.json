There are many cities with art museums that have Monet's Water Lilies series or similar Impressionist pieces.\n\nCould you please tell me the name of your city or the nearest major city to you? That way, I can suggest art museums in your area that might have Monet's work or similar pieces.\n\nIf you're not sure, you can also try searching online for \"art museums near me\" or \"art museums in [your city/state]\" to get a list of options. Then, I can help you narrow down the list based on their collections and exhibits.\n\nLet me know, and I'll do my best to assist you in planning a great art-filled day with your sister!",
