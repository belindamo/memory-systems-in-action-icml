It's great that you've taken proactive steps to establish a relaxing pre-sleep routine and set boundaries around your work-life balance.\n\nLight stretching and yoga poses can indeed help relax your muscles, calm your mind, and prepare your body for a restful night's sleep. By incorporating these practices into your daily routine, you're investing in your overall well-being and sleep quality.\n\nBy avoiding work emails and messages after 9 PM, you're also creating a healthy separation between your work and personal life. This can help reduce stress, anxiety, and the likelihood of work-related thoughts creeping into your sleep time.\n\nRemember, establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a sleep-conducive environment, and developing relaxing bedtime routines are all crucial for improving sleep quality. You're on the right track, and it's fantastic that you're taking steps to prioritize your sleep and overall well-being!\n\nHere are a few more tips to consider:\n\n1. **Gradually wind down**: Try to start winding down at least 30 minutes to an hour before bedtime. This can include activities like reading, listening to calming music, or practicing gentle stretches.\n2. **Make your bedroom a sleep sanctuary**: Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n3. **Avoid screens before bed**: The blue light emitted from screens can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime or use blue light filtering glasses or apps.\n4. **Write down your thoughts**: If you find yourself lying awake due to racing thoughts, try writing down your concerns or to-do lists before bed. This can help clear your mind and reduce stress.\n\nKeep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance!",
