  "content": "You're absolutely on the right track! A blond roux with saut\u00e9ed garlic and onion will add a deep, rich flavor to your creamy tomato sauce. The lightly golden color and nutty aroma will complement the bright, tangy flavors of the tomatoes perfectly.\n\nRemember to whisk constantly when adding the flour to the fat, and cook the roux for about 2 minutes, or until it reaches a lightly golden color and has a nutty aroma. Then, gradually add the oat milk, whisking continuously to prevent lumps.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to try out these techniques! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a blast cooking up a storm and enjoying your delicious creamy tomato sauce with roasted cherry tomatoes and zucchini!\n\nHappy cooking, and I look forward to hearing about your culinary adventures!",
