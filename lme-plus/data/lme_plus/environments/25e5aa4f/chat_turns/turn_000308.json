  "content": "That's a great approach! Booking the court first will give you a sense of security and ensure that you have a dedicated time slot to practice. And focusing on volleys is a fantastic goal - it's an important aspect of tennis that can really elevate your game.\n\nOnce you've booked the court, you can reach out to Rachel and confirm the details with her. It's always more fun to practice with a partner, and it's great that you're making time for it.\n\nDo you have a preferred time slot in mind for Saturday? Are you a morning, afternoon, or evening player?\n\nAlso, have you considered warming up before your practice session? A good warm-up can help prevent injuries and get you ready to focus on your volleys.",
