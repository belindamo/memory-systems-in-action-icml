However, I can offer some suggestions to help you find the latest pasta coupons:\n\n1. **Check the manufacturer's website**: Visit the website of your preferred pasta brand (e.g., Barilla, Ronzoni, Buitoni) to see if they have any current promotions, discounts, or printable coupons.\n2. **Sign up for newsletters**: Register for newsletters from your favorite pasta brands or online coupon platforms (like Coupons.com, RetailMeNot, or Groupon) to receive exclusive offers and updates on new coupons.\n3. **Follow social media**: Follow your preferred pasta brands on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, as they often post special promotions, discounts, or coupon codes.\n4. **Check online coupon aggregators**: Websites like Coupons.com, CouponCabin, or SmartSource often feature a wide range of coupons for various products, including pasta.\n5. **Look for digital coupons**: Many retailers, like Target, Walmart, or Kroger, offer digital coupons that you can load onto your loyalty card or mobile app.\n6. **Check your local newspapers**: Although not as common as they used to be, some newspapers still carry coupon inserts that may feature pasta coupons.\n\nRegarding the 10% off coupon you used on the 15th, I'm glad you found it helpful! If you can provide more details about the coupon (e.g., where you got it, the brand, or the promo code), I might be able to help you find similar offers.\n\nRemember to always check the expiration dates and terms of any coupon before using it to ensure it's valid and applicable to your purchase. Happy pasta shopping!",
