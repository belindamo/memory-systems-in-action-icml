  "content": "I used a pretty basic recipe with chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil. I was surprised by how easy it was to make and how much better it tasted than store-bought hummus. I've been dipping raw veggies in it instead of reaching for crackers or chips, which has been a nice change.\n\nI have thought about trying other dips and spreads, actually. I've been wanting to try making guacamole, and I've also heard great things about roasted red pepper hummus. Do you have any tips or recommendations for those recipes?",
