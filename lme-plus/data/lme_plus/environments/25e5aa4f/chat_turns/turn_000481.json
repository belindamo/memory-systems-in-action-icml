The hike you took must have been breathtaking, and I can only imagine the stunning views from the top.\n\nIt's great that you also got to spend quality time with your sister's family and explore the city together. The Denver Zoo is always a hit with kids, and I'm sure they had a blast seeing all the animals up close.\n\nAnd, of course, no trip to Denver would be complete without trying some of the local craft beer and food scene! Denver is known for its vibrant culinary scene, and I'm sure you discovered some new favorite brews and eats.\n\nI'm curious, what was your favorite part of the hike in Rocky Mountain National Park? Was there a particular view or moment that stood out to you?\n\nAlso, did you have a favorite brewery or restaurant that you discovered during your trip? I'm always looking for new recommendations!",
