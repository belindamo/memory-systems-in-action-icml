  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have an opinion. However, some people do feel that American Idol could do more to support contestants after the show has ended. Some have suggested that the series could invest more in helping winners and finalists develop their careers post-show, providing them with ongoing mentorship, resources, and industry connections. There has also been debate around whether AI could do a better job of promoting alumnae and featuring their performances and music on the show, helping to maintain the buzz around their careers. Ultimately, the question of how AI could better support former contestants is a complex one, and would involve consideration of numerous factors, including budget, resources, and the goals of the series itself.",
