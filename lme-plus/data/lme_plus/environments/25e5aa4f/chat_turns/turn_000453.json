  "content": "\"As a creative director in the world of 3D motion design, I know firsthand the power of fear. I've been afraid of failing, of not being good enough, of not living up to my own expectations. These fears almost held me back from completing a 3D motion design video that I was working on as part of a course in 2020. But despite these fears, I made the decision to face them and continue pursuing my passion for this field.\n\nIt's not always easy and I'm definitely not perfect in this approach. But my experience as a product manager has taught me the value of hard work and a willingness to learn from my mistakes. These skills have helped me to overcome my fears and continue pursuing my dreams.\n\nOn the course, I learned all the skills I needed in the pipeline - from coming up with ideas and creating mood boards to blocking, lighting, and working with materials and compositing. It was a challenging process, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nI still have a lot to learn and explore in the world of 3D motion design. But I'm dedicated to continuing my journey and seeing where it takes me. It's a challenging and exciting process, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.\n\nTo all my fellow creatives out there, don't let fear hold you back from pursuing your passions. Embrace imperfection and take the leap. You never know where it will take you.\"",
