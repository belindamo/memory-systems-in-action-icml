Here are some tips to help you decide what to keep, donate, or sell:\n\n**The Keep Criteria:**\n\n1. **The Joy Factor**: Does the item bring you joy or make you feel confident and happy when you wear it?\n2. **Frequency of Use**: Have you worn the item in the past year? Be honest!\n3. **Fit and Comfort**: Does the item fit well, and is it comfortable to wear?\n4. **Condition**: Is the item in good condition, or can it be easily repaired?\n5. **Versatility**: Can the item be paired with multiple other pieces in your wardrobe?\n\n**The Donate/Sell Criteria:**\n\n1. **Haven't worn it in a year**: If you haven't worn an item in a year, it's likely you won't miss it.\n2. **Ill-fitting or uncomfortable**: If an item doesn't fit well or is uncomfortable, it's time to let it go.\n3. **Stained, torn, or damaged**: If an item is beyond repair, it's time to say goodbye.\n4. **Out of style or outdated**: If an item is no longer in style or doesn't fit with your current personal style, consider letting it go.\n5. **Duplicates**: If you have multiple items that serve the same purpose, consider keeping only your favorite and donating or selling the rest.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Try the \"hanger trick\"**: Hang clothes with the hook facing the opposite direction. When you wear an item, hang it back up with the hook facing the normal direction. After a few months, consider donating or storing items that are still facing the opposite direction.\n2. **Create a \"maybe\" box**: Place items you're unsure about in a box and set a deadline, like six months, to revisit the item. If you haven't worn or thought about it by then, it's likely safe to let it go.\n3. **Consider the 80/20 rule**: 80% of the time, you likely wear 20% of your clothes. Identify your favorite, most-worn items and consider letting go of the rest.\n4. **Don't feel guilty**: It's okay to let go of gifts or items that no longer serve you. Remember, the goal is to create a closet that makes you feel confident and happy.\n5. **Keep sentimental items in check**: If you're holding onto items for sentimental reasons, consider taking a photo of the item and letting it go. You'll still have the memory, but you'll also free up space in your closet.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a curated closet that makes you feel great and makes getting dressed easier.\n\nHow do you feel about getting started with the purging process?",
