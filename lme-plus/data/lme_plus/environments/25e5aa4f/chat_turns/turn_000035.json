  "content": "Yes, I think that the rise of superhero movies and TV shows has also contributed to the increasing legitimacy of graphic novels. Seeing these characters and stories adapted into big-budget films and popular television shows has helped to bring them to a wider audience and generate interest in the original source material. \n\nMany people who may not have been exposed to graphic novels before may now be more interested in reading them after seeing their favorite superhero story on the big screen or on TV. This has helped to break down some of the earlier stereotypes associated with comics and graphic novels and has shown that they can be just as engaging and thought-provoking as any other form of literature. \n\nFurthermore, with the success of superhero movies and TV shows, there has been an increased recognition of the potential for graphic novels to tell innovative and compelling stories that resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds. This has helped to elevate the genre and put it on equal footing with more traditional forms of literature, further contributing to its legitimacy as a legitimate form of storytelling.",
