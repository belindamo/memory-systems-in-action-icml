  "content": "\"I have fears. I'm afraid of failing, of not being good enough, of not living up to my expectations. And these fears almost held me back from completing a 3D motion design video that I was working on as part of a course in 2020. But despite these fears, I made the decision to face them and continue pursuing my passion for 3D motion design.\n\nIt's not always easy and I'm definitely not perfect. In fact, I make plenty of mistakes along the way. But my experience as a product manager has taught me the value of hard work and a willingness to learn from my mistakes. These skills have helped me to overcome my fears and continue pursuing my dreams.\n\nI learned all the skills I needed in the pipeline - from coming up with ideas and creating mood boards to blocking, lighting, and working with materials and compositing. It was a challenging process, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nI'm not a super star in the field yet and I still have a lot to learn. But I'm dedicated to continuing my journey in 3D motion design and seeing where it takes me. It's a vulnerable and challenging process, but I'm excited for the opportunity to grow and learn.\n\nDon't let fear hold you back from pursuing your passions. Embrace imperfection and take the leap. You never know where it will take you.\"",
