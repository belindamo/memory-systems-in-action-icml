Here are some tips to help you create a perfect roux:\n\n**The Basics:**\n\n1. **Choose the right fat**: Use a neutral-tasting oil or vegan butter with a high smoke point, such as canola oil or Earth Balance. This will help prevent the roux from burning or developing an unpleasant flavor.\n2. **Select the right flour**: All-purpose flour is a great choice for a roux. You can also use whole wheat flour or a combination of all-purpose and cornstarch for added thickness.\n\n**The Technique:**\n\n1. **Use the right ratio**: Aim for a 1:1 ratio of fat to flour. For example, use 2 tablespoons of fat and 2 tablespoons of flour.\n2. **Heat the fat**: Place the fat in a saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, let it simmer for about 1 minute to ensure it's hot and ready for the flour.\n3. **Add the flour**: Gradually add the flour to the hot fat, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Make sure to add the flour in a steady stream, as this will help to cook the flour evenly.\n4. **Cook the roux**: Continue whisking and cooking the roux for about 2-3 minutes, or until it reaches your desired color. You can cook the roux to various levels of doneness, depending on the flavor you're aiming for:\n\t* **Blond roux**: Cook for 2 minutes, until the roux is lightly golden and has a nutty aroma. This is great for creamy sauces.\n\t* **Brown roux**: Cook for 3-5 minutes, until the roux is darker and has a rich, nutty flavor. This is perfect for gumbo or \u00e9touff\u00e9e.\n5. **Smell and taste**: As you cook the roux, pay attention to the aroma and flavor. If it starts to smell nutty or toasted, it's ready. If it tastes bitter or burnt, it's overcooked.\n6. **Add the liquid**: Gradually add the oat milk or other liquid to the roux, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it thickens.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Use aromatics**: Add some saut\u00e9ed onions, garlic, or shallots to the fat before adding the flour for added flavor.\n* **Spice it up**: Add a pinch of cayenne pepper, paprika, or dried herbs to the roux for extra flavor.\n* **Make ahead**: You can make a roux ahead of time and store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a rich, flavorful roux that will elevate your creamy tomato sauce to the next level!",
