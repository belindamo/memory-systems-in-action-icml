This will help to reduce the liquid and intensify the flavors.\n2. **Add a roux**: Mix 1-2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour with a small amount of oil or vegan butter to create a roux. Cook the roux for 1-2 minutes, then gradually add the oat milk, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. This will help to thicken the sauce.\n3. **Use a slurry**: Mix 1-2 tablespoons of cornstarch or tapioca starch with a small amount of water or oat milk until smooth. Add the slurry to the sauce and simmer for a few minutes, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens.\n4. **Add a creamy element**: Introduce a creamy element like vegan cream, soy creamer, or cashew cream (soaked cashews blended with water) to the sauce. This will not only thicken the sauce but also add a rich and creamy texture.\n5. **Simmer with potatoes**: Yes, you read that right! Dice a potato and add it to the sauce. As the potato cooks, it will release its starches and help to thicken the sauce. Simply remove the potato before serving.\n\nWhen using oat milk, it's essential to cook the sauce for a longer period to allow the flavors to meld together and the sauce to thicken. You can also try adding a pinch of salt to help bring out the flavors and thicken the sauce.\n\nRemember, the key is to experiment and find the right balance for your taste preferences. Start with one method and adjust as needed to achieve your desired consistency and flavor.\n\nNow, go ahead and get creative with your sauce!",
