  "content": "I have fears. I'm afraid of failing, of not being good enough, of not living up to my expectations. And these fears almost held me back from doing what I wish to. Actually, I've not finished a 3D motion design video that I was working on as part of a course in 2020. I learned all the skills I needed in the pipeline - from coming up with ideas and creating mood boards to blocking, lighting, and working with materials and compositing. It was a challenging process, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow. \n\nIt's not always easy and I'm definitely not perfect at this approach. But my experience as a product manager has taught me the value of hard work and a willingness to learn from my mistakes. These skills have helped me to overcome my fears and continue pursuing my dreams.\n\nDon't let fear hold you back from pursuing your passions. Embrace imperfection and take the leap. You never know where it will take you.\n\nPlease change this a bit, maybe add something or correct",
