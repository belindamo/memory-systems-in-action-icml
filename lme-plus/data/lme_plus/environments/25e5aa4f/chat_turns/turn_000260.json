Keeping it subtle is a great approach, as it will allow the natural beauty of the linen fabric to shine through.\n\nSmall stars or leaves are perfect for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Delicate touch**: They're small and delicate, so they won't overpower the fabric or overwhelm the overall design.\n2. **Nature-inspired**: Leaves and stars are both nature-inspired motifs that will complement the natural fibers of the linen fabric.\n3. **Easy to execute**: They're simple designs that can be easily embroidered, even for beginners.\n\nTo make the most of your embroidery design, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Choose a matching thread color**: Select a thread color that closely matches the natural color of the linen fabric. This will help the embroidery blend in and create a subtle look.\n2. **Use a simple stitch**: Opt for a simple running stitch or a small satin stitch to keep the design understated.\n3. **Space them out**: Scatter the stars or leaves around the hem in a random pattern to create a playful, whimsical feel.\n4. **Keep it sparse**: Don't overdo it \u2013 a few strategically placed motifs will make a bigger impact than a dense, overly embroidered design.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll create a beautiful, understated embroidery design that complements the natural beauty of your linen fabric.
