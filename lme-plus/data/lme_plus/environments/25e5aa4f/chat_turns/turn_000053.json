  "content": "If you prefer milder flavors, I would suggest trying Khao Moo Daeng, which is sliced pork and crispy pork belly served with rice and a sweet sauce. You could also try Moo Ping, which are grilled pork skewers that are not typically very spicy. Finally, if you have a sweet tooth, Mango Sticky Rice is a must-try dessert that is not spicy at all.",
