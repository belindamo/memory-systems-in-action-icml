However, the stores I mentioned should have enough options to get you started.\n\nIf you're looking for more international or specialty items, you might want to consider visiting larger supermarkets or import stores in other areas of Tokyo. Some popular options include:\n\n* **National Azabu Junction** (Roppongi): A large supermarket with an extensive international section and a wide selection of imported goods.\n* **Kaldi Coffee Farm** (Various locations): A coffee shop and import store with a wide selection of international snacks, drinks, and ingredients.\n* **Tokyo Central Market** (Tsukiji): A large marketplace with a variety of food stalls and shops selling fresh seafood, meats, and produce.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy grocery shopping in Shimokitazawa!",
