I'm afraid I have some bad news: there is no specific \"City Art Museum\" that I can identify, and it's likely that you're not providing a real location.\n\nAs a conversational AI, I don't have the ability to know your personal experiences or locations. I can only respond based on general information and data.\n\nIf you're interested in finding an art museum with Monet's Water Lilies series, I'd be happy to help you search for museums in your area or provide information on famous museums that have Impressionist collections. Alternatively, you can try searching online for \"art museums near me\" or \"museums with Monet's Water Lilies\" to find options.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!",
