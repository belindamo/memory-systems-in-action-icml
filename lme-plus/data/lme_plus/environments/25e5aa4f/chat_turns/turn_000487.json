Binge-watching five episodes in one night is quite the feat!\n\nSince you're looking for something similar to \"The Crown\" but not on Netflix, I've got some recommendations for you:\n\n1. **Victoria** (PBS Masterpiece Amazon Prime Video): As I mentioned earlier, this ITV series follows the reign of Queen Victoria and is a great companion piece to \"The Crown.\" You can stream it on Amazon Prime Video or purchase individual episodes/seasons.\n2. **The Royals** (E! via Hulu or Amazon Prime Video): This drama series explores the lives of a fictional British royal family, with a focus on the scandals, romance, and power struggles within the palace.\n3. **The White Princess** (Starz via Amazon Prime Video or Hulu): This miniseries is a sequel to \"The White Queen\" and follows the marriage of Elizabeth of York and King Henry VII, exploring the tumultuous early years of the Tudor dynasty.\n4. **Reign** (The CW via Hulu or Amazon Prime Video): While you mentioned you've seen some of it, if you haven't finished the entire series, it's worth revisiting. This show offers a more fictionalized take on the life of Mary Queen of Scots and her struggles in 16th-century Scotland and France.\n5. **Sanditon** (PBS Masterpiece Amazon Prime Video): Although not exclusively a royal drama, this adaptation of Jane Austen's unfinished novel explores the lives of the wealthy and aspiring in a seaside town during the early 19th century.\n\nAll of these options are available to stream or purchase through Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, or other services. You might need to subscribe to these platforms or purchase individual episodes/seasons, but they're worth exploring if you're craving more royal drama!\n\nKeep in mind that some of these shows might not have the same production values or historical accuracy as \"The Crown,\" but they share similar themes and settings that might appeal to fans of royal dramas.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or need more recommendations!",
