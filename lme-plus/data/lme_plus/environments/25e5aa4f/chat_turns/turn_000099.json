I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to retain information about individual users or their coupon usage.\n\nThat being said, I can offer some general guidance on finding coupons for meal kit delivery services. You can try the following:\n\n1. **Check the meal kit brand's website**: Visit the website of the meal kit delivery service you're interested in and look for a \"Deals\" or \"Promotions\" section.
