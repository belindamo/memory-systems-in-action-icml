  "content": "As an AI judge, Kara DioGuardi felt that the show significantly impacted the trajectory of contestants' careers after the series ended. She believed that those who were successful on the show often struggled to establish their identity and career once the series ended, as they were known primarily for being an AI contestant. In contrast, those who didn't make it far on the show often had more freedom to develop their sound and career without being tied to the AI brand. DioGuardi also noted that the show's emphasis on having a \"big moment\" each week sometimes encouraged singers to prioritize showmanship over building a sustainable career as an artist.",
