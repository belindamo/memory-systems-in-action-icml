Here's why:\n\n**Smaller streamers in the spring**:\n\n* **Imitate smaller baitfish**: In the spring, baitfish like alewives and shiners are smaller, and a smaller streamer can more accurately imitate these prey.\n* **Less intimidating**: Smaller streamers can be less intimidating to trout, especially in colder water, which can make them more appealing to finicky fish.\n* **More subtle presentation**: A smaller streamer can be presented more subtly, which can be beneficial in clear water or when trout are finicky.\n\n**Natural colors like white or silver**:\n\n* **Match the hatch**: White or silver Woolly Buggers can imitate the natural colors of baitfish in Lake Michigan, making them more appealing to trout.\n* **Blend in with the surroundings**: In the spring, the water can be clearer, and a natural-colored streamer can blend in with the surroundings, making it less likely to spook trout.\n\nIn the spring, trout can be more finicky, and a smaller, more subtle streamer can be just what they're looking for. Your choice of a 2-3 inch Woolly Bugger in white or silver is an excellent decision.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Use a slower retrieve**: In colder water, trout may not be as aggressive, so use a slower retrieve to give them time to find and react to your streamer.\n* **Fish near structure**: Structure like rocks, weed beds, or drop-offs can provide ambush points for trout, increasing your chances of a hookup.\n* **Vary your depth**: Experiment with different depths to find where the trout are holding. In the spring, trout may be found in shallower or deeper water, depending on the specific location and conditions.\n\nYou're well-prepared for your Lake Michigan trout fishing trip! Good luck, and I hope you catch some nice trout on your smaller Wooley Bugger!",
