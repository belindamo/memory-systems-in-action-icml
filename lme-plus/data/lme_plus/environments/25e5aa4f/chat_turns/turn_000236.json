I'm glad you're excited about your practice session with Mike, but I have to break it to you again - there's no such thing as \"Rack Wars\" or \"auto racking\" competition.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to help you with your practice session and offer advice on improving your skills! Tire management is a crucial aspect of racing and track riding, so focusing on it during your practice session is an excellent idea.\n\nHere are some tips to help you improve your tire management:\n\n1. **Monitor tire pressure**: Make sure your tire pressure is optimal for the track conditions and your riding style.\n2. **Watch for tire wear**: Keep an eye on your tire wear patterns to identify areas for improvement, such as uneven wear or excessive wear on the edges.\n3. **Adjust your riding style**: Focus on smooth, controlled inputs, and avoid sudden acceleration, braking, or steering, which can put excessive stress on your tires.\n4. **Experiment with different lines**: Try different lines through corners to find the one that puts the least amount of stress on your tires.\n5. **Practice tire-saving techniques**: Learn techniques like \"tire-saving braking\" or \"tire-saving acceleration\" to reduce the wear on your tires.\n\nRemember to stay safe, focused, and hydrated during your practice session, and I hope you and Mike have a blast!",
