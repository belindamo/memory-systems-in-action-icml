  "content": "Machu Picchu was an ancient Inca city built in the 15th century in the mountains of Peru. Its purpose is still debated, but it is believed to have served as a royal estate and religious sanctuary for the Inca emperor Pachacuti and his followers.\n\nMachu Picchu was largely abandoned by the Inca in the 16th century during the Spanish conquest of South America. It was then largely forgotten and remained hidden for centuries until it was rediscovered in 1911 by American archaeologist Hiram Bingham. Bingham was searching for Vilcabamba, the last Inca stronghold that fell to the Spanish, but instead stumbled upon Machu Picchu. Bingham and his team cleared away the overgrown vegetation and documented the site, drawing the world's attention to the lost city.",
