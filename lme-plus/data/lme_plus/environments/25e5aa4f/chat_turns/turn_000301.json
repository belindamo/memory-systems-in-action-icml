I've been eyeing that parka from The North Face, but it's a bit pricey, so I'm not sure if I want to splurge on it just yet. Maybe I'll wait until it goes on sale. By the way, I've been really loving my red sweater lately - I've worn it 7 times since I got it three weeks ago, and it's become a staple in my wardrobe. I think I'll try to find a coat that will complement it well.",
