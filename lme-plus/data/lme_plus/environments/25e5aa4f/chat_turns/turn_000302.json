If you're not ready to splurge just yet, waiting for a sale is a great idea. You can also consider looking for similar styles from other brands or last season's models, which might be more affordable.\n\nIt's great to hear that your red sweater has become a staple in your wardrobe! Finding a coat that complements it well will be a great addition to your winter wardrobe. Since your sweater is a bold, bright color, you may want to consider a coat in a neutral color that will provide a nice contrast. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Neutral colors**: Look for coats in neutral colors like black, navy, gray, beige, or olive green. These colors will provide a nice background for your red sweater and won't compete with it.\n2. **Earth tones**: Earthy colors like brown, tan, or camel can complement the red sweater nicely and add a warm, cozy touch to your outfit.\n3. **Soft pastels**: If you want to add a touch of softness to your outfit, consider a coat in a soft pastel color like pale pink, baby blue, or mint green. These colors will create a nice contrast with the bold red sweater.\n\nWhen trying on coats, make sure to wear your red sweater underneath to get a sense of how the colors work together. You may also want to consider the style of the coat, such as a parka, pea coat, or trench coat, to see which one works best with your sweater.\n\nHow do you feel about shopping during sales or looking for discounts? Do you have a budget in mind for your new coat?",
