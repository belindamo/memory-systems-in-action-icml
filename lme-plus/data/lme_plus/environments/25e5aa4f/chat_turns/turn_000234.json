I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries.\n\nI never mentioned participating in a \"Rack Wars\" auto racking competition, nor did I provide any information about such an event. It's possible that you might have misremembered or misinterpreted our conversation.\n\nIf you have any questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to help. But I assure you, there's no such thing as \"Rack Wars\" or \"auto racking\" competition!",
