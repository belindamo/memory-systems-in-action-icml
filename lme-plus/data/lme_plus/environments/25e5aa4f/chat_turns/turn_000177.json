  "content": "Sure, here's a four-column table that maps out a one-year SMART plan for a college student who is mapping out their career goals:\n\n| Goal | Specifics (S) | Metrics (M) | Timeline (T) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Get an internship | Apply to at least 10 internships per week for the next 2 months | Secure an internship with a major company in the field of interest | 6 months |\n| Improve public speaking skills | Attend at least 3 public speaking workshops/seminars | Deliver a presentation to an audience of at least 25 people with confidence and clarity | 3 months |\n| Build professional network | Attend at least 2 networking events per month | Add 50 new contacts to professional network on LinkedIn | 12 months |\n| Gain experience in leadership | Join a student organization and take up a leadership role | Successfully plan and execute at least 2 events as a leader of the organization | 9 months |\n\nIn this table, the first column outlines the student's specific career goals, such as getting an internship, improving public speaking skills, building a professional network, and gaining experience in leadership. The second column outlines the specific actions the student will take to achieve each goal, such as applying to at least 10 internships per week, attending public speaking workshops, attending networking events, and taking up a leadership role in a student organization.\n\nThe third column outlines the metrics that the student will use to measure their progress towards each goal, such as securing an internship with a major company, delivering a confident and clear presentation, adding 50 new contacts to their professional network, and successfully planning and executing events as a leader of a student organization.\n\nThe fourth column outlines the timeline for each goal, with specific deadlines for achieving intermediate benchmarks and ultimately achieving the goal within one year. By mapping out their goals in this way, the student can create a concrete plan of action and track their progress over time.",
