  "content": "10 am sounds like a great time slot! The morning sun will be shining, and the court should be nice and quiet. You'll be able to get in a good practice session before the afternoon crowds arrive.\n\nExcellent to hear that you already have a warm-up routine in place! It's essential to get your muscles ready for the physical demands of tennis. A proper warm-up can help prevent injuries and get you in the right mindset for your practice session.\n\nNow, when you book the court, make sure to confirm their policies and rules. Some community centers might have specific regulations or restrictions, so it's always a good idea to double-check.\n\nAfter you've booked the court, you can shoot Rachel a text or give her a call to confirm the details. I'm sure she'll be excited to hit the court with you again!\n\nDo you have a favorite drill or exercise that you like to use to practice your volleys?",
