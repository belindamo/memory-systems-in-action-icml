  "content": "That's really helpful to know about Asana's integrations. Since I've recently attended a 3-day project management workshop and earned 21 professional development units (PDUs) for attending, I'm eager to apply what I learned and explore tools like Asana to improve my project management skills. Can you tell me more about Asana's reporting features? How can I use them to track progress and identify areas for improvement?",
