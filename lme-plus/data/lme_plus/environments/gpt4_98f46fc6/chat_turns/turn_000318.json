These vendors contact the employer and obtain the necessary information.\n3. **Phone or email verification**: The lender may contact the employer directly via phone or email to verify the employment information.\n4. **Online portal**: Some employers have an online portal where lenders can access employment information and verify employment status.\n\n**What information is typically requested on a VOE?**\n\nA VOE typically includes the following information:\n\n1. **Employee name and ID number**: The employee's name and ID number or other identifying information.\n2. **Job title and duties**: The employee's job title and a brief description of their job duties.\n3. **Employment status**: The employee's current employment status, such as full-time, part-time, or temporary.\n4. **Length of employment**: The length of time the employee has been employed with the company.\n5. **Income information**: The employee's income, including salary, hourly wage, or commission rate.\n6. **Probability of continued employment**: The employer's assessment of the likelihood of the employee's continued employment.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* **Check with your employer**: If you're unsure about the VOE process, check with your HR department or supervisor to see if they have a standard VOE form or process.\n* **Provide accurate information**: Ensure that the information provided on the VOE is accurate and up-to-date to avoid delays or issues with your loan application.\n* **Be prepared to explain**: Be prepared to explain any gaps in employment or changes in income to the lender.\n\nBy understanding the VOE process, you'll be better prepared to provide the necessary information and documentation to support your loan application.",
