Here are a few examples of supplements that may aid in heart health:\n\n1. Omega-3 fatty acids: These are found in fatty fish or fish oil supplements, and may help lower triglycerides and improve heart health.\n\n2. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): This is a substance that is naturally found in the body and can also be found in supplement form. It may help improve heart health by reducing inflammation and improving blood flow.\n\n3. Fiber supplements: These supplements can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\n4. Magnesium supplements: Magnesium is important for heart health and can be found in supplement form. It may help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nAlthough these supplements may offer some benefits for heart health, it's always recommended to talk to a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.
