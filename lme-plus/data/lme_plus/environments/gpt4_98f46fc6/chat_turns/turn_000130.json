Canurta expects to have its 7,800 square feet (with opportunity for expansion) agri-processing building - built following National Farm Building Code and according to GMP specifications - raised on an identified property fitted with all infrastructures. This will allow for streamlining production and ensuring that standards are met throughout manufacturing, development, and delivery processes.
