This will give you 45 minutes to get ready for your jog.\n\nHere's a suggested reminder schedule:\n\n* Monday: 6:45 AM - \"Time to get ready for morning jog!\"\n* Tuesday: 6:45 AM - \"Get moving! Morning jog time\"\n* Thursday: 6:45 AM - \"Rise and shine! Morning jog awaits\"\n\nFeel free to adjust the reminder times or messages to suit your preferences. Would you like me to suggest any other reminders or help with anything else?",
