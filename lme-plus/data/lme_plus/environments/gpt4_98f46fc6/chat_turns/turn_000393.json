  "content": "I've been doing some research on my own, and I stumbled upon some old family documents and deeds related to the property. It's been really interesting to dig through all that history and get a better sense of how the land has been passed down through our family over the generations. I was wondering, are there any specific documents or records that I should be looking for to get a better understanding of the property's history and any potential restrictions or easements?",
