Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Spicy Roasted Chickpeas Recipe**\n\n** Servings: ** About 1 cup (enough for 8-10 snacks)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 can chickpeas (15 ounces), drained and rinsed\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, but adds a nice depth of flavor)\n* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more to taste, for some heat)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven:** Set your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. **Rinse and dry the chickpeas:** Rinse the chickpeas with water, then dry them thoroughly with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.\n3. **Mix the spices:** In a small bowl, combine the cumin, smoked paprika (if using), garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.\n4. **Toss with olive oil and spices:** In a medium bowl, toss the chickpeas with the olive oil until they're evenly coated. Then, add the spice mixture and toss until the chickpeas are well-coated.\n5. **Spread on a baking sheet:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Spread the chickpeas out in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd the sheet.\n6. **Roast in the oven:** Roast the chickpeas in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until they're crispy and golden brown. Stir the chickpeas halfway through the roasting time to ensure even cooking.\n7. **Cool and enjoy:** Remove the chickpeas from the oven and let them cool completely on the baking sheet. Once cool, break them up into individual pieces and store them in an airtight container.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* For an extra crispy texture, try roasting the chickpeas at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning.\n* To add some extra flavor, try using different spices or seasonings, such as dried herbs (e.g., thyme, rosemary), grated Parmesan cheese, or lemon zest.\n* If you prefer a milder snack, reduce or omit the cayenne pepper.\n* You can also roast chickpeas in a skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until crispy and golden brown.\n\nThat's it! Enjoy your delicious Spicy Roasted Chickpeas at your charity bake sale or as a healthy snack at your office.",
