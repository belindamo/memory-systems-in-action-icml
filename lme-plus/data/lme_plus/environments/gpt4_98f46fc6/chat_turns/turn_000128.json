  "content": "re-write this paragraph highlighting blockchain technologies advantage in helping Canurta develop its drugs, natural health products, and various ingredients with batch-to-batch consistency in order to meet the high threshold set by regulators such as the FDA: Canurta will deploy blockchain technology paired with its physical supply chain to establish a digital ledger that enables full supply chain traceability \u2013 providing regulators, customers, consumers and other ecosystem partners with critical information related to the lifecycle of its products. We have developed our supply chain's digital twin on Hyperledger Iroha and will deploy it throughout the pilot-scale manufacturing of our molecules and assets, with the aim to have a working prototype as Canurta enters the market with its Activated Seed Powders.\n\nSupply chain management is complex, as it includes coordinating with intellectual properties (IPs), various levels of domestic and international governments, regulations, laws, logistics, and supply chain transparency. Our blockchain supply chain management system will provide a smarter solution to managing a sustainable supply chain.",
