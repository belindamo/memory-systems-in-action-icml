  "content": "Canurta is leveraging blockchain technology alongside its physical supply chain to establish a digital ledger that ensures full traceability, meeting the stringent requirements set by regulators such as the FDA. This approach provides regulators, customers, consumers, and ecosystem partners with essential information related to the lifecycle of our products, enabling batch-to-batch consistency.\n\nWe have created a digital twin of our supply chain using Hyperledger Iroha, which will be deployed throughout the pilot-scale manufacturing of our molecules and assets. Our goal is to have a working prototype as Canurta launches its Activated Seed Powders in the market.\n\nManaging a supply chain is a complex task, involving coordination with intellectual properties, various domestic and international government levels, regulations, laws, logistics, and ensuring transparency. By implementing a blockchain-based supply chain management system, Canurta offers a smarter, more sustainable solution to navigate these complexities.",
