  "content": "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n Mobility Where It Matters\n From Jeremy\nWe have talked an awful lot about being \u201cstill\u201d and maintaining stability. What about mobility, which is more or less the opposite of stillness? I get asked this a lot. For low back pain sufferers, the place in which you want to promote flexibility and mobility is in the hips and lower extremities. This short chapter teaches you how to increase and maintain flexibility in the muscles and mobility in the joints in the hips and lower extremities. These few exercises should be done every day. They will add only a minute or two to your workout time.\nA lack of flexibility in the big muscles of the lower extremities and lack of mobility in the hip joints will cause increased pressure and load on the lumbar spine while limiting blood flow to important areas. Maintaining flexibility and mobility requires a combination of dynamic mobilization exercises and static stretching. \nMobilizations\nWhen we refer to maintaining range of motion in a joint, we use the term \u201cmobility.\u201d This is not a stretch but rather a movement where the goal is to move the joint through its maximum range of motion without compromising the low back. For our purposes, hip mobility is the most important. As we have said throughout the book, we want to maximize movement in the hips while minimizing movement in the lumbar spine. \nAside from the effects of limited hip mobility on the low back, it is also important to maintain hip mobility for the health of the hip itself. The hip joint has no direct blood supply and therefore relies on the pressure generated by movement in the joint to \u201csqueeze\u201d nutrients (synovial fluid) into the joint space. The more limited your range of motion in the hip, the less synovial fluid is \u201csqueezed\u201d in and the hip will eventually suffer and degenerate. This can ultimately lead to a hip replacement and other operations. We promote maximum hip mobility by lengthening the muscles around the hip through stretching and by performing mobilization exercises to \u201coil\u201d the hip joint.\nHip Circles\nThis movement is an important mobilization. Do this one before you exercise. \n\nStep 1: Get on your hands and knees.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Lift one knee slightly and pretend to \u201cdraw\u201d circles on the floor with your kneecap, getting maximum range of motion out of the hip joint without moving your low back. In other words, your hip joint should be performing all of the movement. Your back should not move at all. Done properly, you should feel your abdominal muscles working pretty hard to keep your back still while you do this movement.\nStep 4: Do ten circles clockwise, ten counterclockwise, and then switch sides. \nDon\u2019t arch the low back or hike your hip. Keep the low back still and in place. \nStretches \nIn my experience, people tend to rely far too much on stretching when trying to heal their backs. Stretching has its place but must be done in combination with all of the other strategies (changing habits, spinal stabilization, strengthening the core) in this book. The more balanced and stable your spine and its related muscles become, the less you should need to stretch over time.\nTo increase flexibility in muscles, stretches need to be held for a good while, between forty-five and sixty seconds according to some research. The stretch also needs to be fairly intense to facilitate muscle lengthening. The stretches in this chapter are \u201cstatic\u201d stretches. Static stretches are held in place for long periods of time. These are done to promote muscle lengthening. These are not to be confused with \u201cdynamic\u201d stretches. Dynamic stretches are stretches that are performed with movement and are best done prior to exercises. The dynamic hamstring stretch in your daily routine is one example. \nThe key muscles to maintain flexibility are the hamstrings, glutes, piriformis, and psoas. For each of the following four stretches, try to hold for forty-five to sixty seconds with an intensity of about a 6/10. When performing the stretch, make sure that everything is relaxed except your arms, which are doing the work. Also maintain a light core brace to protect your back. Perform these stretches after exercise. \nHamstring Stretch\n\nStep 1: Get a belt, towel, or strap. It should about twice the length of your leg.\nStep 2: Lie on your back. Place the strap around your foot.\nStep 3: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 4: Slowly pull one leg up until you feel a moderate stretch (about a 6/10 in intensity).\nStep 5: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure your arms and core are the only parts of your body working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 6: Repeat on the other side. \nGlute Stretch\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back. Find neutral spine. Brace core lightly.\nStep 2: Cross one leg over the other.\nStep 3: Put your hands around the thigh of the uncrossed leg and use it as a lever to pull back the crossed leg, stretching the buttock.\nStep 4: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure that your arms and core are the only areas working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 5: Repeat on other side. \nPiriformis Stretch\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core. Bend one knee and bring it toward your chest.\nStep 3: Grab the top/outside of the foot of the bent leg with the opposite hand as shown.\nStep 4: With the other hand, grab the knee.\nStep 5: Pull the knee to the opposite shoulder, creating a stretch in the buttock area. \nStep 6: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure that your arms and core are the only areas working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 7: Repeat on other side. \nPsoas Stretch\nThis stretch is slightly more difficult than the others. The goal is to feel a stretch in the top of the thigh, groin, and inside the abdominal wall.\n\nStep 1: Get in a half-kneeling position: One leg will be in front of you, knee bent, and foot on the floor. The other leg will be below you, knee bent, with lower leg and knee resting on the floor. \nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Shift your body forward by \u201cpointing\u201d your hip bone straight out in front of you while simultaneously squeezing the glutes on that side. You should maintain neutral spine, not round your back or hinge forward at the hips. \nStep 4: Bring your arms up over your head. You should feel the stretch in the thigh, groin, and/or inner abdomen. Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Then switch sides.",
