  "content": "Great! I wanted to ask your help for the wording of a Purimspiel which I wish to record, about 3-5 minutes, the text of a video. It is supposed to present in a funny, cynical manner the present state of our religious community in Hungary, which was unfortunately unlawfully seized by the Chabad leader Rabbi Kovesh, who involved his good relations with the Hungarian leadership which is not completely democratic. He filled up the membership with more members than the number of original numbers, and subsequently changed all the leadership, board and president to his loyalists. The community members worked really hard for almost a year in order to retain independence, trying to get help from major rabbis and political leaders, so far not very successfully, and we are still trying to make some efforts to regain control. Purim is near, and we want to laugh about our sorry situation, as well as send a humorous but also strong message with this Purimspiel to the ones who occupy our resources.",
