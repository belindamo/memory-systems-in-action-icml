Harps have been found in the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Sumeria, as well as in the early European societies.\n\nIn ancient Sumeria, depictions of harps can be seen on artifacts and in carvings from around 3000 BCE. In Egypt, harps were a prominent instrument in religious and secular life, with archaeological evidence of their use dating back to around 2500 BCE. The Egyptian harps were typically angular, with a straight or slightly curved neck and a resonator body, often richly decorated.\n\nThroughout history, harps have evolved in design, size, and materials, reflecting the cultural and technological advancements of their respective societies. The modern concert harp, also known as the pedal harp, was developed in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and its intricate mechanism allows for chromatic playing and greater versatility.\n\nIn summary, harps are an ancient instrument with a history dating back around 5,000 years, and they have been a significant part of various cultures and civilizations throughout time.",
