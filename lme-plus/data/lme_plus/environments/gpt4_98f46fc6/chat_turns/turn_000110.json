However, since it is a seafood restaurant, you can expect to find a great selection of fresh seafood dishes on the menu. I would recommend asking your server for recommendations or popular dishes when you arrive. They will be able to guide you based on their menu offerings and let you know what dishes are particularly good that day. Don't forget to try some local favorites, such as the paella - a traditional dish in Spain made with rice and seafood.",
