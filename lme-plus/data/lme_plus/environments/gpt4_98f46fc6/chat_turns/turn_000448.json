Here's why:\n\n1. **Seasonal transition**: You've already made the effort to put your winter decorations away, which means you're signaling to yourself that it's time to move on to a new season. Sticking with your current decorative items will help you transition smoothly into the next season.\n2. **Reducing clutter**: Getting out your winter decorations again might lead to clutter and visual overwhelm. By using the items you already have out, you'll maintain a sense of simplicity and focus on the current season.\n3. **Create a fresh look**: Using your current decorative items will give you the opportunity to create a fresh and new look for your shelf. You might discover new combinations or arrangements that you hadn't thought of before.\n4. **Save time and effort**: Retrieving your winter decorations from storage might require some time and effort. By sticking with what you have, you'll save yourself the hassle and energy.\n\nThat being said, if you're really attached to your winter decorations and want to incorporate them into your shelf display, you could consider doing a seasonal mashup. This means combining winter and non-winter items to create a unique and eclectic look. Just be mindful of the overall aesthetic and balance of the display.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours! Take a moment to think about what will make you happy and bring you joy. If you're still unsure, you could always try creating a mini-display with a few winter items and see how it looks before committing to a full-scale shelf makeover.",
