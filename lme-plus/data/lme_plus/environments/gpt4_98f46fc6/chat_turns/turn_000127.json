  "content": "Canurta's unique advantage lies in the combination of our advanced biosynthesis platform with AI technology, which enables the creation of de-novo molecules for potential pharmaceutical breakthroughs. Our researchers have identified significant opportunities to modify chemical subspaces within Canurta's library of molecules, resulting in enhanced bioactivity.\n\nTo capitalize on this potential and expand our capabilities, we are assembling a team of skilled bioinformaticians to develop a computer-aided drug design (CADD) pipeline with analogs and de-novo generated molecules obtained through graph relational generated models and rule-based molecule modification models. By harnessing the power of bioinformatics and enzymatic synthesis, Canurta is poised to discover promising leads for pharmaceutical applications more efficiently, positioning us as a trailblazer in the industry.",
