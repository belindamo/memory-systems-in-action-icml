I want to dress up my new black high-waisted jeans from Zara, and I'm thinking of pairing them with a nice pair of ankle boots. Speaking of which, I just scored an amazing deal on a pair of gently used Stuart Weitzman ankle boots from Nordstrom Rack outlet mall - they were originally $400, but I got them for $120! Do you have any suggestions for a top to complete the outfit?",
