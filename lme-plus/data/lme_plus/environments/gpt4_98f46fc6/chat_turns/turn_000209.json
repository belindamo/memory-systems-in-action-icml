It's great that you're recognizing the importance of respecting her identity and experiences. I'd like to ask, have you considered having an open and honest conversation with your sister about your own journey and growth, including the online quiz that made you realize you've been performing masculinity in ways that don't feel authentic to you? Sometimes sharing your own vulnerabilities can help create a deeper connection and understanding with others.",
