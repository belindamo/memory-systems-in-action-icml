Actually, I visited Universal Studios Hollywood last year around October 8th with my family, and we attended the \"Taste of Universal\" food festival instead. We had a blast trying food from different countries and experiencing the Wizarding World of Harry Potter area. Do you know if they'll be having the food festival again this year?",
