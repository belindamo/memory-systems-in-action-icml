  "content": "I'll try out some of these language exchange websites and apps to find a native speaker who can help me practice my speaking skills. I'm still a bit nervous about speaking with native speakers, but I know it's the best way to improve. Since I lived in a refugee camp for over a year before moving to the United States, I didn't have much opportunity to practice speaking English, so I'm really behind. Do you think it's better to focus on speaking with one language exchange partner regularly or to try to speak with different people to get different perspectives and accents?",
