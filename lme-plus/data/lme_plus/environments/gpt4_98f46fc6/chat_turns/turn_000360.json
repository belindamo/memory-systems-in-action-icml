  "content": "What a wonderful idea! Booking a dinner reservation at a fancy restaurant is a great way to celebrate your anniversary!\n\nRegarding your credit cards, it's a good idea to update them with your new name, but it's not necessarily a requirement for booking a dinner reservation. Here's why:\n\n1. **Credit card information:** When booking a dinner reservation, the restaurant typically doesn't require your credit card information upfront. They might ask for a credit card to hold the reservation, but they won't charge it until the day of the reservation or at the end of the meal.\n2. **Payment at the restaurant:** When you arrive at the restaurant, you can present your updated credit card with your new name to pay for the meal.\n3. **Credit card company notification:** It's essential to notify your credit card company about your name change, but it's not a pressing issue for booking a dinner reservation. You can update your credit card information with your new name at your convenience.\n\nHowever, it's still a good idea to update your credit cards with your new name to avoid any potential issues or confusion in the future. You can contact your credit card company to update your information, and they'll guide you through the process.\n\nFor now, you can focus on booking your dinner reservation and enjoying your anniversary celebration!",
