It's great that you're willing to take the step to improve your speaking skills, despite feeling nervous.\n\nRegarding your question, both approaches have their advantages. Here are some pros and cons of each approach to help you decide:\n\n**Focusing on one language exchange partner regularly:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Consistency**: You'll have a regular schedule and can develop a routine with your language exchange partner.\n2. **Familiarity**: You'll become more comfortable with your partner's speaking style, accent, and way of communicating.\n3. **Depth**: You can delve deeper into specific topics or areas of interest with your partner.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Limited exposure**: You might only be exposed to one accent, speaking style, and perspective.\n2. **Dependence**: You might rely too heavily on one person and not develop the skills to adapt to different speaking styles.\n\n**Speaking with different people to get different perspectives and accents:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Variety**: You'll be exposed to different accents, speaking styles, and perspectives, which can help you become more adaptable.\n2. **Broad exposure**: You'll learn to recognize and understand different ways of communicating, which can improve your overall comprehension.\n3. **Networking**: You'll have the opportunity to connect with more people and potentially find multiple language exchange partners.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Inconsistency**: You might not have a regular schedule or consistent practice with any one person.\n2. **Overwhelming**: You might feel overwhelmed by the different speaking styles and accents.\n\nUltimately, I recommend a combination of both approaches. You could try to find one or two regular language exchange partners to provide consistency and depth, while also speaking with other people occasionally to gain exposure to different accents and perspectives.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following tips to help you make the most of your language exchange experiences:\n\n1. **Be open-minded**: Be willing to learn from others and adapt to different speaking styles.\n2. **Ask questions**: Encourage your language exchange partners to correct your mistakes and provide feedback.\n3. **Take notes**: Record your conversations or take notes on new vocabulary, grammar, or pronunciation tips.\n4. **Practice active listening**: Focus on understanding your language exchange partner's message, rather than just responding.\n\nRemember, the key to improving your speaking skills is consistent practice and a willingness to learn. Don't be too hard on yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Good luck, and I hope you find a language exchange partner who can help you achieve your goals!",
