However, since you're waiting for your updated driver's license to arrive, you can try booking the flight with your old ID, but be prepared to provide additional documentation.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1. **Book the flight with your old ID:** Go ahead and book the flight using your old ID, but make sure to enter your new name (as it appears on your marriage certificate) in the \"Name\" field. This way, the airline will have a record of your new name.\n2. **Bring documentation:** When you check-in for your flight, bring the following documents:\n\t* Your old ID (with your previous name)\n\t* Your marriage certificate (showing your name change)\n\t* A copy of your updated driver's license application or a receipt showing you've applied for an updated license (if you have one)\n3. **Be prepared for possible delays:** When you arrive at the airport, be prepared to explain the situation to the airline staff and TSA agents. They may ask you additional questions or request more documentation, so be patient and cooperative.\n\nKeep in mind that some airlines or TSA agents might be more lenient than others, but it's always better to be prepared for any potential issues.\n\nOnce you receive your updated driver's license, make sure to update your flight booking with the new ID information to avoid any further complications.\n\nFingers crossed that everything goes smoothly, and you have a wonderful anniversary trip!",
