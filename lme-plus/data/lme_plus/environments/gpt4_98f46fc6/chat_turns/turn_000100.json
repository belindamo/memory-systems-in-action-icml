  "content": "I'm thrilled to hear that the podcast has inspired you to make changes to your daily routine!\n\nI'd be happy to help you find a good walking route from the previous stop to your office. However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time location data or mapping information. But I can suggest a few ways to help you find a suitable walking route:\n\n1. **Google Maps**: Open Google Maps on your phone or computer and enter your starting point (the previous train stop) and your destination (your office address). Google Maps will provide you with walking directions and an estimated time.\n2. **MapMyWalk**: This app allows you to search for walking routes and even create your own custom routes. You can enter your starting and ending points and get a suggested route.\n3. **Walkit**: This website provides walking directions and routes for various cities. You can enter your starting and ending points and get a suggested route.\n4. **Ask a colleague or friend**: If you have a colleague or friend who takes a similar route, ask them for their preferred walking route. They might have some valuable insights and tips to share.\n\nRemember to consider factors like pedestrian safety, traffic, and road conditions when choosing your walking route.\n\nBy getting off the train a stop earlier and walking, you'll not only get some exercise but also have time to clear your mind, enjoy the fresh air, and maybe even listen to another episode of that entrepreneurship podcast!\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a route that works well for you!",
