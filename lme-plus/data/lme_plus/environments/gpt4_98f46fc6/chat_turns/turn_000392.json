Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process:\n\n1. **Contact your local government**: Reach out to your local government's planning or zoning department, often found in the municipal or county government office. You can search online or look up the contact information in the phone book.\n2. **Zoning ordinance**: Ask for a copy of the zoning ordinance or zoning code, which outlines the rules and regulations for your area. You can usually find this document on the government's website or request a physical copy.\n3. **Zoning map**: Obtain a zoning map, which shows the different zoning districts in your area. This will help you determine the specific zoning designation for your property.\n4. **Property records**: Research your property's records, including the deed, property taxes, and any existing permits or variances.
