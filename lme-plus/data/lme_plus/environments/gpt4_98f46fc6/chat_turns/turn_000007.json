It's possible that it was a one-time event or a private party that was not publicly advertised.\n\nAs a conversational AI, my knowledge is based on publicly available information and data. If Screamfest was not a publicly announced event, I wouldn't have any information about it.\n\nHowever, I can try to help you investigate further. Can you tell me more about Screamfest? What did the event entail? Was it a Halloween-themed event? Do you remember any specific details, such as the date, time, or activities that took place during the event?\n\nAdditionally, you can also try contacting Disney World directly or checking their website to see if they have any information about a Screamfest event. They might be able to provide more information or clarify if it was a one-time event or a private party.\n\nI apologize again for the confusion, and I hope we can figure out what Screamfest was all about!",
