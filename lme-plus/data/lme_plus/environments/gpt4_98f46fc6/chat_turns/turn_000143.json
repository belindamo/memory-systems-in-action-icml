Here's a general 8-week training plan that you can follow:\n\n**Weeks 1-2: Walking and Running**\n\n* Start with 2-3 times of walking for 30 minutes each\n* Incorporate short running segments (1-2 minutes) into your walks, with 2-3 minutes of walking in between\n* Gradually increase the duration of your runs by 1-2 minutes each week\n\n**Weeks 3-4: Building Endurance**\n\n* Continue to alternate between walking and running\n* Aim for 20-30 minutes of total exercise time, with 10-15 minutes of running\n* Incorporate strength training exercises 2-3 times a week to improve your overall endurance (focus on legs, core, and glutes)\n\n**Weeks 5-6: Building Distance**\n\n* Start to increase your total exercise time to 30-40 minutes\n* Aim to run for 20-25 minutes without stopping, with 5-10 minutes of walking to cool down\n* Introduce interval training: run at a faster pace for 1-2 minutes, then walk or jog at a slower pace for 2-3 minutes\n\n**Weeks 7-8: Taper and Rest**\n\n* Reduce your exercise time to 20-30 minutes, with 15-20 minutes of running\n* Focus on active recovery: incorporate stretching, yoga, or light cardio to help your body recover\n* Rest and taper your training in the last week before the race to allow your body to recover and prepare for the event\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Start with a beginner-friendly pace and gradually increase your speed as you build endurance\n* Listen to your body: rest when you need to, and don't push yourself too hard\n* Incorporate proper warm-up and cool-down routines to prevent injuries\n* Make sure to stay hydrated and fuel your body with a balanced diet\n* Get plenty of sleep and try to get at least one or two rest days per week\n\nRemember, this is just a general plan, and you should adjust it based on your current fitness level, goals, and progress.
