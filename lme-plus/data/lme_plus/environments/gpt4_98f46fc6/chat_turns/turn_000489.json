  "content": "As an HR Business Partner, I conducted an employee survey with a response rate of 87.5%. The survey aimed to measure employee motivation, satisfaction, engagement, and loyalty. The key findings are summarized below.\n\nMotivation and satisfaction: The average score for motivation, job satisfaction, and overall satisfaction with working in the organization was high, with scores ranging from 5.82 to 5.98 out of 7. However, there was a slight decline in scores from 2020 to 2022.\n\nEngagement and loyalty: The average score for engagement and loyalty was also high, with scores ranging from 5.88 to 6.56 out of 7. The score for willingness to recommend the organization to others was particularly high, with a score of 6.06. However, the score for willingness to work in the organization in one year slightly decreased from 2020 to 2022.\n\nTop 5 and Bottom 5: The top five areas that employees were most positive about were related to engagement and social capital, such as willingness to help the organization achieve its goals, having a competent manager, being proud of working for the organization, having good teamwork, and trusting colleagues. On the other hand, the bottom five areas that employees were least positive about were related to work conditions, including the organization's ability to innovate, the balance between workload and time available, the relationship between effort and pay, and work-life balance.\n\nStress: Around 15% of employees reported experiencing stress daily or weekly, while around 85% of employees reported rarely experiencing stress. The main cause of stress was related to work, with 70.78% of respondents identifying it as the primary cause, followed by a combination of work and personal life issues.\n\nAction Plans:\n\n1. Address work-related stress: The organization should provide stress management training for employees and encourage managers to identify and address factors that contribute to stress in the workplace.\n2. Improve work conditions: The organization should review and adjust workloads, pay scales, and work-life balance policies to ensure that they are fair and adequate. Employees should have enough time to complete their tasks, receive fair pay for their effort, and have a good balance between work and personal life.\n3. Strengthen management capabilities: The organization should offer management training and development programs to ensure that managers are competent, supportive, and able to provide their team members with clear expectations, feedback, and support. Managers should be held accountable for creating a positive work environment and promoting employee engagement.\n\nImplementation: The HR department should work with senior leaders, managers, and employees to implement the three action plans. Senior leaders should set the tone for the organization's commitment to addressing employee concerns, while managers should be responsible for implementing specific actions within their teams. HR should provide training, resources, and support to managers and employees to ensure successful implementation. Regular monitoring and evaluation should be conducted to measure the effectiveness of the action plans and identify areas for improvement.",
