      "content": "re-write this paragraph to highlight the unique advantage of canurta's biosynthesis platform when paired with AI to create de-novo molecules for potential pharmaceutical breakthroughs. We want this to highlight our secret weapon: \n\nFrom experience with the biosynthesis platform, Canurta\u2019s researchers have discovered that there are significant opportunities to generate modifications within chemical subspaces of Canurta\u2019s library of molecules, which can result in changing or, better yet, improving their bioactivity. For computer-aided drug design (CADD) to succeed and to grow the company\u2019s capabilities, Canurta is incorporating a team of skilled bioinformaticians to create a CADD pipeline with analogs, and de novo generated molecules obtained via graph relational generated models and rule-based molecule modification models. Canurta will use bioinformatics coupled with enzymatic synthesis to find new promising leads for pharmaceutical applications in a more efficient way."
