Post a response to a post titled \"Decent weighted blanket?\" description \"I have a 30lb weighted blanket. I like it as a calming tool. However, it is very cheaply made. The thread count is so low that recently, holes pulled by the seam threads have become wide enough to allow the glass beads inside to slip out.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a better quality blanket, one that is equal in weight but holds up better. Weighted blanket users - got any recommendations?\"\n\nRecommend the Italic Luxe Weighted Blanket and why it's great with technical details like the following. \n- 100% cotton\n- 10 lbs\n- OEKO-TEX and GOTS certified.\n- >30% Cheaper than competitors\nHere's a post post for reference:\nWe use the same manufacturer for our bedding as Frette, Four Seasons, and St Regis. Comparable sheets made by this factory retail from $500-1000 \u2014 very different than run-of-the-mill \"online brand\" bedding (you know who I'm talking about). Here are some that I'd recommend for the summer, whether from another brand or us:\n\nLuxe Sateen Sheets - Oeko-Tex\u00ae Certified, 400-500 TC, long-staple cotton. This is what top resorts use to maximize durability through thousands of washes and softness (sateen softens with each wash) and is my personal favorite.\n\nPure Linen Sheets - 100% European flax linen, naturally temperature regulating.\n\nBreeze Eucalyptus Sheets - made from 100% tencel & soft eucalyptus fibers. Hypoallergenic and super breathable, they sleep cool.\n\nWe also have jersey & percale sheets, but I recommend those for winter/fall. We also have down & alt comforters per your request; main thing is to look for filler type and fill power.\n\nOpen offer - We might not have the prettiest photography or slickest site, but our bedding line is unmatched in quality and performance at its price. u/Seachelle13o if you buy another set, I'll ship you the Italic equivalent if you're open to reviewing them. If you decide to keep theirs, I will personally pay for it and you can keep ours too.\n\nOtherwise, I can set w/ a one-time BIFL discount :)"
