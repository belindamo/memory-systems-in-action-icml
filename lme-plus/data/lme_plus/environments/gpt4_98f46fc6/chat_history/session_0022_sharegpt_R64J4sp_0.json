Before the interview, make sure you've prepared a list of questions to ask each builder, and have a clear idea of your project's timeline and budget.\n\nDuring the interview, ask the builder about their experience with projects similar to yours, their process for managing projects, and their approach to problem-solving. You should also ask about their subcontractors, insurance coverage, and licensing.\n\nPay attention to how the builder communicates with you during the interview. Are they open and transparent? Do they listen carefully to your needs and concerns? If you have any red flags during the interview, such as the builder being evasive or defensive, it may be a sign that they're not the right fit for your project.\n\nRemember that choosing the right builder is not just about finding someone who can do the job, but also about finding someone you can communicate with and trust to manage the project effectively. Take the time to interview each potential builder thoroughly to make the best decision for your project."
