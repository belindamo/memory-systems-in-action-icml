      "content": "Paris in March sounds like a wonderful idea! However, I have to inform you that there is no airline called \"Travel-X.\" It's possible that you may have booked with a different airline or a travel agency. Could you double-check your booking confirmation to ensure everything is in order?\n\nNow, let's focus on planning your Parisian adventure! March is a great time to visit Paris, and booking attractions in advance is an excellent idea to avoid long lines and make the most of your time. Here are some must-see places and tours that I highly recommend:\n\n1. The Eiffel Tower: You can't go to Paris without visiting the iconic Eiffel Tower. Book your tickets in advance to skip the lines, and consider taking the stairs instead of the elevator for a more budget-friendly option.\n2. The Louvre Museum: Home to the Mona Lisa, the Louvre is a must-visit museum in Paris. Book your tickets online to avoid the long queues, and consider a guided tour to get the most out of your visit.\n3. Notre-Dame Cathedral: This beautiful Gothic cathedral is a Parisian icon. While it's currently under reconstruction, you can still visit the exterior and take a guided tour.\n4. Montmartre Walking Tour: Explore the charming streets of Montmartre, visit the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica, and enjoy the stunning views of the city. You can book a guided tour or venture on your own.\n5. Seine River Cruise: A river cruise is a great way to see the city's landmarks while learning about its history and culture. You can book a day or evening cruise, depending on your preference.\n6. Palace of Versailles: If you have time, consider taking a day trip to the Palace of Versailles, a former royal residence with stunning gardens and opulent decorations. Book your tickets and transportation in advance to make the most of your day.\n7. Arc de Triomphe: This triumphal arch honors the soldiers who fought and died for France. You can book tickets to climb to the top for panoramic views of the city.\n\nSome popular tour companies in Paris include:\n\n* GetYourGuide: Offers a wide range of tours and attractions, including skip-the-line access to popular sites.\n* Viator: Provides guided tours, day trips, and attractions, with options for skip-the-line access and private tours.\n* Paris Museum Pass: A great option if you plan to visit multiple museums and attractions, as it grants you skip-the-line access and discounts.\n\nRemember to always book with reputable companies and read reviews before making a purchase.\n\nLastly, don't forget to explore the charming neighborhoods, cafes, and markets that make Paris so unique. Enjoy your trip, and bon anniversaire!"
