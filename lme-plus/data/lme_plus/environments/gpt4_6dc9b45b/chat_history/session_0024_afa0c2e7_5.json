Anyway, back to lunch spots... do you think any of these places would be good for a quick bite before the game, or should I plan for a more leisurely lunch?"

      "content": "You're a baseball enthusiast, and you've already experienced the magic of Wrigley Field! That's awesome!\n\nFor a quick bite before the game, I'd recommend Murphy's Bleachers, The Cubby Bear, or Bernie's Tavern. These spots are all within a short walk of Wrigley Field and offer a more casual, quick-service atmosphere. You can grab a burger, hot dog, or sandwich, and be in and out in about 30-45 minutes.\n\nIf you're looking for a more leisurely lunch, Big Star, Rico's Pizza, or The Sports Column might be a better fit. These spots offer a more relaxed atmosphere, and you can take your time enjoying your meal. Keep in mind that these places might be a bit more crowded, and you might need to plan for about an hour to an hour and a half for lunch.\n\nGuthrie's Tavern is a great spot, but it's a bit more laid-back, and you might want to plan for a more relaxed lunch there.\n\nConsidering you're a baseball fan, you might want to plan your lunch around the game schedule. If you're looking to grab a quick bite before the game, aim to arrive at the stadium about 1-2 hours before the first pitch. If you're planning a more leisurely lunch, you might want to arrive a bit earlier, around 2-3 hours before the game.\n\nRemember to check the Wrigley Field website for any specific bag restrictions, prohibited items, or security protocols before heading to the game.\n\nEnjoy your lunch and the game!"
