      "content": "I have already done building a wearable prototype which can collect two parameters, Active range of motion at the MCP joint and fingertip force. These two data are collected to identify the condition of finger ability. The motivation to do this research and building the prototype is that it is identified that finger rehabilitation lacks a systematic and qualitative method to evaluate the finger function, and it usually depends on the experience of the physiotherapist or clinicians which are in a quantitative manner. I have collected data from 14 healthy people, with similar distribution of two gender, two hand both tested on 3 fingers being the thumb, index and middle finger. I can identify the range of motion of the 3 fingers upwards and downwards from the horizon line, as well as their force on each fingertips as mentioned above. Do you capture until now?"
