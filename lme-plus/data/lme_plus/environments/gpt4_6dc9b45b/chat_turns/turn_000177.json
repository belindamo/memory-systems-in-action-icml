Cleanse your face with a gentle cleanser suitable for combination skin. Look for a non-comedogenic and oil-free formula to avoid clogging pores.\n2. Apply the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Peel (1-2 pumps) to your face, avoiding the eye area. Gently massage it in for about 30 seconds to help exfoliate and unclog pores. Rinse with lukewarm water.\n3. Pat dry your face and apply a few drops of the Sunday Riley Power Couple serum. This serum is formulated to help reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. Gently massage it into your skin until absorbed.\n4. Follow up with the La Mer Moisturizing Cream. This rich and luxurious moisturizer will help lock in the previous steps and provide long-lasting hydration.

This will help your skin regenerate and repair itself overnight.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Use the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Peel 2-3 times a week, as it contains alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) that can be gentle exfoliants. Start with 2 times a week and adjust as needed based on your skin's sensitivity.\n* The Sunday Riley Power Couple serum can be used morning and night, but if you have sensitive skin, you may want to start with once a day and gradually increase as your skin becomes more tolerant.\n* La Mer Moisturizing Cream is rich and luxurious, so use it sparingly. You can also use it as a spot treatment for dry areas or as a mask 1-2 times a week.\n* Be patient and consistent with your new routine. It may take 2-4 weeks to see noticeable improvements in your skin.\n* Don't forget to wear sunscreen with at least SPF 30 during the day, even on cloudy days, to prevent further hyperpigmentation.\n\nBy incorporating these products into your routine, you should start to see improvements in acne, hyperpigmentation, and overall skin texture. Remember to monitor your skin's response and adjust the routine as needed. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
