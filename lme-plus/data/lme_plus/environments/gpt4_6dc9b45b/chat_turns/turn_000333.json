If you're looking for musicals with a similar folk-rock vibe, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Once** (2011) - A beautiful, intimate musical about a busker who falls in love with a Czech immigrant in Dublin. The music is a mix of folk, rock, and indie sounds, with a hauntingly beautiful score by Glen Hansard and Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1.\n2. **Spring Awakening** (2006) - While not entirely folk-rock, this musical features a mix of rock, pop, and folk elements in its score by Duncan Sheik. The show explores themes of teenage angst, rebellion, and self-discovery in 19th-century Germany.\n3. **The Great Comet** (2016) - A musical electropop opera based on a segment of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. The score by Dave Malloy is a fusion of indie rock, electronic, and folk elements, with a unique, immersive sound.\n4. **Folk Wandering** (2020) - A new musical that premiered at the Public Theater's Under the Radar Festival, featuring a folk-rock score by Heather Christian.
