  "content": "Austin is a fantastic city for live music! I'm happy to help you discover some new spots in your upcoming destination. However, I need to know which city you're planning to visit. Could you please share the name of the city or region you're heading to? That way, I can provide you with personalized recommendations for live music venues and experiences.\n\nAlso, it would be helpful to know what type of music you're into (e.g., rock, jazz, blues, indie, etc.) and what kind of atmosphere you're looking for (e.g., intimate clubs, outdoor festivals, or large concert halls). This will help me give you more targeted suggestions.\n\nOnce I have that information, I can start recommending some amazing live music spots for you to check out on your trip!",
