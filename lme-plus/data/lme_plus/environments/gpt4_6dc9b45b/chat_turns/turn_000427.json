I've been doing 25% water changes every week, but I think I'll switch to 10-15% every 7-10 days to make it more manageable. By the way, I've been really enjoying my community of neon tetras, harlequin rasboras, and corydoras catfish, and I'm excited to add some new plants to the tank to help with algae control. Do you have any tips on how to acclimate new plants to my tank?",
