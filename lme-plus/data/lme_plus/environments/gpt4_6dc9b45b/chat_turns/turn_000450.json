  "content": "Yes, I understand your research topic. Based on the information you've provided, here are some suggestions for writing your proceeding paper:\n\n1. Introduction: Provide an introduction to the topic, including the problem statement and the motivation for your research. Discuss the importance of finger rehabilitation and the need for a more systematic and qualitative method to evaluate finger function.\n2. Background: Provide a literature review of existing research on finger rehabilitation and evaluation methods. Discuss the limitations of current methods and how your wearable prototype addresses those limitations.\n3. Methodology: Describe the methodology you used to build your wearable prototype and collect data from participants. Discuss any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.\n4. Results: Present the results of your data analysis, including the active range of motion at the MCP joint and fingertip force for each finger tested. Discuss any notable trends or patterns that emerged from the data.\n5. Discussion: Discuss the implications of your findings and how they can be applied in practice. Highlight the advantages of using a wearable prototype to evaluate finger function in a more systematic and qualitative manner.\n6. Conclusion: Summarize your findings and conclusions, and reiterate the importance of developing more advanced methods for evaluating finger function in rehabilitation.\n7. Future work: Discuss future work and potential directions for research, such as expanding the study to include participants with finger injuries or disorders, or incorporating additional parameters to evaluate finger function.\n\nMake sure to provide sufficient detail for each section and to use clear and concise language throughout your paper. Additionally, be sure to follow any formatting guidelines provided by the conference.",
