Beetles: Many species of beetles feed on dead wood and other organic matter, helping to break it down and release nutrients back into the soil.\n\n2. Flies: Flies, including blowflies and houseflies, feed on decaying organic matter and help to break it down, releasing nutrients back into the soil.\n\n3. Moths and butterflies: The larvae of moths and butterflies, known as caterpillars, feed on leaves and other plant material. When they defecate, they release nutrient-rich feces back into the soil.\n\n4. Earthworms: Earthworms are important decomposers that help to break down and aerate the soil, releasing nutrients back into the soil.\n\n5.
