  "content": "What a fantastic idea! Adding a gift card to a meal delivery or food subscription service to the gift basket is a thoughtful and practical gesture that can bring a huge relief to new parents.\n\nNew parents often have a lot on their plates (no pun intended!), and mealtime can be a significant stress factor. Having meals taken care of can be a huge weight off their shoulders, allowing them to focus on more important things... like bonding with their new baby!\n\nA gift card to a meal delivery or food subscription service can provide them with a convenient and delicious solution to mealtime. It's a thoughtful way to show you care about their well-being and want to help make their lives a little easier during this transition.\n\nSome popular meal delivery and food subscription services include:\n\n* Meal kit delivery services like Blue Apron, HelloFresh, or Sun Basket\n* Prepared meal delivery services like GrubHub, Uber Eats, or DoorDash\n* Grocery delivery services like Instacart or Shipt\n* Subscription boxes like Amazon Fresh or ButcherBox\n\nChoose a service that aligns with your cousin's preferences and dietary needs, and include a thoughtful note expressing your support and best wishes for their new adventure.\n\nYou're really going above and beyond with this gift basket, and I'm sure your cousin will appreciate the thought and effort you've put into it!",
