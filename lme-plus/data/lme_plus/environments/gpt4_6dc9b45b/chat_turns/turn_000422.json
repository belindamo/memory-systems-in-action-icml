Here are some tips to help you create a natural-looking environment for your neon tetras, harlequin rasboras, and corydoras catfish:\n\n**Choose Decorations that Mimic Nature**\n\n1. **Rocks and Boulders**: Use rocks and boulders to create hiding places, caves, and crevices. You can arrange them to create a natural-looking terrain, with some areas more open and others more secluded.\n2. **Driftwood**: Add driftwood or branches to create hiding places and visual interest. You can also use them to create a \"tree-like\" structure or a \"sunken log\" effect.\n3. **Plants**: Live plants are essential for creating a natural environment. Choose plants that are suitable for a community aquarium, such as Java moss, Anacharis, or Amazon Swords. They'll help to create hiding places, provide shade, and oxygenate the water.\n4. **Sand or Gravel**: Use a natural-colored substrate, such as sand or gravel, to create a riverbed or lakebed effect.\n\n**Create Hiding Places and Visual Interest**\n\n1. **Caves and Overhangs**: Create caves and overhangs using rocks, driftwood, or ceramic decorations. This will provide your fish with hiding places and create visual interest.\n2. **Plant Clusters**: Group plants together to create clusters, which will provide shelter and hiding places for your fish.\n3. **Decorative Features**: Add decorative features, such as a sunken ship, a treasure chest, or a water feature, to create visual interest and add character to your aquarium.\n\n**Consider the Water Flow**\n\n1. **Water Flow**: Create areas of gentle water flow and areas of still water to mimic the natural environment. This will help to create a sense of movement and visual interest.\n2. **Water Level**: Consider creating a slight incline or a \"beach\" area, where the water level is lower, to create a natural-looking shoreline.\n\n**Tips for Your Specific Fish**\n\n1. **Neon Tetras**: These active swimmers love open swimming spaces, so create areas of open water for them to dart around in.\n2. **Harlequin Rasboras**: These peaceful fish appreciate plants and hiding places, so make sure to include plenty of plants and decorations for them to hide in.\n3. **Corydoras Catfish**: These bottom-dwellers love to dig and forage, so provide them with a sandy or gravelly substrate and plenty of hiding places, such as rocks or plants, to burrow under.\n\n**Remember**\n\n1. **Research**: Research the natural habitats of your fish to get inspiration for your aquarium design.\n2. **Balance**: Balance your decorations to create a visually appealing and natural-looking environment.\n3. **Safety**: Make sure your decorations are safe for your fish and don't create any sharp edges or hiding places that could trap them.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a natural-looking environment that will delight both you and your fish. Good luck, and have fun!",
