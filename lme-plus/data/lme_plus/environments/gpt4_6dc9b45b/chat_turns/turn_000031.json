  "content": "The construction of Mount Rushmore indeed reflects a narrative of American history that often excluded indigenous peoples and prioritized a White American perspective. Acknowledging this past and taking steps towards reconciliation is an ongoing process that involves recognizing the legacy of systemic oppression and taking actions to address it. Some actions that could be taken include involving indigenous peoples in the management and interpretation of sites such as Mount Rushmore, increasing funding to education and programs that highlight the contributions and experiences of indigenous communities, and engaging in meaningful consultation and dialogue with indigenous peoples regarding issues that affect them.",
