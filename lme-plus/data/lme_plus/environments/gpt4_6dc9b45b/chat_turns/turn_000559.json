  "content": "C. Chiller System\n\n1. Two working refrigerants that can be used for the chiller system are R410A and R407C. R410A is a blend of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and has a higher cooling capacity and a lower pressure than R134a. R407C is a blend of HFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and is similar to R22 in terms of thermodynamic properties, but it has a lower global warming potential. Both refrigerants are considered safe and have been widely used in air-conditioning and refrigeration systems.\n2. If the refrigerant exits the evaporator as saturated vapor, the suitable operating pressures for the chiller can be determined using the pressure-enthalpy diagram for the refrigerant. The low-pressure side of the chiller, which is the evaporator, should operate at a pressure that is below the saturation pressure at the desired chilled water temperature (2oC) for R410A, and the high-pressure side of the chiller, which is the condenser, should operate at a pressure that is above the saturation pressure at the cooling water temperature (26oC) for R410A.\n\nFor R407C, the low-pressure side of the chiller, which is the evaporator, should operate at a pressure that is below the saturation pressure at the desired chilled water temperature (2oC) and the high-pressure side of the chiller, which is the condenser, should operate at a pressure that is above the saturation pressure at the cooling water temperature (26oC)\n\nThe COP (coefficient of performance) of the chiller system can be calculated using the formula:\n\nCOP = (Qc / Wc)\n\nwhere Qc is the cooling capacity and Wc is the compressor work input. A higher COP indicates a more efficient system. Comparing the COP of the chiller system for both coolants assuming a compressor efficiency of 90% would indicate that R410A would have a higher COP than R407C\n\n3. The estimated cost for running the chiller system for a 30 days, 24 hour operation schedule can be calculated by multiplying the compressor work input by the electrical cost for the specific coolant used. The cost for R410A would be higher than the cost for R407C based on the compressor work input, because R410A has a higher compressor work input. The cost calculation should be done according to the Malaysian daylight electrical tariff.",
