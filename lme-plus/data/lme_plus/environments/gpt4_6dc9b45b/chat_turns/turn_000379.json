  "content": "In Buddhism, things are not considered to arise from \"nothing\" in a literal sense. Rather, things are seen as arising from the interplay of conditions and causes, and their existence is said to be dependent on those conditions.\n\nFor example, a tree arises from a seed, soil, water, and other conditions, but it does not arise from \"nothing.\" Similarly, all things are said to be causally connected and dependent on other things, and their existence is said to be contingent and impermanent.\n\nSo, in Buddhism, things are not considered to come from nothing or to exist independently, but rather to arise and exist in dependence on conditions and causes. This view is often referred to as \"dependent origination\" (pratityasamutpada in Sanskrit), and it is a central concept in many forms of Buddhism.",
