It's exciting that you're curious to see how your evening walks will impact your sleep quality and duration.\n\nRemember to be patient and consistent with your tracking, as it may take some time to notice patterns and correlations. Also, don't be afraid to experiment and try different outdoor activities or routines to see what works best for you.\n\nIn addition to tracking your sleep and outdoor activities, you might also want to consider keeping a sleep diary or journal to track other factors that could be affecting your sleep, such as:\n\n* What you ate and drank before bedtime\n* Your stress levels and anxiety\n* Your bedtime routine and sleep environment\n* Any medications or supplements you're taking\n\nBy tracking these factors, you can get a more complete picture of what's affecting your sleep and make informed decisions to improve it.\n\nRemember, sleep is a complex and personal aspect of our lives, and what works for one person may not work for another. But by being curious, tracking your data, and making small changes to your routine, you can take steps towards improving your sleep quality and overall well-being.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you start seeing some positive changes soon!",
