  "content": "From the same objective and problem statement,\nC. Chiller System\nThe chiller system functions to produce chilled water at 2oC. Cooling water at an inlet temperature of\n26oC enters the condenser to assist the heat rejection process from the chiller system.\n1. Select 2 working refrigerants for the system (other than R134a) and explain the reasons of\nselection based on safety and thermal properties. (CO1)\n2. If the refrigerant exits the evaporator as saturated vapor, select the suitable operating\npressures for the chiller. Explain the reasons for the selected pressures. Then, compare the\nCOP of the chiller system for both coolants assuming a compressor efficiency of 90%. (CO2)\n3. Compare the estimated cost for running the chiller system for a 30 days, 24 hour operation\nschedule using the two different coolants (based only on the compressor work input \u2013\nassume the coolants flow at 700 liters per hour) under steady conditions. Apply the\nMalaysian daylight electrical tariff for the cost calculations. (CO3)\nTips:\nRefer to any coolant manufacturer website for the list of potential coolants and its\nproperties.",
