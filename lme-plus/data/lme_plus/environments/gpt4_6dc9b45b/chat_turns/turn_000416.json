Here's the thing: everyone starts somewhere, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.\n\n**You're not alone in feeling this way**: Many people take breaks from socializing, and it's common to feel a bit uncertain when getting back into it. The key is to be kind to yourself and focus on the present moment.\n\n**Remember, people are more focused on themselves than on you**: When you're in a social setting, people are often more concerned with their own thoughts, worries, and experiences than with judging you. So, try not to put too much pressure on yourself.\n\n**Start small**: Begin with small, low-stakes interactions, like chatting with someone for a few minutes or exchanging a few messages online. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually build up to longer conversations and more in-depth connections.\n\n**Focus on listening and asking questions**: Instead of worrying about being interesting or witty, focus on listening to others and asking open-ended questions. This will help you build connections and show genuine interest in others.\n\n**It's okay to take breaks**: If you're feeling overwhelmed or need some time to recharge, it's perfectly fine to take a step back and take a break. You don't have to be \"on\" all the time.\n\n**Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small successes, like striking up a conversation with someone new or attending an event. This will help you build confidence and momentum.\n\n**You're not trying to replace your best friend**: Remember that you're not trying to replace your best friend, but rather expand your social circle and meet new people. It's okay to have different friends and connections for different aspects of your life.\n\nLastly, **be patient with yourself**: Rebuilding your social connections takes time, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on enjoying the process, learning from your experiences, and being kind to yourself along the way.\n\nI hope these additional tips help you feel more at ease. Remember, you got this! You're taking the first step by reaching out to the organizer, and that's something to be proud of.",
