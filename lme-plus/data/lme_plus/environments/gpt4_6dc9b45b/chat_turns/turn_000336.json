I've been listening to a lot of show tunes on my daily commute, and I think I need to add some of these to my playlist. Speaking of playlists, I actually made a playlist with all my favorite show tunes and have been listening to it nonstop. Do you have any recommendations for songs or musicals that would fit well into a playlist with songs like \"Wait for It\" from Hamilton and \"All That Jazz\" from Chicago?",
