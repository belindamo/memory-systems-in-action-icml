I'll double-check my booking confirmation, but I'm certain that's correct. Anyway, thanks for the recommendations, the Montmartre Walking Tour and Seine River Cruise sound interesting. Can you give me more information on how to book them and what's the best way to get to Montmartre from my hotel, Hotel Le Walt?",
