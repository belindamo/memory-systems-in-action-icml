Here are some tips to help you apply a wash like a pro:\n\n**Applying a Wash:**\n\n1. **Choose the right brush:** Use a soft, flat brush (e.g., a 1/0 or 2/0) to apply the wash. This type of brush will allow you to control the flow of the wash and get into small crevices.\n2. **Load the brush:** Dip the brush into the wash, but make sure to wipe off any excess on the rim of the container. You want the brush to be damp, not soaking wet.\n3. **Apply the wash:** Gently touch the brush to the model, starting in a recessed area or a panel line. Use a gentle, flowing motion to spread the wash into the surrounding areas.\n4. **Work in small sections:** Divide the model into smaller sections, and apply the wash to one area at a time. This will help prevent the wash from pooling or running.\n5. **Use a 'feathering' technique:** As you apply the wash, use the tip of the brush to 'feather' the edges, blending the wash into the surrounding areas. This helps create a smooth, even transition.\n\n**Preventing Pooling and Unevenness:**\n\n1. **Use a primer:** Make sure the model is primed with a good quality primer. This will help the wash adhere evenly and reduce the risk of pooling.\n2. **Avoid over-saturating:** Don't overload the brush with too much wash. This can cause the wash to pool or run, leading to unevenness.\n3. **Work in well-ventilated areas:** Good airflow will help the wash dry faster and more evenly.\n4. **Use a hairdryer (optional):** If you're working in a humid environment or need to speed up the drying process, use a hairdryer on a low setting to gently blow air across the model. Be cautious not to overheat the model or disturb the wash.\n5. **Monitor and adjust:** Keep an eye on the wash as it dries. If you notice pooling or unevenness, use a damp brush to gently blend the wash and correct the issue.\n6. **Use a wash with a good flow:** Some washes are designed to have a better flow and leveling properties than others. Look for washes specifically marketed as 'flow-enhanced' or 'self-leveling.'\n7. **Practice makes perfect:** The more you practice applying washes, the better you'll become at judging the right amount of wash to apply and the best techniques to use.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use a wash with a matte finish:** Matte-finish washes will help reduce the appearance of pooling and unevenness.\n2. **Apply washes in thin coats:** Building up multiple thin coats of wash will help prevent pooling and create a more even effect.\n3. **Avoid using washes on raised details:** Washes can accumulate on raised details, making them appear too dark or dirty. Instead, use a lighter shade of paint or a drybrush to add subtle color and texture to these areas.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to achieving smooth, even washes that add depth and realism to your models.",
