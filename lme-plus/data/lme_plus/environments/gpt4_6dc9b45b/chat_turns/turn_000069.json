  "content": "Current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that women should not consume more than one alcoholic drink per day. However, it's important to note that any alcohol consumption can have negative health consequences, and some individuals may be more sensitive to the effects of alcohol than others.\n\nAs for healthy alternatives to drinking, there are many options available. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Sparkling water or fruit-infused water\n2. Herbal tea\n3. Kombucha or other fermented beverages\n4. Non-alcoholic beer or wine\n5. Freshly squeezed juices or smoothies.\n\nThese alternatives can be just as enjoyable as drinking alcohol and can provide a refreshing and healthy way to unwind or socialize with friends. Additionally, engaging in other activities such as exercise, meditation, or creative hobbies can also be effective ways to reduce stress and promote a healthy lifestyle.",
