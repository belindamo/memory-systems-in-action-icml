Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **The Light in the Piazza** (2005) - This musical, based on Elizabeth Spencer's novel, features a beautiful, folk-infused score by Adam Guettel. The story revolves around Clara, a young woman with a developmental disability, and her mother's struggles to find her a place in the world. The show explores themes of identity, love, and self-discovery.\n2. **The Wild Party** (2000) - While not exclusively folk-rock, this dark, jazzy musical features a strong, complex female lead character in Queenie, a fading star of the 1920s party scene. The score by Andrew Lippa is edgy and atmospheric, with a hint of folk influences.\n3. **Violet** (1997) - Based on the short story \"The Ugliest Pilgrim\" by Doris Betts, this musical features a folk-rock score by Jeanine Tesori and a book by Brian Yorkey. The story follows Violet, a young woman with a facial disfigurement, as she embarks on a journey to find a televangelist who she believes can heal her.\n4. **Fun Home** (2015) - This Pulitzer Prize-winning musical, based on Alison Bechdel's graphic novel, features a folk-rock score by Jeanine Tesori and a book by Lisa Kron. The show explores the complex relationships between Alison and her family, particularly her father, a closeted gay man.\n5. **Waitress** (2015) - With a score by Sara Bareilles and a book by Jessie Nelson, this musical tells the story of Jenna, a pregnant waitress and pie-maker stuck in a loveless marriage. The music is a mix of folk, pop, and rock, with a strong emphasis on female empowerment.\n\nThese shows all feature complex, dynamic female lead characters and share some elements of Hadestown's folk-rock vibe. You might also want to explore the music of female singer-songwriters like Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, or Lucy Dacus, who all have a similar introspective, folk-rock sound.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more musicals with strong female leads, you might enjoy:\n\n1. **Elise** (2019) - A new musical about the life of Elise Cowen, a 19th-century Jewish woman who defied convention to become a scholar and writer. The score is a mix of folk, rock, and klezmer music.\n2. **Gun & Powder** (2020) - A musical about two African American sisters who pass as white and seek revenge against the man who destroyed their family. The score is a blend of folk, rock, and R&B.\n3. **SIX** (2019) - A high-energy, pop-rock musical about the six wives of Henry VIII, told from their perspective. The show is a celebration of female empowerment and features a diverse, all-female cast.\n\nThese shows all feature complex, dynamic female characters and might appeal to fans of Hadestown's strong, female-driven storytelling.",
