I'd be happy to recommend some songs and musicals that would fit perfectly with \"Wait for It\" from Hamilton and \"All That Jazz\" from Chicago. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n**Songs:**\n\n1. \"Not a Day Goes By\" from Merrily We Roll Along - A poignant, introspective song about lost love and missed opportunities, with a similar blend of jazz and R&B influences found in \"Wait for It\".\n2. \"Losing My Mind\" from Follies - A haunting, jazzy ballad about the pain of lost love and the fragility of the human psyche, which would complement \"All That Jazz\" nicely.\n3. \"Being Alive\" from Company - A classic Sondheim song about the complexities of relationships and the search for human connection, with a similar blend of jazz and pop influences.\n4. \"I'm Not That Girl\" from Wicked - A poignant, introspective ballad about self-discovery and the struggle for identity, with a similar emotional depth to \"Wait for It\".\n5. \"She Used to Be Mine\" from Waitress - A heartfelt, folk-infused ballad about self-discovery and growth, which would fit nicely alongside \"All That Jazz\".\n\n**Musicals:**\n\n1. **In the Heights** - Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical about the Latinx community in Washington Heights, featuring a blend of hip-hop, jazz, and Latin music that would complement Hamilton nicely.\n2. **Cabaret** - A classic Kander and Ebb musical set in 1930s Berlin, featuring a similar blend of jazz, cabaret, and musical theater styles found in Chicago.\n3. **Rent** - Jonathan Larson's rock musical about artists living in New York City in the late 1980s, featuring a similar blend of rock, pop, and R&B influences found in Hamilton.\n4. **Next to Normal** - A rock musical about a family struggling with mental health issues, featuring a similar blend of rock and pop influences found in Waitress.\n5. **The Last Five Years** - A musical about the complexities of relationships, featuring a blend of pop, rock, and folk influences that would fit nicely alongside \"Wait for It\" and \"All That Jazz\".\n\nThese songs and musicals should fit nicely into your playlist, but feel free to explore and add or remove songs to make it your own!",
