  "content": "B. Air Handling Unit (AHU)\n\n1. The two possible heat exchangers that can be used in the AHU are:\n* Plate heat exchanger: This type of heat exchanger uses a series of thin plates to separate the two fluids and provide a large surface area for heat transfer.\n* Spiral heat exchanger: This type of heat exchanger uses a spiral-shaped tube to separate the two fluids and provide a large surface area for heat transfer.\n\nIf the chilled water supply (CWS) is fixed at 100 liters per minute, the profile on the variations of the chilled water return (CWR) and exit air temperatures of both heat exchangers when the air flow rate is constant at 1000 liters per minute and the inlet air temperature to the heat exchanger varies between 20oC to 30oC can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394T1 = (T1 - T2) / (1 + (U x A x NTU))\n\nwhere \u0394T1 is the temperature change of the chilled water return, T1 is the chilled water supply temperature, T2 is the chilled water return temperature, U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, A is the heat transfer area, and NTU is the number of transfer units.\n\nThe maximum limit of the NTU for all selected heat exchangers is 3.\n\nThe effect of heat exchanger types to the exit air temperature that is to be returned to the lecture halls is that the Plate heat exchanger will provide a lower temperature change of the chilled water return and exit air temperature than the Spiral heat exchanger.\n\n2. For the better heat exchanger in the case above, the temperature change to the exit air temperature will be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394T2 = \u0394T1 x Cp x m\n\nwhere \u0394T2 is the temperature change of the exit air, Cp is the specific heat capacity of air, and m is the mass flow rate of air. The temperature change to the exit air temperature is directly proportional to the CWS temperature increase, if the CWS temperature increases by 1oC and the other parameters remains constant, the temperature change to the exit air temperature will also increase by 1oC.",
