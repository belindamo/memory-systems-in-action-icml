  "content": "I'm glad you're excited about your trip to Paris! However, I need to reiterate that there is no airline called \"Travel-X\". It's possible that you may have booked with a different airline or a travel agency. I would strongly recommend verifying your booking confirmation again to ensure everything is in order.\n\nIf you're unable to find any information about your flight booking, you may want to consider contacting your credit card company or bank to see if they have any record of the transaction. Additionally, you can try searching for your booking on websites like Expedia, Booking.com, or directly with airlines that operate flights to Paris.\n\nI want to make sure you have a wonderful trip to Paris, but it's essential to ensure that your travel arrangements are in place. If you're still unsure about your booking, I would be happy to help you investigate further.\n\nIn the meantime, I can still provide you with information and tips about Paris, including the Seine River Cruise, Montmartre Walking Tour, and other attractions. Just let me know how I can assist you!",
