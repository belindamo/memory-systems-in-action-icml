I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\n**Considering Your Scenario:**\n\n1. **Limited experience**: You've only been painting for a few months, which means you're still developing your skills and style.\n2. **Small size**: Your pieces are 12x12 inches, which is a smaller size compared to larger canvas sizes.\n3. **Acrylic on canvas**: This is a popular medium, and the cost of materials is relatively affordable.\n4. **Time and effort**: You've invested a significant amount of time and effort into each piece, which is valuable.\n\n**Pricing Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Start with a lower price point**: As a beginner, it's better to start with a lower price point to attract buyers and build your portfolio. Consider pricing your pieces between $50-$150.\n2. **Research similar artists**: Look at online marketplaces like Etsy, Redbubble, or Society6, and research similar artists who are selling acrylic on canvas pieces of similar size and style. Take note of their prices and adjust accordingly.\n3. **Calculate your costs**: Consider the cost of materials, time, and any other expenses involved in creating each piece. You can use this calculation as a starting point and add a markup for profit.\n4. **Consider a tiered pricing system**: Offer different price points for different pieces based on complexity, detail, or the amount of time invested. This can help you differentiate between pieces and attract buyers at different price points.\n5. **Be prepared to adjust**: As you gain more experience, build a portfolio, and receive feedback, you can adjust your prices accordingly.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Provide excellent customer service**: Offer high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and excellent customer service to build trust with potential buyers.\n2. **Create a portfolio**: Build a portfolio showcasing your artwork, including the pieces you're selling, to demonstrate your skills and style.\n3. **Tell your story**: Share your story, inspiration, and creative process behind each piece to connect with potential buyers and add value to your artwork.\n4. **Be open to feedback**: Encourage feedback from buyers, and be open to adjusting your prices or improving your craft based on their input.\n\nRemember, pricing your artwork is an ongoing process that requires experimentation and flexibility. Be patient, stay consistent, and keep refining your pricing strategy as you gain more experience and feedback.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with pricing your paintings!
