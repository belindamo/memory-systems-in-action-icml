  "content": "I've been doing some research on pricing my paintings, and I was wondering if you could help me with a specific scenario. I took a weekend art class in April, and since then, I've been hooked on painting. I've created a few pieces that I'm really proud of, and I'm considering selling them online. However, I'm not sure how to price them. They're all acrylic on canvas, and they're around 12x12 inches in size. I've invested a lot of time and effort into each piece, but I'm not sure if I can charge a premium for them since I'm still a beginner. What would you suggest?",
