  "content": "I'm so glad you're considering the books with rhymes and interactive elements! They're perfect for engaging little ones and encouraging early language development.\n\nEthan is a wonderful name, and I'm sure your nephew is just as lovely! It's great that you're close with your sister and able to support her during this time. Being an aunt can be such a rewarding experience, and it's clear you're cherishing every moment with Ethan.\n\nI'm sure your cousin will appreciate the thought and love you're putting into the gift basket. Remember to include a personalized note or card to make it an even more special and heartfelt gift.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope your cousin's baby shower is a joyous celebration, and the new baby boy receives a warm welcome into the family!",
