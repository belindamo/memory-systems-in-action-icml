  "content": "I understand your persistence, but I must reiterate that there is no airline called \"Travel-X\". It's possible that you may have booked with a different airline or a travel agency. I would strongly recommend verifying your booking confirmation again to ensure everything is in order.\n\nRegarding the Seine River Cruise, I'd be happy to provide more information. However, I must clarify that I couldn't find any information on a hotel called \"Hotel Le Walt\" in Paris. It's possible that it's a small or boutique hotel, or it may not exist.\n\n**Booking a Seine River Cruise:**\n\n* You can book a Seine River Cruise through various companies, such as Bateaux-Mouches, Vedettes du Pont Neuf, or Compagnie des Bateaux-Mouches.\n* You can book online through their websites, or through a ticket vendor like GetYourGuide or Viator.\n* Some hotels may offer to book the cruise for you, but it's not guaranteed. You can ask your hotel (if you can confirm its existence) if they offer this service.\n* You can also purchase tickets directly at the pier, but be prepared for potential long lines and limited availability.\n\n**Getting to the Pier:**\n\n* The Seine River Cruise departs from various piers along the Seine River, such as Pont Neuf or Eiffel Tower.\n* You can use Paris's public transportation system, including the metro (lines 4, 6, or 12) or bus (lines 24, 27, or 68), to get to the pier.\n* You can also take a taxi or ride-hailing service, such as Uber, from your hotel to the pier.\n\nIf you're unable to find information on your hotel, I suggest trying to contact the hotel directly or checking online travel agencies like Booking.com, Expedia, or Hotels.com to see if they have any information on Hotel Le Walt.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.",
