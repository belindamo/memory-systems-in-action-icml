  "content": "I've been listening to a lot of musical soundtracks on Spotify lately and have been really into the music of Hadestown. I'm curious, are there any other musicals that have a similar vibe to Hadestown in terms of its folk-rock sound, but also have a strong female lead character? I love the story and music of Hadestown, but I'd love to explore more shows with complex, dynamic female characters.",
