  "content": "According to American Airlines' current policy, on domestic flights like AA211 from LAX to JFK, they offer free snacks and soft drinks to all passengers.\n\nAs for meals, American Airlines typically offers a buy-on-board menu on this route, which means you can purchase food items like sandwiches, salads, and snacks on board the plane. However, they don't provide complimentary meals on this flight.\n\nThat being said, if you have elite status or are flying in a premium cabin, you might have access to additional food and beverage options. But for a standard economy ticket, you can expect to purchase any meals or snacks you'd like.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check with American Airlines directly or check their website for the most up-to-date information on their in-flight amenities and services.",
