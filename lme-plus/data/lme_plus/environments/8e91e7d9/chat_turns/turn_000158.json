Higher education institutions, particularly major research universities, are often major employers and drivers of innovation and economic growth in their communities. For example, the University of Michigan is estimated to contribute $22 billion annually to the Michigan economy, while the University of Texas at Austin is estimated to contribute over $8 billion annually to the Austin economy.\n\nIn addition to direct employment and research and development activities, universities also attract students, researchers, and visitors from around the world, creating demand for housing, food, retail, and other services in the surrounding community.
