  "content": "I can provide general guidance on dog nutrition, but please note that dog's needs and preferences might vary. chicken is a great treat option for dogs as it's a good source of protein and nutrition for them. however, it's important not to overfeed your dog with treats as they should only be a small part of their daily diet. it's generally recommended that treats should only make up 10% of a dog's daily caloric intake, and should be balanced with regular meals that meet their nutritional needs. in addition to chicken, you can mix up your dog's treats with other options i mentioned earlier such as cheese, peanut butter, apples, and carrots. it's also a good idea to check with your vet before changing your dog's diet or giving him a new treat regularly, especially if your dog suffers from any health issues.",
