Don't be too hard on yourself if you make mistakes \u2013 everyone learns at their own pace, and it's normal to struggle at first.\n\nKeep in mind that practice is key, so try to set aside some time each week to practice, even if it's just for a few minutes. Consistency is important when it comes to improving your dance skills.\n\nAlso, don't hesitate to reach out to Alex or other dance instructors if you have questions or need feedback on your progress. They're there to help you learn and improve, and they can provide valuable insights and corrections to help you grow as a dancer.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may seem. Learning to dance takes time, patience, and practice, but it's a journey worth taking.\n\nGood luck, and have fun dancing!",
