It's a beloved tradition that showcases a selection of genre-bending, cult, and often unconventional films that cater to fans of horror, sci-fi, action, and fantasy. Here's more about Midnight Madness:\n\n**History**\n\nMidnight Madness was founded in 1988 by TIFF programmer Colin Geddes, with the goal of creating a program that would showcase films that were too wild, too weird, or too outrageous for the mainstream. The first Midnight Madness screening featured the cult classic **Evil Dead 2**, which set the tone for the program's future.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nMidnight Madness films are often a mix of:\n\n1. **Horror**: From supernatural thrillers to slasher flicks, Midnight Madness has premiered some of the most iconic horror films of the past few decades.\n2. **Sci-Fi and Fantasy**: Expect a range of futuristic, intergalactic, and mythological adventures that push the boundaries of the genre.\n3. **Action and Thrillers**: High-octane, adrenaline-fueled films that keep you on the edge of your seat.\n4. **Cult Classics**: Films that are so bad they're good, or so weird they're wonderful.\n\n**Midnight Madness Premieres**\n\nSome notable Midnight Madness premieres over the years include:\n\n1. **Trainspotting** (1996) - Danny Boyle's iconic adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel.\n2. **The Blair Witch Project** (1999) - The found-footage horror phenomenon that became a cultural sensation.\n3. **Shaun of the Dead** (2004) - Edgar Wright's zombie romp that launched the careers of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.\n4. **Let the Right One In** (2008) - The Swedish vampire romance that became a genre classic.\n5. **The Raid: Redemption** (2011) - Gareth Evans' Indonesian martial arts extravaganza.\n6. **The Babadook** (2014) - Jennifer Kent's psychological horror film that became a critical and commercial hit.\n\n**The Midnight Madness Experience**\n\nAttending a Midnight Madness screening is an event in itself. The atmosphere is electric, with fans often dressing up in costume or participating in pre-screening activities. The screenings typically take place at the Ryerson Theatre, which is transformed into a party venue with DJs, decorations, and a lively crowd.\n\n**The People's Choice Award for Midnight Madness**\n\nThe Midnight Madness program also features its own People's Choice Award, which is voted on by the audience. This award is often seen as a predictor of cult success and has helped launch the careers of many filmmakers.\n\nI hope this gives you a sense of what Midnight Madness is all about! If you ever get the chance to attend a screening, it's an experience you won't soon forget.",
