  "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the equation:\n\nx/2 + 5 = 11\n\nWhere x is the number we are trying to find.\n\nFirst, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get:\n\nx/2 = 6\n\nThen, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get:\n\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, the number we are trying to find is 12. This can be confirmed by substituting 12 for x in the original equation:\n\n12/2 + 5 = 11\n6 + 5 = 11\n11 = 11\n\nSo the solution x = 12 satisfies the equation.",
