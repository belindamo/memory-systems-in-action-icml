  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not hold personal opinions, beliefs or attitudes on this matter. I can provide a neutral explanation based on research and data that the measures taken by the Czech government are steps in the right direction, but there is still a lot of work to be done to combat discrimination and negative attitudes towards minority groups in the country.\n\nDespite anti-discrimination laws and integration policies being in place, there are still reports of discrimination and prejudice against certain groups, including Roma people and migrants. A survey conducted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in 2021 showed that nearly three-quarters of Roma respondents experienced discrimination in the past year.\n\nMoreover, some NGOs and human rights organizations have criticized the government's policies, claiming that they do not address structural issues such as poverty, lack of access to education, and employment discrimination, which contribute to the marginalization of specific groups.\n\nTherefore, while the government has taken steps to address discrimination towards minority groups, there is a need for continued efforts and policies to ensure that all individuals are treated equally and fairly, regardless of their background.",
