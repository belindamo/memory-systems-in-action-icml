  "content": "To write an expression that shows how many goals Alexa scored, we can use the following:\n\nAlexa's goals = Trish's goals + 4\n\nThis expression states that Alexa's number of goals is equal to Trish's number of goals plus 4. In this case, we can represent Trish's goals with the variable g.\n\nTherefore, the expression that shows how many goals Alexa scored is:\n\nAlexa's goals = g + 4\n\nThis expression can be used to determine the number of goals Alexa scored given the number of goals Trish scored. For example, if Trish scored 5 goals, we can substitute 5 for g in the expression to find that Alexa scored 5 + 4 = 9 goals.",
