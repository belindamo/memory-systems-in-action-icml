Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Scythe**: A highly-acclaimed game set in an alternate history of the 1920s, where you build your own empire, manage resources, and expand your territory.\n2. **Pandemic Legacy**: A cooperative game where you work together with your friends to stop the spread of diseases and save the world. Each game builds upon the previous one, with new challenges and surprises.\n3. **Wingspan**: A bird-themed game where you collect and manage resources to build a network of habitats, attracting different bird species and earning points.\n4. **Gloomhaven**: A campaign-based game where you explore a fantasy world, battle monsters, and make decisions that impact the game world and your characters.\n\nThese games offer a mix of strategy, engine-building, and thematic immersion that might appeal to you if you enjoyed Azul.\n\nWhat do you think?
