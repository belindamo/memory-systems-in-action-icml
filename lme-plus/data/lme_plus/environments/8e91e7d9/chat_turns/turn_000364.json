  "content": "To write an expression that shows how many times a week Madison eats breakfast, we can use the following:\n\nMadison's breakfasts = Elizabeth's breakfasts - 3\n\nThis expression states that Madison's number of breakfasts is equal to Elizabeth's number of breakfasts minus 3. In this case, we can represent Elizabeth's breakfasts with the variable b.\n\nTherefore, the expression that shows how many times a week Madison eats breakfast is:\n\nMadison's breakfasts = b - 3\n\nThis expression can be used to determine the number of times a week Madison eats breakfast given the number of times Elizabeth eats breakfast. For example, if Elizabeth eats breakfast 7 times a week, we can substitute 7 for b in the expression to find that Madison eats 7 - 3 = 4 breakfasts a week.",
