  "content": "To write an expression that shows how many chocolate bars one of Amanda's friends will receive, we can use the following:\n\nChocolate bars per friend = Amanda's chocolate bars / 3 friends\n\nThis expression states that the number of chocolate bars per friend is equal to Amanda's number of chocolate bars divided by the number of friends. In this case, we can represent Amanda's chocolate bars with the variable c.\n\nTherefore, the expression that shows how many chocolate bars one of Amanda's friends will receive is:\n\nChocolate bars per friend = c / 3\n\nThis expression can be used to determine the number of chocolate bars one of Amanda's friends will receive given the number of chocolate bars Amanda has. For example, if Amanda has 9 chocolate bars, we can substitute 9 for c in the expression to find that each friend will receive 9 / 3 = 3 chocolate bars.",
