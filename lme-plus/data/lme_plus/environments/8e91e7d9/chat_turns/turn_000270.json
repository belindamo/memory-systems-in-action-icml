Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Morning Hours:**\n\n1. **Before 6:00 AM**: This is usually the quietest time on the path, with minimal foot and bike traffic. If you're an early riser, you'll likely have the path almost to yourself.\n2. **6:00-7:00 AM**: As the sun rises, you'll start to see more joggers, walkers, and cyclists. The path will still be relatively quiet, but you'll need to be more aware of your surroundings.\n3. **7:00-8:00 AM**: This is usually the busiest morning hour, with commuters and recreational users sharing the path. Be prepared for more traffic and potential congestion.\n\n**Bringing a Phone or Fitness Tracker:**\n\n1. **Phone:** Consider bringing a phone for:\n\t* Emergency situations: In case of an accident or medical issue, you can call for help.\n\t* Navigation: If you're new to the path, a phone with GPS can help you stay on course.\n\t* Music or podcasts: If you enjoy listening to music or podcasts while exercising, bring your phone and headphones.\n2. **Fitness Tracker:** If you have a fitness tracker or smartwatch, consider wearing it to:\n\t* Track your distance, pace, and heart rate.\n\t* Monitor your progress and set goals.\n\t* Receive notifications and stay connected (if your device allows it).\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Dress appropriately**: Wear reflective clothing, especially if you're planning to be on the path before sunrise.\n2. **Bring water and snacks**: Even if you're only going for a short walk or jog, it's a good idea to bring water and snacks to stay hydrated and energized.\n3. **Be visible**: Wear bright, reflective clothing and consider adding reflective strips or arm/leg bands to increase visibility.\n4. **Stay alert**: Keep an eye out for pedestrians, cyclists, and other obstacles, and be prepared to react to unexpected situations.\n5. **Enjoy the scenery**: Take in the beautiful views of Cherry Creek and the surrounding landscape!\n\nRemember to follow the path rules and regulations, and always prioritize your safety.
