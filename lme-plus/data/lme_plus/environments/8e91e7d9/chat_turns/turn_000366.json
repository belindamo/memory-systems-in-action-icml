  "content": "To write an expression that shows how many goals Patrik scored, we can use the following:\n\nPatrik's goals = 2 \\* Jack's goals\n\nThis expression states that Patrik's number of goals is equal to twice Jack's number of goals. In this case, we can represent Jack's goals with the variable g.\n\nTherefore, the expression that shows how many goals Patrik scored is:\n\nPatrik's goals = 2 \\* g\n\nThis expression can be used to determine the number of goals Patrik scored given the number of goals Jack scored. For example, if Jack scored 5 goals, we can substitute 5 for g in the expression to find that Patrik scored 2 \\* 5 = 10 goals.",
