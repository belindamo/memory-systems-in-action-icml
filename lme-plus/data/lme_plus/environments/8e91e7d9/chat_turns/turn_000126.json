When shooting with a wide-angle lens, here are some tips to help you make the most of the morning light:\n\n1. **Get there early**: Arrive at the park before sunrise to capture the soft, pre-dawn light. This is often the most magical time of day, with a gentle, warm glow that's perfect for capturing flowers.\n2. **Shoot towards the sun**: When the sun is low on the horizon, shoot towards it to capture the warm, golden light. This will help to create a beautiful, soft glow on your flowers.\n3. **Use the soft light to your advantage**: The soft morning light is ideal for capturing flowers, as it reduces harsh shadows and highlights. Take advantage of this by shooting in open areas or near reflective surfaces like water or dew-covered leaves.\n4. **Take advantage of the long shadows**: Although the light is soft, the shadows can still be quite long and dramatic. Use these shadows to add depth and interest to your photos.\n5. **Look for backlight**: When the sun is behind your subject, use the backlight to create a beautiful rim of light around the flowers. This can add depth and dimensionality to your photos.\n6. **Shoot in RAW**: Shooting in RAW format gives you more flexibility when editing your photos, especially when working with the soft, morning light.\n7. **Pay attention to the clouds**: Clouds can add interest and texture to your photos, especially when they're illuminated by the morning sun. Look for clouds that are tinted with warm, golden light to add depth and atmosphere to your shots.\n8. **Experiment with exposure**: With the soft morning light, you may need to adjust your exposure settings to capture the full range of tones. Experiment with different exposure settings to find the one that works best for your shot.\n9. **Use the wide-angle lens to capture the environment**: The morning light is a great time to capture the environment around the flowers. Use your wide-angle lens to take in the surrounding scenery, including trees, hills, or other features that add context to your shot.\n10. **Take your time**: The morning light can be fleeting, so take your time to enjoy the moment and capture the best shots. Don't rush, and be prepared to wait for the perfect light.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to capture some stunning photos of the flowers in the soft, morning light. Remember to enjoy the experience and take your time to soak in the beauty of nature!",
