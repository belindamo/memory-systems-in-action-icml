  "content": "Yes, while many fruits are safe for dogs to eat in moderation, some fruits can be toxic to dogs. Here are some fruits to avoid feeding your dog:\n\n1. Grapes and raisins: Grapes and raisins can cause kidney damage and even be fatal to dogs.\n\n2. Avocado: Avocado contains persin, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in dogs.\n\n3. Citrus fruits: While small amounts of citrus fruits are generally safe, large amounts can upset a dog's stomach and cause vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n4. Cherries: While the flesh of cherries is safe for dogs, the pits contain cyanide, which can be lethal if ingested in large amounts.\n\n5. Fruits with pits: Fruits with pits, such as peaches and plums, can be a choking hazard for dogs and may cause digestive problems.\n\nAs with any new food, it's important to introduce fruits gradually and in small amounts to see how your dog reacts. If you notice any signs of digestive upset, such as vomiting or diarrhea, stop feeding the fruit and contact your veterinarian.",
