  "content": "That's great to hear that you enjoyed the salsa class!\n\nAs a beginner, it's generally a good idea to start with classes that are specifically labeled as \"beginner\" or \"fundamentals\" classes. These classes are designed to introduce you to the basics of the style, including footwork, rhythm, and technique. They're usually taught at a slower pace, and the instructor will break down the movements into smaller parts to help you understand and execute them correctly.\n\nAll-levels classes, on the other hand, are typically designed to cater to dancers of varying skill levels, from beginners to advanced. While they can be a great way to challenge yourself and learn from more experienced dancers, they may not provide the same level of attention to detail and foundational instruction that a beginner's class would offer.\n\nThat being said, if you enjoyed Alex's teaching style and feel comfortable with the pace and material covered in the class, you might consider taking an all-levels class with Alex. Since you've already had a taste of their teaching style, you'll have a better idea of what to expect, and Alex may be able to provide additional guidance and adjustments to help you progress.\n\nBefore signing up for an all-levels class, you might want to ask Alex a few questions to get a better sense of what to expect:\n\n* What's the typical level of the students in the all-levels class?\n* Will you be covering more advanced material, or will there be opportunities to review and refine the basics?\n* Are there any specific skills or prerequisites required for the all-levels class, or is it open to dancers of all levels?\n* How will Alex provide guidance and adjustments to students of different levels in the class?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll get a better sense of whether an all-levels class with Alex is right for you, or if you'd be better off sticking with beginner's classes for now.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of learning. If you're feeling challenged and motivated, that's a great sign that you're on the right track!",
