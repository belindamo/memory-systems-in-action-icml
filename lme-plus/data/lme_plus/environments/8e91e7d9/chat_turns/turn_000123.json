I've had some good experiences with capturing flowers in the past, like when I took a quick walk during my lunch break on February 22nd and snapped some photos of the blooming flowers in the park. Those photos turned out really well, and I'm hoping to replicate that success this weekend. Do you have any tips on how to capture the movement of flowers in the wind, or how to convey a sense of movement in my photos?",
