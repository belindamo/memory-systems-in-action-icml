However, I can provide a general overview of how external factors such as immigration and globalization have impacted Czech attitudes towards other ethnic groups based on available data from credible sources.\n\nThe Czech Republic has experienced significant demographic changes in recent years, with an increasing number of people from different ethnic backgrounds immigrating into the country. As of January 2021, the official data from the Czech Statistical Office shows that the number of foreigners residing in the Czech Republic has been steadily increasing, now accounting for 7% of the total population.\n\nGlobalization has also played a role in bringing about new cultural influences and economic opportunities in the country. As a result, there has been a growing interest in learning foreign languages, and Czech people have become more exposed to diverse cultures and traditions.\n\nHowever, the impact of these factors on Czech attitudes towards other ethnic groups has been mixed. According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2016, nearly 50% of Czechs have a negative attitude towards refugees, and many hold negative perceptions of Roma people, who are the largest minority in the Czech Republic.\n\nThere have also been cases of discrimination and xenophobia towards foreigners, particularly those from the Middle East and Africa. Still, many Czech people are welcoming and open-minded towards foreigners and have actively supported policies to promote integration and cultural diversity.\n\nIn conclusion, external factors such as immigration and globalization have had a varied impact on Czech attitudes towards other ethnic groups. While there has been some progress in promoting cultural diversity and integration, negative attitudes and discrimination towards certain minority groups persist.",
