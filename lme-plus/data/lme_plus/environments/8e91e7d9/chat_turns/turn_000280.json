  "content": "The marriage between Princess Diana and Prince Charles was marked by numerous scandals and rumors of infidelity, many of which became tabloid fodder and consumed significant media attention during her lifetime. \n\nThe most infamous affair was between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, whom he had known since the early 1970s and had maintained a close relationship with throughout his marriage to Diana. In 1992, a recording of a private conversation between Charles and Camilla emerged, which became known as the \"Camillagate\" scandal. In the recording, Charles expressed his desire to be Camilla's tampon, a comment that was widely criticized by the public.\n\nDiana also had extramarital affairs, including with her riding instructor James Hewitt, which was widely reported in the media. She also admitted to an affair with British-Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, which she said was a serious relationship.\n\nThere were also rumors that both Charles and Diana had affairs with multiple partners throughout their marriage. These allegations were often unsubstantiated and based on hearsay and anonymous sources, but they only fueled the public fascination with the couple and their troubled marriage.\n\nThe media scrutiny and public interest in their private lives took a heavy toll on both Diana and Charles, and their marriage ultimately ended in divorce in 1996.  Despite the controversy surrounding their relationship, Diana's legacy as a humanitarian and philanthropist has endured, and she is still remembered as a beloved figure by people all over the world.",
