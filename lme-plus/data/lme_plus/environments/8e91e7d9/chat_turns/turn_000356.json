  "content": "If we use four digits of precision for pi and the square of 38.1, the area of Captain America's shield would be:\n\nA = 3.1416 \\* 38.1^2\n= 3.1416 \\* 1454.81\n= 4605.7376 cm^2\n\nThis would be a more precise approximation of the true value. However, keep in mind that the value of pi is an irrational number, which means it cannot be expressed exactly as a finite decimal. Therefore, any decimal approximation of pi will always be an approximation, no matter how many decimal places are used. In practice, it is often sufficient to use a few decimal places of pi to achieve a good level of precision in calculations.",
