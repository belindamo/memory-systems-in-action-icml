However, I'm a large language model, I don't have have information on specific panel discussions or events that occurred at the Austin Film Festival or any other festival. Each festival is unique, and the panels, speakers, and events can vary greatly from year to year.\n\nBut I can tell you that the topic of \"Diversity in Film\" is an important and timely conversation in the film industry. The lack of representation and diversity in film has been a long-standing issue, and it's crucial to have open and honest discussions about how to increase representation, inclusion, and diversity in front of and behind the camera.\n\nIt's great that you attended a panel discussion on this topic, and I'm sure you gained valuable insights from the industry experts and filmmakers who shared their experiences. It's essential to continue having these conversations and to take action to create more opportunities for underrepresented groups in the film industry.\n\nIf you're interested, I can provide some general information on the importance of diversity in film and some initiatives that are working to increase representation and inclusion in the industry.",
