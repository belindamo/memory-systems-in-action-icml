According to a report by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, UC Berkeley contributes approximately $9.8 billion annually to the Bay Area economy, with $4.2 billion of that directly benefiting the local economy in Berkeley. The university also supports over 80,000 jobs in the Bay Area, including both direct employment on campus and indirect employment in the surrounding community.
