  "content": "I'm thinking of adding a subtle, earthy glaze to bring out the natural tones of the clay and complement the texture. As for inspiration, I've been drawn to organic forms and natural shapes lately, so this vase is sort of a reflection of that. I'm imagining it sitting on a shelf or table, adding a touch of warmth and coziness to the space.\n\nBy the way, I've been meaning to ask: do you have any recommendations for displaying and packaging my sculptures for the craft fair? I want to make sure they're safely transported and visually appealing to potential customers.",
