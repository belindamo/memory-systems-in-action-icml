It's natural to reflect on your own life and wonder about the time you have left.\n\nThis is a common phenomenon known as \"mortality salience,\" where the awareness of one's own mortality becomes more prominent after experiencing a loss. It's a natural response to the existential crisis that can come with losing someone close.\n\nYour anxiety about not having enough time to do everything you want to do in life is also a common sentiment. It's a fear that many people experience, especially when they're faced with the reality of their own mortality.\n\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge that this fear can be overwhelming and debilitating if left unchecked. It's crucial to find ways to manage these feelings and focus on living in the present moment.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you cope with these feelings:\n\n1. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that these feelings are normal. Remember that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.\n2. **Focus on the present**: Instead of worrying about the future or past, try to focus on the present moment. Engage in activities that bring you joy and make you feel alive.\n3. **Set realistic goals**: Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem.\n4. ** Cultivate gratitude**: Reflect on the things you're grateful for in your life, including the time you have with loved ones and the opportunities you have to pursue your passions.\n5. **Seek support**: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings. Sharing your concerns with others can help you feel heard and understood.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel scared and overwhelmed. But by acknowledging these feelings and taking small steps towards managing them, you can learn to live with a greater sense of purpose and appreciation for the time you have.\n\nTake your time, be gentle with yourself, and remember that you're not alone in this journey.",
