Since you mentioned you're feeling overwhelmed with boxes and clutter from the move, I'd like to offer some additional tips to help you tackle that:\n\n* **Unpack one room at a time:** Focus on one room at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the amount of clutter.\n* **Use a \"unpacking station\":** Designate a specific area, like a table or countertop, as an \"unpacking station\" where you can sort and organize items as you unpack.\n* **Sort items into categories:** Group similar items together, like books, kitchen items, or linens, to make unpacking and organizing easier.\n* **Take breaks:** Unpacking can be physically and mentally exhausting, so be sure to take breaks to rest and recharge.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or areas of concern, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you.",
