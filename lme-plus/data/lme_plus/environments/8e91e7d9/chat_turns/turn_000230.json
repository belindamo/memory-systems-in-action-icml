While there's no single, definitive study on this topic, here are some insights:\n\n**Education level and book selection:**\n\n1. **Literary fiction and non-fiction:** Book clubs with higher education levels (bachelor's degree or higher) tend to favor literary fiction, classics, and non-fiction books. These genres often require a higher level of literacy, critical thinking, and analytical skills, which are more common among individuals with higher education levels.\n2. **More complex themes and topics:** Book clubs with higher education levels may be more likely to explore complex themes, such as social justice, philosophy, or historical events, which are often present in literary fiction and non-fiction.\n3. **In-depth discussions:** Higher education levels can also lead to more in-depth discussions and analyses of the books, which might attract readers who enjoy exploring complex ideas and themes.\n\n**Income level and book selection:**\n\n1. **Accessibility and affordability:** Book clubs with lower income levels might be more likely to choose books that are more affordable and accessible, such as paperback bestsellers, e-books, or borrowed library copies.\n2. **Popular fiction and genre fiction:** Lower-income book clubs might favor popular fiction, romance, or genre fiction (e.g., mystery, thriller, science fiction), which are often more widely available and affordable.\n3. **Leisure reading:** Book clubs with lower income levels might focus more on leisure reading, with an emphasis on entertainment and relaxation, rather than intellectual or literary pursuits.\n\n**Other factors influencing book selection:**\n\n1. **Cultural and social context:** Book clubs may choose books that reflect their cultural or social context, such as books by authors from underrepresented groups or books that address social issues relevant to their community.\n2. **Personal recommendations:** Book clubs often rely on personal recommendations, word-of-mouth, or online reviews, which can influence the types of books they read.\n3. **Accessibility of books:** The availability of books in local libraries, bookstores, or online platforms can also impact the types of books chosen by book clubs.\n\n**Correlations and exceptions:**\n\nWhile there are correlations between education level, income level, and book selection, there are also many exceptions. Some book clubs with lower education or income levels might choose literary fiction or non-fiction, while those with higher education or income levels might prefer popular fiction or genre fiction.\n\nIt's essential to remember that book clubs are diverse, and individual preferences play a significant role in shaping the types of books they read. These correlations are general trends, and there is no one-size-fits-all explanation for the types of books chosen by book clubs.\n\nKeep in mind that these insights are based on general trends and may not reflect your specific book club or community. The most important thing is to find books that resonate with your group and foster engaging discussions!",
