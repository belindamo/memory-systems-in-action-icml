  "content": "To find the area of a circle, you can use the formula:\n\nA = \u03c0r^2\n\nWhere A is the area, \u03c0 (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nThe radius of a circle is equal to half the diameter, so in this case the radius of Captain America's shield would be 76.2 cm / 2 = 38.1 cm.\n\nPlugging this value into the formula above, we get:\n\nA = \u03c0 \\* 38.1^2\n= 3.14 \\* 1454.81\n= 4604.7274 cm^2\n\nSo the area of Captain America's shield is approximately 4604.7274 cm^2.",
