There's a slight chance of scattered showers, but nothing too heavy.\n\nHowever, please note that weather forecasts are subject to change, and it's always a good idea to check again closer to your arrival time for the most up-to-date information.\n\nYou can check the latest weather forecast on websites like weather.com, accuweather.com, or wunderground.com for the most current information.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check with your airline, American Airlines, or the JFK Airport website for any travel advisories or updates on your flight status.\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you have a smooth flight!\n\n(P.S. If you'd like, I can also try to provide more information on your flight status, but I'll need to rely on external sources, so please let me know if you'd like me to check on that as well!)",
