Here are some tips to help you keep track of your coupons and ensure you use them before they expire:\n\n1. **Coupon Binder or Folder**: Create a binder or folder specifically for your coupons. You can categorize them by store, expiration date, or product type. This will help you quickly find the coupons you need and ensure you don't forget about them.\n2. **Digital Coupon Organization**: If you have digital coupons, consider using a digital coupon organizer like Flipp or Checkout 51. These apps allow you to store and organize your digital coupons, and they'll even remind you when they're about to expire.\n3. **Expiration Date Tracking**: Keep track of the expiration dates for each coupon. You can write the expiration date on the coupon itself or use a spreadsheet to keep track. Set reminders on your phone or calendar to ensure you use the coupons before they expire.\n4. **Coupon Prioritization**: Prioritize your coupons by expiration date or importance. Use the coupons that are closest to expiring first, and make sure to plan your shopping trip around those items.\n5. **Store Coupon Policies**: Familiarize yourself with each store's coupon policy. Know what types of coupons they accept, if they have any digital coupon limitations, and if they offer rainchecks for out-of-stock items.\n6. **Shopping List**: Create a shopping list based on the coupons you have and the sales at each store. Stick to your list to avoid impulse purchases and ensure you're using your coupons effectively.\n7. **Coupon Clipping**: Clip your coupons as soon as you receive them, and file them away in your binder or folder. This will help you avoid losing or forgetting about them.\n8. **Digital Coupon Loading**: If you have digital coupons, make sure to load them to your loyalty card or app before you shop. This will ensure they're applied to your purchase at checkout.\n9. **Coupon Stacking**: Check if the stores you're shopping at allow coupon stacking (using multiple coupons on a single item). This can help you maximize your savings even further.\n10. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your coupon collection and adjust your shopping plans accordingly. Remove expired coupons, and make sure you're using the most valuable ones first.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep track of your coupons, use them before they expire, and make the most of your shopping trip to Bed Bath & Beyond, Michaels, and CVS Pharmacy.
