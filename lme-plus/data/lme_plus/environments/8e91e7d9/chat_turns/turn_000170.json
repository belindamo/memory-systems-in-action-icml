  "content": "The Thule Evo rack is a fantastic choice for transporting your bikes.\n\nRegarding your old Cannondale road bike, its value depends on several factors, including its condition, age, model, and original components. Since you mentioned it's an older bike, its value might be more sentimental than monetary. However, you can still get a good price for it if you sell it online, especially if it's in good condition and has some desirable components.\n\nHere are some tips to help you determine its value and sell it online:\n\n1. **Research similar models**: Look up similar Cannondale road bikes from the same era to determine their current market value. Websites like eBay, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace can give you an idea of what similar bikes are selling for.\n2. **Check the condition**: Be honest about the bike's condition. If it's in excellent condition, with minimal wear and tear, it will be more valuable than a bike that needs repairs or has cosmetic damage.\n3. **Gather original components**: If your Cannondale still has its original components, such as wheels, derailleurs, or brakes, it can increase its value. Make sure to mention these components in your listing.\n4. **Take high-quality photos**: When taking photos of your bike, make sure they're well-lit, in focus, and show the bike from multiple angles. This will help potential buyers see the bike's condition and features.\n5. **Write a detailed description**: In your listing, include a detailed description of the bike, its condition, and any upgrades or repairs you've made. Be honest about any flaws or issues.\n6. **Set a competitive price**: Price your bike competitively based on your research. Keep in mind that you may need to negotiate, so leave some room for bargaining.\n7. **Choose the right platform**: Decide which online platform to use, such as eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace. Each has its own fees and rules, so choose the one that best suits your needs.\n\nIf you're unsure about the bike's value or don't have the time to sell it online, consider consulting with a local bike shop or a professional bike appraiser. They can help you determine its value and potentially sell it for you.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be honest about the bike's condition and features. Good luck with the sale, and I hope you get a great price for your Cannondale road bike!",
