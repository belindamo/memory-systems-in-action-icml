Candles are an excellent choice, and you've already got a good start with the ones you've purchased.\n\nHere are some suggestions to complement your candles and photo album:\n\n1. **Matching candle holder or vase**: Consider a beautiful vase or candle holder that will complement the style of the candles and add a decorative touch to your mom's home. You can find them at home decor stores like Pier 1, Crate & Barrel, or even thrift stores.\n2. **Fragrant diffuser**: A diffuser can enhance the ambiance and fragrance of the candles. Look for one that matches the scent of the candles or a neutral one that won't compete with the candle fragrances.\n3. **Cozy throw blanket**: A soft, plush throw blanket can add warmth and comfort to your mom's home. Choose a neutral color that will match her decor, and consider a material like fleece, Sherpa, or cashmere.\n4. **Decorative plate or tray**: A decorative plate or tray can be used to display the candles, photo album, or other small decorative items.
