I can provide you with general information about the NBA playoffs, but I won't be able to give you the latest updates or scores.\n\nThat being said, I can tell you that the NBA playoffs typically take place from April to June, and the Milwaukee Bucks did have a strong season in the 2020-2021 season, winning the NBA championship. But to get the latest information on the current NBA playoffs, I recommend checking out official NBA websites, sports news outlets, or following reputable sports journalists on social media.\n\nIf you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to help!",
