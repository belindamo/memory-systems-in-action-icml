  "content": "On American Airlines flights, including AA211 from LAX to JFK, they offer a range of in-flight entertainment options.\n\nYou'll have access to their seatback entertainment system, which features a selection of movies, TV shows, music, and games. However, it's worth noting that not all American Airlines planes have seatback screens, so it's possible that your plane might have tablet-based entertainment or streaming to your personal device instead.\n\nIn any case, you can expect to find a variety of content to choose from, including recent movies, popular TV shows, and music. Some content might be available for free, while other premium content might require a payment.\n\nIf you prefer to bring your own entertainment, you're welcome to do so! Just make sure your device is fully charged, as power outlets might not be available on the plane.\n\nIt's also a good idea to download any content you want to watch or listen to on your device beforehand, as internet access might not be available on the flight.\n\nI hope that helps, and enjoy your in-flight entertainment!",
