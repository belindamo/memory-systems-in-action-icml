      "content": "The tradition of celebrating New Year's Eve in Times Square started in 1904. At that time, The New York Times had recently moved to a new building in the area, and the paper's owner, Adolph Ochs, wanted to celebrate the opening of the building in a big way. He came up with the idea of a New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, which he called a \"New Year's Eve celebration of the ages.\"\n\nOn December 31, 1904, thousands of people gathered in Times Square to watch fireworks and a street party. The Times also lowered a large illuminated ball at the stroke of midnight to mark the occasion. The event was a huge success, and the tradition of the Times Square ball drop was born.\n\nThe ball itself has evolved over the years (from its initial iron and wood frame to a modern LED-lit sphere), but the basic idea of the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square has remained the same: a gathering of people from around the world to celebrate the arrival of the new year with a unique and memorable spectacle."
