      "content": "Sandra \"\u0160konk\" Gioia had been working at Banka Koper for the past two years. Her colleagues knew her well as someone who frequently took breaks and needed paid leave. Despite this, she was always able to complete her tasks on time and never missed a deadline.\n\nOne day, Sandra's boss, Mr. Novak, called her into his office. She knew what was coming. Mr. Novak had been keeping track of her frequent breaks and paid leave, and he was concerned about her productivity.\n\n\"Sandra,\" he began, \"I've been noticing that you take a lot of breaks and need a lot of paid leave. While I understand that everyone needs some time off, it's starting to impact your productivity. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to cut back on the breaks and leave.\"\n\nSandra was taken aback. She had always thought her work was satisfactory, and she didn't understand why Mr. Novak was making such a big deal out of her breaks and leave.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Novak,\" she said, \"but I really do need those breaks and leave. I have a condition that requires me to take frequent breaks, and I need to go to the doctor for regular checkups.\"\n\nMr. Novak looked surprised. \"I had no idea,\" he said. \"What kind of condition is it?\"\n\nSandra hesitated for a moment, then decided to be honest. \"I have an anxiety disorder,\" she said. \"Sometimes I need to take a break and calm down, or I won't be able to work at all. And I need to see my doctor regularly to manage my condition.\"\n\nMr. Novak looked sympathetic. \"I understand,\" he said. \"I had no idea. Please don't worry about taking breaks or leave when you need it. We can work something out to make sure you're able to manage your condition and still meet your work obligations.\"\n\nSandra felt relieved. She had been worried that Mr. Novak would be angry with her or think she was slacking off. But he had listened to her and understood her situation. She knew she had a good boss who cared about her well-being.\n\nFrom that day forward, Sandra felt more comfortable taking the breaks and leave she needed. She knew that her boss and colleagues understood her situation and supported her. And she was able to continue doing her job well, without the added stress of worrying about taking time off when she needed it."
