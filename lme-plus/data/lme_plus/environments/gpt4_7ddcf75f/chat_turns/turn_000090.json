  "content": "S. Carey's music is a great choice for beginners, as it often features simple yet beautiful melodies and chord progressions. Here are some S. Carey songs that I think would be great for beginners to learn:\n\n1. **\"In the Dirt\"**: This song features a simple, repetitive guitar pattern and a focus on atmospheric soundscapes. It's a great song to practice playing with a pick and creating ambient textures.\n2. **\"Mothers\"**: This song has a beautiful, introspective quality to it, with a simple chord progression and a focus on vocal harmonies. It's a great song to practice singing and playing at the same time.\n3. **\"Crown the Pines\"**: This song features a catchy, repetitive guitar riff and a simple chord progression. It's a great song to practice playing with a pick and creating a driving rhythm.\n4. **\"Fire-Scene\"**: This song has a haunting, atmospheric quality to it, with a focus on ambient guitar textures and a simple vocal melody. It's a great song to practice creating mood and atmosphere with your playing.\n5. **\"Glass/Film\"**: This song features a simple, repetitive guitar pattern and a focus on vocal harmonies. It's a great song to practice singing and playing at the same time, and creating a sense of space and atmosphere.\n\nAll of these songs are relatively simple and would be great for beginners to learn. S. Carey's music often features a focus on atmosphere and mood, so don't be afraid to experiment with different effects pedals or playing techniques to create a sense of space and depth in your playing.\n\nAdditionally, I would recommend checking out S. Carey's EP \"Hoyas\" which is a great starting point for beginners, it features simpler songs and it's a great way to get familiar with his style.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of learning. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things, and don't worry if you make mistakes - they're all part of the learning process!",
