It's also a low-impact activity, which means it's easy on your joints.\n\nRemember to start slowly and gradually increase your pace and duration as you get more comfortable. It's also essential to wear comfortable shoes and clothes, and to stay hydrated before, during, and after your walk.\n\nSince you're just starting out, you might want to consider setting some goals for yourself. For example, you could aim to walk for 30 minutes, three times a week, and gradually increase the frequency or duration over time.\n\nAlso, don't forget to track your progress and celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem. This will help you stay motivated and engaged in your exercise routine.\n\nIf you have any questions or need any tips on how to stay motivated, feel free to ask. I'm here to help.\n\nNow, go get walking!",
