If you're planning to use the tabs or chord sheets for commercial purposes (e.g., recording a cover song), make sure you have the necessary permissions or licenses.\n\nFor S. Carey and The Antlers, you might find some tabs and chord sheets on the above platforms. If not, you can try searching for specific songs or albums on YouTube, where you might find cover versions or tutorials that can help you learn the songs.\n\nGood luck, and happy playing!",
