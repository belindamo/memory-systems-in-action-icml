Carey's music, and they can indeed produce a warmer and more mellow tone.\n\nFor beginners, I would recommend the following nylon-string guitars:\n\n1. **Cordoba C3M**: The Cordoba C3M is a great entry-level nylon-string guitar that offers a warm, rich tone and a comfortable playing experience. It's a great choice for beginners, and it's very affordable.\n2. **Yamaha CG122MS**: The Yamaha CG122MS is another excellent choice for beginners. It's a well-made guitar with a rich, balanced tone and a comfortable neck. It's also very affordable and easy to find.\n3. **Taylor Academy Series nylon-string**: Taylor Guitars is known for their high-quality instruments, and their Academy Series nylon-string guitar is no exception. It's a great choice for beginners who want a high-quality guitar with a warm, rich tone.\n4. **Fender CN-60S**: The Fender CN-60S is a great choice for beginners who want a nylon-string guitar with a slightly brighter tone. It's a well-made guitar with a comfortable neck and a rich, balanced sound.\n\nWhen choosing a nylon-string guitar, keep the following things in mind:\n\n* **Action:** Make sure the action (string height) is low and comfortable to play. Nylon-string guitars can have a higher action than steel-string guitars, so it's important to find one that feels comfortable to play.\n* **Neck width:** Nylon-string guitars often have a wider neck than steel-string guitars, which can take some getting used to. Look for a guitar with a neck width that feels comfortable for your hand.\n* **String type:** Nylon-string guitars use nylon strings, which can be softer on the fingers than steel strings. However, some nylon-string guitars may use a higher-tension string, which can be more challenging to play.\n* **Body shape:** Nylon-string guitars come in a variety of body shapes, including classical, flamenco, and cutaway. Choose a body shape that feels comfortable to hold and play.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to find a guitar that feels comfortable to play and sounds good to your ears. Try out a few different options before making a purchase, and don't be afraid to ask for advice from a music store employee or a guitar teacher.",
