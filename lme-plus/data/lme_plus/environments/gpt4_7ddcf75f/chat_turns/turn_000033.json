Here are some tips to help you manage your time and focus on these two critical areas:\n\n**Developing a New Marketing Strategy with the Sales Team:**\n\n1. **Schedule dedicated time blocks:** Allocate specific times of the day or week to work with the sales team on developing the new marketing strategy. This could be a series of meetings or working sessions to ensure everyone is aligned and contributing to the strategy.\n2. **Set clear objectives and outcomes:** Define what you want to achieve with the new marketing strategy and what success looks like. This will help you stay focused and ensure the sales team is working towards the same goals.\n3. **Identify key stakeholders:** Determine who needs to be involved in the strategy development process and ensure they're available and committed to the scheduled meetings.\n4. **Use a collaborative approach:** Encourage open communication and collaboration with the sales team to ensure their input and feedback are incorporated into the strategy.\n5. **Establish a project timeline:** Create a project timeline with key milestones and deadlines to keep everyone on track and ensure the strategy is developed within the desired timeframe.\n\n**Attending High-Level Meetings with the Executive Team:**\n\n1. **Prioritize preparation:** Ensure you're well-prepared for executive meetings by reviewing relevant data, reports, and materials beforehand. This will help you contribute meaningful insights and demonstrate your expertise.\n2. **Schedule meeting prep time:** Allocate time in your calendar to prepare for executive meetings, including reviewing materials, researching topics, and preparing questions or topics for discussion.\n3. **Focus on key takeaways:** Identify the most critical information to share or discuss during the meeting and prioritize those topics. Avoid getting bogged down in minor details or tangential discussions.\n4. **Be concise and clear:** Communicate complex information in a clear, concise manner, avoiding jargon or technical terms that might confuse non-marketing executives.\n5. **Follow up and follow through:** After the meeting, ensure you follow up on any action items or commitments you made and follow through on any tasks assigned to you.\n\n**Balancing Time Between Both Areas:**\n\n1. **Create a calendar template:** Develop a calendar template that blocks time for both strategy development with the sales team and executive meetings. This will help you visualize your time commitments and avoid conflicts.\n2. **Set realistic time allocations:** Be realistic about how much time each task requires and allocate accordingly. Don't overcommit yourself by trying to fit too much into a short timeframe.\n3. **Use time-management tools:** Utilize tools like calendars, to-do lists, or project management software to stay organized and on track.\n4. **Learn to say no:** Be mindful of taking on too much and learn to say no to non-essential tasks that may interfere with your focus on these two critical areas.\n5. **Review and adjust:** Regularly review your time allocations and adjust as needed to ensure you're meeting your objectives and staying focused on the most critical tasks.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to effectively balance your time between developing a new marketing strategy with the sales team and attending high-level meetings with the executive team. Remember to stay flexible and adapt to changing priorities and deadlines.",
