It's great that you're taking proactive steps to manage your stress and improve your overall well-being.\n\nRemember to start with small amounts and adjust as needed. You can always increase the amount of peppermint oil you use, but it's harder to reduce the intensity once it's been applied.\n\nIn addition to using peppermint oil, here are some other tips to help you manage stress and improve mental clarity:\n\n1. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as yoga, meditation, or reading.\n2. **Stay organized**: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and create a schedule to stay on track.\n3. **Take breaks**: Take short breaks throughout the day to stretch, move your body, and rest your eyes.\n4. **Practice deep breathing**: Take a few minutes each day to focus on deep, intentional breathing. This can help calm your mind and reduce stress.\n5. **Seek support**: Don't be afraid to ask for help or guidance from colleagues, friends, or a mentor. You don't have to do it alone!\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's a sign of strength to acknowledge when you need help. By taking care of your physical and mental health, you'll be better equipped to tackle challenges and succeed in your new role.\n\nKeep me posted on how you find using peppermint oil during your yoga practice!",
