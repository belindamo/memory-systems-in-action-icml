Unfortunately, I'm not able to guess the exact type of cheese he used, but I can try to help you narrow down the options.\n\nHere are a few questions to jog your memory:\n\n* Was the cheese melted or did it have a bit of a crumbly texture?\n* Was it a strong, pungent cheese or a milder, creamier one?\n* Did it have a yellow or white color?\n* Did Mike mention the type of cheese he used, or did you ask him and forget?\n\nAny details you can provide might help me make an educated guess about the type of cheese Mike used. Alternatively, you could always ask Mike himself and get the answer straight from the source!",
