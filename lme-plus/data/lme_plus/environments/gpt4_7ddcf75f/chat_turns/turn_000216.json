The fact that it was spicy and smoky suggests that it might have been a Texas-style BBQ sauce, which often has a thicker, sweeter, and more robust flavor profile compared to other regional styles.\n\nWith that in mind, here are a few possibilities for the cheese:\n\n* Cheddar: A popular choice for BBQ-style burgers, cheddar has a sharpness that can stand up to the bold flavors of the BBQ sauce.\n* Pepper Jack: This variation of Monterey Jack cheese is flavored with jalape\u00f1o peppers, which would complement the spicy kick of the BBQ sauce.\n* Colby: A mild, semi-soft cheese that's similar to Cheddar but has a milder flavor, which could provide a nice contrast to the bold BBQ sauce.\n\nAs for the bacon, it's likely that Mike used a thick-cut, smoked bacon to add a rich, savory flavor to the burger.\n\nNow, I'm curious - did Mike's burger have any other toppings or features that you remember? For example, was it served on a toasted bun, or did it have any lettuce, tomato, or onion?",
