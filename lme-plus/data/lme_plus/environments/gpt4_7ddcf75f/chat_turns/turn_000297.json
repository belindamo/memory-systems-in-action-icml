It sounds like you're making some great choices to prioritize your health and well-being.\n\nDrinking at least 8 cups of water throughout the day is an excellent habit to stay hydrated and support overall health. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and decreased focus, so it's great that you're making a conscious effort to drink plenty of water.\n\nLimiting your caffeine intake is also a great move. While caffeine can provide a temporary energy boost, excessive consumption can lead to jitters, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. By restricting your caffeine intake to one cup of coffee in the morning and one cup of tea in the afternoon, you're avoiding the negative effects while still getting a gentle energy lift.\n\nIt's wonderful that you've noticed an improvement in your focus and energy levels since making these changes. It's all about finding that balance and listening to your body, isn't it?\n\nKeep up the good work, and remember to be kind to yourself if you ever slip up. It's all about progress, not perfection!",
