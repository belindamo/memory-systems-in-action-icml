  "content": "I want to work out 5 days a week, with 2 rest days on the weekend. My goals are to maintain my current fitness level and continue making progress on my cardiovascular health and strength training. I'm at an intermediate level. I can dedicate about 30-45 minutes per workout session. I prefer to work out in the morning, around 6:30 am. I've been doing yoga on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and jogging on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I've also been doing strength training three times a week, focusing on upper body exercises.",
