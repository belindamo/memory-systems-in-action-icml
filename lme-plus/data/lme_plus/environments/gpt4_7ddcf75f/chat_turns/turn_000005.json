Feel free to adjust the schedule as needed to fit your individual needs and work style.\n\nRemember to prioritize self-care and take breaks to avoid burnout. You can also adjust the schedule to accommodate meetings, appointments, or other commitments.\n\nHow does this revised schedule look to you? Is there anything you'd like to change or add?",
