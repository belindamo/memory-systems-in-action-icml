Avoid relying on stereotypes: Don't rely on common stereotypes when creating your characters. Instead, give them unique and authentic qualities that make them stand out.\n\n2.

Explore different aspects of their personality, motives, and actions to avoid stereotypes.\n\n3. Use varied backgrounds: Characters from diverse backgrounds allow you to break away from traditional molds and create something fresh.\n\n4. Identify your character's motivations: It's essential to understand your character's motivations, goals, and desires. This will enable you to create authentic behaviors and reactions to different situations, which will keep your characters from feeling like cliches.\n\n5.
