  "content": "The Razer BlackWidow Lite is a PC-centric keyboard, and it's not natively compatible with the PS5. The keyboard is designed to work with Windows and macOS, and it doesn't have the necessary drivers or firmware to connect to a PS5.\n\nThe PS5 uses a different input protocol and operating system than PC, so you wouldn't be able to connect the Razer BlackWidow Lite directly to your PS5. Even if you could connect it, the keyboard's features and customization options would likely not be compatible with the PS5's operating system.\n\nIf you're looking for a keyboard to use with your PS5, you might consider a keyboard specifically designed for console gaming, such as the Razer Raiju or the SteelSeries Nimbus. These keyboards are designed to work with console systems like the PS5 and offer features like wireless connectivity, customizable buttons, and console-specific layouts.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a keyboard for PC gaming, the Razer BlackWidow Lite is still a great option. It's a solid gaming keyboard that offers great performance, customization options, and a compact design.",
