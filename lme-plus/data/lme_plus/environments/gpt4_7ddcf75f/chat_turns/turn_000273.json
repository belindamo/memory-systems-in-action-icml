Essentially, it is a virtual bulletin board where users can discover and share new ideas and inspiration. The platform is often used for planning projects or events such as home decorating, weddings, travel, and more.\n\nUsers can search for content by entering keywords into the search bar or by browsing through categories such as food, fashion, and beauty. When a user finds an image or video they like, they can save it to their own board or share it with their followers. Pinners can also follow other users and boards to stay inspired and discover new content.\n\nIn addition to saved content, Pinterest also features community boards and group boards where multiple users can contribute and collaborate on a single board.
