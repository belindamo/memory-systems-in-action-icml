  "content": "Auxins are plant hormones that can be used in plant cell cultures to promote cell growth and differentiation. The most commonly used auxin in plant cell culture is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).\n\nIAA can be synthesized artificially using chemical methods, or it can be extracted from plant tissues. However, because IAA is present in very low concentrations in plants, it is usually more cost-effective to produce it through chemical synthesis.\n\nTherefore, when you buy auxins for plant cell cultures, it is likely that they are synthesized chemically in a laboratory rather than extracted from plants.",
