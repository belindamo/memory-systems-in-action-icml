  "content": "A portable power bank is an excellent idea to keep your devices charged during your camping trip.\n\nA 10,000mAh power bank is a good size for charging small devices like the GoPro Hero8 Black. To determine if it's sufficient to charge your Hero8 Black a few times, let's do some math:\n\n* The Hero8 Black's battery capacity is approximately 1,220mAh.\n* A 10,000mAh power bank can charge the Hero8 Black around 8-10 times (10,000mAh \u00f7 1,220mAh), assuming 100% efficiency (which is not the case in real-world scenarios).\n\nConsidering the inefficiencies of charging and discharging, a 10,000mAh power bank will likely charge your Hero8 Black around 6-8 times. This should be sufficient to top up your camera's battery a few times during your camping trip, depending on your usage.\n\nHere are some tips to maximize your power bank's efficiency:\n\n1. **Charge your Hero8 Black when the battery is between 20% and 80% full**: Avoiding letting the battery drop to 0% or charging it to 100% can help prolong its lifespan.\n2. **Turn off your Hero8 Black when not in use**: This will help conserve battery life and reduce the number of times you need to charge it.\n3. **Use a high-quality power bank**: Look for a power bank with a high energy density, low self-discharge rate, and multiple USB ports to charge multiple devices at once.\n4. **Keep your power bank charged**: Make sure to charge your power bank before your trip and top it up when possible to ensure it's always ready to charge your Hero8 Black.\n\nA 10,000mAh power bank should be sufficient to charge your Hero8 Black a few times during your camping trip. However, if you're planning an extended trip or expect to use your camera extensively, consider bringing a larger power bank or additional batteries to ensure you stay powered up.\n\nRemember to pack your power bank, charging cables, and any other essential accessories in a waterproof bag to protect them from the elements during your adventure!",
