Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.\n2. Cook the bacon slices until crispy, then set aside.\n3. Form the beef patties to your desired thickness and season with salt and pepper.\n4. Grill the patties for 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.\n5. While the patties are cooking, toast the buns on the grill or in a toaster.\n6. Assemble the burgers by spreading a slice of cheese on the bottom bun, followed by a cooked patty, a few slices of bacon, a dollop of BBQ sauce, and finally the top bun.\n\n**Bun Suggestion:**\n\nFor a BBQ-inspired burger, I recommend using a sturdy, slightly sweet bun that can hold up to the juicy patty and tangy BBQ sauce. Here are a few options:\n\n* Brioche buns: These rich, buttery buns are a great match for the bold flavors of the BBQ sauce.\n* Sesame seed buns: A classic choice, sesame seed buns add a nice crunch and a touch of nutty flavor that complements the BBQ sauce.\n* Ciabatta buns: A slightly lighter, airier bun that won't overpower the flavors of the burger.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different bun options to find your favorite!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance. Happy grilling!",
