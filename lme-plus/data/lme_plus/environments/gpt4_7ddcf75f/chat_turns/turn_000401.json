Mindfulness Meditation: This is the practice of focusing your attention on your breath or a specific sensation in the present moment, without judgment. There are many guided meditations available online or through meditation apps, such as Headspace and  Insight Timer.\n\n2. Yoga: Physical movement and breath work can be a form of mindfulness that helps quiet your mind and reduce stress. You can find many YouTube channels and yoga apps that offer guided yoga classes.\n\n3. Mindful Breathing: Focused breathing can be a powerful tool to help manage stress and anxiety. You can try box breathing (inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts), or simply focus on taking slow, deep breaths.\n\n4. Mindful Walking: This is the practice of walking slowly and intentionally, paying attention to your breath and the sensations in your body and surroundings. You can practice this anywhere - on a nature trail, in your neighborhood, or even around your home.\n\n5.
