  "content": "I apologize for the oversight regarding the pilot/engineer. As for the cabin size, based on our previous calculations for the six-seater Pig with its increased dimensions, the cabin length is approximately 3.4 meters, width is around 1.7 meters, and height is 1.2 meters. While passengers may not be able to stand up, the cabin should provide enough space for them to sit comfortably.\n\nIf you would like to make adjustments to the cabin size or seating arrangement, I can recalculate the Pig's MTOW and dimensions accordingly.",
