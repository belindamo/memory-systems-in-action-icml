My morning routine typically includes a 30-minute walk on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, and catching up on my favorite podcast or responding to urgent work emails on Wednesdays and Fridays. I also have a consistent coffee routine and try to read the news or a book before leaving for work. I usually grab a quick breakfast on the go.
