  "content": "\"Pride and Joy\" by Stevie Ray Vaughan is a blues classic! The song features a iconic riff and a simple, yet infectious chord progression. Here's a simplified chord progression to get you started:\n\n**Chord Progression:**\n\nVerse:\nC - G - Am - F\nC - G - F - C\n\nChorus:\nG - Am - F - C\nG - F - C\n\n**Chord Shapes:**\n\n* C: 032010\n* G: 320003\n* Am: x02210\n* F: 133211\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Focus on playing clean, crisp chords with a strong rhythm. SRV's playing is all about the feel and the groove.\n* Use a steady, driving strumming pattern, emphasizing the 2nd and 4th beats in each measure.\n* Pay attention to your chord changes, especially between the Am and F chords, which can be a bit tricky.\n* Experiment with adding some subtle vibrato and string bending to give your playing some extra flavor.\n\n**Riff:**\nOnce you're comfortable with the chord progression, you can start working on the famous \"Pride and Joy\" riff. The riff is based on a 12-bar blues pattern and involves playing a series of single-note lines over the chord changes. You can find many online resources that provide tablature or video lessons to help you learn the riff.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect! Start with a slow tempo and gradually increase the speed as you become more comfortable with the chord progression and riff. Good luck, and have fun playing \"Pride and Joy\"!",
