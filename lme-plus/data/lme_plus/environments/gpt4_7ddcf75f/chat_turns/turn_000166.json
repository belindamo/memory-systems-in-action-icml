It's great that you normally take the 7:45 am train and it works out fine, but it's also good that you're acknowledging that unexpected things can happen.\n\nIn that case, instead of beating yourself up over it, why not focus on what you can do to minimize the impact of unexpected events in the future?\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Build in a buffer**: Consider leaving a bit earlier than usual to account for any unexpected delays. Even 10-15 minutes can make a big difference.\n2. **Have a backup plan**: Identify alternative transportation options in case you miss your train. This could be a nearby bus stop, a ride-sharing service, or even a backup train schedule.\n3. **Stay informed**: Sign up for updates from your train operator or use a transit app to stay informed about any service disruptions or delays.\n4. **Review and adjust**: Take this as an opportunity to review your morning routine and see if there are any adjustments you can make to reduce your chances of missing the train in the future.\n\nRemember, it's not about being perfect; it's about being prepared and flexible when things don't go according to plan.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there anything that resonates with you, or is there another area you'd like to explore?",
