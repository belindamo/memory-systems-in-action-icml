I must have made an error in my previous calculation.\n\nAssuming an average weight of 75 kg per person and 40 kg of baggage per person, the total weight for 6 people and their baggage would be:\n\n6 people \\* 75 kg/person + 6 people \\* 40 kg/person = 630 kg\n\nAdding this to the empty weight and other equipment weight, the revised MTOW for Pig would be:\n\nStructural weight: 680 kg\nPower system weight: 210 kg\nPayload weight: 630 kg\nOther equipment weight: 80 kg\n\nTotal MTOW: 1600 kg",
