Tomatoes and basil are a classic pairing, and adding some complementary plants can enhance their growth and flavor. Here are some suggestions for companion plants that go well with tomatoes and basil:\n\n**Beneficial Companions:**\n\n1. **Borage**: Attracts beneficial insects, improves tomato flavor, and adds nutrients to the soil.\n2. **Chives**: Repels aphids and other pests, adds nutrients, and improves tomato flavor.\n3. **Marigold**: Repels nematodes, whiteflies, and aphids, and adds color to the garden.\n4. **Oregano**: Repels pests, adds flavor to tomatoes, and improves soil health.\n5. **Parsley**: Repels carrot flies, improves soil health, and adds fresh flavor to dishes.\n6. **Radish**: Repels cucumber beetles, improves soil health, and can be used as a trap crop.\n7. **Spinach**: Shades the soil, reduces soil temperature, and adds nutrients.\n\n**Companion Plants to Avoid:**\n\n1. **Fennel**: Inhibits tomato growth and can cross-pollinate with dill.\n2. **Kohlrabi**: Competes with tomatoes for water and nutrients.\n3. **Members of the Brassica family** (broccoli, cauliflower, kale): Can be susceptible to the same diseases as tomatoes.\n4. **Potatoes**: Can spread diseases to tomatoes.\n\n**Tips for Companion Planting:**\n\n1. **Plant companions according to their growth habits**: Tall plants like sunflowers or corn can provide shade, while spreading plants like marigold or oregano can fill gaps.\n2. **Consider the mature size of each plant**: Ensure that companions have enough space to grow without overcrowding or competing with each other.\n3. **Plant companions at the right time**: Plant companions when tomatoes are still young, so they can establish themselves before the tomatoes grow large.\n4. **Keep the garden well-maintained**: Regularly water, fertilize, and prune plants to promote healthy growth and minimize competition.\n\nRemember, companion planting is not an exact science, and results may vary depending on your specific climate, soil, and garden conditions. However, by choosing beneficial companions, you can create a more diverse and resilient garden ecosystem that benefits both your tomatoes and basil.",
