  "content": "`typing-extensions` is a library that provides additional classes and functions for working with Python's built-in `typing` module. The `typing` module is a library that provides support for type hints, which are a way to specify the types of variables, function arguments, and return values. The `typing-extensions` library provides additional classes that are not included in the standard `typing` library.\n\nHere are a few examples of what `typing-extensions` library provides:\n\n* `Literal`: A class that allows you to specify that a variable or argument must have a specific value.\n```\nfrom typing_extensions import Literal\n\ndef greet(name: Literal[\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]) -> None:\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n```\n* `Annotated`: A class that allows you to add an additional annotation to a type.\n```\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\n\ndef calculate_area(radius: Annotated[float, \"in meters\"]) -> float:\n    return 3.14 * radius ** 2\n```\n* `Final`: A class that allows you to specify that a class is final, meaning that it cannot be subclassed.\n```\nfrom typing_extensions import Final\n\nclass MyClass(Final):\n    pass\n```\n* `Protocol`: A class that allows you to define a protocol, which is similar to an interface in other programming languages.\n```\nfrom typing_extensions import Protocol\n\nclass MyProtocol(Protocol):\n    def my_method(self) -> None:\n        ...\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def my_method(self) -> None:\n        ...\n\ndef my_function(obj: MyProtocol) -> None:\n    obj.my_method()\n\nx = MyClass()\nmy_function(x)\n```\nThese are just a few examples of what `typing-extensions` library provides, it has many more classes and functions like `Type`, `TypeVar`, `NoReturn` etc.\n`typing-extensions` is an open-source library and it is compatible with Python 3.5 and later versions.\nIt is widely used by python developers to increase the readability and maintainability of their code by providing additional information about types and protocols.",
