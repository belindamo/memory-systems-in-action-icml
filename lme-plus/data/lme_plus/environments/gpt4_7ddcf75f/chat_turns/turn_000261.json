  "content": "Microbial fermentation is one method for producing many of the inputs used in plant cell culture, including the nutrients, growth regulators, and other chemicals needed to support plant growth in vitro.\n\nFor example, amino acids, such as tryptophan and glutamine, can be produced through microbial fermentation, as can sugars, vitamins, and other nutrients. Similarly, many plant growth regulators, including auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, can be synthesized using microbial fermentation.\n\nIn addition to microbial fermentation, some inputs used in plant cell culture can be derived from plant or animal sources, such as plant extracts or animal serum. However, these sources can be more expensive and less consistent in composition than inputs produced through microbial fermentation.\n\nOverall, microbial fermentation is a widely used and cost-effective method for producing many of the inputs used in plant cell culture, particularly those that are difficult or expensive to obtain from natural sources.",
