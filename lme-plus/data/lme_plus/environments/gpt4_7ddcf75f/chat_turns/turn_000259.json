  "content": "Tryptophan, the amino acid from which auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) can be synthesized, is an essential amino acid that cannot be synthesized by plants and animals and must be obtained from the diet.\n\nIn plants, tryptophan is synthesized through the shikimate pathway, a metabolic pathway that produces aromatic amino acids, including tryptophan, from simple precursors. Plants obtain the precursors for the shikimate pathway through photosynthesis and other metabolic processes.\n\nTryptophan can be found in a wide variety of plant-based foods, including beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and many fruits and vegetables. In addition, tryptophan is often used as a dietary supplement for humans and animals and can be sourced from bacteria or yeast fermentation, as well as from plant-based sources.\n\nIn the context of industrial-scale production of IAA, however, tryptophan is usually obtained through microbial fermentation processes. Bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, can be genetically engineered to produce high levels of tryptophan, which can then be used as a starting material for IAA synthesis.",
