I'll make sure to mention that it's been garage-kept and not ridden in over a year, but also mention that it may require some maintenance to get it back in running condition. I'll keep the listing concise and to the point, and include clear photos of the bike. Thanks for the advice! Do you think I should also consider getting a mechanic's inspection or appraisal to get an independent assessment of the bike's condition?",
