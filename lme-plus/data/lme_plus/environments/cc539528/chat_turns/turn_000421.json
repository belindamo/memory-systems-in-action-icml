Use bullet points to make your resume easier to scan: Bullet points help break up large blocks of text and make it easier for the hiring manager to quickly scan your resume.\n2. Focus on quantifiable achievements: Where possible, use numbers and percentages to quantify your achievements. This can help give the hiring manager a better sense of the impact you've had in your previous roles.\n3. Tailor your resume to the job description: Look closely at the job description and use the language and key phrases from the job description in your resume. This can help your resume stand out and show that you have the skills and experience the employer is looking for.\n4. Remove irrelevant information: If you have information on your resume that is not relevant to the job you are applying for, consider removing it. This can help keep your resume focused and make it easier for the hiring manager to quickly see your relevant skills and experience.\n5. Proofread carefully: Make sure to carefully proofread your resume for errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. You can also ask a friend or family member to review your resume for you to catch any errors you might have missed.",
