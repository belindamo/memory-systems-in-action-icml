It's amazing how a chance encounter can bring back fond memories and create new connections.\n\nNow, about that pour-over: you're absolutely right that it's a great way to bring out the flavors of the coffee beans. The pour-over method allows for a high degree of control over the brewing process, which means you can tailor the flavor to your liking.\n\nHere are some tips to help you get started with pour-over:\n\n1. **Invest in a good pour-over dripper**: There are many types of pour-over drippers available, but look for one made from glass, ceramic, or stainless steel. Avoid plastic or paper filters, as they can absorb some of the coffee's natural oils.\n2. **Choose a high-quality coffee bean**: Fresh, high-quality beans will result in a more flavorful cup. Look for beans that have been roasted recently and have a good reputation for flavor.\n3. **Use the right water temperature**: The ideal water temperature for brewing coffee is between 195\u00b0F and 205\u00b0F. If the water is too hot, it can burn the coffee, while water that's too cold can result in a weak brew.\n4. **Use the right amount of coffee**: A general rule of thumb is to use 1 tablespoon of coffee for every 6 ounces of water. You can adjust this ratio to suit your taste preferences.\n5. **Pour in a circular motion**: When pouring the water over the coffee grounds, try to pour in a circular motion to evenly saturate all of the grounds.\n6. **Be patient**: Pour-over brewing can take a few minutes, so be patient and enjoy the process.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first few pour-overs don't turn out exactly as you hoped. Keep experimenting with different roasts, grind sizes, and brewing techniques until you find the perfect cup.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you enjoy your pour-over adventure!",
