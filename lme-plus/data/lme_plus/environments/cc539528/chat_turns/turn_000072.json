However, 2-ply toilet paper can still be a good option if it's designed to be clog-resistant.\n2. **Recycled fibers**: Toilet paper made from recycled fibers tends to break down more easily than virgin fibers.\n3. **High-water-absorption capacity**: Look for toilet paper that can absorb a lot of water, as this helps it break down faster.\n4. **Low-lint or lint-free**: Toilet paper with low-lint or lint-free properties reduces the amount of fibers that can cling to pipes and cause clogs.\n\nSome popular brands that offer sewer-safe or clog-resistant toilet paper include:\n\n1. **Scott**: Scott's 1000 and 1100 series toilet paper are designed to be clog-resistant and break down quickly.\n2. **Charmin**: Charmin's Ultra Strong and Ultra Soft toilet paper are both designed to be sewer-safe and gentle on pipes.\n3. **Quilted Northern**: Quilted Northern's Ultra Plush and Ultra Comfort toilet paper are designed to break down quickly and reduce clogs.\n4. **Cottonelle**: Cottonelle's Ultra Comfort and Ultra Clean toilet paper are both designed to be clog-resistant and gentle on pipes.\n5. **Seventh Generation**: Seventh Generation's Recycled Toilet Paper is made from 100% recycled fibers and is designed to break down quickly and reduce clogs.\n\nKeep in mind that even with sewer-safe toilet paper, it's still important to follow proper toilet etiquette and avoid flushing excessive amounts of paper at once.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to check the packaging or manufacturer's website to ensure the specific product you're interested in meets your needs and is suitable for your plumbing system.",
