  "content": "A fixed pitch instrument is one that cannot be tuned. This means that the instrument is always producing the same set of notes, and cannot be adjusted to produce different notes. [[1](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/50825/fixed-pitch-instruments)]\n\nA handpan is an example of a fixed pitch instrument, and it typically has a set of notes that are played by striking the instrument with a mallet. The notes on a handpan are arranged in a specific pattern on the surface of the instrument, and the player cannot change the pitch of these notes.\n\nIf you have the notes of your handpan, it's possible to find chords and songs that can be played on it. For example, if your handpan has the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B, you could play the following chords:\n\nChord name: C major\nNotes: C, E, G\n\nChord name: D minor\nNotes: D, F, A\n\nTo find songs that can be played on your handpan, you can look for songs that use only the notes that your instrument can produce. For example, songs that use only the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B would be able to be played on your handpan. Additionally, you could also transpose songs in a way that the chords and melody fits the notes of your handpan.\n\nKeep in mind that the handpan is a relatively new instrument, many songs and compositions are not written specifically for it, so you may have to make some adjustments to the songs you find in order to play them on your handpan.",
