Getting the right consistency and balance of flavors can be a challenge, but with some tips and tricks, you'll be on your way to making a delicious, thick, and tangy BBQ sauce.\n\n**Tips for achieving a thick, Southern-style BBQ sauce:**\n\n1. **Reduce, reduce, reduce:** One of the key factors in achieving a thick BBQ sauce is to cook it low and slow, allowing the liquid to reduce and the flavors to meld together. This will help thicken the sauce and intensify the flavors.\n2. **Use a roux:** Making a roux with flour or cornstarch can help thicken the sauce. Mix the roux with a small amount of oil or butter to create a smooth, thickening agent.\n3. **Tomato paste:** Using tomato paste instead of ketchup can help reduce the sugar content and add a deeper, richer flavor to the sauce. Look for a low-sodium tomato paste to avoid adding excess salt.\n4. **Acidity balance:** A good Southern-style BBQ sauce should have a balance of acidity from ingredients like vinegar, citrus, or hot sauce. This will help cut through the richness and sweetness.\n5. **Spices and seasonings:** Don't forget to add a blend of spices and seasonings like paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper to give your BBQ sauce depth and complexity.\n\n**Avoiding sweetness:**\n\n1. **Use a small amount of sweetener:** Start with a small amount of sweetener like brown sugar, honey, or molasses, and taste as you go. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess sweetness.\n2. **Balance with acidity:** As mentioned earlier, a balance of acidity will help counteract the sweetness. Don't be afraid to add a splash of vinegar or citrus juice to balance out the flavors.\n3. **Use a variety of sweeteners:** Combining different sweeteners like brown sugar, honey, and molasses can create a more complex flavor profile and reduce the overall sweetness.\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Southern-Style BBQ Sauce Recipe:**\n\n* 1 cup tomato paste\n* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar\n* 1/4 cup water\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 1 tablespoon honey\n* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1 teaspoon onion powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)\n* Salt to taste\n\nCombine all ingredients in a saucepan and whisk until smooth. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and reduced slightly.\n\n**Remember:** The key to a great BBQ sauce is to taste as you go and adjust the flavors to your liking. Don't be afraid to experiment and make changes to the recipe to suit your taste preferences.\n\nI hope these tips and the recipe help you create a delicious, thick, and tangy Southern-style BBQ sauce!",
