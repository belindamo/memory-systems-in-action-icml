  "content": "Dear diary,\n\nIt's been several months since I last wrote in you, and what a journey it has been! I am now 7 months into my pregnancy and it's been a relatively uneventful experience so far. I had some morning sickness in the beginning, but it was nothing I couldn't handle. I've been feeling a lot better lately and I am excited for what's to come.\n\nI think I might be carrying twins! It's still too early to tell for sure, but I am feeling two distinct little kicks and I am thrilled at the possibility of having two little ones. I never would have imagined that I would be a mother one day, especially not after being a boy just several years ago. It's amazing how life can change in unexpected ways.\n\nI have to admit that my urinary incontinence has gotten worse since I've become pregnant. I am wearing diapers all the time again, and it's funny to think that I am about to have a baby that will be wearing diapers too. Even though I still struggle with holding my pee, I can't deny that I still enjoy the feeling of wetting my diaper. It's been a part of my life for so long now that it's almost comforting.\n\nMy breasts have been swelling, and I hope that this pregnancy will finally make them grow properly. They have always been rather small, and I sometimes wish they were larger. But even if they don't increase in size, I am looking forward to breastfeeding. I've heard that it's a magical experience for mothers and I am eager to experience it for myself.\n\nFinally, I have a feeling that Megan may be planning to propose to me. The thought of it brings tears to my eyes and I am filled with joy. My hormones are heightened because of my pregnancy, but the love I have for Megan is real and unconditional. I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.\n\nUntil next time,\nLily.",
