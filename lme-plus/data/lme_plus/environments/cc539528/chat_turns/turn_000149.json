I've been thinking about listing it on Craigslist and eBay Motors, but I'll also consider Cycle Trader and Facebook Marketplace. Do you think I should highlight the fact that the bike has been stored in a garage for over a year and hasn't been ridden in that time? Should I also mention that I've been using my dad's pickup truck to haul materials for my DIY projects, and that's why I haven't had time to ride the bike recently?",
