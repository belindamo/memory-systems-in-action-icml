I just bought two new books, \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" by Taylor Jenkins Reid and \"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides, and I'm excited to start them once I finish \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah, which I'm currently reading. Do you have any other suggestions similar to these authors or genres?",
