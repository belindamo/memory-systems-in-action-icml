  "content": "Asking the pitmaster about their process and wood selection is a great way to learn more about their craft.\n\nAs for ordering, I'm happy to provide some recommendations! Since you're trying the brisket, you might want to consider ordering some other dishes to complement it. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n**Sides:**\n\n1. **Baked beans:** A classic BBQ side, baked beans are a great match for brisket. They're usually sweet, smoky, and tangy, which pairs well with the rich flavor of the brisket.\n2. **Coleslaw:** A creamy coleslaw can provide a nice contrast to the bold flavors of the brisket. Look for a coleslaw made with a vinegar-based dressing to cut through the richness.\n3. **Potato salad:** A creamy potato salad can be a great side dish, especially if it's made with diced potatoes, herbs, and a tangy dressing.\n\n**Other meats:**\n\n1. **Pulled pork:** If you're in the mood for something other than brisket, pulled pork is a great option. It's usually tender, juicy, and flavorful, with a nice balance of sweetness and tanginess.\n2. **Sausages:** If Smokey's offers sausages, consider ordering one to share with your group. Sausages can add a nice variety to your meal and provide a different flavor profile than the brisket.\n3. **Ribs:** If you're feeling adventurous, you could try an order of ribs to compare with your homemade attempts. Pay attention to the texture, flavor, and presentation to see how Smokey's does it.\n\n**Desserts:**\n\n1. **Peach cobbler:** A classic Southern dessert, peach cobbler is a great way to end your meal. Look for a warm, flaky crust and a sweet, fruity filling.\n2. **Banana pudding:** Another Southern favorite, banana pudding is a creamy, sweet treat that pairs well with the smoky flavors of BBQ.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to enjoy your meal and have fun! Don't be afraid to ask questions, take notes, and learn from the pitmaster's expertise. Happy eating!",
