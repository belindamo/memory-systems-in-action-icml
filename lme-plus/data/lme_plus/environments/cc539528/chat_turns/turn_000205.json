Here are some titles that are sure to entertain and engage your guests:\n\n1. **Ticket to Ride**: A popular train-themed game where players compete to build railroad routes across a map of North America. Easy to learn, but with enough depth for strategy.\n2. **Settlers of Catan**: A classic game of resource management and trading, where players build settlements, roads, and cities on an island. Great for groups of 5-7, with plenty of interaction and negotiation.\n3. **Pandemic**: Work together to save the world from deadly diseases! This cooperative game is perfect for larger groups, promoting teamwork and communication.\n4. **Codenames**: A word-guessing game where players try to identify words based on one-word clues given by their teammate. Hilarious and engaging, with plenty of laughter guaranteed.\n5. **Mysterium**: A cooperative game where one player takes on the role of a ghost trying to communicate with the other players (psychic mediums) to solve a murder mystery.\n6. **Deception**: A social deduction game where one player takes on the role of a spy, and the others must figure out who it is through deduction and negotiation.\n7. **Wits & Wagers**: A trivia game where players bet on the answers given by their opponents, making it a fun and social experience.\n8. **Taboo**: A fast-paced word-guessing game where players describe a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases.\n9. **Dixit**: A creative game where players try to guess which card was chosen by the storyteller based on a single clue.\n10. **Junk Art**: A dexterity game where players try to create the most impressive art piece using random junk items.\n\nThese games offer a great mix of strategy, social interaction, and fun, making them perfect for a group of 5-7 people. Make sure to have a variety of games available to cater to different tastes and preferences.\n\nTips for hosting a successful board game night:\n\n* Have a diverse selection of games to cater to different interests and skill levels.\n* Set a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere with snacks, drinks, and good lighting.\n* Encourage socializing and mingling before and between games.\n* Consider having a \"game explainer\" or a designated teacher for each game to help new players learn the rules.\n* Keep the games relatively short (30-60 minutes) to allow for multiple games and variety throughout the night.\n\nHave fun hosting your board game night, and I hope these recommendations help make it a memorable and enjoyable experience for your guests!",
