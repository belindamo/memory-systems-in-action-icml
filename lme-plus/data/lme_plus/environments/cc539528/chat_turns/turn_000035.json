  "content": "I've been trying out a few coffee shops near my bus stop, but I haven't found one that really stands out yet. I did try the new coffee place that just opened up near the bus stop last week, but their coffee was too bitter for my taste. I've been going back to my usual spot, which is a bit more expensive but has a better atmosphere. Do you have any tips on how to order coffee like a pro?",
