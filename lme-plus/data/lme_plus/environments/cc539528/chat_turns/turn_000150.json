  "content": "You're on the right track! Detailing the bike and taking high-quality photos will definitely help showcase its condition and attract potential buyers.\n\nRegarding the bike's history, it's essential to be transparent and honest in your listing. Highlighting the fact that the bike has been stored in a garage for over a year and hasn't been ridden in that time can be a positive aspect, as it shows that the bike has been well-maintained and not subjected to harsh weather conditions. However, you should also mention that the bike has been sitting idle for an extended period, which might affect its performance and require some maintenance to get it back in running condition.\n\nAs for your personal circumstances, it's not necessary to mention that you've been using your dad's pickup truck for DIY projects and that's why you haven't had time to ride the bike. While it's a nice gesture to provide context, it's not directly relevant to the bike's condition or sale. Keep the focus on the bike's features, condition, and history.\n\nHere's an example of how you could phrase it in your listing:\n\n\"2007 Kawasaki Ninja 650 for sale! This bike has been garage-kept for over a year and has not been ridden in that time. As a result, it's been well-maintained and has been protected from the elements. However, due to lack of use, it may require some maintenance to get it back in running condition. The bike has [insert mileage] miles and has been regularly serviced. It features [insert features, such as ABS brakes, etc.]. I'm looking for a serious buyer who will give this bike the attention it deserves. Please contact me with any questions or to schedule a test ride.\"\n\nRemember to include clear photos of the bike, including the odometer reading, and be prepared to answer any questions potential buyers may have. Good luck with the sale!",
