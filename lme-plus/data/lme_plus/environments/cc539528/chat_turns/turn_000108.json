This could be:\n\t+ Vacuuming stairs (if you have them)\n\t+ Cleaning under furniture or around tight spaces\n\t+ Focusing on a particularly dusty or high-traffic area\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Try to vacuum in sections, working in small areas to ensure a thorough cleaning.\n* Change your vacuum filter regularly to maintain its effectiveness and prolong its lifespan.\n* Consider vacuuming in slow, overlapping passes to pick up dirt and dust more efficiently.\n* If you notice any stains or spills, clean them immediately to prevent them from setting into the carpet.\n\nBy following this schedule, you'll be able to maintain your carpets' appearance and keep them looking their best. Remember, consistency is key, so try to stick to your schedule as much as possible.\n\nYou're already doing great with making your bed every morning, and now you'll be tackling your carpets too!",
