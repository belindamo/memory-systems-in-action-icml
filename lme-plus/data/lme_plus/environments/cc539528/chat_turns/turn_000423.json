  "content": "Hong Kong is a bustling city where many people work hard throughout their lives without taking the time to understand their inner selves and the meaning of their existence. As a result, some people in their retirement years look back on their lives with regret and remorse, realizing that they have neglected to cherish their limited time, pursued their dreams, spent time with family and friends, and repaired damaged relationships. They carry the burden of self-blame for the past and anxiety about the future, unable to enjoy the present moment or recognize the significance of their lives.\n\nDue to the influence of Chinese culture, many people may find it difficult to express their thoughts and feelings directly to those around them, such as saying \"I love you,\" \"I'm sorry,\" \"Goodbye,\" or \"Thank you.\" Furthermore, death is a taboo topic in Chinese culture, even though it is an inevitable stage of life that requires each person to prepare for it. Through the \"Four Paths of Life\" (Love, Thanks, Apology, and Farewell), social workers can encourage elderly individuals to reflect on their life experiences and discover the meaning of their lives. This approach enables them to face the unavoidable challenges of life, such as aging, illness, and death, and ultimately achieve the desire to leave this world without regrets by forgiving and reconciling with themselves and others.\n\nThe \"Four Paths of Life\" include expressing gratitude for those who have been kind to us, apologizing to those we have wronged, expressing love and care to important people in our lives, and saying goodbye to loved ones and making arrangements for after we are gone. This approach provides a comprehensive and proactive way for the elderly to prepare themselves for the end of life, allowing them to achieve peace and fulfillment in their final years.",
