  "content": "Write the second entry from the diary in which Lily recounts the last several months of her pregnancy, which is overall uneventful. She had some morning sickness at first, but that passed. Now she is 7 months pregnant and showing. She suspects she might have twins on the way, which excites her. She mentions that she still has urinary incontinence which has worsened since her pregnancy started, requiring her to wear diapers all the time again. She remarks on how ironic it is that she is about to have a baby (or possibly two!) that will be in diapers while she herself is also in diapers. She confesses she still enjoys the feeling of wetting her diaper all these years later. She also feels her breasts swelling and hopes that the pregnancy will finally make them grow properly. Her breasts have always been rather small and she sometimes wishes they were larger. Even if they don't increase in size, she looks forward to breastfeeding which is described as a magical experience for mothers. She ends the entry noting that she suspects Megan may be preparing to propose to her. The thought of this, combined with her heightened pregnancy-hormone emotions fills her with joy.",
