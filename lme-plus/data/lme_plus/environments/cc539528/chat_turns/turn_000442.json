  "content": "I like the team-building game ideas, especially the \"Two Truths and a Lie\" game. It seems like a great way to get to know each other better. By the way, speaking of getting to know each other better, I recently reconnected with my old high school friend Emma, who recently moved back to the city after living abroad for a few years. We met up for brunch and caught up on each other's lives. Anyway, back to the game night, do you have any suggestions on how to make it more interesting, like any prizes or rewards for the winners?",
