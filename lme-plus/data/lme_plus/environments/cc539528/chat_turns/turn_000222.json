Wash and dry the herbs, then chop them finely.\n\n2. In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil over low heat until warm.\n\n3. Add the chopped herbs and smashed garlic (if using) to the warm oil, stirring gently to combine.\n\n4. Let the oil and herbs simmer on low heat for 5-10 minutes, until the herbs start to release their fragrant oils and the garlic is lightly browned.\n\n5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the oil cool to room temperature.\n\n6. Strain the oil through a fine mesh sieve into a clean glass jar or bottle, discarding the herbs and garlic.\n\n7. Store the herb-infused olive oil in a cool, dark place for up to a month.\n\nThis delicious oil can be used as a marinade for meat, drizzled over roasted vegetables, or used as a dip for crusty bread.
