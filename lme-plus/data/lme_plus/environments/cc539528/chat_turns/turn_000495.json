I exist solely as a digital entity, so I don't have personal experiences or habits like humans do.\n\nBut I'm always happy to provide advice and tips on how to maintain a tidy space and establish a consistent cleaning routine! Consistency is indeed key to keeping a space organized and clutter-free. It's all about creating habits and systems that work for you and your lifestyle.\n\nRemember, it's not about being perfect; it's about making progress and being intentional about maintaining your space. Every small step counts, and celebrating your successes along the way can help motivate you to keep going!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance on organizing your kitchen drawers or maintaining a cleaning routine, feel free to ask!",
