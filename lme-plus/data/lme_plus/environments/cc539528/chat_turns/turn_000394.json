They can use data wrangling techniques to extract and clean the relevant data from the retailer's social media accounts. Here's how they can do it:\n\n1. Collect data: The researcher can extract customer feedback data from the retailer's social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using web scraping tools.\n2. Clean data: The researcher can clean the extracted data by removing irrelevant information such as likes, shares, and retweets. They can also remove duplicates and filter out spammy content.\n3. Analyze data: After cleaning the data, the researcher can analyze it to identify the most common complaints customers have about the retailer's products. They can use text analysis techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to identify patterns in customer feedback.\n4. Develop a plan: Based on the insights gained from the analysis, the researcher can develop a plan to address the most common complaints. For example, they can improve the quality of the products, improve customer service, or adjust the marketing strategy to better align with customer needs.\n\nBy using data wrangling techniques to explore customer feedback data, the researcher can gain valuable insights into the customer experience and develop strategies to improve it.",
