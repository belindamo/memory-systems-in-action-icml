The novel follows the story of Starr Carter, a Black teenager who witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood friend by a white police officer. Through her experiences, the book tackles themes of racism, police brutality, and the Black Lives Matter movement. It also explores the complexities of identity, as Starr navigates her identity as a Black girl from a poor neighborhood who attends a predominantly white private school. The novel provides a thought-provoking look at the impact of systemic racism on individuals and communities, and has been praised for its powerful and authentic portrayal of Blackness."
