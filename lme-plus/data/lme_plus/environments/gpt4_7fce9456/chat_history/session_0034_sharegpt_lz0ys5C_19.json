My name is [Agent Name], and I'm calling from Kallective Wellness CPR. We're like your personal trainers, but for life-saving skills.\n\nProspect: Haha, I like that! What do you guys do exactly?\n\nAgent: Well, we offer CPR training programs designed to reduce class time by 40% and increase hands-on training time by 50%, using the latest science and techniques. Plus, our \"Heartbeat Away\" scheduling guarantees delivery of same-day certification via email, so you can get back to saving lives in no time.\n\nProspect: Impressive! But why should I choose you over other options out there?\n\nAgent: Simple - we offer the lowest cost, more trainings, and no minimum or maximum student requirements. Plus, booking with us means you're supporting a local provider instead of a national organization that charges $126 per student and $250 per instructor with a minimum billing of eight students per class. And let's face it, who doesn't want to support their local heroes?\n\nProspect: You make a good point there. How do I sign up?\n\nAgent: Glad you asked! Just give me a few details, and we'll get you and your team trained up in no time. Trust me, you'll be saving lives like a superhero in your own right.\n\nProspect: Sounds great, let's do it!"

I wanted to tell you about an amazing opportunity for CPR training that I think would be perfect for you.\"\n3. Qualify the lead: Ask questions to determine if the person is a good fit for your services. For example, \"Can you tell me a little bit about your organization and your CPR training needs?\"\n4.

We prioritize lowest cost and more training to ensure that your employees receive the best value for their training investment.\"\n5.

We also have no training student minimum or maximum, so we can accommodate any group size.\"\n6. Close the sale: Once you have addressed any objections, ask for the sale. For example, \"Based on what you've told me about your organization's needs, I think we could provide the perfect solution for you. Are you interested in moving forward with our CPR training services?\"\n7. Follow up: If the person is not ready to make a decision, schedule a follow-up call and send additional information to keep the conversation going.

I can also send you some additional information about our services in the meantime.\"\n\nRemember to keep the tone friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful, and focus on how your services can provide value to the prospect.

      "content": "Here are some tactics that can help your sales agent get past the gatekeeper and reach decision makers:\n\n1. Build rapport with the gatekeeper: Take the time to establish a positive relationship with the gatekeeper by being friendly and personable. Show genuine interest in their role and responsibilities, and try to build a rapport based on shared interests or experiences.\n2. Use referral-based introductions: If possible, get a referral from a current client, colleague or mutual acquaintance to make an introduction to the decision maker. This can help build credibility and trust with the gatekeeper.\n3. Research the decision maker: Do your homework and gather as much information as possible about the decision maker before making the call. This can help you tailor your pitch to their specific needs and interests, and demonstrate your understanding of their business.\n4. Be persistent: Don't be discouraged if you're initially unsuccessful in reaching the decision maker. Keep calling back and trying different approaches until you're able to get through.\n5. Be respectful: Remember that the gatekeeper is just doing their job, and they're often under pressure to protect the decision maker's time. Be respectful of their role and responsibilities, and avoid being pushy or aggressive.\n6. Be concise: When you do get through to the decision maker, be concise and get straight to the point. Demonstrate that you understand their business and have a solution to meet their needs.\n7. Offer something of value: Provide the decision maker with something of value, such as a helpful resource or a free consultation. This can help demonstrate your expertise and build trust with the decision maker.\n8. Follow up: If you don't get an immediate response from the decision maker, follow up with a personalized email or handwritten note. This can help keep you top-of-mind and increase your chances of securing a meeting or call."
