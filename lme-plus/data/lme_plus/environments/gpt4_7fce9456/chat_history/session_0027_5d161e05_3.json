Here are some tips to help you keep your Nikon FM2 SLR camera in top shape:\n\n**Storage:**\n\n1. **Dry and cool environment**: Store your camera in a dry, cool place with minimal humidity (around 50-60% relative humidity). Avoid basements, attics, or areas prone to dampness.\n2. **Protect from direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause damage to the camera's materials, such as fading or discoloration of the paint, leather, or rubber.\n3. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Store your camera away from heat sources like radiators, heaters, or ovens.

Avoid using chemicals, liquids, or harsh cleaners, as they can damage the camera's finish or harm its mechanical components.\n2. **Lubricate the shutter**: Use a small amount of silicone-based lubricant (e.g., Sil-Glyde) on the shutter blades and mirror damper to keep them running smoothly. Apply a tiny amount to a soft cloth and gently wipe the blades and damper.\n3. **Check and clean the viewfinder**: Use a soft brush or a blower bulb to remove dust and debris from the viewfinder. Avoid touching the viewfinder glass with your fingers, as oils from your skin can leave marks.\n4. **Check the battery compartment**: Make sure the battery compartment is clean and free of corrosion. Remove any batteries when not in use to prevent leakage.\n5. **Test the camera regularly**: Periodically test your camera to ensure it's functioning properly. Check the shutter, aperture, and metering systems to identify any issues early on.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Handle with care**: Always handle your camera with clean, dry hands. Avoid touching the lens or other sensitive areas to prevent oils from your skin from leaving marks.\n2. **Use a lens cap**: Store the camera with a lens cap to protect the lens from scratches and dust.\n3. **Keep the camera strap clean**: Clean the camera strap regularly to prevent dirt and grime from transferring to the camera.\n4. **Document your camera**: Keep a record of your camera's history, including its serial number, purchase date, and any maintenance or repairs.\n5. **Consider climate-controlled storage**: If you live in an area with extreme temperature or humidity fluctuations, consider storing your camera in a climate-controlled environment, such as a temperature- and humidity-controlled storage unit.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your vintage Nikon FM2 SLR camera for years to come.
