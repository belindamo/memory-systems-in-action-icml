There are a few ways to do this:\n\n1. **GasBuddy**: GasBuddy is a popular app and website that allows you to search for gas stations along your route and filter by price, distance, and amenities. You can also earn rewards and discounts through their GasBuddy Perks program.\n2. **Waze**: Waze is a GPS navigation app that also shows gas prices along your route. You can filter by price and distance to find the cheapest options.\n3. **AAA**: If you're a AAA member, you can use their TripTik feature to plan your route and find discounts on gas, hotels, and attractions along the way.\n4. **Gas station loyalty programs**: Many gas station chains, like Shell, Exxon, and Mobil, have their own loyalty programs that offer discounts and rewards. You can sign up for these programs to earn points or discounts on gas purchases.\n5. **Cashback apps**: Apps like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, and Checkout 51 offer cashback on gas purchases at certain stations.\n6. **Travel websites**: Websites like Roadtrippers and ViaMichelin allow you to plan your route and find gas stations along the way, including prices and amenities.\n\nTo get started, could you please share your road trip route with me? That way, I can provide you with more tailored suggestions and discounts along your specific route."

      "content": "With your route, I can give you more specific suggestions.\n\nUsing your Kroger Plus Card for fuel points is a great way to save on gas, but let's explore other options to see if we can find an even better deal.\n\n**Kroger Plus Card**: Since you already have a Kroger Plus Card, you can earn fuel points on your groceries and redeem them for discounts on gas at Kroger-affiliated stations. This is a great way to save, especially if you're already shopping at Kroger.\n\n**Other options along your route**:\n\n1. **Iowa City**: In Iowa City, you can find several gas stations with competitive prices. According to GasBuddy, some options include:\n\t* Kum & Go: They have a loyalty program called Kum & Go Rewards, which offers 3\u00a2 off per gallon on every fuel purchase.\n\t* Casey's General Store: Casey's has a rewards program called Casey's Rewards, which offers 5\u00a2 off per gallon on every fuel purchase.\n2. **Omaha**: In Omaha, you can find gas stations with discounts through various loyalty programs:\n\t* Conoco: Conoco has a loyalty program called Conoco Rewards, which offers 3\u00a2 off per gallon on every fuel purchase.\n\t* Kum & Go (again!): Kum & Go has several locations in Omaha, and their rewards program can help you save 3\u00a2 per gallon.\n\n**Comparison**: If you earn 1 fuel point for every $1 spent at Kroger, you'll need 100 points to redeem $0.10 off per gallon. With your Kroger Plus Card, you can earn around $0.10 to $0.20 off per gallon, depending on your fuel point balance.\n\nIn contrast, the loyalty programs mentioned above offer fixed discounts per gallon, ranging from 3\u00a2 to 5\u00a2 off. While these discounts might not be as high as what you can earn with your Kroger Plus Card, they're still a good option to consider, especially if you're not earning fuel points on your groceries.\n\n**Tips**:\n\n* Always check the prices at each gas station to ensure you're getting the best deal, even with loyalty programs or discounts.\n* If you have a credit card that offers cashback on gas purchases, consider using it to earn additional rewards.\n* Keep an eye on gas prices along your route using apps like GasBuddy or Waze to find the cheapest options.\n\nConsidering your route and the loyalty programs available, it's likely that your Kroger Plus Card will still offer the best deal, especially if you've accumulated a significant number of fuel points. However, it's always a good idea to explore other options and compare prices to ensure you're getting the best deal."

      "content": "You're welcome!\n\n**Kroger Affiliate Stores**: Yes, you can earn fuel points by shopping at Kroger's affiliate stores, including Harris Teeter and Ralphs.

      "content": "**Earning Fuel Points on Online Purchases from Other Stores**: Unfortunately, you cannot earn Kroger fuel points on online purchases from other stores like Walgreens or CVS, even if you have their loyalty programs.\n\nKroger's fuel points program is specific to Kroger and its affiliate stores, including Harris Teeter and Ralphs. While you can earn rewards and discounts through Walgreens' Balance Rewards program or CVS's ExtraCare program, these rewards are not transferable to Kroger's fuel points program.\n\n**Why?**: Each loyalty program is designed to reward customers for shopping within that specific store's ecosystem. Kroger's fuel points program is a benefit exclusive to Kroger and its affiliate stores, while Walgreens' Balance Rewards and CVS's ExtraCare programs are designed to reward customers for shopping at their respective stores.\n\n**But Wait!**: There's a silver lining! You can still earn rewards and discounts through Walgreens' Balance Rewards program and CVS's ExtraCare program on their online purchases. These rewards can be redeemed on future purchases at their respective stores, but they won't be converted to Kroger fuel points.\n\n**Tips**:\n\n* Take advantage of the rewards and discounts offered by Walgreens' Balance Rewards and CVS's ExtraCare programs on their online purchases.\n* Consider using cashback apps like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, or Checkout 51, which offer rebates on certain purchases at various stores, including Walgreens and CVS.\n* Keep an eye on your rewards balances and redeem them regularly to ensure you don't miss out on potential savings.\n\nWhile you can't earn Kroger fuel points on online purchases from other stores, you can still earn rewards and discounts through their loyalty programs. Just remember to keep track of your rewards balances and redeem them accordingly."
