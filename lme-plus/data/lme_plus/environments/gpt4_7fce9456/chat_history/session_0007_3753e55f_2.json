These apps can help you categorize your expenses and provide a list of the stores you've shopped at.\n3. **Keep a grocery journal**: Start a small notebook or use a note-taking app on your phone to record each grocery trip, including the date, store name, and amount spent.\n4. **Ask your bank**: If you use a credit or debit card for grocery shopping, you can log in to your online banking account and review your transaction history to see a list of the stores you've shopped at.\n\nBy using one or more of these methods, you should be able to create a list of the grocery stores you've visited recently."
