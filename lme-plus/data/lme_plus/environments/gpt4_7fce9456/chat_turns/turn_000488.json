  "content": "The Sands Expo is located just off the Strip, and there are several hotels within walking distance or a short shuttle ride away. Considering you want to avoid taking a taxi every morning, I'd recommend the following hotels:\n\n1. **The Venetian**: As I mentioned earlier, The Venetian is a great option, and it's literally connected to the Sands Expo via a walkway. You can't get much closer than that!\n2. **The Palazzo**: The Palazzo is The Venetian's sister property, and it's also connected to the Sands Expo via a walkway. You'll have access to all the amenities of both hotels, and it's a great choice if you want to be close to the conference.\n3. ** Sands Expo-adjacent Hotels**: There are a few hotels located directly across the street from the Sands Expo, including the **Renaissance Las Vegas Hotel**, **Las Vegas Marriott**, and **SpringHill Suites by Marriott**. These hotels offer a more affordable option and are within a 5-minute walk to the Expo.\n4. **Wynn Las Vegas**: While not directly connected to the Sands Expo, the Wynn is a short 10-15 minute walk away. You can also take the Wynn's shuttle service, which stops at the Sands Expo.\n\nAll of these options will save you the hassle of taking a taxi every morning, and you'll be close enough to the conference to easily get there on foot or with a short shuttle ride.\n\nKeep in mind that the Venetian and Palazzo are both luxury properties, so they might be pricier than the other options. The Renaissance, Marriott, and SpringHill Suites are more mid-range hotels, while the Wynn is a luxury property with a more upscale atmosphere.\n\nLet me know if you have any other specific preferences or if you'd like more information about any of these hotels!",
