Here are some tips to help you keep your Nikon FM2 SLR camera in top shape:\n\n**Storage:**\n\n1. **Dry and cool environment**: Store your camera in a dry, cool place with minimal humidity (around 50-60% relative humidity). Avoid basements, attics, or areas prone to dampness.\n2. **Protect from direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause damage to the camera's materials, such as fading or discoloration of the paint, leather, or rubber.\n3. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Store your camera away from heat sources like radiators, heaters, or ovens. Temperatures above 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C) or below 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C) can cause damage to the camera's components.\n4. **Use a hard case or storage box**: Store your camera in its original case or a sturdy, padded storage box specifically designed for cameras. This will protect it from bumps, scratches, and dust.\n\n**Maintenance:**\n\n1. **Cleanliness is key**: Regularly clean your camera's exterior and interior with a soft, dry cloth to remove dust and dirt. Avoid using chemicals, liquids, or harsh cleaners, as they can damage the camera's finish or harm its mechanical components.\n2. **Lubricate the shutter**: Use a small amount of silicone-based lubricant (e.g., Sil-Glyde) on the shutter blades and mirror damper to keep them running smoothly. Apply a tiny amount to a soft cloth and gently wipe the blades and damper.\n3. **Check and clean the viewfinder**: Use a soft brush or a blower bulb to remove dust and debris from the viewfinder. Avoid touching the viewfinder glass with your fingers, as oils from your skin can leave marks.\n4. **Check the battery compartment**: Make sure the battery compartment is clean and free of corrosion. Remove any batteries when not in use to prevent leakage.\n5. **Test the camera regularly**: Periodically test your camera to ensure it's functioning properly. Check the shutter, aperture, and metering systems to identify any issues early on.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Handle with care**: Always handle your camera with clean, dry hands. Avoid touching the lens or other sensitive areas to prevent oils from your skin from leaving marks.\n2. **Use a lens cap**: Store the camera with a lens cap to protect the lens from scratches and dust.\n3. **Keep the camera strap clean**: Clean the camera strap regularly to prevent dirt and grime from transferring to the camera.\n4. **Document your camera**: Keep a record of your camera's history, including its serial number, purchase date, and any maintenance or repairs.\n5. **Consider climate-controlled storage**: If you live in an area with extreme temperature or humidity fluctuations, consider storing your camera in a climate-controlled environment, such as a temperature- and humidity-controlled storage unit.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your vintage Nikon FM2 SLR camera for years to come. Happy shooting!",
