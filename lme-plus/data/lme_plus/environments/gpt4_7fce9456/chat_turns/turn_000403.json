  "content": "I appreciate your detailed explanation on the importance of research when buying a condo. I'm currently looking at condos in the downtown area, and I'm considering a few options. I viewed a 1-bedroom condo on February 10th, but the noise from the highway was a deal-breaker. I'm looking for a condo with modern appliances and a community pool. Do you have any tips on how to evaluate a condo's appliances and amenities?",
