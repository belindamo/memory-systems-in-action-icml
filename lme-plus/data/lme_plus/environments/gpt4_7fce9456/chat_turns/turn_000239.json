  "content": "I cannot have a favorite graphic novel, but i understand your point. watchmen is a great example of how the setting can contribute to the mood and atmosphere of a graphic novel. the alternate history timeline creates a sense of unease, while the urban environment of new york city reflects the larger themes of corruption and decay. the use of iconic landmarks, such as the statue of liberty and times square, also adds to the story's cultural significance and reinforces the idea that this is an alternate version of the city we know. the attention to detail in the setting enhances the overall world-building and immerses the reader in the story's universe.",
