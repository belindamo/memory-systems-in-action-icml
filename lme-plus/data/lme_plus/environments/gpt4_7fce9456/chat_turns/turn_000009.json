  "content": "Lions are primarily known to be active at night and during the early morning hours, although they can hunt and feed during the day. They are crepuscular predators, which means they are most active at dawn and dusk, although they can also hunt at night. Lions have a powerful eyesight that is suited for hunting during low-light conditions, making it easier for them to catch prey when it is scarce. Another reason why lions prefer to hunt during the night is that it offers them better camouflage and reduces the risk of detection from potential prey.",
