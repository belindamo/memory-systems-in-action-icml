  "content": "Sure, here's an optimized cold call script for your company:\n\n1. Introduction: Start with a friendly greeting and introduce yourself and your company. For example, \"Hi, this is [Name] from Kallective Wellness CPR. How are you doing today?\"\n2. Get permission to continue: Ask if it's a good time to talk and if the person is interested in learning about CPR training. For example, \"Do you have a minute to talk? I wanted to tell you about an amazing opportunity for CPR training that I think would be perfect for you.\"\n3. Qualify the lead: Ask questions to determine if the person is a good fit for your services. For example, \"Can you tell me a little bit about your organization and your CPR training needs?\"\n4. Highlight the benefits: Explain how your services can meet their needs and provide value. For example, \"At Kallective Wellness CPR, we offer high-quality training with certified instructors using the latest science and techniques, which allows us to reduce class time by 40% and increase hands-on training time by 50%. We prioritize lowest cost and more training to ensure that your employees receive the best value for their training investment.\"\n5. Address objections: If the person expresses any concerns or objections, address them in a positive and helpful manner. For example, \"I understand that cost is a concern for many organizations. Our base level courses start at $80, with options to add in skill boosts for an additional $20 per skill boost and customize your training for an additional $20. We also have no training student minimum or maximum, so we can accommodate any group size.\"\n6. Close the sale: Once you have addressed any objections, ask for the sale. For example, \"Based on what you've told me about your organization's needs, I think we could provide the perfect solution for you. Are you interested in moving forward with our CPR training services?\"\n7. Follow up: If the person is not ready to make a decision, schedule a follow-up call and send additional information to keep the conversation going. For example, \"No problem, I understand that you need some time to think about it. Would it be okay if I followed up with you in a week? I can also send you some additional information about our services in the meantime.\"\n\nRemember to keep the tone friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful, and focus on how your services can provide value to the prospect. Good luck!",
