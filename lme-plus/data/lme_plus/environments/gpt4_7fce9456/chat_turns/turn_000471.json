  "content": "I've been trying to be more intentional with my purchases, especially since I've been shopping online so frequently. I've been using cashback apps like Rakuten and Ebates to earn rewards on my purchases, which has been helpful in saving some extra money. By the way, I bought a wireless charging pad from Best Buy's website on March 15th, which has been really convenient for keeping my phone charged. Do you have any tips on how to stay organized with online shopping, like keeping track of orders and packages?",
