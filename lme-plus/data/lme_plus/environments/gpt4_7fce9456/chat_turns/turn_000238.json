  "content": "I completely agree, the setting can truly make or break a graphic novel. One of my favorite graphic novels, Watchmen, utilizes its setting of an alternate history 1980s America to explore themes of power, corruption, and morality. The gritty urban atmosphere adds to the overall mood of the story and makes it feel more real and impactful.",
