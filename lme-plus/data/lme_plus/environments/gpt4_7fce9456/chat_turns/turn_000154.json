Attending Rachel's restorative yoga class regularly and supplementing with your daily morning flow has likely helped you establish a strong foundation for your practice.\n\nThe daily morning flow is a great way to start your day, as it can help increase energy, flexibility, and mental clarity. Sun salutations are an excellent way to warm up the body, get the blood flowing, and prepare for the day ahead. Adding gentle stretches to your routine can help maintain flexibility and range of motion, while also reducing the risk of injury.\n\nIt's also impressive that you've been able to commit to a daily practice, even if it's just 10 minutes a day. Consistency is key when it comes to seeing progress and experiencing the benefits of yoga. Even a short daily practice can have a profound impact on both physical and mental well-being.\n\nHow do you find that your daily morning flow affects your day? Do you notice any differences in your energy levels, mood, or overall sense of well-being after practicing?\n\nAlso, have you noticed any changes in your body or your yoga practice since starting Rachel's restorative yoga class? For example, have you noticed any improvements in your flexibility, balance, or strength?",
