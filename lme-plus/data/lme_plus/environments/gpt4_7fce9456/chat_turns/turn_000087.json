  "content": "Pulsar timing measurements were not used to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity in regards to the mass of Sirius. \n\nHowever, pulsar timing measurements have been used to confirm other aspects of Einstein's theory of general relativity, such as the existence of gravitational waves and the curvature of spacetime around massive objects. These measurements involve observing the regular pulses of radiation emitted by a pulsar and tracking any changes in their arrival time caused by the curvature of spacetime.\n\nTo confirm the mass of Sirius, astronomers have used a variety of methods, including analyzing the orbits of binary star systems, measuring the star's gravitational influence on nearby objects, and studying its spectrum to determine the star's composition and temperature.",
