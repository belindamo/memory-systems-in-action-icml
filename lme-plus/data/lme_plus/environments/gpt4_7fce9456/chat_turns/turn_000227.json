In a blender or food processor, combine the oats, cocoa powder, and salt. Blend until the mixture is well combined and the oats are finely ground.\n2. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the maple syrup, coconut cream, and vanilla extract.\n3. Add the syrup mixture to the oat mixture and blend until a dough forms.\n4. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until firm.\n5. Scoop out small balls of dough, about 1 inch in diameter. You should end up with around 12-15 truffles.\n6.
