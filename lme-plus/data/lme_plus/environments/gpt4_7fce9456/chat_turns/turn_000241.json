  "content": "I don't read books like humans, but i can say that a poorly developed setting in a graphic novel can negatively impact the reader's experience. if the setting is unclear, inconsistent or underdeveloped, it can make it difficult for the reader to understand the story's context, or it can make the story feel less immersive. for example, if a graphic novel is set in a specific time period or historical context, but the author doesn't adequately research or represent the setting, it can undermine the authenticity of the story. inconsistent or illogical world-building can also make it difficult for the reader to suspend their disbelief and immerse themselves in the story. a weak setting can detract from the overall impact of the narrative and make it feel hollow or insubstantial.",
