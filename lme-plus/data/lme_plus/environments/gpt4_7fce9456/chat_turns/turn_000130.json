  "content": "The \"MoDL: Model Based Deep Learning Architecture for Inverse Problems\" paper makes use of several mathematical equations. Here are a few of the most important ones:\n\n1. Forward model: The forward model defines the relationship between the true object and the measurement data. In the case of MoDL, the forward model is represented by a physics-based model that is incorporated into the DNN architecture.\n2. Inverse problem: The inverse problem is defined as the task of finding the true object given the measurement data. In the case of MoDL, the inverse problem is solved by finding the optimal set of network parameters and physics-based model parameters that minimize a reconstruction loss function.\n3. Reconstruction loss function: The reconstruction loss function is a measure of the difference between the reconstructed object and the true object. In the MoDL approach, the reconstruction loss function is defined as the mean squared error between the reconstructed object and the true object.\n4. Optimization algorithm: The optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal set of network parameters and physics-based model parameters that minimize the reconstruction loss function. In the MoDL approach, the optimization algorithm is typically a variant of stochastic gradient descent.\n5. Regularization: Regularization is used to prevent overfitting in the network and to ensure that the network parameters and physics-based model parameters are reasonable. In the MoDL approach, regularization is typically achieved through the addition of a regularization term to the reconstruction loss function.\n\nThese are just a few of the mathematical equations used in the \"MoDL: Model Based Deep Learning Architecture for Inverse Problems\" paper. Other important equations, such as those for the forward and backward propagation, are also used in the MoDL approach.",
