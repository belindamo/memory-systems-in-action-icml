  "content": "There are several challenges facing County Mayo's economy currently, including:\n\n1. Depletion of natural resources: The extraction of peat, fishing and farming have been the backbone of Mayo's economy for many years. However, the depletion of peat and overfishing have become major problems, leading to job losses and an economic downturn.\n\n2. Dependence on a few industries: Mayo's economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, fishing, tourism and manufacturing. The county's reliance on these industries makes it vulnerable to changes in the global economy.\n\n3. Brain drain: The young and educated people of the county are leaving in search of better job opportunities leaving the county with an aging population.\n\n4. Access to broadband: The lack of high-speed broadband in many parts of County Mayo is a persistent issue, and is limiting the county's ability to attract new businesses and support existing ones.\n\nTo address these challenges, the county council and other stakeholders have implemented a number of initiatives, including:\n\n1. Diversifying the economy: The county council is exploring new opportunities for economic development by attracting new industries to the area such as Renewables, IT and Lifesciences.\n\n2. Improving infrastructure: The government and the county council have invested in improving transportation, telecommunications and other infrastructure to make it easier for businesses to operate in the area.\n\n3. Supporting entrepreneurship: The county council provides financial support, mentorship and training programs for entrepreneurs starting new businesses in the area.\n\n4. Promoting Mayo as a tourism destination: The county council is promoting Mayo's natural beauty, culture and heritage to attract more visitors and generate revenue.\n\nOverall, while there are challenges facing County Mayo's economy, the county council and other stakeholders are taking proactive steps to address them and create sustainable growth in the long term.",
