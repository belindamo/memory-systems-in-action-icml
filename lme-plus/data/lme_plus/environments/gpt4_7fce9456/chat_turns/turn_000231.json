Here are some tips to help you store your fudge:\n\n1. **Air-tight container**: Store the fudge in an airtight container, such as a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. This will prevent air from getting in and causing the fudge to become dry or develop off-flavors.\n2. **Refrigerate**: Store the fudge in the refrigerator to slow down the oxidation process. The fudge will typically keep for 2-3 weeks in the fridge.\n3. **Freeze**: If you want to keep the fudge for a longer period, consider freezing it. Wrap the fudge tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place it in a freezer-safe bag. Frozen fudge can be stored for up to 3-4 months. When you're ready to eat it, simply thaw it in the refrigerator or at room temperature.\n4. **Room temperature**: If you plan to consume the fudge within a week, you can store it at room temperature in an airtight container. However, be aware that the fudge may become softer and more prone to melting in warmer temperatures.\n5. **Layering**: To prevent the fudge from becoming soggy or developing condensation, consider layering it with parchment paper or wax paper when storing. This will help absorb any excess moisture and keep the fudge fresh.\n6. **Keep it away from light**: Light can cause the fudge to become discolored or develop off-flavors, so store it in a dark or shaded area.\n7. **Monitor temperature and humidity**: Avoid storing the fudge in areas with high temperatures (above 75\u00b0F/24\u00b0C) or high humidity, as this can cause the fudge to become soft, sticky, or develop mold.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you can enjoy your vegan chocolate fudge for a longer period while maintaining its texture and flavor.",
