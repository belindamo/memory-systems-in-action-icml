Here are some tips to help you avoid impulse buying online:\n\n1. **Set a budget**: Decide how much you're willing to spend and stick to it. Consider setting a budget for specific categories, like technology or clothing.\n2. **Make a wishlist**: Before browsing, create a list of items you need or want. Stick to your list and avoid browsing aimlessly.\n3. **Use website blockers**: Tools like Freedom, SelfControl, or Cold Turkey can block shopping websites or apps during certain times of the day or for a set period.\n4. **Remove saved payment info**: Consider removing your saved payment information from websites to make checkout more difficult and give you time to think twice.\n5. **Use the 30-day rule**: When you see something you want to buy, wait 30 days. If you still need it after that, consider purchasing it.\n6. **Avoid shopping when emotional**: Don't shop when you're feeling stressed, bored, or emotional. Take a break and come back when you're in a clearer state of mind.\n7. **Read reviews and research**: Take time to read reviews, compare prices, and research the product before making a purchase.\n8. **Use cashback apps**: Cashback apps like Rakuten or TopCashback can help you earn rewards, but they can also make you more mindful of your purchases.\n9. **Unsubscribe from promotional emails**: Avoid temptation by unsubscribing from promotional emails or limiting the number of newsletters you receive.\n10. **Practice mindful shopping**: Be intentional with your purchases. Ask yourself if you really need the item, if you have space for it, and if it aligns with your values.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop new habits. Start with small changes and be patient with yourself. Good luck!",
