  "content": "Proposition 10: The success of a meme is positively correlated with the number of people who are exposed to it.\n\nRevision: The success of a meme is not necessarily correlated with the number of people who are exposed to it. The impact of a meme on its audience and the extent to which it is able to spread and persist depend on a variety of factors beyond simple exposure, including the appeal and relevance of the meme, the effectiveness of its presentation or execution, and the cultural context in which it is encountered.\n\nExtension: The proposition could be extended to consider the relationship between the number of people exposed to a meme and its success, taking into account the various other factors that can influence success. This extension could provide a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of a meme.\n\nProposition 11: The success of a meme is positively correlated with the number of people who create variations of it.\n\nRevision: The success of a meme is not necessarily correlated with the number of people who create variations of it. The impact of variations on the success of a meme depends on the quality and novelty of the variations and the extent to which they are able to appeal to and engage the audience.\n\nExtension: The proposition could be extended to consider the relationship between the number of variations of a meme and its success, taking into account the various factors that can influence the quality and appeal of the variations. This extension could provide a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of a meme.",
