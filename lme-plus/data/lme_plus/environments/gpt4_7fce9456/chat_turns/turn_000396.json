  "content": "Here are some tactics that can help your sales agent get past the gatekeeper and reach decision makers:\n\n1. Build rapport with the gatekeeper: Take the time to establish a positive relationship with the gatekeeper by being friendly and personable. Show genuine interest in their role and responsibilities, and try to build a rapport based on shared interests or experiences.\n2. Use referral-based introductions: If possible, get a referral from a current client, colleague or mutual acquaintance to make an introduction to the decision maker. This can help build credibility and trust with the gatekeeper.\n3. Research the decision maker: Do your homework and gather as much information as possible about the decision maker before making the call. This can help you tailor your pitch to their specific needs and interests, and demonstrate your understanding of their business.\n4. Be persistent: Don't be discouraged if you're initially unsuccessful in reaching the decision maker. Keep calling back and trying different approaches until you're able to get through.\n5. Be respectful: Remember that the gatekeeper is just doing their job, and they're often under pressure to protect the decision maker's time. Be respectful of their role and responsibilities, and avoid being pushy or aggressive.\n6. Be concise: When you do get through to the decision maker, be concise and get straight to the point. Demonstrate that you understand their business and have a solution to meet their needs.\n7. Offer something of value: Provide the decision maker with something of value, such as a helpful resource or a free consultation. This can help demonstrate your expertise and build trust with the decision maker.\n8. Follow up: If you don't get an immediate response from the decision maker, follow up with a personalized email or handwritten note. This can help keep you top-of-mind and increase your chances of securing a meeting or call.",
