  "content": "Setting up conversion tracking for your reusable water bottle product launch is a great idea. I'd be happy to help you set up an event tracking code to track when a customer adds the product to their cart or makes a purchase.\n\n**Setting up Event Tracking in Google Analytics:**\n\n1. **Create a new event category**: In Google Analytics, go to **Admin > Events > New Category**. Name the category something like \"Ecommerce Events\" or \"Product Interactions\".\n2. **Create a new event action**: Under the event category, create a new event action for \"Add to Cart\" and another for \"Purchase\". You can also create additional actions for other events, such as \"View Product\" or \"Remove from Cart\".\n3. **Set up event tracking code**: You'll need to add the event tracking code to your website. You can do this by using Google Tag Manager (GTM) or by adding the code directly to your website.\n\n**Event Tracking Code:**\n\nHere's an example of the event tracking code for \"Add to Cart\" and \"Purchase\" events:\n```javascript\n// Add to Cart event\nga('send', 'event', 'Ecommerce Events', 'Add to Cart', 'Reusable Water Bottle', {\n  'eventCategory': 'Ecommerce Events',\n  'eventAction': 'Add to Cart',\n  'eventLabel': 'Reusable Water Bottle',\n  'value': 1 // Optional: set the value of the event\n});\n\n// Purchase event\nga('send', 'event', 'Ecommerce Events', 'Purchase', 'Reusable Water Bottle', {\n  'eventCategory': 'Ecommerce Events',\n  'eventAction': 'Purchase',\n  'eventLabel': 'Reusable Water Bottle',\n  'value': 19.99 // Optional: set the value of the event (e.g., product price)\n});\n```\n**Where to add the code:**\n\nAdd the event tracking code to the relevant pages on your website:\n\n* \"Add to Cart\" code: Add to the \"Add to Cart\" button click event on your product page.\n* \"Purchase\" code: Add to the \"Place Order\" or \"Complete Purchase\" button click event on your checkout page.\n\n**Tips and Best Practices:**\n\n* Make sure to replace \"Reusable Water Bottle\" with the actual product name or ID.\n* Set the `value` parameter to track the monetary value of the event (e.g., product price).\n* Use a consistent naming convention for your event categories, actions, and labels.\n* Test your event tracking code by using the Google Analytics Debugger or by checking the \"Real-Time\" report in Google Analytics.\n\nBy setting up event tracking for \"Add to Cart\" and \"Purchase\" events, you'll be able to measure the success of your product launch and gain insights into customer behavior on your website.",
