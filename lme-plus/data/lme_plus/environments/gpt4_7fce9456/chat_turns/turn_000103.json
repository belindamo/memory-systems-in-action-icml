Displaying your grandmother's vase prominently in the living room is a great way to honor her memory and add a personal touch to the space.\n\nRegarding maintenance, it's essential to clean and dust your grandmother's vase regularly to preserve its beauty and longevity. Here are some tips to help you do so:\n\n1. **Dusting:** Gently dust the vase with a soft, dry cloth to remove any loose particles. Avoid using feather dusters or vacuum cleaners, as they can create static electricity that might attract dust particles.\n2. **Cleaning:** For more thorough cleaning, mix a small amount of mild soap, such as dish soap, with warm water. Dip a soft, clean cloth into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and gently wipe the vase. Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, or hot water, as they can damage the vase's surface or alter its patina.\n3. **Avoid direct sunlight:** Direct sunlight can cause colors to fade or become brittle over time. If possible, place the vase near a window with filtered sunlight or use sheer curtains to diffuse the light.\n4. **Handle with care:** Always handle the vase with clean, dry hands. If you need to move the vase, make sure to lift it carefully to avoid accidental drops or scratches.\n5. **Avoid extreme temperatures:** Avoid placing the vase near heating vents, fireplaces, or air conditioning units, as extreme temperature fluctuations can cause materials to expand and contract, potentially leading to cracks or damage.\n6. **Conservation-grade materials:** If you notice any damage or deterioration, consider consulting a professional conservator or restorer who uses conservation-grade materials and techniques to preserve the vase.\n7. **Regular inspection:** Periodically inspect the vase for any signs of damage, such as cracks, chips, or fading. Addressing issues promptly can help prevent further deterioration.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to maintain your grandmother's vase and ensure its beauty and significance are preserved for generations to come.\n\nRemember, the vase is not only a precious family heirloom but also a connection to your grandmother's love and legacy. By taking care of it, you're showing respect for her memory and the stories she shared with you.",
