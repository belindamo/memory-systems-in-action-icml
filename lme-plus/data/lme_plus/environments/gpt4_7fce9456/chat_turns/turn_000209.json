  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that the School of Rock is indeed a fun and inspiring movie with many memorable musical numbers. Some of the most beloved songs from the film include the opening number \"School of Rock,\" \"The Legend of the Rent,\" \"You're in the Band,\" and \"Teacher's Pet.\" The final performance of \"School of Rock (Teacher's Pet Reprise),\" where the students come together to showcase their talents and win the Battle of the Bands competition, is also a fan favorite. Every musical number contributes to the story and character development, and they all have an energy and passion that captures the spirit of rock and roll.",
