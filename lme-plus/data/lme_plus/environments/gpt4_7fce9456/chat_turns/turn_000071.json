  "content": "**Earning Fuel Points on Online Purchases from Other Stores**: Unfortunately, you cannot earn Kroger fuel points on online purchases from other stores like Walgreens or CVS, even if you have their loyalty programs.\n\nKroger's fuel points program is specific to Kroger and its affiliate stores, including Harris Teeter and Ralphs. While you can earn rewards and discounts through Walgreens' Balance Rewards program or CVS's ExtraCare program, these rewards are not transferable to Kroger's fuel points program.\n\n**Why?**: Each loyalty program is designed to reward customers for shopping within that specific store's ecosystem. Kroger's fuel points program is a benefit exclusive to Kroger and its affiliate stores, while Walgreens' Balance Rewards and CVS's ExtraCare programs are designed to reward customers for shopping at their respective stores.\n\n**But Wait!**: There's a silver lining! You can still earn rewards and discounts through Walgreens' Balance Rewards program and CVS's ExtraCare program on their online purchases. These rewards can be redeemed on future purchases at their respective stores, but they won't be converted to Kroger fuel points.\n\n**Tips**:\n\n* Take advantage of the rewards and discounts offered by Walgreens' Balance Rewards and CVS's ExtraCare programs on their online purchases.\n* Consider using cashback apps like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, or Checkout 51, which offer rebates on certain purchases at various stores, including Walgreens and CVS.\n* Keep an eye on your rewards balances and redeem them regularly to ensure you don't miss out on potential savings.\n\nWhile you can't earn Kroger fuel points on online purchases from other stores, you can still earn rewards and discounts through their loyalty programs. Just remember to keep track of your rewards balances and redeem them accordingly.",
