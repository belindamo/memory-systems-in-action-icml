However, I can provide information on the collaborations mentioned earlier, which have been highly regarded by fans of Capcom and other franchises involved in the partnerships. \n\nThe Marvel vs. Capcom series is one of Capcom's most successful collaborations, having been a popular and highly competitive fighting game franchise since its inception in 1996. The series has brought together many iconic characters from both universes, resulting in intense, fast-paced, and visually stunning gameplay.\n\nStreet Fighter X Tekken is another highly regarded collaboration that brought together two of the most prominent fighting game franchises of all time. The game features unique tag-team mechanics and a vast roster of characters from both series.\n\nThe Resident Evil x Last Day on Earth collaboration was a unique partnership that combined two vastly different games but was successful nonetheless. The partnership introduced new content to Last Day on Earth, which was well-received by players.\n\nFinally, Monster Hunter World x The Witcher 3 was a highly anticipated crossover event that introduced the Witcher's protagonist, Geralt of Rivia, into the world of Monster Hunter. The collaboration was highly regarded for seamlessly integrating Geralt's character into the already expansive Monster Hunter world, as well as bringing in new elements like the use of Witcher spells and weaponry.",
