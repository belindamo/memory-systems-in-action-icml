They're designed to work with wireless charging and are available for a wide range of phone models.\n2. **Clear cases with built-in screen protectors**: Cases like Tech21's Evo Check or Spigen's Liquid Crystal offer clear protection with a built-in screen protector. They're thin (around 0.5-1mm thick) and won't obstruct wireless charging. These cases often have a soft, flexible material that absorbs shocks and scratches.\n3. **Slim wallet cases**: Cases like Card Slot Case or Fossil's Wallet Case offer a slim design (around 2-3mm thick) with a built-in card slot. They usually have a soft, TPU material that provides protection against scratches and drops while still allowing for wireless charging.\n4. **Flexible TPU cases**: Cases like Anker's Karapax or Case-Mate's Tough Stand offer a flexible, shock-absorbing material that provides excellent protection against drops and scratches. They're usually thin (around 1-2mm thick) and work with wireless charging.\n\nWhen shopping for a case, look for keywords like \"wireless charging compatible,\" \"thin,\" \"slim,\" \"rugged,\" or \"flexible\" to find options that fit your needs.\n\nKeep in mind that even with a thin case, it's still important to check the specific case's dimensions and reviews to ensure it works seamlessly with your phone and wireless charging pad.",
