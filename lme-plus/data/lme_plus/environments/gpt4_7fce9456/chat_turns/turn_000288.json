  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot have a personal opinion. However, I can say that the initiatives being taken by the county council and other stakeholders are a step in the right direction towards addressing the brain drain problem in County Mayo. By supporting entrepreneurship, diversifying the economy and promoting the area as a tourism destination, the county council is creating more job opportunities and attractive incentives for young and educated individuals to remain in or return to the area. It is essential to have a thriving business eco-system and addressing the broadband connectivity issue. In the long term, these initiatives combined with other measures may help to retain young talent in the area and build a sustainable economy. However, it is necessary to monitor the development and success of these initiatives to determine their effectiveness in the light of the local needs.",
