Please note that rates may vary depending on the room type, availability, and any promotions that might be available. Here are some options:\n\n**Room Rates:**\n\n* **Deluxe Room (King or Queen):** around $180-$220 per night (total: $900-$1,100 for 5 nights)\n* **Executive Room (King or Queen):** around $220-$260 per night (total: $1,100-$1,300 for 5 nights)\n* **Suite (King or Queen):** around $300-$360 per night (total: $1,500-$1,800 for 5 nights)\n\n**Discounts and Promotions:**\n\n* **Conference Rate:** The hotel might offer a special rate for conference attendees, which can range from 10% to 20% off the regular rate. You'll need to provide your conference registration confirmation or a code to receive this discount.\n* **Business Traveler Rate:** As a business traveler, you might be eligible for a discounted rate, which can vary depending on the hotel's policies. This rate might include additional perks like free Wi-Fi, breakfast, or upgraded amenities.\n* **Marriott Bonvoy Member Rate:** If you're a Marriott Bonvoy member, you can earn points and enjoy exclusive discounts, which can range from 5% to 10% off the regular rate.\n* **Advance Purchase Discount:** Booking your stay in advance can result in a discounted rate, typically 10% to 15% off the regular rate.\n* **Package Deals:** The hotel might offer package deals that include extras like breakfast, parking, or attraction tickets, which can sometimes be cheaper than booking a room-only rate.\n\nTo get the best rate, I recommend checking the hotel's website, contacting their reservation team directly, or using a hotel booking website like Expedia or Booking.com. Be sure to ask about any available discounts or promotions, and don't hesitate to negotiate the rate if you're booking a large block of rooms or a long-term stay.\n\nKeep in mind that rates may change depending on the hotel's availability and other factors, so it's always a good idea to compare prices and book in advance to secure the best rate.",
