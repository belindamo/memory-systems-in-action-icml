  "content": "With 20% down, you'll avoid paying Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).\n\nPMI is an insurance policy that lenders require when a homebuyer puts down less than 20% of the purchase price. It protects the lender in case you default on the loan. PMI typically ranges from 0.3% to 1.5% of the original loan amount annually, and it's usually added to your monthly mortgage payment.\n\nSince you're putting 20% down, you won't need PMI, which is a great cost savings for you!\n\nNow, let's estimate your monthly mortgage payments based on the details you provided:\n\n* Purchase price: $340,000\n* Down payment: $68,000 (20%)\n* Loan amount: $272,000 ($340,000 - $68,000)\n* Interest rate: 4%\n* Loan term: 30 years\n\nUsing a mortgage calculator, here's an estimate of your monthly mortgage payment:\n\n* Principal and interest (P&I): $1,294\n* Property taxes (estimated): $400-500 (depending on the local tax rate)\n* Insurance (estimated): $100-150 (depending on the insurance provider and coverage)\n\nSo, your total estimated monthly mortgage payment would be around $1,794 to $1,944.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an estimate, and your actual payment may vary depending on other factors, such as homeowners association (HOA) fees, insurance rates, and property tax rates.\n\nHow does this estimate look to you? Are you comfortable with the monthly payment amount?",
