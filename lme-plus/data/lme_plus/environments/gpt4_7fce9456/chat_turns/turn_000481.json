  "content": "I think it's the raw energy and rebellious spirit of street art and graffiti that really speaks to me. I love how it can transform public spaces and challenge our perceptions of what art should be. Plus, the fact that it's often created in the midst of the city, in the midst of people's daily lives, makes it feel more accessible and relatable than traditional gallery art.",
