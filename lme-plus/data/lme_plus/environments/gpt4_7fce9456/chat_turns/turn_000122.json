  "content": "The paper \"MoDL: Model Based Deep Learning Architecture for Inverse Problems\" proposes the MoDL (Model-Based Deep Learning) architecture as a solution to the problems discussed in the field of inverse problems. The proposed solution is as follows:\n\n1. Incorporating the physics-based model into the DNN: The MoDL approach incorporates the physics-based model of the measurement process into the DNN architecture. This allows the network to learn the parameters of the physics-based model, which can improve the accuracy of the reconstruction results.\n2. Joint optimization of the network parameters and the model parameters: The MoDL approach performs a joint optimization of the network parameters and the parameters of the physics-based model. This allows the network to learn the parameters of the physics-based model that best fit the measurement data.\n3. Multi-layer architecture: The MoDL approach uses a multi-layer architecture, with each layer of the network performing a different step in the inverse problem. This allows the network to learn a complex mapping from the measurement space to the image space.\n4. End-to-end training: The MoDL approach is trained end-to-end, meaning that the network is trained on the measurement data directly, rather than pre-processed or transformed data. This allows the network to learn a mapping that is tailored to the specific measurement process.\n\nThe MoDL approach is designed to handle non-linear inverse problems and model mismatches, which can improve the accuracy of the reconstruction results. Additionally, the MoDL approach can be used to solve inverse problems involving large datasets, and the joint optimization of the network parameters and the model parameters can reduce the computational cost of the inverse problem.\n\nOverall, the MoDL approach is a novel approach to solving inverse problems that combines the benefits of traditional physics-based models and deep learning, and can provide improved accuracy and efficiency for solving inverse problems.",
