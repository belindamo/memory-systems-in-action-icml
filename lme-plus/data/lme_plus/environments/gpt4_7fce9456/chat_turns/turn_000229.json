Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium saucepan, combine the non-dairy milk, chocolate chips, cocoa powder, sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk until the sugar has dissolved.\n3. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil.\n4. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and reaches 235\u00b0F on a candy thermometer.\n5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.\n6. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top with a spatula.\n7. Let the fudge cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until firm.\n8. Cut into squares and enjoy! If desired, sprinkle with chopped nuts, dried cranberries, or shredded coconut before serving.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a high-quality vegan chocolate for the best flavor.\n* If you don't have a candy thermometer, test the fudge by dropping a small amount of the mixture into a cup of cold water. If it forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water, it's ready. If it doesn't form a ball, continue cooking the fudge and testing until it reaches the correct consistency.\n* Experiment with different flavor combinations, like adding a teaspoon of instant coffee or a pinch of cayenne pepper to the mixture.\n\nThis vegan chocolate fudge is creamy, rich, and indulgent \u2013 perfect for satisfying your sweet tooth!",
