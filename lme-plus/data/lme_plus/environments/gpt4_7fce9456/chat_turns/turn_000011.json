  "content": "Lions are social animals and typically hunt in groups, known as prides. A pride is usually made up of several adult females, their cubs, and one or more dominant males. When hunting, the lionesses will work together using tactics of cooperation, surrounding their prey animal, and isolating weaker members from the herd for attack. Hunting in a group allows lions to target larger and more dangerous prey, which they would not be able to bring down alone. While lions predominantly hunt as a group, solitary hunters, usually older males, are not uncommon.\n\nLions are territorial creatures that defend their space from other lions. A pride of lions typically occupies a certain area, which it seeks to defend against other prides in the region. Male lions are especially defensive of their territory, and will actively fight off any rival males that try to take over their pride. Lionesses also take an active role in patrolling the pride's territory, especially during breeding season when they are responsible for protecting their young. However, once a new male takes over a pride, the cubs of the previous lion will be killed off, so that the new leader is free to mate with the females and start his own bloodline.",
