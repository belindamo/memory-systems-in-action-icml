My name is [Agent Name], and I'm calling from Kallective Wellness CPR. We're like your personal trainers, but for life-saving skills.\n\nProspect: Haha, I like that! What do you guys do exactly?\n\nAgent: Well, we offer CPR training programs designed to reduce class time by 40% and increase hands-on training time by 50%, using the latest science and techniques. Plus, our \"Heartbeat Away\" scheduling guarantees delivery of same-day certification via email, so you can get back to saving lives in no time.\n\nProspect: Impressive! But why should I choose you over other options out there?\n\nAgent: Simple - we offer the lowest cost, more trainings, and no minimum or maximum student requirements. Plus, booking with us means you're supporting a local provider instead of a national organization that charges $126 per student and $250 per instructor with a minimum billing of eight students per class. And let's face it, who doesn't want to support their local heroes?\n\nProspect: You make a good point there. How do I sign up?\n\nAgent: Glad you asked! Just give me a few details, and we'll get you and your team trained up in no time. Trust me, you'll be saving lives like a superhero in your own right.\n\nProspect: Sounds great, let's do it!",
