The longevity of a meme depends on a variety of factors, including the appeal and relevance of the meme, the effectiveness of its presentation or execution, and the cultural context in which it is encountered.\n\nExtension: The proposition could be extended to consider the relationship between the longevity of a meme and its success, taking into account the various factors that can influence the persistence of a meme over time. This extension could provide a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of a meme.\n\nProposition 13: The success of a meme is positively correlated with the number of different contexts in which it is used.\n\nRevision: The success of a meme is not necessarily correlated with the number of different contexts in which it is used. The versatility and adaptability of a meme can be important factors in its success, but these qualities are not always sufficient to guarantee success. Other factors, such as the appeal and relevance of the meme, the effectiveness of its presentation or execution, and the cultural context in which it is encountered, can also play a significant role in determining the success of a meme.\n\nExtension: The proposition could be extended to consider the relationship between the number of different contexts in which a meme is used and its success, taking into account the various other factors that can influence success. This extension could provide a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of a meme.",
