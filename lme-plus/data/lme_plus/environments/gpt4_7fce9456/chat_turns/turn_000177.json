  "content": "Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) status needs to be renewed because it is not a permanent status. It allows an individual to live and work in the UK without any time restrictions, but it can be lost if the holder spends too much time outside of the UK or commits a serious criminal offense.\n\nIf ILR is not renewed, it can be lost, and the individual may have to leave the UK. Additionally, if an individual who has lost their ILR status applies for British citizenship, the application may be refused, and they may have to leave the UK. Therefore, it is important for individuals to renew their ILR status and meet the residency requirements to maintain their status in the UK.",
