  "content": "I'm in the process of buying a new home and I need some help with organizing all the paperwork. I've been house hunting for a while, and it's been a wild ride. I actually fell in love with a 2-bedroom condo on February 15th, it had amazing modern appliances and a community pool, but unfortunately, my offer got rejected on the 17th due to a higher bid. Anyway, can you help me create a checklist for all the documents I need to finalize the deal on my new home?",
