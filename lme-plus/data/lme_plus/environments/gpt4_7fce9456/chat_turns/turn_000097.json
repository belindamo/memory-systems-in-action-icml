James Webb Space Telescope: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), scheduled to launch in 2021, is a highly anticipated mission that will study the early universe, star formation, and the atmospheres of exoplanets. With its powerful infrared capabilities, it will be able to see much further back in time than any previous telescope and observe some of the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang.\n\n2. Mars Missions: Several missions to Mars are planned for the coming years, including NASA's Mars 2020 Rover, which will search for signs of past microbial life on the planet, and the ExoMars mission, a joint project between the European Space Agency and Roscosmos that will search for signs of current or past life on Mars.\n\n3. Dark Energy Survey: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an ongoing project that is mapping the distribution of dark matter in the universe and studying the accelerating expansion of the universe caused by dark energy. The DES is expected to produce some groundbreaking results in the coming years and provide new insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy.\n\n4. Breakthrough Starshot: This ambitious project aims to send a fleet of tiny spacecraft to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, using powerful lasers. The spacecraft, equipped with cameras and communication equipment, would be able to study the planets and other objects in the star system up close and transmit their data back to Earth.\n\nThese upcoming discoveries and missions in space show that there is always something new and exciting to learn about the universe, and scientific exploration and curiosity continue to drive us forward.",
