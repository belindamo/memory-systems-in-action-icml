Wireless charging is a standardized technology that follows the Qi (pronounced \"chee\") protocol, which is widely adopted by most phone manufacturers and accessory makers.\n\nWhat's important is to ensure that your phone supports wireless charging in the first place. If your phone does, then you can look for a case that is specifically designed to work with wireless charging.\n\nHere are some tips to find a compatible case:\n\n1. Check your phone's specifications: Make sure your phone supports wireless charging. You can check your phone's manual or manufacturer's website to confirm.\n2. Look for \"wireless charging compatible\" or \"Qi-compatible\" cases: When shopping for a case, look for keywords like \"wireless charging compatible\" or \"Qi-compatible\" in the product description or features list.\n3. Check the case material: Some cases with metal or thick materials may interfere with wireless charging. Opt for cases made from materials like silicone, TPU, or thin polycarbonate that won't block the wireless signal.\n4. Check reviews and ratings: Read reviews from other customers who have used the case with wireless charging to ensure it works seamlessly.\n\nYou can find wireless charging compatible cases from various online retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, or directly from phone case manufacturers like OtterBox, Speck, or Case-Mate.\n\nRemember, as long as your phone supports wireless charging and you choose a case that's designed to work with it, you should be good to go!",
