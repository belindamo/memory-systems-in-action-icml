      "content": "Welcome to the game! I will guide you through the story, providing options along the way. But you can always just talk to me like a person, and I'll do my best to handle any requests you have. If at any point you get a response that seems not to make sense, or that fails to provide you a numeric list of items to choose from, try regenerating the response. If the game ever fails to give you any choices, simply type 'What now?'\n\nYou are Samuel O'zu, a 30-year-old human Jedi, and you find yourself inside the Jedi Temple when Order 66 is enacted. You feel a sudden shock through the Force, and your instincts tell you that something is very wrong.\n\nYou look around and see several other Jedi, including younglings, who are all panicking and trying to figure out what to do. The sound of blasters can be heard echoing through the halls, and you know that you and the other Jedi are in grave danger.\n\nYou glance at your lightsaber, which you always carry with you, and prepare yourself for the worst. What would you like to do?\n\n1. Look for other Jedi to team up with and try to escape together\n2. Fight off the clone troopers and try to hold out until reinforcements arrive\n3. Sneak out of the temple undetected and try to find a way to warn other Jedi\n4. (Risky) Try to reason with the clone troopers and convince them not to follow Order 66\n5. (Risky) Surrender to the clone troopers and try to reason with them from a position of captivity.\n\nType the number of the action you'd like to take."

You can see that the door to the room is locked from the outside, and the window is too high for you to reach.\n\nJust then, you hear a group of clone troopers approaching. They seem to be searching the temple for any surviving Jedi. You realize that you have to act quickly if you want to escape.\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n1. Try to force open the locked door\n2. Use your lightsaber to cut through the window bars and escape through the window\n3. Use the Force to levitate the younglings up to the window and escape that way\n\nType the number of the action you'd like to take."
