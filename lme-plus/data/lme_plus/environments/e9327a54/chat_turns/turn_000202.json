For example:\n\n* What's your favorite type of cuisine? (e.g. eggs, pancakes, sandwiches, international flavors)\n* Do you have a specific budget in mind?\n* Are you looking for a casual, low-key spot or something more upscale?\n* Do you have a preferred location or neighborhood in mind?\n* How many people will be in your group?\n* Are there any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g. gluten-free, vegan, etc.) that need to be considered?\n\nAny additional details you can provide will help me give you more tailored brunch recommendations!",
