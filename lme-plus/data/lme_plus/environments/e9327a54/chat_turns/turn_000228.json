  "content": "The Hishi Pattern is a classic and timeless choice.\n\nFor a handkerchief, you'll want a lightweight, breathable fabric that's soft against the skin. Here are some fabric recommendations:\n\n1. **Cotton lawn**: A high-quality cotton lawn is an excellent choice for a handkerchief. It's lightweight, smooth, and has a soft drape.\n2. **Linen**: Linen is another great option for a handkerchief. It's natural, breathable, and has a lovely texture.\n3. **Voile**: Voile is a lightweight, semi-sheer fabric that's perfect for a handkerchief. It's soft, drapey, and has a beautiful texture.\n\nAvoid using thick or heavy fabrics, as they might be uncomfortable against the skin.\n\nNow, let's talk about finishing the edges of your handkerchief. You have a few options:\n\n1. **Hemming**: Fold the edges of the fabric over twice to create a narrow hem, and then sew in place using a straight stitch or a zigzag stitch. This is a simple and classic finish.\n2. **Rolled hem**: Roll the edges of the fabric over once, and then sew in place using a straight stitch or a zigzag stitch. This creates a more rustic, handmade look.\n3. **Binding**: Cut a strip of fabric, fold it in half lengthwise, and sew it to the edges of the handkerchief. This creates a decorative finish and adds a pop of color.\n\nTips for finishing the edges:\n\n* Use a 1/4 inch seam allowance to prevent the edges from fraying.\n* Press your seams as you go to help the fabric lie flat.\n* Use a walking foot or a Teflon foot on your sewing machine to help guide the fabric and prevent bunching.\n* Consider using a contrasting thread color to create a decorative stitch along the edges.\n\nFor a sashiko handkerchief, you might want to keep the edges simple and understated, so a hemmed or rolled hem finish would be a good choice.\n\nI hope that helps!
