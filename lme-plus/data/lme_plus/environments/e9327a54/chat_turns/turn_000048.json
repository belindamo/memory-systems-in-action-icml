Push back up to the starting position.\n2. **Lunges**: Stand with your feet together, take a large step forward with one foot, and lower your body down until your back knee almost touches the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Alternate legs.\n3. **Push-ups**: Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart, then lower your body down until your chest almost touches the ground. Push back up to the starting position.\n4. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat.\n5. **Glute bridges**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lift your hips up towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top. Lower back down and repeat.\n6. **Calf raises**: Stand on the edge of a stair or step with your heels hanging off the edge. Raise up onto your tiptoes, then lower back down.\n7. **Leg raises**: Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat.\n\n**Suggested Routine:**\n\n1. **Warm-up**: 5-10 minutes of light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks, etc.)\n2. **Monday (Lower Body):**\n\t* Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps\n\t* Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (per leg)\n\t* Calf raises: 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n3. **Wednesday (Core):**\n\t* Plank: 3 sets of 30-60 seconds\n\t* Glute bridges: 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n4. **Friday (Upper Body):**\n\t* Push-ups: 3 sets of 10-12 reps\n\t* Leg raises: 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n5. **Cool-down**: 5-10 minutes of stretching\n\n**Frequency and Progression:**\n\n1.

Increase the number of reps or sets as you get stronger.\n4. Gradually increase the difficulty of the exercises by adding more challenging variations (e.g., single-leg squats, decline push-ups, etc.).\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Focus on proper form and technique over the number of reps or sets.\n2. Start with lower reps and sets and gradually increase as you build strength and endurance.\n3. Listen to your body and rest when needed.\n4. Incorporate strength training into your routine consistently for at least 6-8 weeks to see noticeable improvements in your running.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your running training and adjust your strength training routine accordingly. If you're feeling fatigued or experiencing muscle soreness, reduce the frequency or intensity of your strength training sessions.",
