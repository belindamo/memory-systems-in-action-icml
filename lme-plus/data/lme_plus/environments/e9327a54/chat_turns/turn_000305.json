  "content": "Certainly! The probability density function (PDF) of the exponential distribution is given by the equation:\n\nf(x) = \u03bb \\* e^(-\u03bbx)\n\nWhere x is the time between events and lambda (\u03bb) is the rate at which events occur.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that plots the PDF of the exponential distribution for different values of lambda:\n```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom math import exp\n\n# Set the values of lambda to plot\nlambdas = [1, 2, 5]\n\n# Set the range of x values to plot\nx_range = np.linspace(0, 4, 100)\n\n# Plot the PDF for each value of lambda\nfor l in lambdas:\n    y = [l * exp(-l * x) for x in x_range]\n    plt.plot(x_range, y, label=f\"lambda = {l}\")\n\n# Add a legend and show the plot\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\nThis will produce a plot with three lines, each representing the PDF of the exponential distribution for a different value of lambda. The shape of the PDF will change as the value of lambda changes, with the distribution becoming more peaked and decreasing in height as lambda increases.",
