  "content": "Thanks for the tips! I'll definitely give them a try. I've been wanting to make homemade naan for a while now, and I'm excited to finally give it a shot. It'll be a great addition to my meal prep routine.\n\nSpeaking of meal prep, I've been doing pretty well with cooking at home most nights of the week. I've managed to cook dinner at home at least 4-5 times a week, sometimes even lunch if I have leftovers. And, as I mentioned earlier, I've been making Chicken Fajitas every Wednesday for the past two weeks, which has been a great way to mix things up.",
