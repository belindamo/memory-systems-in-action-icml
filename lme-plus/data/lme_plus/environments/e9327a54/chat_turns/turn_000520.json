Here's another one that includes a Sussex student, a Falmouth student, and an Oxford student:\n\nA Sussex student, a Falmouth student, and an Oxford student walk into a bar. The Sussex student orders a pint of beer, the Falmouth student orders a fancy cocktail, and the Oxford student orders a cup of tea. The bartender looks at them and says, \"Wow, you three are quite the eclectic bunch. What brings you together?\" The Sussex student replies, \"We're all just here to celebrate our love of learning.\" The Falmouth student adds, \"And to appreciate the diversity of our different disciplines.\" And the Oxford student finishes by saying, \"And to enjoy the simple pleasures of life.\"\n\nI hope this one is more to your liking and that it highlights the positive attributes of students from different universities coming together to celebrate their love of learning and diversity.",
