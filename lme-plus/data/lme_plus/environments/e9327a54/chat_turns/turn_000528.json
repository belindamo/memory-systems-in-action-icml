  "content": "Sure, here's another joke about the five playing Project Zomboid without a moral at the end:\n\nThe five students were playing Project Zomboid when suddenly a horde of zombies appeared on their screen. The Sussex student, who had been quietly focused on their own game, didn't notice the danger until the zombies were practically on top of them. The Falmouth student, who had been goofing around and not taking the game seriously, suddenly sprang into action and started mowing down zombies left and right. The Oxford student, who had been confidently leading the group, found themselves completely overwhelmed by the zombies and quickly became zombie food.\n\nMeanwhile, the security guard, who had been quietly observing the game from the sidelines, suddenly jumped in and started expertly navigating through the game, leading the remaining players to safety. The supermarket assistant, who had been frantically searching for supplies, finally found a cache of weapons and started firing them off with wild abandon, taking out even more zombies than the Falmouth student.\n\nIn the end, the five of them managed to survive the zombie onslaught, but not without a few close calls and a lot of laughs.",
