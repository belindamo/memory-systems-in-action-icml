Congratulations on meeting Finneas!\n\nRegarding Taylor Swift tickets, it's always a good idea to keep an eye on ticket prices, as they can fluctuate. However, it's generally a good idea to buy tickets as soon as possible for popular artists like Taylor Swift, especially for a large venue like SoFi Stadium.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **High demand**: Taylor Swift is a massive star, and her concerts often sell out quickly. The sooner you buy tickets, the better your chances of getting good seats.\n2. **Ticket prices tend to increase**: As the concert approaches, ticket prices might rise due to demand. If you wait too long, you might end up paying more than you would have if you bought them earlier.\n3. **Ticket availability**: As tickets sell out, the selection of available seats might become limited. Buying early gives you a better choice of seats and sections.\n4. **Secondary market prices**: If you wait too long and tickets sell out, you might have to resort to buying from secondary marketplaces like StubHub or Vivid Seats. These prices can be significantly higher than face value.\n5. **Ticketmaster's ticket limit**: Taylor Swift's tour often has a ticket limit per customer. If you wait too long, you might not be able to buy the number of tickets you need.\n\nThat being said, it's not uncommon for ticket prices to drop slightly in the days leading up to the concert, especially if the event isn't sold out. However, this is not a guarantee, and prices can also increase if the event is nearly sold out.\n\nIf you're concerned about prices, you can:\n\n* Set up price alerts on ticketing websites like Ticketmaster or SeatGeek to notify you if prices drop.\n* Consider buying tickets through a ticketing app like TicketIQ, which offers a price guarantee and can help you find better deals.\n* Look into purchasing tickets from authorized resellers, like the venue's box office or Taylor Swift's official website, which might offer more competitive pricing.\n\nUltimately, if you're excited about attending the concert and want to secure good seats, buying tickets now is a good idea.",
