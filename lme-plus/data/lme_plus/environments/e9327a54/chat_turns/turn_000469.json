  "content": "Yes, various types of filters can be used in garage ventilation systems depending on the specific needs and contaminants present in the garage. Here are some common types of filters used:\n\n1. HEPA filters: These are high-efficiency particulate air filters that can remove particles as small as 0.3 microns, including fine dust and airborne contaminants.\n\n2. Activated carbon filters: These filters are used to absorb and remove odors, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other gases.\n\n3. Electrostatic filters: These filters use an electrostatic charge to attract dust and other particles from the air.\n\n4. Pleated filters: These are made up of filter paper folded into pleats. They are effective in removing larger particles such as pollen and lint.\n\n5. Fiberglass filters: These filters are made of spun glass fibers and are used to remove larger particles such as dust and lint.\n\nThe type of filter or combination of filters used will depend on the specific requirements, airflow rates, and size of the garage.",
