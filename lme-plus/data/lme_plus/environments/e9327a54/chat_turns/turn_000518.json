  "content": "Sure, here's a joke that includes three students who attend the University of Sussex, Falmouth University, and Oxford University, a security guard, and a supermarket assistant:\n\nThree students from Sussex, Falmouth, and Oxford walked into a supermarket. The security guard stopped them and said, \"Hey, you can't come in here without a shopping cart!\" The Sussex student replied, \"But we're just here to buy some snacks for our study group!\" The Falmouth student chimed in, \"Yeah, we need something to keep our creative juices flowing.\" And the Oxford student added, \"I'm just here to buy some tea for my tutor.\" The supermarket assistant then looked at them and said, \"Well, I'm just happy you're not here to steal any of our ideas!\"\n\nI hope you found this joke amusing and that it highlights the diverse experiences and interests of individuals from different universities and professions.",
