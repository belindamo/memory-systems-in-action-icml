  "content": "The paper \"MoDL: Model Based Deep Learning Architecture for Inverse Problems\" compares the MoDL approach with traditional inverse problems solvers such as Tikhonov regularization, gradient descent, and deep learning-based approaches.\n\nCompared to traditional solvers, the MoDL approach provides several advantages:\n\n1. Improved accuracy: The MoDL approach was shown to provide improved accuracy compared to traditional inverse problems solvers, such as Tikhonov regularization, in several inverse problems, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and X-ray crystallography.\n2. Faster convergence: The MoDL approach was shown to converge faster than traditional inverse problems solvers, which can reduce the computational cost of the inverse problem.\n3. Robustness to model mismatches: The MoDL approach was shown to be robust to model mismatches, meaning that it can still provide accurate reconstruction results even when the physics-based model used in the inverse problem is not a perfect match to the true measurement process.\n\nCompared to deep learning-based approaches, the MoDL approach provides several additional advantages:\n\n1. Incorporation of physics-based models: The MoDL approach incorporates the physics-based model of the measurement process into the DNN architecture, which can improve the accuracy of the reconstruction results.\n2. Joint optimization of network and model parameters: The MoDL approach performs a joint optimization of the network parameters and the parameters of the physics-based model, which can reduce the computational cost of the inverse problem.\n3. End-to-end training: The MoDL approach is trained end-to-end, meaning that the network is trained on the measurement data directly, rather than pre-processed or transformed data. This allows the network to learn a mapping that is tailored to the specific measurement process.\n\nOverall, the MoDL approach provides improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to both traditional inverse problems solvers and deep learning-based approaches, and is a promising approach for solving inverse problems in a variety of fields.",
