And yeah, their menu does look pretty extensive, so we'll probably take our time deciding.\n\nAs for the new place I tried last week, I think what really stood out to me was the unique dishes they had. They had a lot of creative twists on classic brunch items, which was really refreshing. And the atmosphere was really trendy and modern, which was a nice change of pace from the usual breakfast joints. But what really impressed me was the service - our server was super friendly and attentive, and the food came out really quickly. Overall, it was just a really great experience!",
