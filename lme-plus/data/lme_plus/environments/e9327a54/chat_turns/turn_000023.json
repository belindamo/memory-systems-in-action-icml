What a great memory to share with your best friend Emily!\n\nI'm happy to have been able to help with some music recommendations. I think you'll enjoy exploring the artists I mentioned, and who knows, you might discover some new favorites! If you need more recs or have any other questions, feel free to ask anytime.\n\nBy the way, since you mentioned Finneas, I have to ask: Did you know that he's not only Billie's brother but also her collaborator and co-writer on many of her songs? He's a talented artist in his own right, and their sibling collaboration has been a key part of Billie's success.\n\nAnyway, I'll let you get back to enjoying your music and reliving those concert memories with Emily!",
