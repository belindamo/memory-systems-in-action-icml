  "content": "Certainly! The probability density function (PDF) of the Poisson distribution is given by the equation:\n\nf(x) = (e^-\u03bb \\* \u03bb^x) / x!\n\nWhere x is the number of events and lambda (\u03bb) is the average rate at which events occur.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that plots the PDF of the Poisson distribution for different values of lambda:\n```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom math import factorial, exp\n\n# Set the values of lambda to plot\nlambdas = [1, 2, 5]\n\n# Set the range of x values to plot\nx_range = range(0, 15)\n\n# Plot the PDF for each value of lambda\nfor l in lambdas:\n    y = [((exp(-l) * (l**x)) / factorial(x)) for x in x_range]\n    plt.plot(x_range, y, label=f\"lambda = {l}\")\n\n# Add a legend and show the plot\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\nThis will produce a plot with three lines, each representing the PDF of the Poisson distribution for a different value of lambda. The shape of the PDF will change as the value of lambda changes, with the distribution becoming more skewed and increasing in peak height as lambda increases.",
