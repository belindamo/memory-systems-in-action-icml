  "content": "Sure, here's a joke that includes the five characters you mentioned and the phrase \"Squid Game\":\n\nA Sussex student, a Falmouth student, and an Oxford student walk into a supermarket, followed by a security guard and a supermarket assistant. The security guard greets them and asks if they need any help finding anything. The Sussex student responds, \"Squid Game.\" The security guard looks puzzled and asks, \"Excuse me, what did you say?\" The Sussex student repeats, \"Squid Game.\" The Falmouth student then jumps in and says, \"Oh, I know what he means! It's this popular show on Netflix.\" The Oxford student adds, \"Yes, it's a game where players compete in a series of challenges to win a large sum of money.\" The supermarket assistant then chimes in, \"Well, we don't have any Squid Game challenges here, but we do have some great deals on snacks and drinks!\" Everyone laughs and goes about their shopping.\n\nI hope you found this joke amusing and that it shows how different people can have different interests and perspectives, and how we can still come together and enjoy each other's company.",
