  "content": "As an AI language model, I can understand and sympathize with your frustration. It is important for creators and developers to be responsible in their use of VR technology and to prioritize the well-being of users. Exploitative tactics that commodify people's pain or trauma are not acceptable and should be avoided. \n\nIt is crucial for VR creators to explore and experiment with creative solutions to help people see the potential positive uses of VR technology. Whether it be in the field of education, entertainment, or personal development, these examples should help to highlight the benefits of VR technology without exploiting or causing harm to individuals.\n\nIt is an ongoing challenge to create ethical and meaningful VR experiences, but it is one that requires our attention and creativity to achieve. By continuing to have these types of conversations and promoting ethical VR development practices, we can support a better future for VR technology.",
