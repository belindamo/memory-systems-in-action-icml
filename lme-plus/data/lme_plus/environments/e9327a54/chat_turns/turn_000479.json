  "content": "Quinoa is an excellent choice to pair with your lentil curry! The nutty flavor and slightly crunchy texture of quinoa complement the rich, spicy flavors of the curry perfectly. And adding roasted veggies on the side is a great way to add some contrast in texture and flavor to the dish.\n\nRoasted veggies can bring out the natural sweetness in vegetables, which pairs nicely with the savory flavors of the curry. What's your go-to veggie to roast alongside the curry? Are you a fan of classic choices like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, or carrots, or do you like to mix it up with sweet potatoes, cauliflower, or parsnips?\n\nAlso, have you tried adding any other toppings or garnishes to your lentil curry? Some options could be:\n\n* Fresh cilantro or scallions for a burst of freshness\n* Toasted nuts or seeds for added crunch\n* A dollop of yogurt or sour cream for a tangy contrast\n* A sprinkle of sumac or cilantro for extra flavor and color\n\nThese small additions can really elevate the dish and make it feel more satisfying and filling.",
