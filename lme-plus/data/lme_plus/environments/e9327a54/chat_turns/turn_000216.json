  "content": "The Nightingale is an amazing book, but it's great that you're looking for something new.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear you enjoyed The Hating Game and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo! Both are fantastic books.\n\nRegarding historical fiction audiobooks, the average length can vary greatly, but I can give you an idea of the length of the books I mentioned earlier:\n\n* The Red Tent: 14 hours 45 minutes\n* The Alice Network: 15 hours 30 minutes\n* The Historian: 24 hours 35 minutes (a bit longer than your preferred range, but it's an epic novel)\n* The Paris Wife: 12 hours 45 minutes\n* The Song of Achilles: 12 hours 30 minutes\n* All the Light We Cannot See: 16 hours 2 minutes\n* The Other Boleyn Girl: 17 hours 45 minutes\n* The Lost Queen: 14 hours 45 minutes\n* The Silent Companions: 12 hours 45 minutes\n\nConsidering your preference for 15-20 hour audiobooks, I'd recommend:\n\n* The Alice Network (15 hours 30 minutes)\n* All the Light We Cannot See (16 hours 2 minutes)\n* The Other Boleyn Girl (17 hours 45 minutes)\n\nThese three books are all highly acclaimed and engaging, with great narrators to bring the stories to life. If you're interested in exploring more options, I can definitely provide additional recommendations within your preferred length range.\n\nLet me know if you have any other specific preferences (e.g., time period, geographic setting, specific themes) that might help me suggest more targeted recommendations.",
