  "content": "Chicken Fajitas are always a delicious and satisfying option.\n\nFor sides, here are some ideas that would complement your Chicken Fajitas nicely:\n\n1. **Mexican Street Corn**: Grilled or boiled corn on the cob with mayonnaise, cotija cheese, chili powder, and lime juice.\n2. **Spanish Rice**: A classic pairing that's easy to make with rice, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices.\n3. **Roasted Vegetables**: Roasted bell peppers, zucchini, or carrots with a sprinkle of lime juice and cilantro would make a tasty and healthy side dish.\n4. **Refried Beans**: A traditional Mexican side that's easy to make with pinto beans, onions, garlic, and spices.\n5. **Grilled or Sauteed Greens**: Quickly cooked spinach, kale, or collard greens with garlic and lemon juice can provide a nutritious and flavorful contrast to the rich fajitas.\n6. **Warm Flour or Corn Tortillas**: Serve with extra tortillas on the side for wrapping up your fajitas, and consider offering sour cream, salsa, avocado, or shredded cheese as toppings.\n7. **Mexican Coleslaw**: A refreshing side made with shredded cabbage, lime juice, and a hint of cumin.\n\nI'm impressed by your efforts to reduce your grocery spending and minimize single-use plastics! Buying in bulk and using reusable containers and bags are great steps towards a more sustainable lifestyle. Keep up the good work!\n\nRemember, you can also get creative with leftovers to reduce food waste and save time during the week. Consider using leftover fajita ingredients to make a fajita salad or wraps for lunch the next day.",
