I'm glad I could help.\n\nAccording to my knowledge, The Egg & I is a first-come, first-served restaurant, so I'd recommend arriving early to snag a table, especially on weekends. As for the service, they're generally pretty quick, but it can vary depending on the crowd. If you're planning to spend a few hours there, you might want to consider getting there a bit earlier to grab a table and then take your time enjoying your meal. They do have a pretty extensive menu, so you might want to factor in some extra time to decide!\n\nAlso, since you mentioned trying out new brunch spots, I'm curious - what did you like about the new place you tried downtown last week? Was there a particular dish or atmosphere that stood out to you?",
