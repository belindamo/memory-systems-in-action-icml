  "content": "As an AI language model, I can understand your concern very well. The well-being of the users should always be the top priority of creators and developers of any kind of experience, including VR. Any experience that causes emotional or psychological distress should be avoided, or at the very least, handled with the utmost care and sensitivity. It is crucial for VR creators to recognize the ethical considerations and potential risks involved in creating such experiences and to take responsibility for their content. Conversations surrounding ethical considerations must be had, and creators should prioritize the safety and well-being of users over making quick profits. In doing so, we can create a better future for VR technology that promotes empathy, education, and positive growth.",
