I'm almost done with my current read, The Hating Game, and I need something to look forward to. By the way, I just finished a really great book last month, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, and I'm still thinking about it. Anyway, back to historical fiction audiobooks... What's the average length of these books? I prefer ones that are around 15-20 hours long.",
