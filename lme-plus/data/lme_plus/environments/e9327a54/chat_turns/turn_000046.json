Here are some exercises and tips to help you incorporate strength training into your routine:\n\n**Why Core and Glutes?**\n\n* A strong core provides stability and support for your entire body, helping you maintain good posture and reduce your risk of injury.\n* Strong glutes are essential for generating power and propulsion when you run, and can help you maintain good form and reduce your risk of hip and knee injuries.\n\n**Exercises for Core Strength:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise targets your abs, obliques, and lower back.\n2. **Russian twists**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Twist your torso to left and right, touching your hands to the ground each time. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each side.\n3. **Leg raises**: Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. **Side plank**: Lie on your side with your feet stacked and your hands under your shoulders. Lift your hips off the ground and hold for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat on the other side.\n5. **Bird dog**: Start on your hands and knees. Lift your right arm and left leg off the ground and hold for a few seconds. Lower back down and repeat on the other side. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each side.\n\n**Exercises for Glute Strength:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands by your sides. Lower your body down into a squat, keeping your back straight and your knees behind your toes. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n2. **Lunges**: Stand with your feet together and take a large step forward with one foot. Lower your body down into a lunge, keeping your front knee behind your toes and your back knee almost touching the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each leg.\n3. **Glute bridges**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lift your hips up towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top. Lower back down and repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. **Deadlifts**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a weight or dumbbell with both hands. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, lift the weight up to hip level and lower back down. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n5. **Step-ups**: Stand in front of a stair or step with your right foot on the step and your left foot on the ground. Step up onto the step with your left foot and step back down to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each leg.\n\n**Tips for Incorporating Strength Training into Your Routine:**\n\n1. **Start slow**: Begin with 1-2 strength training sessions per week and gradually increase the frequency and intensity as you build strength and endurance.\n2. **Focus on lower weights and higher reps**: As a runner, you're not looking to build massive muscle mass. Instead, focus on building endurance and strength with lower weights and higher reps (10-15 reps per set).\n3. **Incorporate exercises that target multiple muscle groups**: Exercises like squats and lunges target multiple muscle groups at once, which can help you",
