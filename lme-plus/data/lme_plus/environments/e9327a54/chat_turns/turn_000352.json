  "content": "The \"MoDL: Model Based Deep Learning Architecture for Inverse Problems\" paper discusses some of the trade-offs associated with the MoDL approach.\n\n1. Model complexity: The MoDL approach requires a physics-based model of the measurement process to be incorporated into the DNN architecture. The accuracy of the reconstruction results is dependent on the accuracy of this model, and a complex model may increase the computational cost of the inverse problem.\n2. Model mismatch: If the physics-based model used in the MoDL approach is not a perfect match to the true measurement process, the accuracy of the reconstruction results may be affected.\n3. Training data requirements: The MoDL approach requires a large amount of training data to be effective. This can be a challenge in certain fields, such as medical imaging, where the acquisition of training data may be limited.\n4. Hyperparameter tuning: The MoDL approach requires careful tuning of several hyperparameters, such as the network architecture and learning rate, to obtain optimal results. This can be a time-consuming process.\n\nOverall, the MoDL approach provides improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional inverse problems solvers and deep learning-based approaches, but also has some trade-offs, such as the requirement for a physics-based model, the need for a large amount of training data, and the need for careful hyperparameter tuning.",
