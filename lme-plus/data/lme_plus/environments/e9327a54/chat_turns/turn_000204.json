  "content": "Sounds like you're a brunch enthusiast! I'm glad to hear you're open to trying new things.\n\nI'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or physical locations, so I don't have a list of recommendations to add to. However, I'd love to hear more about the new place you tried downtown! What was the name of the restaurant, and what made it amazing? Was it the food, atmosphere, service, or something else?\n\nAlso, since you're looking for a spot that serves a mix of everything, I can suggest some popular brunch spots that offer a variety of dishes. Here are a few questions to help me narrow down some options:\n\n* Are you looking for a spot that serves breakfast items, lunch items, or a mix of both?\n* Do you prefer a buffet-style brunch or a menu with individual dishes?\n* Is outdoor seating or a trendy atmosphere important to your group?\n* Are there any specific days or times you're looking to go for brunch (e.g. weekends, weekdays, late morning, early afternoon)?\n\nLet me know, and I can try to suggest some brunch spots that might fit your group's preferences!",
