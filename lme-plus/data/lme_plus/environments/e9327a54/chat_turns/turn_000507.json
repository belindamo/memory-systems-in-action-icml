  "content": "Yes, changing typography can have a significant impact on how people perceive a brand. Here are a few examples of brands that changed their typography, which led to a positive or negative result:\n\n1. Airbnb - In 2014, Airbnb changed their typography after six years of using their old, quirky logo. The new typography featured a simple, sans-serif font. This change helped Airbnb create a more professional and serious look, which was necessary to appeal to a broader audience.\n\n2. Gap \u2013 In 2010, Gap tried to change their iconic logo by replacing the bold sans-serif font with a lighter and more modern design. The new typography faced widespread criticism, leading to the company retracting its new logo and returning to their original version.\n\n3. Burberry \u2013 Burberry changed their typography in 2018 as a part of their rebranding effort. The luxury brand changed from their old, classic serif font to a modern sans-serif font. This change helped Burberry create a more contemporary and global design for younger audiences.\n\nThese examples show that typography change can make or break a brand's identity. A well-planned and executed typography change can have a positive impact, while a rushed or poorly designed change can negatively affect the brand. Therefore, choosing typography should always be a thoughtful and strategic decision for a brand.",
