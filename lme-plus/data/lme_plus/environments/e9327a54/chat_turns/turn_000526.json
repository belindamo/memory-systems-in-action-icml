  "content": "Sure, here's a joke about the five playing Project Zomboid:\n\nThe five students decided to play Project Zomboid together. The Sussex student, being the newbie, accidentally shot the Falmouth student in the game, mistaking them for a zombie. The Oxford student, who had been leading the group until then, suddenly found themselves surrounded by zombies and started panicking, while the security guard calmly took charge and began instructing the others on how to survive. Meanwhile, the supermarket assistant found a hidden stash of supplies and shared them with the group, saving the day.\n\nIn the end, they all managed to make it to safety, but not without a few laughs and a newfound appreciation for the importance of teamwork.",
