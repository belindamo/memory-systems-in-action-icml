  "content": "Strawberry Shortcake is a classic dessert that's perfect for warm weather. Making sweet biscuits from scratch is a great idea, and I'd be happy to guide you through it. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Strawberry Shortcake Sweet Biscuits Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n* 3/4 cup heavy cream or buttermilk\n* 1 large egg, beaten\n* Confectioners' sugar, for dusting (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven:** Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.\n2. **Whisk dry ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n3. **Cut in butter:** Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.\n4. **Add cream and egg:** Pour in the heavy cream or buttermilk and mix until the dough starts to come together. Add the beaten egg and mix until the dough forms a shaggy mass.\n5. **Knead the dough:** Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently knead it a few times until it comes together into a cohesive mass.\n6. **Roll out the dough:** Roll the dough out to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thickness. Use a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass to cut out rounds. You should be able to get about 8-10 biscuits.\n7. **Bake the biscuits:** Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each biscuit. Brush the tops with a little extra heavy cream or buttermilk.\n8. **Bake:** Bake the biscuits for 18-20 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.\n9. **Assemble the shortcake:** Split the biscuits in half horizontally using a serrated knife. Spoon sliced strawberries and whipped cream over the bottom half, then top with the top half of the biscuit.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to keep your butter cold, as this will help create a flaky, tender biscuit.\n* Don't overmix the dough, as this can lead to tough biscuits.\n* If you don't have buttermilk, you can make a substitute by mixing 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using.\n* You can also add a sprinkle of confectioners' sugar on top of the biscuits before baking for an extra touch of sweetness.\n\nThat's it! Your sweet biscuits are ready to be devoured with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Enjoy your delicious Strawberry Shortcake!",
