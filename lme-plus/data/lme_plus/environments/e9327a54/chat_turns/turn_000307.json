  "content": "A FIFO (first-in, first-out) queue is a type of queue in which units of work are added at one end and removed from the other end, in the order in which they were added. This means that the first unit of work to enter the queue is also the first one to leave the queue, followed by the second unit of work, and so on.\n\nThe operation of a FIFO queue can be described as follows:\n\n1. Units of work arrive at the queue at a rate governed by an arrival process, such as a Poisson process.\n2. The units of work are added to the end of the queue as they arrive.\n3. The queue is serviced by one or more servers, who remove units of work from the front of the queue and process them.\n4. The rate at which the servers are able to process units of work is governed by a service process, such as a Poisson process.\n5. If the arrival rate is greater than the service rate, the queue will grow until it reaches its capacity, at which point units of work may be lost (also known as abandonment). If the arrival rate is less than the service rate, the queue will shrink until it reaches an equilibrium state.\n\nThe FIFO queue is a simple and intuitive model that is often used to analyze systems that have a single server and a relatively low arrival rate, such as a bank teller or a retail store. It is a special case of the more general M/M/1 queueing model, which is a fundamental model in queuing theory.",
