  "content": "I'm looking to sell some of my collectibles and I'm not sure where to start. I have a few rare items like a limited edition Tag Heuer Carrera watch, a vintage 1980s Sony Walkman Professional, and a first edition of The Avengers #1 comic book. By the way, I also have a first edition of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee, which I've heard could be worth upwards of $10,000 if it's in good condition. Do you have any advice on where to start with researching their values and finding potential buyers?",
