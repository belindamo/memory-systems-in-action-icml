Since you're casual and open to both buffet-style and individual dishes, I can suggest some popular spots that might fit the bill.\n\nHere are a few questions to help me narrow down some options:\n\n* Are you looking for a spot that's more laid-back and low-key, or something a bit more trendy and Instagram-worthy?\n* Would you prefer a spot that's within walking distance of other downtown attractions, or are you okay with a short drive or ride-share?\n* Are there any specific amenities you're looking for, such as a full bar, live music, or a pet-friendly patio?\n\nAlso, since you mentioned outdoor seating is a plus, I can suggest some spots with great patio areas. Keep in mind that availability and seating may vary depending on the weather and time of day.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, and I can give you some personalized brunch recommendations for downtown!",
