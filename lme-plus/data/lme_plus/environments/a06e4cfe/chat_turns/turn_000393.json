Allocating 30 minutes a day to your show can be a great way to take a breather and come back to your work refreshed.\n\nRemember to be flexible with your schedule, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. The goal is to make progress on your proposal and take care of yourself, not to stick to a rigid plan.\n\nTo help you stay on track, consider setting a reminder or scheduling your TV breaks in your calendar. This way, you'll ensure you're taking time for yourself and making progress on your show.\n\nHow's your mindset feeling now?
