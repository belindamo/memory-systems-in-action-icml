I hope you are doing well too. It is going to be very useful. I will be very much happy to be part of it, to explore and interact with like minds in CommCare. Earlier today, I tried to reach out to Kirti to discuss a topic raised by one of my CommCare student but unfortunately I got a reply that he no longer work with Dimagi. This will be a good forum for discussion and learning. \n\nThanks \nBest Regards.\nJa'afar Lawal\nGabriella Stoudemire \nNov 30, 2022, 7:19 PM\nto me\n\nHi Ja'afar,\nThanks so much for your note. We'd love your feedback or participation for the Community of Practice! Please also feel free to share it with your network.\nAnd yes, Kirti recently left. Please let me know if I can help answer any questions. \nIt would be great to touch base again in the New Year to keep discussing in-person training if you're still interested.\nBest,\nGabriella \n\nJa'afar Lawal \nDec 1, 2022, 11:15 PM\nto Gabriella\n\nHi Gabriella,\n\nThank you for the opportunity. I will be very glad to participate and also share my feedback with other members of the community of practice. Sounds interesting already. \n\nAnd for the in-person training, I am very much interested. I recently leveraged on an opportunity and trained some M&E staff ministry of health during the material and newborn child health week. Though the training was brief but the interest is high. Looking forward to discuss with you on that. \n \nThe question rised during one of my classes was that, whether it is possible to export barcodes and pictures in it's form not as a link?\n Thanks. \n\nBest regards\nJa'afar Lawal gtbank",
