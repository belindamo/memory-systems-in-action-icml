For example:\n\n* Not Started: Light Gray\n* In Progress: Yellow\n* Ready for Review: Light Green\n* In Review: Dark Green\n* Complete: Blue\n* Rejected: Red\n\nThis color scheme is intended to provide clear and easily recognizable visual cues for the different statuses. Additionally, the use of color contrast between the status and the background can help ensure that the status information is easy to see for all users, including those with color blindness.",
