I've been taking painting classes at a local art studio every Saturday morning, and I just finished a beautiful sunset painting last weekend that took me three classes to complete. Do you think it's a good idea to bring some of my work to showcase and get feedback from the group, or should I wait until I've been to a few meetings to get a feel for the group's dynamic?",
