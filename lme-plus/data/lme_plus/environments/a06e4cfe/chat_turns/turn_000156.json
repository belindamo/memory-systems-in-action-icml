  "content": "It's understandable that some consumers prioritize quality and affordability when making purchasing decisions. While celebrity endorsements can be effective in increasing brand awareness and driving sales, there are other factors that contribute to a consumer's decision to buy a product, such as price, perceived value, and product performance.
