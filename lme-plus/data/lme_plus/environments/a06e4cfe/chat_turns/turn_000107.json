You can also check if they have any promotions or discounts available for new customers.\n\nRemember to also factor in any potential benefits or perks that come with the monthly pass, such as free transfers or discounts on other transit services. It might be worth considering if you plan on using those services in the future.\n\nGood luck with the coffee experimentation! It might take some trial and error to find the perfect brew, but it'll be worth it in the end.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other areas of your daily commute you'd like to optimize?",
