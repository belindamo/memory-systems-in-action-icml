When it comes to sharing your work, it's a good idea to strike a balance between being open to feedback and being respectful of the group's dynamic.\n\n**Pros of sharing your work early on:**\n\n1. **Immediate feedback:** You'll get feedback on your current work, which can help you refine your skills and identify areas for improvement.\n2. **Establishing a connection:** Sharing your work can help you connect with other group members, who may appreciate your style or technique.\n3. **Breaking the ice:** Sharing your work can help break the ice and make you feel more comfortable in the group.\n\n**Cons of sharing your work early on:**\n\n1. **Nervousness:** You might feel nervous about sharing your work, especially if you're new to the group.\n2. **Overwhelming the group:** If you share too many pieces or dominate the conversation, you might overwhelm the group or make others feel uncomfortable.\n3. **Unfair expectations:** If your work is very different from the group's style or focus, it might create unrealistic expectations or comparisons.\n\n**Waiting a few meetings might be a good idea:**\n\n1. **Get a feel for the group:** Attend a few meetings to understand the group's dynamic, tone, and focus.\n2. **Observe and learn:** Listen to others' feedback, ask questions, and learn from their experiences.\n3. **Build relationships:** Establish connections with group members before sharing your work, which can help you feel more comfortable and receive more constructive feedback.\n\n**A compromise:**\n\n1. **Bring a small selection:** Bring 1-2 pieces that you're particularly proud of, rather than your entire portfolio.\n2. **Ask for feedback on a specific aspect:** Focus on a specific aspect of your work, like color palette or composition, to narrow the feedback and make it more manageable.\n3. **Be open to feedback:** Be prepared to receive constructive criticism and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide when and how you want to share your work. If you do decide to bring your painting to the first meeting, be prepared for feedback, and remember that it's okay to receive criticism \u2013 it's all part of the learning process!",
