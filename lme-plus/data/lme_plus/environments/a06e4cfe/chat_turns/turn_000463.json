If you're still experiencing issues, trying out some of the other suggestions might help.\n\nRegarding transferring your old phone case to your friend's place, I'm happy to help with that as well! However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to physically transfer objects. But I can offer some suggestions on how you can get the phone case to your friend:\n\n1. **Mail it**: You can package the phone case securely and mail it to your friend via postal services like USPS, UPS, or FedEx.\n2. **Hand-deliver**: If you live close to your friend, you could consider hand-delivering the phone case to them.\n3. **Use a delivery service**: If you're short on time or can't meet up with your friend, you could use a delivery service like UberRUSH, TaskRabbit, or a local courier service to transport the phone case.\n4. **Ask a mutual friend**: If you have a mutual friend who's planning to visit your friend, you could ask them to drop off the phone case on their way.\n\nRemember to properly package the phone case to prevent damage during transport, and consider getting a tracking number to ensure it reaches your friend safely.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns about phone battery life or anything else, feel free to ask!",
