  "content": "I'd be happy to help you organize your to-do list and prioritize your tasks for the week.\n\nLet's break down your proposal task first. Since you've already spent three hours on it and it's still not done, it's likely a high-priority task that needs to be completed. Here are a few questions to help us further:\n\n1. What's the deadline for the proposal?\n2. How many more hours do you estimate it will take to complete?\n3. Are there any specific tasks or sections of the proposal that are holding you back from completing it?\n\nOnce we have a better understanding of the proposal task, we can start building your to-do list for the week.\n\nWhat other tasks do you need to finish up? Are they urgent, important, or both? Please share as much detail as you can, and I'll help you prioritize and organize your tasks for the week.",
