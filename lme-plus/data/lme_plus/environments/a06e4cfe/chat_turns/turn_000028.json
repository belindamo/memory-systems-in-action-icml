It takes time and practice to develop the muscle memory and confidence to clip in and out smoothly. But with consistent practice, you'll get there!\n\nNow, about the new bike path near the state park... I'm just an AI, I don't have real-time information about specific local projects, but I can suggest some ways for you to find out more about it.\n\nYou could try:\n\n1. Checking the state park's website or social media pages for updates on the bike path project.\n2. Contacting the local cycling advocacy group or bike shop to see if they have any information about the project.\n3. Reaching out to the local government or parks department to ask about the status of the project.\n4. Searching online for news articles or cycling forums that might have discussions about the new bike path.\n\nIf the bike path is indeed being built, it sounds like it could be an amazing resource for cyclists in your area! A 12-mile trail perfect for road bikes like your Trek Emonda SL 6 would be a fantastic addition to the local cycling infrastructure.\n\nKeep me posted if you find out more about the project, and I hope you get to enjoy the new bike path soon!",
