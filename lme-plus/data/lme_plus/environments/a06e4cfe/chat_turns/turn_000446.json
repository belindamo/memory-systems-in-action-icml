If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\n118 In my opinion, however, the Master erred in the approach he adopted.\n119 The integrity of the entire levee system is a matter of great importance to the town of Brewarrina. A whole levee bank might be breached by water penetration around a culvert and a levee might fail at any location where fill is sufficiently loose or cracks are sufficiently deep. Professor Fell, an expert witness for the Council, testified that only one layer of poorly compacted soil might give a path for seepage and initiation of erosion. This is common sense.\n120 In the light of the potential vulnerability of the area above and around culverts and the importance of the impermeable quality of the system as a whole, the relevance of the contractual requirements for testing at the culverts is self-evident. The purpose of these testing requirements was to give an appropriate degree of satisfaction to the Council as to the quality of the work done and the integrity of the system.\n121 I accept the submission made by Beckhaus that the failure to carry out some of the tests does not necessarily mean that the works, when complete, do not substantially comply with the contractual standard. But, once it is established that there has been a failure to comply with the testing requirements, the evidentiary onus passes to Beckhaus to provide \u2013 by other evidence \u2013 the same degree of assurance as to the integrity of the system as would have been forthcoming had satisfactory test results been obtained in accordance with the frequency of testing under the Contract. Whether that assurance is to be derived from tests carried out subsequently, or from some other source, would be a matter for Beckhaus to establish.\n122 Furthermore, due regard has to be paid to two other matters. Firstly, the failure by Beckhaus to comply with the obligation to add 3% lime to all material. This must give rise to at least a prima facie doubt that the levees had the qualities that the addition of lime to that extent would achieve.\n123 Secondly, the circumstances under which the compaction tests (known as the \u201cCETS\u201d tests) were performed while Beckhaus was carrying out work under the Contract cast some doubt on the conclusions that otherwise would be drawn from the results of those tests. Some 340 CETS tests were carried out, in accordance with the Contract, in random places relating to the compaction levels on the levee system. All these tests passed, and Beckhaus submitted that these results, alone, provided a high degree of assurance that contractual standards had been met generally. After all, the Contract provided for the kind and quantity of compaction tests that would show, to the extent required by the Council, that the compaction work had been done properly, and these tests had been performed and satisfactory results had been achieved.\n124 But, some of those tests only passed after the persons testing had indicated to Beckhaus that, in their view, a test at the particular place was likely to fail; Beckhaus then added lime and reworked the area; the test was then carried out and passed successfully. Mr Rudge explained:\n\n\u201cThere was contested evidence before [the Master], which he accepted, that the CETS testers did not issue failing certificates. They were sufficiently experienced to tell, when they were on site, doing the in situ tests, that something was not properly compacted because of some deleterious material within the area, and that it would fail. They would then tell the foreman that that area was not going to pass, and the foreman would then arrange for it to be reworked, and then an adjacent or nearby area would be retested. If it looked as if it was going to pass, that sample was then taken back to the laboratory and, generally speaking, it did.\u201d\n125 This practice detracts from the degree of assurance that the successful CETS testing would otherwise have provided.\n126 These two matters emphasise the need for Beckhaus to rebut the inference that arises from its failure to provide satisfactory test results as required by cl 3.8 and cl 8.9.3 of the specification.\n127 In my opinion, the mere fact that compaction was actually performed at culverts (a fact relied on by the Master) and that the compaction was carried out apparently in accordance with appropriate techniques (which, arguably, is a further matter relied on by the Master) do not provide the degree of assurance that would have been forthcoming had satisfactory tests been carried out at the frequency required by the Contract.\n128 In my opinion, the Master erred in finding that the evidence demonstrated that there had been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts.\n129 In my view, the Council is entitled to damages flowing from the breach of contract arising from the failure to carry out the tests required in relation to compaction at the culverts. Those damages are the costs of rectifying the work at the culverts. This would involve removing the fill over and in the vicinity of the culverts sufficiently to enable the work to be done in accordance with the contract. I propose that the assessment of such damages should be remitted to Macready AsJ.",
