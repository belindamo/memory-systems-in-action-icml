  "content": "On the Tasks (Admin, Tagger, Checker View) screen, the following features can be used for task management:\n\n* Collaboration: The Tagger and Checker users can communicate and collaborate with each other through a messaging system within the Annotation Tool. This can be useful for discussing questions or issues that arise while annotating or reviewing the documents.\n* Version Control: The Annotation Tool should track the changes made to the documents as they are annotated and reviewed, and should allow users to view previous versions or revert to a previous version if necessary. This can be useful for auditing purposes and for ensuring that the data is accurate and consistent.\n* Quality Assurance: The Annotation Tool should include quality assurance checks and metrics to ensure that the annotations are accurate and consistent. For example, the tool could track the accuracy rate of the annotations and provide feedback to the Tagger user on areas that need improvement. The tool could also include a peer review feature, where the annotations of one Tagger user are reviewed by another Tagger user, to provide an additional level of quality control.",
