This will give you a general idea of the weather patterns and trends.\n2. **5 days out**: Check the forecast again 5 days before the event. The accuracy of the forecast increases as the event gets closer, and you'll get a better sense of the high and low temperatures, precipitation chances, and wind conditions.\n3. **3 days out**: Check the forecast again 3 days before the event. This is usually when the forecast becomes more reliable, and you can start making more informed decisions about your event setup.\n4. **1-2 days out**: Check the forecast daily, and make any final adjustments to your plan.\n\n**Weather Forecast Resources:**\n\n1. **National Weather Service (NWS)**: The NWS provides accurate and reliable weather forecasts, warnings, and conditions. You can check their website or mobile app for detailed forecasts.\n2. **Weather Apps**: Use weather apps like Dark Sky, Weather Underground, or The Weather Channel to get hyperlocal forecasts, which can be more accurate than general forecasts.\n3. **Local News**: Check local news websites, TV channels, or radio stations for weather updates and forecasts specific to your area.\n\n**Tent and Equipment Rental:**\n\n1. **Rent a tent with sides**: If you're renting a tent, consider getting one with sides or walls to provide additional protection from wind and rain.\n2. **Weighted tents or anchors**: Make sure the tent is securely anchored to the ground with weights or anchors to prevent it from being blown away.\n3. **Lighting and heating**: Rent lighting and heating equipment that can be used both indoors and outdoors, so you're prepared for any scenario.\n\nBy keeping an eye on the weather forecast and having a backup plan, you'll be well-prepared to handle any weather situation and ensure your 30th birthday celebration is a success!",
