I'll definitely check out \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"The Green Mile\" since they seem to have similar settings and themes to \"Shawshank Redemption\". By the way, I've been meaning to ask, are there any good film-related podcasts you'd recommend? I've been listening to \"The Ringer's The Watch\" and \"The Film Bros\" lately.",
