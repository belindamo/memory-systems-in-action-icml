  "content": "On the Tasks (Admin, Tagger, Checker View) screen, the following features can be used for task management:\n\n* Editing: The Admin user can edit the name, description, and other details of a task by clicking on a button or link in the task list. This will open an edit form where the Admin can make changes and save them.\n* Reallocating: The Admin user can reassign a task to a different Tagger user by clicking on a button or link in the task list. This will open a form where the Admin can select the new Tagger user and confirm the reassignment.\n* Reassigning: The Tagger user can request that a specific document within a task be reassigned to a different Tagger user by clicking on a button or link in the annotation screen. This will open a form where the Tagger can select the new Tagger user and explain the reason for the reassignment. The request will be reviewed by the Admin, who will have the option to approve or deny it.\n* Changing Status: The Tagger user can mark a document as \"Finished\" once they have completed the annotation, by clicking on a button or link in the annotation screen. This will update the status of the document to \"Review\" and notify the Checker that it is ready for review. The Checker can then approve or reject the annotation, or request that the Tagger make changes. If the annotation is approved, the status of the document will be updated to \"Complete\". The status of the task will also be updated to \"Complete\" once all the documents within the task have been marked as \"Complete\".",
