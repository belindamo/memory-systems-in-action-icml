I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding the launch of the Research Community of Practice on the CommCare Forum.\n\nI am still very excited about the opportunity to participate in the community and I am looking forward to engaging with like-minded individuals and sharing ideas. I am also glad to hear that the community will include topics such as \"Trusty Tips\" and the Researcher Spotlight Series.\n\nI also wanted to bring up the question I had regarding exporting barcodes and pictures in their original form. If possible, it would be great if you could provide me with more information on this topic or direct me to a resource where I can find more information.\n\nAdditionally, I am still very interested in discussing in-person training opportunities. Let me know when would be a good time for us to schedule a call or meeting to discuss further.\n\nThank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\nJa'afar Lawal\n\nNote: you might want to make any additional modifications that suits your need.",
