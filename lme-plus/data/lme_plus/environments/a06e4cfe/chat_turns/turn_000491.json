Organizing your watercolor supplies will definitely help you get the most out of your new paints and paper. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n**Organizing Your Watercolor Paints:**\n\n1. **Palette Organization:** Invest in a good quality watercolor palette with separate wells for each color. You can choose from plastic, porcelain, or wooden palettes. Consider a palette with a lid to prevent paint from drying out.\n2. **Color Arrangement:** Organize your paints by color family (e.g., primaries, secondaries, earth tones, etc.) or by the color wheel. This will help you find the right colors quickly and create harmonious palettes.\n3. **Labeling:** Use a permanent marker to label each well with the color name and pigment number (if applicable). This will help you identify the colors and keep track of your inventory.\n4. **Paint Storage:** Store your paints in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. You can also store them in airtight containers or bags to prevent moisture from affecting the paints.\n\n**Organizing Your Watercolor Paper:**\n\n1. **Paper Storage:** Store your watercolor paper in a flat, dry place, away from direct sunlight. You can use a paper storage box or a file organizer with separate compartments for different paper sizes.\n2. **Paper Organization:** Organize your paper by size, weight, and type (e.g., hot press, cold press, rough). This will help you quickly find the right paper for your project.\n3. **Paper Labels:** Label each paper pad or sheet with its size, weight, and type. You can use stickers or write the information directly on the paper.\n4. **Paper Protection:** Store your paper between sheets of cardboard or paper interleaves to prevent damage and bending.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Brush Storage:** Store your watercolor brushes in a protective case or roll to prevent damage and keep them organized.\n2. **Water Container:** Designate a specific container for water, and keep it clean and filled. You can use a plastic cup, a porcelain palette with a built-in well, or a water bottle with a built-in palette.\n3. **Palette Knife Storage:** Store your palette knife in a safe place, like a dedicated slot in your palette or a separate container, to prevent accidents and damage.\n4. **Cleaning Station:** Designate a cleaning station with soap, water, and a cloth to clean your brushes and palette.\n5. **Reference Materials:** Keep reference materials like color charts, tutorials, and inspiration images nearby to help you stay organized and inspired.\n\n**Cotman-Specific Tips:**\n\n1. **Cotman Paint Box:** If you have a Cotman paint box, make sure to store it upright to prevent the paints from mixing.\n2. **Cotman Color Chart:** Create a color chart for your Cotman paints to reference the colors and their pigment numbers.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to organizing your watercolor supplies and creating a workflow that suits your style. Happy painting!",
