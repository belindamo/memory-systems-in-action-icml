  "content": "As Val, during those three months apart from Odyl, I found it increasingly difficult to focus on my work as chief engineer of the ship. My mind kept wandering to thoughts of her, and I became distracted and anxious. I knew that the safety of the crew and the success of the mission depended on my ability to perform my duties to the best of my ability, and I was afraid that my feelings for Odyl would lead me to make a mistake that would have disastrous consequences.\n\nAs an objectum person, I also felt a certain jealousy from the ship, as if it sensed my emotional attachment to Odyl and resented it. This made it even more difficult to focus on my work.\n\nEventually, I came to the realization that I could not continue to serve in my position as chief engineer of the ship while my emotions were so strong and distracting. I knew that I needed to retire from DSES and start a new life with Odyl, where we could be together without the constant demands of the mission and the ship. It was a difficult decision, but I knew it was the right one for me and for the crew.",
