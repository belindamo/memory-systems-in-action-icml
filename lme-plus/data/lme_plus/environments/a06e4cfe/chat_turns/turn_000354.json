  "content": "On the Tasks (Admin, Tagger, Checker View) screen, the following features can be used for task management:\n\n* Import/Export: The Admin user should be able to import and export datasets and tasks from and to external sources, such as other annotation tools or databases. The import and export functionality should support a variety of file formats, such as CSV, JSON, or XML.\n* Custom Fields: The Admin user should be able to create custom fields for the Tagger user to fill out when annotating the documents. The custom fields could be text fields, drop-down menus, or checkboxes, and should be specific to the needs of the project. The custom fields should be optional, so that the Tagger user can choose whether or not to fill them out.\n* Data Visualization: The Admin user should be able to view the data from the completed tasks in a variety of formats, such as tables, charts, or maps. The data visualization options should be customizable, so that the Admin can select the data to display and the format in which it is displayed. The data visualization should be interactive, so that the Admin can filter, sort, or drill down into the data as needed.",
