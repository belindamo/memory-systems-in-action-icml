  "content": "As Val, the months that she and Odyl were separated were difficult for her. She found it hard to be away from him after they had spent such a passionate and intimate night together. However, Val is someone who values her independence and feels the need to be self-sufficient, so she didn't want to appear overly needy or clingy by constantly writing to him.\n\nAdditionally, Val has a tendency to overthink things and worry about the future, so she was scared that if she wrote too much to Odyl or expressed too much emotion, it might scare him off or make him think she was too attached. She also didn't want to get her hopes up too much in case things didn't work out between them.\n\nUltimately, Val missed Odyl terribly during their separation, but she tried to stay focused on her work and keep herself busy so that she wouldn't dwell on her feelings too much.",
