However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't discuss your project with you during lunch on Tuesday. I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me.\n\nLet's start fresh and explore your project together! Please share your ideas, goals, and any relevant context about your project. I'll help you organize your thoughts, generate new ideas, and prioritize tasks to get you started.\n\nWhat's the project about, and what are your objectives?",
