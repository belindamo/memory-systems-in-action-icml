There are many excellent options available, and I'd be happy to help you find a good match for your Trek Emonda SL 6. Since you mentioned morning commutes, I'll assume you're looking for lights that provide good visibility and safety during early morning or low-light conditions.\n\nHere are a few factors to consider when choosing bike lights:\n\n1. Lumen output: Look for lights with a high lumen output (measured in lumens) for better visibility.\n2. Beam pattern: A focused beam pattern helps to direct light where you need it, while a wider beam provides more peripheral visibility.\n3. Mounting options: Make sure the lights are compatible with your bike's handlebars, seatpost, or other attachment points.\n4. Battery life: Consider lights with long battery life or ones that are easily rechargeable via USB.\n5. Durability: Look for lights with weather-resistant designs and durable materials.\n\nBased on these factors, here are some recommendations that should be compatible with your Trek Emonda SL 6:\n\n1. **Cygolite Hotrod 50**: A compact, high-output light with a focused beam pattern (50 lumens) and a sleek design that attaches to your handlebars. (~ $40)\n2. **Lezyne Strip Drive Pro**: A versatile light with a wide beam pattern (300 lumens) and a compact design that can be mounted on your handlebars or seatpost. (~ $50)\n3. **NiteRider Mako 200**: A budget-friendly option with a decent lumen output (200 lumens) and a simple, tool-free mounting system. (~ $25)\n4. **Garmin Varia RTL515**: A premium option with a high lumen output (250 lumens) and a sleek design that integrates with Garmin devices. (~ $100)\n5. **Knog Plus**: A unique, compact light with a wide beam pattern (130 lumens) and a USB-rechargeable design. (~ $30)\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider your budget, the type of riding you'll be doing, and any specific features you need (e.g., USB rechargeability, adjustable beam pattern).\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect bike lights for your morning commutes!",
