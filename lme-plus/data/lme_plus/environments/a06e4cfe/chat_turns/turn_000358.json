  "content": "Functional Specification for Tasks (Admin, Tagger, Checker View) Screen:\n\nPurpose:\nThe Tasks screen allows users to manage and track the progress of tasks that have been created in the Annotation Tool. The screen is divided into three views: one for the Admin user, one for the Tagger user, and one for the Checker user. Each view has different features and functionality, depending on the role of the user.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n* The Admin user can create new tasks, edit existing tasks, and assign tasks to Tagger users.\n* The Tagger user can view and annotate the documents within their assigned tasks, and mark the documents as \"Finished\" when they have completed the annotation.\n* The Checker user can review the annotations made by the Tagger user, approve or reject the annotations, and request changes if necessary.\n\nFlows:\n\n* The Admin user can create a new task by clicking on the \"Create Task\" button and filling out the task form. The form includes fields for the task name, description, and Tagger user assignment. The Admin can also upload a dataset to be used as the basis for the task.\n* The Tagger user can view their assigned tasks by clicking on the \"Tasks\" tab and selecting the \"Tagger View\" tab. The Tagger user can then click on a task to view the documents within the task.\n* The Tagger user can annotate the documents by selecting labels from a list or by entering custom labels. The Tagger user can also use the label suggestion feature to receive recommendations for labels to apply.\n* The Tagger user can mark a document as \"Finished\" by clicking on the \"Finish\" button in the annotation screen. This will update the status of the document to \"Review\" and notify the Checker that it is ready for review.\n* The Checker user can view the documents in \"Review\" status by clicking on the \"Tasks\" tab and selecting the \"Checker View\" tab. The Checker user can then click on a document to view the annotations made by the Tagger user.\n* The Checker user can approve or reject the annotations by clicking on the \"Approve\" or \"Reject\" button in the annotation screen. If the annotations are rejected, the status of the document will be updated to \"Rejected\" and the Tagger user will be notified to make the necessary changes.\n\nActions:\n\n* Admin: Create task, edit task, assign task, upload dataset\n* Tagger: View tasks, annotate document, mark document as \"Finished\"\n* Checker: Review annotation, approve annotation, reject annotation, request changes\n\nUI Design:\n\n* The Tasks screen should have a clear and intuitive layout, with distinct sections for the different views.\n* The task list should be organized in a table format, with columns for the task name, assigned",
