  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions, but there are many architects today who continue to draw inspiration from the work of Raphael and other Renaissance architects. For example, Andrea Palladio, who lived in the 16th century and was heavily influenced by Raphael, is still an important figure in architectural history, and his work continues to inspire architects today. Additionally, there are contemporary architects who incorporate classical elements into their designs or employ mathematical principles in their work, both of which are direct legacies of Raphael's work on Saint Peter's Basilica. In some ways, the impact of Raphael's work on Renaissance architecture is ongoing, and his legacy continues to influence the field today.",
