I'm glad you finally got around to backing them up to Google Drive. It's always a great feeling to free up space on your phone, isn't it? Backing up your photos is so important, not just to free up space, but also to ensure you don't lose those precious memories in case something happens to your phone.\n\nGoogle Drive is a great choice for storing your photos, by the way. It's convenient, accessible, and you can even access your photos from multiple devices. Did you consider organizing your photos into folders or albums on Google Drive, or are you more of a \"dump everything into one folder\" kind of person?\n\nAlso, since you mentioned freeing up space on your phone, have you considered cleaning up your phone's storage in other ways, like deleting unused apps or clearing out your cache?",
