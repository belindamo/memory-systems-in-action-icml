  "content": "Including laundry as a weekly task is a great idea! Since you want to ensure that you do laundry every Sunday morning, it's better to add it as a specific task on that day rather than as a daily task. This way, you can dedicate a specific time slot for laundry and make sure it gets done consistently.\n\nHere's the revised schedule:\n\n**Daily Tasks:**\n\n1. Make your bed as soon as you get up\n2. Quick pick-up of toys, books, and clutter\n3. Wipe down bathroom sink and toilet after use\n4. Vacuum or sweep high-traffic areas\n5. Put away clean laundry as soon as it comes out of the dryer (this task can be removed or modified since you'll be doing laundry on Sundays)\n\n**Weekly Tasks:**\n\n1. Dust and tidy living room and dining room\n2. Mop kitchen and bathroom floors\n3. Clean bathrooms (sinks, toilets, showers, bathtubs)\n4. Clean the kitchen (counters, sink, stove, refrigerator)\n5. Vacuum or mop all floors\n6. Change bed sheets\n7. Take out the trash and recycling (on your designated day)\n8. Laundry (Sunday morning)\n\nBy adding laundry as a weekly task, you'll ensure that it gets done regularly and at a specific time. You can also remove or modify the daily task \"Put away clean laundry as soon as it comes out of the dryer\" since you'll be doing laundry on Sundays.\n\nHow does the revised schedule look to you?",
