Here are some popular and highly-regarded vermouth brands that pair well with a variety of gins:\n\n1. **Dolin**: A French vermouth with a light, crisp flavor profile that won't overpower the gin. Dolin is a great choice for those who prefer a drier martini.\n2. **Noilly Prat**: Another French vermouth with a slightly sweeter and more complex flavor profile than Dolin. Noilly Prat is a good match for gins with bold, juniper-forward flavors.\n3. **Carpano Antica**: An Italian vermouth with a rich, herbal flavor profile that pairs well with gins that have a more delicate flavor profile. Carpano Antica is a good choice for those who prefer a slightly sweeter martini.\n4. **Cocchi**: An Italian vermouth with a bold, bitter flavor profile that pairs well with gins that have a strong juniper flavor. Cocchi is a good choice for those who prefer a more bitter martini.\n5. **Maurin**: A French vermouth with a light, floral flavor profile that pairs well with gins that have a more delicate flavor profile. Maurin is a good choice for those who prefer a lighter, more elegant martini.\n6. **Vermouth Routin**: A French vermouth with a rich, herbal flavor profile that pairs well with gins that have a more complex flavor profile.
