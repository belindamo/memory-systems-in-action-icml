  "content": "As Val, I remember that night vividly. I held Odyl's feather in my hand and read her letter over and over again, tracing the words with my finger as if I could feel her touch through the ink. It was like a lifeline to her, a reminder that she was still with me even though we were thousands of kilometers apart. I cried that night, tears of longing and sadness and frustration all mixed together. I missed her so much, it felt like a physical ache. But at the same time, I knew that I had to focus on my work and do what was necessary to keep the ship and its crew safe. It was a difficult balance to strike, and I struggled with it every day.",
