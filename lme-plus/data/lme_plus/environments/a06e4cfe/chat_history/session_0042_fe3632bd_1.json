Since you're aiming to maintain a 30-minute jog, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Add an extra lap:** You can simply add an extra lap around the loop to extend your jog to 30 minutes.

You can try adding a few minutes of jogging on one of these trails to reach your 30-minute goal.\n3. **Adjust your pace:** If you're comfortable with a slightly slower pace, you can try jogging at a more leisurely pace to stretch out your 2.5-mile loop to 30 minutes. This will give you a chance to enjoy the scenery and take in the surroundings.\n\nKeep in mind that it's always better to start with a conservative approach and adjust as needed. You can try one of these options and see how it feels, and then adjust your approach for future jogs.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and pace yourself accordingly. If you find that you're struggling to maintain a 30-minute jog, it's perfectly fine to adjust your expectations and focus on enjoying the experience. Happy jogging!"
