      "content": "I don't have the most current or specific information, but generally speaking, bosnia and herzegovina is a reasonably easy country to travel around, with a well-developed bus network and reasonably priced taxis. the country is relatively small, making it possible to visit several locations in a short period. however, some of the more remote areas may require a bit more effort to get to, and you may need to hire a car to explore the more off-the-beaten-path destinations. english is widely spoken, particularly in the main tourist areas, which should make communication simpler. if you're planning to visit the more remote areas, it may be useful to learn some basic bosnian phrases."
