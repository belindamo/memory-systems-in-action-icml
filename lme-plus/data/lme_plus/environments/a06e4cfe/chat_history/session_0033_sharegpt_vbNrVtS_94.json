This will open an edit form where the Admin can make changes and save them.\n* Reallocating: The Admin user can reassign a task to a different Tagger user by clicking on a button or link in the task list. This will open a form where the Admin can select the new Tagger user and confirm the reassignment.\n* Reassigning: The Tagger user can request that a specific document within a task be reassigned to a different Tagger user by clicking on a button or link in the annotation screen. This will open a form where the Tagger can select the new Tagger user and explain the reason for the reassignment. The request will be reviewed by the Admin, who will have the option to approve or deny it.\n* Changing Status: The Tagger user can mark a document as \"Finished\" once they have completed the annotation, by clicking on a button or link in the annotation screen. This will update the status of the document to \"Review\" and notify the Checker that it is ready for review. The Checker can then approve or reject the annotation, or request that the Tagger make changes. If the annotation is approved, the status of the document will be updated to \"Complete\". The status of the task will also be updated to \"Complete\" once all the documents within the task have been marked as \"Complete\"."

The progress bar should be updated in real-time as documents are annotated and reviewed.\n* Document Outline: The Tagger user can view an outline of the document being annotated, which shows the structure and hierarchy of the content. The outline should be interactive, so that the Tagger can click on a section to navigate to it in the main content area. This can be particularly useful for long documents with many pages.\n* Label Suggestions: The Tagger user can use the label suggestion feature to receive recommendations for labels to apply to the document. The suggestions should be based on the context and content of the document, and should be relevant and accurate. The Tagger should have the option to accept or reject the suggestions, and should also have the ability to customize the settings for the label suggestion feature."

This can be useful for discussing questions or issues that arise while annotating or reviewing the documents.\n* Version Control: The Annotation Tool should track the changes made to the documents as they are annotated and reviewed, and should allow users to view previous versions or revert to a previous version if necessary. This can be useful for auditing purposes and for ensuring that the data is accurate and consistent.\n* Quality Assurance: The Annotation Tool should include quality assurance checks and metrics to ensure that the annotations are accurate and consistent. For example, the tool could track the accuracy rate of the annotations and provide feedback to the Tagger user on areas that need improvement. The tool could also include a peer review feature, where the annotations of one Tagger user are reviewed by another Tagger user, to provide an additional level of quality control."

The Tagger user should be able to view a list of the available labels and select the appropriate one when annotating the document.\n* Label Definitions: The Tagger user should be able to view the definitions or descriptions of the labels, so that they can understand the meaning and context of each label. The definitions should be clear and concise, and should provide examples of how the label should be applied.\n* Label Hierarchy: The Tagger user should be able to view the hierarchy or relationships between the labels, so that they can understand how the labels fit into the overall structure of the data. The label hierarchy should be visually represented, such as in a tree or graph structure, and should be easy to understand and navigate."

The custom fields could be text fields, drop-down menus, or checkboxes, and should be specific to the needs of the project. The custom fields should be optional, so that the Tagger user can choose whether or not to fill them out.\n* Data Visualization: The Admin user should be able to view the data from the completed tasks in a variety of formats, such as tables, charts, or maps. The data visualization options should be customizable, so that the Admin can select the data to display and the format in which it is displayed.

      "content": "Functional Specification for Tasks (Admin, Tagger, Checker View) Screen:\n\nPurpose:\nThe Tasks screen allows users to manage and track the progress of tasks that have been created in the Annotation Tool. The screen is divided into three views: one for the Admin user, one for the Tagger user, and one for the Checker user. Each view has different features and functionality, depending on the role of the user.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n* The Admin user can create new tasks, edit existing tasks, and assign tasks to Tagger users.\n* The Tagger user can view and annotate the documents within their assigned tasks, and mark the documents as \"Finished\" when they have completed the annotation.\n* The Checker user can review the annotations made by the Tagger user, approve or reject the annotations, and request changes if necessary.\n\nFlows:\n\n* The Admin user can create a new task by clicking on the \"Create Task\" button and filling out the task form. The form includes fields for the task name, description, and Tagger user assignment. The Admin can also upload a dataset to be used as the basis for the task.\n* The Tagger user can view their assigned tasks by clicking on the \"Tasks\" tab and selecting the \"Tagger View\" tab. The Tagger user can then click on a task to view the documents within the task.\n* The Tagger user can annotate the documents by selecting labels from a list or by entering custom labels. The Tagger user can also use the label suggestion feature to receive recommendations for labels to apply.\n* The Tagger user can mark a document as \"Finished\" by clicking on the \"Finish\" button in the annotation screen. This will update the status of the document to \"Review\" and notify the Checker that it is ready for review.\n* The Checker user can view the documents in \"Review\" status by clicking on the \"Tasks\" tab and selecting the \"Checker View\" tab. The Checker user can then click on a document to view the annotations made by the Tagger user.\n* The Checker user can approve or reject the annotations by clicking on the \"Approve\" or \"Reject\" button in the annotation screen. If the annotations are rejected, the status of the document will be updated to \"Rejected\" and the Tagger user will be notified to make the necessary changes.\n\nActions:\n\n* Admin: Create task, edit task, assign task, upload dataset\n* Tagger: View tasks, annotate document, mark document as \"Finished\"\n* Checker: Review annotation, approve annotation, reject annotation, request changes\n\nUI Design:\n\n* The Tasks screen should have a clear and intuitive layout, with distinct sections for the different views.\n* The task list should be organized in a table format, with columns for the task name, assigned"
