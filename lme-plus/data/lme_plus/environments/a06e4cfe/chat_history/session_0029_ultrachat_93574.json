Encourage resilience: Explain to your child that setbacks and obstacles are common in any fundraising activity, and that they can learn from them to do better next time.\n\n3.

Celebrate when they sign up for the fundraising event, or when they complete the event.\n\n4. Set realistic goals: Ensure that the fundraising goal is realistic for your child. Talk with your child about what they can expect and what kind of effort they need to put in to reach the goal.\n\n5. Be positive: Be positive and supportive, even if your child doesn't reach their goal.
