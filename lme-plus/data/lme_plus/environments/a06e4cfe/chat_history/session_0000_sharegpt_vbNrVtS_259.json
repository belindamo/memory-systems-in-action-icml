For example:\n\n* Not Started: Light Gray\n* In Progress: Yellow\n* Ready for Review: Light Green\n* In Review: Dark Green\n* Complete: Blue\n* Rejected: Red\n\nThis color scheme is intended to provide clear and easily recognizable visual cues for the different statuses. Additionally, the use of color contrast between the status and the background can help ensure that the status information is easy to see for all users, including those with color blindness."

To provide an overview of the task's details, such as tagger, checker, assigned date, due date, and description.\n3. To allow the user to manage the task by changing the status of the documents as they progress through the annotation process.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1. A list of all the documents assigned to the specific task.\n2. Information about the tagger, checker, assigned date, due date, and description for each document.\n3. The ability to change the status of a document, such as from \"Not started\" to \"In progress\", \"Ready for review\", \"In review\", \"Complete\", and \"Rejected\".\n4. The ability to view the annotations made by the tagger and the checker.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n1. An administrator assigns a task to a tagger and a checker. The tagger and checker then use the specific task screen to manage the task and annotate the documents.\n2. The tagger marks each document as \"In progress\" as they work on it.\n3. The checker marks each document as \"Ready for review\" when they believe it has been fully annotated by the tagger.\n4. The administrator reviews the annotations and marks each document as \"In review\" when they believe it is ready for further review by the checker.\n5. The checker reviews the annotations and marks each document as \"Complete\" or \"Rejected\".\n6. The administrator uses the specific task screen to view the status of each document and make changes as needed.\n\nFlows and Actions:\n\n1. The administrator assigns a task to a tagger and a checker.\n2. The tagger opens the specific task screen and begins annotating the documents.\n3. As the tagger works, they mark each document as \"In progress\".\n4. The checker opens the specific task screen and marks each document as \"Ready for review\".\n5. The administrator opens the specific task screen and marks each document as \"In review\".\n6. The checker reviews the annotations and marks each document as \"Complete\" or \"Rejected\".\n7. The administrator uses the specific task screen to view the status of each document and make changes as needed.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\n1. The list of documents in the specific task screen is accurate and up-to-date.\n2. The information about the tagger, checker, assigned date, due date, and description is correct.\n3. The ability to change the status of a document is functional and the new status is reflected in the list of documents.\n4. The annotations made by the tagger and checker are visible in the specific task screen.\n5. The specific task screen is accessible from the main menu and is easy to use."

      "content": "Functional Specification: Specific Task Management and Annotation Tool\n\nGoals:\n\n1. To provide a user-friendly and efficient interface for task management and document annotation.\n2. To enable administrators to create, manage and monitor tasks and their progress.\n3. To enable taggers to annotate and tag documents efficiently and accurately.\n4. To enable checkers to review and verify the annotations made by taggers.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1. Task Management: The task management screen provides a comprehensive view of all tasks assigned to the system. The administrator can create a new task, edit existing tasks, and assign tasks to taggers and checkers.\n2. Document List: The document list displays all the documents assigned to a specific task. The list includes information such as the document name, assigned tagger, assigned checker, due date, and description.\n3. Progress Bar: A progress bar provides a visual representation of the progress made on each task. The bar displays the percentage of documents that have been tagged and verified.\n4. Status Change: Administrators can change the status of a task from \"Not Started\" to \"In Progress\" once the task has been assigned to a tagger. Tagging will then begin, and the status will change to \"Ready for Review\" once the tagging is completed. The checker can then review the annotations and change the status to \"In Review.\" If the annotations are verified, the status will change to \"Complete.\" If the annotations require further revisions, the status will change to \"Rejected.\"\n5. Task Description: The task description provides a brief overview of the task and its requirements.\n6. Annotation Tool: The annotation tool enables taggers to efficiently annotate and tag documents. The tool includes features such as text highlighting, entity recognition, and relationship extraction.\n7. Review and Verification: The checker can review the annotations made by the tagger and verify the accuracy of the annotations. The checker can also reject annotations that are incorrect or need further revisions.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n1. Admin wants to view the progress of the task:\na. Admin logs in to the system.\nb. Admin navigates to the task management screen.\nc. Admin selects the specific task they want to view.\nd. The task management screen displays the progress bar, document list, and task description.\ne. Admin can view the progress of the task and see how many documents have been tagged and verified.\n2. Admin wants to assign a task to a tagger:\na. Admin logs in to the system.\nb. Admin navigates to the task management screen.\nc. Admin selects the specific task they want to assign.\nd. Admin clicks on the \"Assign Task\" button.\ne. The system displays a list of available taggers.\nf. Admin selects the tagger they want to assign the task to.\ng. The task status changes from \"Not Started\" to \"In Progress.\"\n3. Tagger wants to annotate a document:\na. Tagger logs in to the system.\nb. Tagger navigates to the specific task they have been assigned.\nc. Tagger selects the document they want to annotate.\nd. The annotation tool opens and displays the document.\ne. Tagger annotates the document by highlighting text, selecting entities, and creating relationships.\nf. Tagger saves the annotations and closes the tool.\ng. The document status changes from \"Not Started\" to \"Ready for Review.\"\n4. Checker wants to verify the annotations:\na. Checker logs in to the system.\nb."
