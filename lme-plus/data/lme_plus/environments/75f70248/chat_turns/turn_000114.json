I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't retain any information from previous conversations.\n\nIf you need to check the rescheduled team meeting date, I recommend checking your calendar, email, or messaging app for the original reschedule notification or reaching out to your team lead or colleague for confirmation.",
