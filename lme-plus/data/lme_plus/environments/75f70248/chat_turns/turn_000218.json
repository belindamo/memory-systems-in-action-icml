It's a fascinating and emotional read that explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and survival.\n3. **The Lost Girls of Paris** by Pam Jenoff: This book is set in 1946 and follows a young widow who discovers a suitcase of photographs of women who worked for a resistance network during the war. It's a gripping and emotional story about courage, sacrifice, and the power of women.\n4. **The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society** by Mary Ann Shaffer: This epistolary novel is set on the island of Guernsey after WWII and tells the story of a writer who forms a connection with the islanders who survived the occupation.
