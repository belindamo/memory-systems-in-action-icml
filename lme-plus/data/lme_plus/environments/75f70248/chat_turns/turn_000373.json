  "content": "I'm planning to research the conference schedule and speaker lineup to identify sessions and talks that align with my interests in deep learning and natural language processing. I'd also like to review the list of attendees and reach out to a few people in advance to set up meetings or coffee breaks. Additionally, I want to prepare an elevator pitch about my thesis and research experience, so I can confidently introduce myself and my work to others.\n\nI'm particularly interested in exploring the applications of AI and machine learning in healthcare and education. I've heard that there are some exciting developments in these areas, and I'd love to learn more about the latest research and innovations.",
