For example, use \"YYYY - Location\" or \"Location - YYYY\" for travel folders.\n3. **Avoid special characters and spaces:** Try to avoid using special characters (e.g., !, @, #) and spaces in folder and collection names, as they can cause issues when syncing or exporting.\n4. **Keep it concise:** Keep folder and collection names concise, but not too short. Aim for 2-5 words that accurately describe the contents.\n5. **Use collections for themes:** Use collections to group photos by themes, such as \"Landscapes\", \"Cityscapes\", \"Portraits\", etc.\n6. **Use smart collections for dynamic filtering:** Use smart collections to dynamically filter your photos based on criteria like keywords, camera settings, or ratings.\n\n**Tips for organizing travel photos:**\n\n1. **Organize by location:** Organize your travel photos by location, such as country, city, or region.\n2. **Use a consistent keyword structure:** Use a consistent keyword structure for your travel photos, such as \"Travel > Europe > France > Paris\".\n3. **Add context with captions and metadata:** Add context to your photos by including captions, descriptions, and metadata like camera settings, GPS coordinates, and timestamps.\n4. **Create a \"Favorites\" collection:** Create a \"Favorites\" collection to store your best travel photos, making it easy to access and share them.\n\nBy following these best practices, you'll be able to create a well-organized folder structure and collections that make it easy to find and enjoy your travel photos.",
