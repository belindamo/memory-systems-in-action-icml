And do you have a specific brand or product that you use for him?\n\nOnce I have that information, I can set a reminder for you to ensure you don't miss the application date.\n\nBy the way, I've already got the following reminders on my virtual sticky note for you:\n\n* Order Luna's grain-free wet food in blue packets in 4-5 days\n* Upcoming vet appointments (waiting for dates and times from you)\n* Luna's medication schedule (waiting for details from you)\n\nLet me know about Max's flea and tick prevention, and I'll add it to the list!",
