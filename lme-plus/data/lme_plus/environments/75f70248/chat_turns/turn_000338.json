It's a sweet way to create memories and indulge in the local flavors. Don't forget to also ask your parents to try some of the local drinks, like coffee, tea, or hot chocolate, to pair with their sweet treats.\n\nRemember to also explore local markets, bakeries, and cafes to discover more hidden gems and unique desserts. And don't be afraid to ask locals for recommendations or try something that looks unfamiliar. That's all part of the fun of traveling and exploring new cultures!\n\nI hope you and your parents have a wonderful time trying all the delicious desserts and pastries on your travels. Bon app\u00e9tit, and I'm sure you'll create many sweet memories together!",
