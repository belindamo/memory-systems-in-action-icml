  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot access the latest information on how Heer has incorporated the use of Artificial Intelligence in its product development and marketing strategies as it is not available in my database. However, based on my knowledge of how companies can use AI in their product development and marketing strategies, I can suggest a few potential ways in which Heer may have used AI:\n\n1. Personalization: Heer may have used AI to personalize its product recommendations and marketing campaigns. By analyzing customer data such as past purchases, browsing behavior, and social media activity, AI can identify patterns and preferences to create a personalized shopping and marketing experience.\n\n2. Image recognition: Heer may have used AI to leverage image recognition technology to identify trends and patterns in customer searches and purchases. This technology can help the company identify which products are popular and which are not, and then cater to customer preferences.\n\n3. Voice assistance: Heer may have incorporated voice-assisted AI technology in its products to allow customers to search for products or make purchases using voice commands. This feature can help customers to navigate the website with ease.\n\n4. Chatbots: AI chatbots can assist customers with their queries and provide them with personalized recommendations based on their preferences. This technology can help in enhancing the customer experience by providing them with 24/7 service and support. \n\nHowever, without the latest information on Heer's practices, it is not possible to confirm how they have used AI in their product development and marketing strategies.",
