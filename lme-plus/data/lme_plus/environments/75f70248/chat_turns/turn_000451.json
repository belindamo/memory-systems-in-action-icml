  "content": "In Suriname, Dutch is the main language of instruction in schools. Most schools also offer English as a second language, and some schools offer other languages such as French or Spanish.\n\nRegarding endangered languages, there are programs that focus on preserving and revitalizing them. The Suriname Language Institute (SLI) is an organization that works to document and preserve the country's endangered languages through research, teaching, and training linguists. Additionally, some villages with high concentrations of Maroon communities have their own language schools that teach Maroon languages to children.\n\nThere are also efforts to incorporate indigenous languages into the curriculum, with some schools offering classes in Arawak or Carib, two Amerindian languages spoken in Suriname. These efforts are aimed at enhancing students' cultural knowledge and promoting language preservation.\n\nOverall, while Dutch remains the main language of instruction, there are initiatives aimed at preserving and promoting the country's diverse linguistic and cultural heritage.",
