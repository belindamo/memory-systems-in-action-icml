That way, I can help you calculate when he's due for the next application.\n\nIf you don't remember the exact date, don't worry! Do you remember approximately when you applied it last? Was it this week, last week, or a few weeks ago?\n\nOnce I have an idea of when the last application was, I can help you determine when Max is due for his next dose.\n\nAnd, just to recap, I've got the following reminders for you:\n\n* Order Luna's grain-free wet food in blue packets in 4-5 days\n* Upcoming vet appointments (waiting for dates and times from you)\n* Luna's medication schedule (waiting for details from you)\n* Max's flea and tick prevention medication application (waiting for last application date)\n\nLet me know when you can provide me with the information, and I'll help you set a reminder for Max's next application!",
