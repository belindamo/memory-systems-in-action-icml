  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have the experience of having a massage. But I can tell you that hot stone massages should not be uncomfortable or painful. The stones used in a hot stone massage are typically heated to a comfortable temperature, usually within the range of 120-130 degrees Fahrenheit (49-54 degrees Celsius). The stones are then placed on different areas of your body, and a trained massage therapist will use them to massage your muscles.\n\nBefore the massage starts, your massage therapist should ask you if the stones are comfortable and if the temperature is okay. If the temperature is too hot for you at any point during the massage, you should let your therapist know immediately so that they can adjust the temperature or remove the stones altogether.\n\nOverall, a hot stone massage can be a deeply relaxing and therapeutic experience. However, it's always important to communicate any discomfort or preferences to your massage therapist during the session.",
