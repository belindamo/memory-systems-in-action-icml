  "content": "What a wonderful coincidence that you already have \"The Song of Achilles\"! It's a great choice, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it when you get to it.\n\n\"The Historian\" is an excellent choice for an epic listen. It's a long book, but the audiobook is well-narrated, and the story is engaging, so it should keep you company on your daily commute.\n\nRegarding book festivals and author events, I'm happy to help you with that! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific locations. But I can suggest a few ways for you to find out about upcoming events in your area:\n\n1. **Local bookstores**: Reach out to your local bookstores (indie or chain) and ask about upcoming author events or book festivals. They often host events or partner with local organizations to bring authors to the area.\n2. **Literary festivals**: Search online for literary festivals in your city or region. These events often feature multiple authors, panels, and workshops. You can check websites like [Literary Festivals](https://literaryfestivals.com/) or [BookFestivals.com](https://www.bookfestivals.com/) to find events near you.\n3. **Author websites and social media**: Follow your favorite authors on social media or sign up for their newsletters to stay informed about their upcoming events and tours.\n4. **Local libraries**: Your local libraries often host author events, book clubs, and other literary activities. Check their websites or visit in person to ask about upcoming events.\n5. **Bookish online communities**: Join online forums like Goodreads, Bookstagram, or Facebook groups dedicated to books and reading. These communities often share information about author events, book festivals, and other literary happenings.\n\nIt's wonderful that you got to meet Celeste Ng at a literary festival! Those events can be such a great way to connect with authors and fellow book lovers.\n\nKeep me updated on your progress with \"The Historian\" and \"All the Light We Cannot See,\" and feel free to ask for more recommendations or discuss books anytime!",
