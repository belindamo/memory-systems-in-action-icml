Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros of sharing your family connection:**\n\n1. **Builds rapport:** Sharing your personal story can help establish a connection with the dealer, making them more invested in helping you find the vase.\n2. **Dealers may prioritize you:** If the dealer knows the vase holds sentimental value, they might be more willing to work with you to find the perfect piece or offer a better price.\n3. **Valuable insight:** The dealer might have knowledge about the vase's history or provenance that could be valuable to you, and sharing your connection could encourage them to open up.\n\n**Cons of sharing your family connection:**\n\n1. **Price inflation:** If the dealer knows the vase holds significant sentimental value, they might inflate the price or be less willing to negotiate.\n2. **Limited bargaining power:** By sharing your emotional attachment, you might lose some bargaining power in negotiations.\n3. **Dealer's bias:** The dealer might focus more on the vase's emotional value rather than its actual worth, which could affect the price or their willingness to sell.\n\n**My advice:**\n\n1. **Keep your cards close:** Initially, keep your family connection to yourself and focus on the vase's characteristics, such as its style, period, and materials.\n2. **Show genuine interest:** Demonstrate your interest in the vase as a collector or enthusiast, and ask questions about its history, provenance, and condition.\n3. **Wait for the right moment:** If you build a rapport with the dealer and feel comfortable, you can share your family connection later in the conversation. This might help you establish a stronger connection and gain valuable insights.\n\nRemember, it's essential to stay calm, professional, and respectful during your interaction with the dealer. Good luck, and I hope you find the vase that matches your family's treasured piece!",
