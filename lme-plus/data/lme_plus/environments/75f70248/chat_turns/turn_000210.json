  "content": "That's a great idea! Creating a separate catalog or a new folder structure within your existing catalog both have their advantages. It ultimately depends on your workflow, preferences, and how you plan to manage your travel photos. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Creating a new catalog:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Separation of concerns:** Having a separate catalog for your travel photos allows you to focus specifically on those images, without cluttering your main catalog.\n2. **Easier backup and management:** You can manage and backup your travel catalog independently, which can be beneficial if you have a large number of photos.\n3. **Customized organization:** You can create a custom organization structure, keyword set, and metadata templates specifically tailored to your travel photos.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Multiple catalogs to manage:** You'll need to maintain and update multiple catalogs, which can be time-consuming.\n2. **Duplicate effort:** You might end up duplicating effort when it comes to keywording, rating, and editing similar photos across multiple catalogs.\n\n**Creating a new folder structure within your existing catalog:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Unified catalog:** Your entire photo collection remains in one place, making it easier to search, filter, and access your photos.\n2. **Less duplication of effort:** You can apply keywords, ratings, and edits to similar photos across your entire catalog, reducing duplication of effort.\n3. **Easier synchronization:** You only need to sync and backup one catalog, making it more convenient.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Cluttered catalog:** If you have a large number of travel photos, your main catalog might become cluttered, making it harder to find specific photos.\n2. **Less granular control:** You might not have as much control over the organization and structure of your travel photos within your main catalog.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n1. Do you plan to work on your travel photos extensively, requiring a dedicated catalog? If so, a new catalog might be the better choice.\n2. Are you comfortable with managing multiple catalogs, or do you prefer a unified catalog? If you prefer a unified catalog, creating a new folder structure within your existing catalog might be the way to go.\n3. How often do you plan to access and work on your travel photos? If it's infrequent, a new folder structure within your existing catalog might be sufficient.\n\nUltimately, you could also consider a hybrid approach:\n\n* Create a new folder structure within your existing catalog for your travel photos.\n* Use collections and smart collections to further organize and filter your travel photos.\n* Use keywords and metadata to differentiate your travel photos from your other photos.\n\nThis approach allows you to maintain a unified catalog while still providing a level of separation and organization for your travel photos.",
