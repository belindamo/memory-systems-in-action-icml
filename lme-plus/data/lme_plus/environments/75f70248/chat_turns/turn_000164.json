  "content": "That's a great starting point!\n\nSo, if you took Max to the vet for his vaccinations and check-up about a month ago, that means the flea and tick prevention medication was likely applied around the same time.\n\nLet's assume it's been approximately 30 days since the last application. To be on the safe side, I'll suggest setting a reminder for Max's next flea and tick prevention medication application in 7-10 days from now. This will give you a buffer in case the exact date is a few days earlier or later.\n\nI'll add this reminder to your list:\n\n* Order Luna's grain-free wet food in blue packets in 4-5 days\n* Upcoming vet appointments (waiting for dates and times from you)\n* Luna's medication schedule (waiting for details from you)\n* Max's flea and tick prevention medication application: due in 7-10 days\n\nFeel free to adjust this reminder if you're certain about the exact date of the last application or if you receive further instructions from your vet.\n\nHow does that sound?",
