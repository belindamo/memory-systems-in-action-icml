That's a great way to stay on top of fare changes.\n\nNow, about your question: whether to book the Lufthansa ticket at $850 return from NY to Frankfurt or wait for prices to drop.\n\nHere are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Price trend**: Have you noticed any recent price drops or increases on your desired route? If prices have been steadily increasing, it might be a good idea to book now. If they've been decreasing, you could wait a bit longer.\n2. **Flexibility**: How flexible are your travel dates? If you have specific dates in mind, it's generally better to book earlier to ensure availability. If you have flexibility, you can wait and see if prices drop.\n3. **Lufthansa's pricing**: Lufthansa is a full-service carrier, and their prices tend to be more stable than low-cost carriers like Norwegian Air. If you're comfortable with the $850 price point, it might be a good time to book.\n4. **Norwegian Air's prices**: How do Norwegian Air's prices compare to Lufthansa's? If they're significantly cheaper, you might want to consider waiting to see if Lufthansa's prices drop to match or beat Norwegian's.\n5. **Summer is peak season**: June to August is peak travel season in Europe, which means prices tend to be higher. If you're traveling during this time, it's unlikely that prices will drop significantly.\n6. **Booking window**: Generally, the optimal time to book a flight is 54 days in advance, according to Skyscanner's data. If you're within that window, it might be a good time to book.\n\nConsidering these factors, if you're comfortable with the $850 price point and don't expect prices to drop significantly, it might be a good time to book the Lufthansa ticket.\n\nRegarding the American Airlines email about the potential class-action lawsuit, that's an interesting side note! While it's not directly related to your travel plans, it's always good to stay informed about loyalty program changes and potential lawsuits that might affect your travel experiences.\n\nFeel free to provide more details about your travel plans, and I'll do my best to help you make an informed decision!",
