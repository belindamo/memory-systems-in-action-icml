It's a popular Korean dessert that's both delicious and visually stunning.\n\n**Sesame Honey Cake ()**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the cake:\n\n* 2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened\n* 4 large eggs\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 cup honey\n* 1/4 cup sesame oil\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nFor the sesame streusel:\n\n* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened\n* 1/4 cup sesame seeds\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Grease a 9-inch (23cm) round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n3. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey, sesame oil, and vanilla extract.\n4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.\n5. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top.\n6. To make the sesame streusel, mix the flour, sugar, and softened butter in a small bowl until crumbly. Stir in the sesame seeds.\n7. Sprinkle the sesame streusel evenly over the cake batter.\n8. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n9. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use high-quality sesame oil for the best flavor.\n* Toast the sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium heat until fragrant and lightly browned before using them in the streusel.\n* The cake will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months.\n\nNow, about your Korean-inspired dinner party menu...\n\nFor main courses, I recommend:\n\n1. **Bulgogi ()**: Thinly sliced marinated beef, typically served with rice and kimchi.\n2. **Jeyuk bokkeum ()**: Stir-fried pork with vegetables and gochujang (Korean chili paste).\n3. **Doenjang jjigae ()**: Fermented soybean paste stew with vegetables and meat or seafood.\n\nFor appetizers, consider:\n\n1. **Kimchi ()**: Spicy fermented Korean cabbage, served with a variety of seasonings.\n2. **Pajeon ()**: Korean-style pancake with scallions and sometimes meat or seafood.\n3. **Mandu ()**: Korean dumplings, steamed or fried, filled with meat, kimchi, or tofu.\n\nThese dishes will pair beautifully with the Sesame Honey Cake and other Korean desserts we've discussed. You can also consider serving Korean tea, such as omija (five-flavor tea) or yuja (citrus tea), to complement the meal.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear about your dinner party plans!",
