Click on the \"Repeat\" icon (looks like a calendar) in the task creation window.\n5. Choose the recurrence pattern:\n\t* Daily: Select the days of the week you want the task to recur (e.g., Monday to Friday).\n\t* Weekly: Select the day of the week and the frequency (e.g., every 2 weeks).\n\t* Monthly: Select the day of the month and the frequency (e.g., 1st and 15th of every month).\n6. Set the start date and time for the recurring task.\n7. Choose whether you want the task to repeat indefinitely or until a specific date.\n8. Click \"Add Task\" to create the recurring task.\n\nIn your case, you can set up a daily or weekly recurring task to review your tasks and adjust your priorities. For example:\n\n* Daily Task Review: Set a daily recurring task to review your tasks and priorities every morning at 9:00 am.\n* Weekly Task Review: Set a weekly recurring task to review your tasks and priorities every Monday at 10:00 am.\n\nWhen the recurring task is due, Todoist will automatically create a new instance of the task, so you can focus on reviewing and adjusting your priorities.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a consistent naming convention for your recurring tasks to make them easy to identify.\n* Set up recurring tasks for other regular activities, such as weekly meetings, report submissions, or habit tracking.\n* Use Todoist's filters and labels to quickly view and manage your recurring tasks.\n\nBy setting up recurring tasks in Todoist, you can maintain a consistent routine, stay organized, and make progress on your goals.",
