Soju spritzers and Makgeolli are excellent choices, but here are a few more Korean-inspired drinks that might complement the flavors of your dinner party:\n\n1. **Yuja-ginger spritzer**: A refreshing mix of yuja juice (Korean citrus), ginger ale, and a splash of Soju or vodka, garnished with a slice of yuja and a sprig of mint.\n2. **Ginger-makgeolli fizz**: A fizzy twist on traditional Makgeolli, flavored with ginger and a squeeze of lime juice, served over ice with a sprinkle of grated ginger.\n3. **Cass beer**: A crisp, light beer from Korea that pairs well with spicy dishes like kimchi or gochujang-based sauces.\n4. **Omija tea cocktail**: A soothing blend of omija tea, gin, and lemon juice, served over ice with a sprinkle of omija powder (dried magnolia berry).\n5. **Sesame-ginger martini**: A savory and sweet martini made with sesame-infused vodka, ginger liqueur, and a splash of lime juice, garnished with a sesame seed-crusted rim and a slice of ginger.\n6. **Korean mojito**: A twist on the classic mojito, featuring Korean mint (ssuk), Soju, lime juice, and a splash of ginger beer, served over ice with a sprig of mint.\n\nThese drinks will not only complement the flavors of your Korean-inspired dinner party but also add a unique and memorable touch to the evening. Enjoy!",
