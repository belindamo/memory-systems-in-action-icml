Here's how:\n\n**Creating a smart collection in Lightroom:**\n\n1. **Go to the Collections panel:** In the Library module, click on the Collections panel on the left-hand side.\n2. **Click the \"+\" icon:** Click the \"+\" icon at the top right of the Collections panel to create a new collection.\n3. **Choose \"Smart Collection\":** Select \"Smart Collection\" from the dropdown menu.\n4. **Set the rules:** In the \"Smart Collection\" dialog box, set the rules for your collection. In your case, you want to filter by lens used.\n5. **Add a rule:** Click the \"Add Rule\" button and select \"Lens\" from the dropdown menu.\n6. **Specify the lens:** Choose \"is\" and then select \"50mm\" from the lens list. If your lens isn't in the list, you can type it in manually.\n7. **Add more rules (optional):** You can add more rules to further refine your smart collection. For example, you could add a rule to include only photos taken during a specific date range or with a specific camera.\n8. **Name your collection:** Give your smart collection a name, such as \"50mm Beach Trip\".\n\n**How it works:**\n\nOnce you've set up the smart collection, Lightroom will automatically add photos that match the specified rules to the collection. In this case, any photo taken with the 50mm f/1.8 lens will be added to the collection. You can then use this collection to quickly access and work on your beach trip photos taken with that specific lens.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Use multiple rules:** You can add multiple rules to your smart collection to refine the selection. For example, you could add a rule to include only photos with a specific keyword or rating.\n* **Use \"is not\" rules:** You can use \"is not\" rules to exclude certain criteria. For example, you could exclude photos taken with a specific camera or lens.\n* **Create a nested smart collection:** You can create a nested smart collection by adding a rule that includes photos from another smart collection. This can help you create a hierarchical structure for your collections.\n\nBy using smart collections, you can automate the process of organizing your photos and make it easier to find and work on specific sets of images.",
