However, I have to inform you that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about a coffee shop called \"The Daily Grind\" or its rewards program. The Daily Grind is a common name for coffee shops, so it's possible that there are multiple locations with different rewards programs.\n\nIf you could provide more information about the specific The Daily Grind you're referring to, such as its location or website, I may be able to help you find the information you're looking for. Alternatively, you can try contacting the coffee shop directly or checking their website or social media pages to learn more about their rewards program.",
