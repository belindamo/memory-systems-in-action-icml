As a conversational AI, I don't have direct access to individual businesses' systems or customer data.\n\nIf you're trying to figure out how many points you need to get a free pastry, I would recommend checking your loyalty program card or app, or visiting the coffee shop's website or social media pages to see if they have a rewards chart or FAQ section that outlines the points system. You can also try asking a barista or manager at the coffee shop directly \u2013 they should be able to help you with your question!",
