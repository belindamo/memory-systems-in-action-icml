It's usually listed in miles per gallon (mpg) for city, highway, and combined driving.\n2. **The distance of your road trip**: How many miles do you plan to drive over the weekend?\n3. **Your driving habits**: Are you a lead-foot or a gentle driver? Do you drive mainly in city, highway, or a mix of both?\n\nAssuming your car's maintenance is up to date (which it is, since you just got an oil change, tire rotation, and new air filter!), we can estimate your fuel efficiency.\n\nAs a rough estimate, a well-maintained car can improve its fuel efficiency by 1-2 mpg after a tune-up, including an oil change, tire rotation, and air filter replacement. Let's assume your car's fuel efficiency will improve by 1.5 mpg.\n\nNow, let's do some math:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate your current fuel economy**\nCheck your car's fuel economy rating and note the combined mpg (city + highway).\n\n**Step 2: Adjust for maintenance boost**\nAdd 1.5 mpg to your combined fuel economy rating to account for the maintenance improvements.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate your road trip distance**\nEnter the total distance of your planned road trip in miles.\n\n**Step 4: Estimate gas consumption**\n Divide the road trip distance by your adjusted fuel economy rating (Step 2).\n\nHere's an example:\n\nLet's say your car's combined fuel economy is 25 mpg, and you're planning a 300-mile road trip.\n\n**Step 1: Current fuel economy** = 25 mpg\n**Step 2: Adjusted fuel economy** = 25 + 1.5 = 26.5 mpg\n**Step 3: Road trip distance** = 300 miles\n**Step 4: Gas consumption** = 300 miles \u00f7 26.5 mpg \u2248 11.3 gallons of gas\n\nSo, in this example, you'd need approximately 11.3 gallons of gas for your 300-mile road trip.\n\nRemember, this is just an estimate, and your actual gas consumption may vary depending on factors like traffic, road conditions, and your driving style.\n\nHow does this sound? Do you have your car's fuel economy rating and road trip distance handy?",
