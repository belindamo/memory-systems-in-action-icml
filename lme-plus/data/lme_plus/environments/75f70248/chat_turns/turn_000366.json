  "content": "That's a wonderful idea! Creating a subfolder for professors who wrote especially heartfelt messages is a great way to highlight their kind words and preserve those special sentiments.\n\nI'm sure Dr. Smith's email meant a lot to you, and it's lovely that you want to give it a special place in your email folder structure. You could name the subfolder something like \"Special Mentions\" or \"Heartfelt Congratulations\" to distinguish it from the general \"Academic\" folder.\n\nBy doing so, you'll be able to easily find and revisit those emails whenever you need a boost of confidence or a reminder of your accomplishments. It's also a great way to show appreciation for the professors who took the time to write such thoughtful messages.\n\nRemember to also consider printing out some of those special emails or saving them as PDFs, so you can include them in a physical keepsake or scrapbook, if you like. Having a physical copy of those emails can be a lovely way to treasure the memories and sentiments.\n\nHow's your email organization project going so far? Are you finding it therapeutic to revisit those congratulatory messages?",
