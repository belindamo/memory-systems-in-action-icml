  "content": "Congratulations on your graduation! Organizing your congratulatory emails is a great way to preserve the memories and sentiments. I'd be happy to help you create a folder structure to categorize your emails. Here's a suggested folder structure to get you started:\n\n**Main Folder: Congratulations on Graduation**\n\n* **Family**\n\t+ Immediate Family (e.g., parents, siblings)\n\t+ Extended Family (e.g., aunts, uncles, cousins)\n* **Friends**\n\t+ Close Friends\n\t+ College Friends\n\t+ High School Friends\n* **Academic**\n\t+ Professors/Mentors\n\t+ Classmates\n\t+ Academic Departments/Clubs/Organizations\n* **Professional Network**\n\t+ Colleagues (if you had a job during college)\n\t+ Industry Connections\n\t+ Professional Associations\n* **Social Media**\n\t+ Facebook Messages\n\t+ Twitter Replies\n\t+ Other Social Media Platforms\n* **Miscellaneous**\n\t+ Unrelated to specific relationships (e.g., generic congratulations from acquaintances)\n\t+ Emails from unknown senders (e.g., people you don't know personally)\n\nYou can further sub-categorize these folders as needed. For example, under \"Family,\" you could create subfolders for each sibling or parent. Under \"Friends,\" you could create subfolders for different social circles or friend groups.\n\nTips:\n\n* Create a consistent naming convention for your folders and subfolders to make them easy to navigate.\n* Consider using tags or labels instead of folders if your email provider supports it. This can help you categorize emails without having to move them to a separate folder.\n* Take a moment to read through each email and savor the kind words and memories. It's a great way to reflect on your accomplishment!\n* If you have a large number of emails, you might consider creating a \"Favorites\" or \"Special Mentions\" folder to highlight particularly meaningful or heartfelt messages.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on organizing your congratulatory emails!",
