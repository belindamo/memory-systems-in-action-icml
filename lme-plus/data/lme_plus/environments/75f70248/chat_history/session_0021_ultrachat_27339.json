      "content": "Sure, here are some tips for making homemade bread without a bread maker:\n\n1. Choose the right flour: Opt for high-protein bread flour as it has more gluten which will help your bread rise well.\n\n2. Activate the yeast: In order to make bread rise, activate the yeast in warm water along with sugar, salt and oil. Let it sit for few minutes until it gets foamy.\n\n3. Knead it well: Kneading the dough is crucial to allow gluten to develop which will result in a nice, chewy texture. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer with a dough hook.\n\n4. Let it rise: After kneading, let your dough rise in a warm and draft-free place until it doubles in size, which usually takes about an hour.\n\n5. Punch down and shape: Once the dough has risen, punch it down and shape it into loaves or rolls before allowing it to rise again for another 30 to 45 minutes.\n\n6. Bake it: Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and bake it for about 30-35 minutes or until it is golden brown.\n\n7. Test for doneness: One of the easiest ways to check if your bread is done is to tap on the underside. If it sounds hollow, it's done.\n\nBy following these tips, you can make delicious homemade bread without a bread maker."
