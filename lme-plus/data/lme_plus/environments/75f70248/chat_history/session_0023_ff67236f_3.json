Congratulations!\n\nNow, I'd be delighted to share a recipe for Tteokbokki-inspired Rice Cakes with Sweet Red Bean Filling. Here's a recipe to get you started:\n\n**Tteokbokki-inspired Rice Cakes with Sweet Red Bean Filling (Tteokbokki-style Bungeo-ppang)**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the rice cakes:\n\n* 2 cups of glutinous rice flour\n* 1/2 cup of cornstarch\n* 1/4 cup of granulated sugar\n* 1/4 cup of vegetable oil\n* 1/2 cup of warm water\n* Food coloring (optional, for a vibrant red color)\n\nFor the sweet red bean filling:\n\n* 1 cup of sweet red bean paste (available at Asian markets or online)\n* 1 tablespoon of honey\n* 1 tablespoon of sesame oil\n* Pinch of salt\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Make the rice cakes:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour, cornstarch, and sugar. Gradually add in the vegetable oil and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the warm water and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and pliable. Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a small egg. Flatten each ball into a disk shape.\n2. **Prepare the sweet red bean filling:** In a small bowl, mix together the sweet red bean paste, honey, sesame oil, and salt until well combined.\n3. **Assemble the rice cakes:** Place a small spoonful of the sweet red bean filling in the center of each rice cake disk. Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape, and press the edges to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges.\n4. **Cook the rice cakes:** In a large pot of boiling water, cook the rice cakes for about 5-7 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain the rice cakes and rinse them in cold water to stop the cooking process.\n5. **Serve:** Serve the rice cakes warm or at room temperature, drizzled with honey and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* To achieve the signature Tteokbokki color, add a few drops of red food coloring to the dough before kneading.\n* You can also add other fillings, such as sweetened condensed milk or chopped nuts, to the rice cakes for variation.\n* If you can't find sweet red bean paste, you can make your own by boiling dried adzuki beans with sugar and water, then mashing them into a paste.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and devouring these delicious Tteokbokki-inspired rice cakes!"

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Grease a 9-inch (23cm) round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n3. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey, sesame oil, and vanilla extract.\n4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.\n5. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top.\n6. To make the sesame streusel, mix the flour, sugar, and softened butter in a small bowl until crumbly. Stir in the sesame seeds.\n7. Sprinkle the sesame streusel evenly over the cake batter.\n8. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n9. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use high-quality sesame oil for the best flavor.\n* Toast the sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium heat until fragrant and lightly browned before using them in the streusel.\n* The cake will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months.\n\nNow, about your Korean-inspired dinner party menu...\n\nFor main courses, I recommend:\n\n1. **Bulgogi ()**: Thinly sliced marinated beef, typically served with rice and kimchi.\n2. **Jeyuk bokkeum ()**: Stir-fried pork with vegetables and gochujang (Korean chili paste).\n3. **Doenjang jjigae ()**: Fermented soybean paste stew with vegetables and meat or seafood.\n\nFor appetizers, consider:\n\n1. **Kimchi ()**: Spicy fermented Korean cabbage, served with a variety of seasonings.\n2. **Pajeon ()**: Korean-style pancake with scallions and sometimes meat or seafood.\n3. **Mandu ()**: Korean dumplings, steamed or fried, filled with meat, kimchi, or tofu.\n\nThese dishes will pair beautifully with the Sesame Honey Cake and other Korean desserts we've discussed. You can also consider serving Korean tea, such as omija (five-flavor tea) or yuja (citrus tea), to complement the meal.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear about your dinner party plans!"
