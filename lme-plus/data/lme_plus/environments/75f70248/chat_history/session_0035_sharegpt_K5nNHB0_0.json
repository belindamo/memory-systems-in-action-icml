You can think of it as an ELN with a product management framework that introduces agile project management to scientific teams. \n\nThe way that scientific research is done today is fundamentally flawed.\u00a0When scientific teams do research, they often largely operate in silos instead of regularly sharing their data with each other, they work in large chunks of deliverables at a time rather than building momentum with smaller milestones, and they have very slow feedback loops rather than regular review cycles that enable teams to make decisions quickly and make the most of their time.\n\nAs a result, scientists are spending increasing amounts of time on data management tasks, like searching for data, sharing their data, and coordinating on tasks to collect data.\n\nColabra helps companies establish stronger operational processes to minimize this admin overhead by introducing product management frameworks, like continuous improvement, data sharing, and workflow automation to the team. We aggregate all of your data in one centralized, searchable place, and enable you to break down your research into clear tasks for your team members, so that your team is always working on the most important task. You can also comment directly on experiments, so that your team is able to (1) surface problems immediately as they come up, and (2) prevent having important information lost in email inboxes and Slack threads.\""
