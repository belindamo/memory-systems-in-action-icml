      "content": "I totally understand! Staying connected with friends who live far away can be challenging, but video call platforms can be a lifesaver. There are many excellent options out there, and I'd be happy to recommend some popular and reliable ones. Here are some top picks:\n\n1. **Zoom**: Zoom is a popular choice for its ease of use, high-quality video and audio, and reliability. It's free for personal use, and you can have up to 100 participants in a single call. It's also available on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.\n2. **Skype**: Skype is a classic video conferencing platform that's been around for a while. It's free for personal use, and you can have up to 25 people in a group call. It's available on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.\n3. **Google Meet**: Google Meet is a simple and user-friendly platform that's part of the Google Suite. It's free, and you can have up to 50 participants in a single call. It's available on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.\n4. **FaceTime**: If you and your friends are all iPhone users, FaceTime is a great option. It's built-in, easy to use, and offers high-quality video and audio.\n5. **WhatsApp Video Calls**: WhatsApp is a popular messaging app that also offers video calling. It's free, and you can have up to 8 people in a group call. It's available on mobile devices.\n6. **Discord**: Discord is a platform primarily designed for gamers, but it's also great for socializing with friends. You can create a server and have voice or video chats with up to 10 people. It's free, and available on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.\n7. **Google Duo**: Google Duo is a simple, lightweight video calling app that's designed for one-on-one conversations. It's free, and available on mobile devices.\n8. **Facebook Messenger Rooms**: Facebook Messenger Rooms is a relatively new feature that allows you to have video calls with up to 8 people. It's free, and available on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.\n\nAll of these options are reliable and easy to use, so you can't go wrong with any of them! If you're looking for a more casual, low-key experience, WhatsApp Video Calls or Facebook Messenger Rooms might be a good choice. If you want a more structured, meeting-like experience, Zoom or Google Meet might be the way to go.\n\nBefore choosing a platform, consider the following factors:\n\n* How many people will be participating in the call?\n* Do you need any special features, like screen sharing or recording?\n* Are you and your friends using the same devices (e.g., all iPhone users)?\n* Do you have any specific security or privacy concerns?\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect platform for your regular catch-ups with your college friends!"

Make sure to save your changes before exiting the meeting settings.\n\n**Method 2: Calendar Invitations**\n\n1. **Add the meeting to your calendar**: When you scheduled the recurring meeting on Zoom, you should have received a calendar invitation.

For example, \"Hey Siri, remind me about my video call with friends at 3 PM today.\"\n2. **Set an alarm**: Set an alarm on your phone, watch, or computer for the designated time. You can also use a third-party alarm app or reminder service.\n\nBy using one or a combination of these methods, you'll receive reminders and ensure you don't forget about the video call yourself.\n\nRemember to test your reminders before the video call to make sure you receive them correctly."

This can be a fun way to bond over food and learn new recipes.\n4. **Wine and cheese night**: If you're all 21+, have a wine and cheese night where you taste different wines and cheeses while discussing your favorites.\n5. **Karaoke**: Sing your hearts out to your favorite songs, either solo or in groups. You can use apps like Smule or SingSnap to make it more interactive.\n6. **Book club**: Start a virtual book club where you discuss a book you've all read. This can lead to great conversations and debates.\n7. **Show and tell**: Have each person share something they've been working on, like a craft project, a new skill they've learned, or a pet they've adopted.\n8. **Virtual scavenger hunt**: Create a list of items for each person to find around their house, and see who can find everything on the list first.\n9. **Creative collaborations**: Collaborate on a creative project, like writing a short story, creating a piece of art, or making a video together.\n10. **Virtual outings**: Take virtual tours of each other's homes, neighborhoods, or local attractions. You can also explore museums or national parks together online.\n\nRemember to choose activities that everyone is comfortable with and that fit your group's interests. The goal is to have fun and make the experience more engaging and interactive!\n\nI hope these ideas help you plan some exciting and memorable video calls with your friends!"
