      "content": "The methodology used to derive this list of surface-expressed tumor-associated antigen (TAA) genes that are overexpressed in CMS2 and/or CMS4 subtypes of colorectal cancer (CRC) but have low expression or are not expressed in CMS1 and/or CMS3 subtypes may vary depending on the source of information. However, the most common approach involves analyzing publicly available gene expression data from CRC patient samples using bioinformatic tools and methods.\n\nFor example, one common approach is to use gene expression microarray or RNA sequencing data from large cohorts of CRC patients, which are often available through public databases like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Researchers can then perform gene expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are specifically overexpressed or downregulated in certain CRC subtypes, such as CMS2 and/or CMS4.\n\nTo identify surface-expressed TAAs specifically, researchers may use additional bioinformatic tools to analyze gene ontology (GO) annotations or database searches for genes with known or predicted transmembrane domains, extracellular domains, or signal peptides. This can help filter out genes that are not expressed on the surface of cancer cells and narrow down the list of potential TAAs.\n\nOnce a list of candidate TAAs is generated, researchers may validate the expression of these genes at the protein level using techniques like immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting, or flow cytometry. Finally, functional assays can be used to determine the immunogenicity and potential utility of these TAAs as targets for cancer immunotherapy."

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - a public resource that provides comprehensive genomic data for multiple cancer types, including colorectal cancer.\n2. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) - a public database of high-throughput gene expression data and other functional genomics datasets.\n3. ArrayExpress - a public database of functional genomics experiments, including gene expression data for colorectal cancer and other cancer types.\n4. Oncomine - a cancer microarray database and web-based data mining platform that provides gene expression data and analysis tools.\n5. Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) - a public resource that provides gene expression data for a large panel of cancer cell lines, including colorectal cancer cell lines.\n6. Cancer Genome Interpreter - a web-based tool that integrates various genomic data sources, including gene expression data, to interpret cancer genomes and identify potential therapeutic targets.\n7. cBioPortal - a web-based platform that allows users to explore multidimensional cancer genomics data, including gene expression data, across various cancer types.\n\nThese databases provide a wealth of information on gene expression data for colorectal cancer and other cancers, and can be used to identify potential TAAs for cancer immunotherapy."
