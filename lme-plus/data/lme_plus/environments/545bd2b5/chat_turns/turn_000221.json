  "content": "Reaching out to groups and asking about their experience with novel writing is a great idea! It's essential to find a group that understands and supports your specific writing goals.\n\nRegarding mentioning your previous experience with a writing group, it's a bit of a gray area. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Honesty**: By mentioning your past experience, you're being transparent about your intentions and showing that you're not afraid to share your story.\n2. **Context**: It might help the group leaders or members understand your perspective and what you're looking for in a writing group.\n3. **Self-awareness**: You're demonstrating that you're reflective and willing to learn from your past experiences.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Potential bias**: Some group leaders or members might view your previous experience as a red flag, wondering if you're flaky or not committed to a group.\n2. **Negative impression**: If you didn't attend the previous group's meeting, it might give the impression that you're not reliable or serious about your writing.\n3. **Unnecessary information**: It might not be relevant to your current search for a writing group, and you don't want to distract from your main goal of finding a suitable group.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether to share this information. If you do decide to mention it, try to frame it in a positive light, focusing on what you learned from the experience and what you're looking for in a group now. For example:\n\n\"Hi, I'm reaching out to explore your writing group because I'm interested in finding a community that focuses on novel writing. I was previously invited to a writing group, but it didn't end up being a good fit for me. I'm looking for a group that can provide constructive feedback and support for novelists. Can you tell me more about your group's experience with novel writing and what kind of support you offer?\"\n\nBy sharing your experience in a concise and positive way, you can show that you're reflective and committed to finding the right group for your writing needs.\n\nRemember, the goal is to find a group that aligns with your writing goals and provides the support you need. Focus on asking questions about the group's focus, format, and expectations, and don't be afraid to ask for clarification or more information. Good luck!",
