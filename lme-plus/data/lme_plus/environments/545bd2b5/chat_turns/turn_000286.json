I recommend checking the websites of these gyms or others that interest you to confirm their hours and find the one that best fits your schedule.\n\nConsidering your usual Tuesday and Thursday routine, you might want to look for a gym with extended hours on those days or one that's open 24/7. That way, you can adjust your schedule as needed to accommodate any unexpected meetings or changes.\n\nHow do you feel about trying out one of these options, or would you like me to suggest more gyms in Chicago?",
