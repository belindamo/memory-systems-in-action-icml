While Zoom's built-in reminders can notify your attendees, you can use other methods to remind yourself about the call. Here are a few ways to set reminders for yourself:\n\n**Method 1: Zoom's Built-in Reminders (for hosts)**\n\n1. **Log in to your Zoom account**: Go to the Zoom website ([www.zoom.us](http://www.zoom.us)) and log in with your credentials.\n2. **Go to \"Meetings\"**: Click on the \"Meetings\" tab in the top navigation bar.\n3. **Find your recurring meeting**: Locate the recurring meeting you scheduled earlier and click on it.\n4. **Edit meeting settings**: Click on the \"Edit\" button next to the meeting title.\n5. **Enable host reminders**: Scroll down to the \"Reminders\" section and toggle the switch to \"On\" next to \"Host reminders\".\n6. **Set reminder timing**: Choose when you want to receive reminders as the host (e.g., 1 hour, 30 minutes, or 15 minutes before the meeting).\n\nZoom will send you reminders at the chosen time, ensuring you don't forget about the video call.\n\n**Method 2: Calendar Reminders**\n\n1. **Add the meeting to your calendar**: When you scheduled the recurring meeting on Zoom, you should have received a calendar invitation. If not, you can add the meeting to your calendar manually.\n2. **Set reminders on your calendar**: Open your calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook) and find the recurring meeting event.\n3. **Edit the event**: Click on the event to edit it.\n4. **Add reminders**: Set reminders for yourself by clicking on the \"Reminders\" or \"Notifications\" tab. Choose the reminder timing and frequency (e.g., 1 hour, 30 minutes, or 15 minutes before the meeting).\n\nYour calendar will send reminders to you at the chosen time.\n\n**Method 3: Digital Assistants or Alarms**\n\n1. **Use a digital assistant**: If you have a digital assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, you can set a reminder using voice commands. For example, \"Hey Siri, remind me about my video call with friends at 3 PM today.\"\n2. **Set an alarm**: Set an alarm on your phone, watch, or computer for the designated time. You can also use a third-party alarm app or reminder service.\n\nBy using one or a combination of these methods, you'll receive reminders and ensure you don't forget about the video call yourself.\n\nRemember to test your reminders before the video call to make sure you receive them correctly.",
