  "content": "I think we've covered a lot of ground, and I'm feeling more organized about discussing the sale of our parents' old house with my siblings. Before we wrap up, I just wanted to mention that I recently rented a storage unit to help declutter my garage, which got me thinking about the storage needs for the items in our parents' house. I'm glad I have that extra space to store things temporarily while we figure out what to do with the property. Anyway, thanks for the help with the agenda \u2013 I feel more prepared for our meeting now!",
