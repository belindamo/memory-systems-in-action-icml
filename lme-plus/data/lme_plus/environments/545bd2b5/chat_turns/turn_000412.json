  "content": "The methodology used to derive this list of surface-expressed tumor-associated antigen (TAA) genes that are overexpressed in CMS2 and/or CMS4 subtypes of colorectal cancer (CRC) but have low expression or are not expressed in CMS1 and/or CMS3 subtypes may vary depending on the source of information. However, the most common approach involves analyzing publicly available gene expression data from CRC patient samples using bioinformatic tools and methods.\n\nFor example, one common approach is to use gene expression microarray or RNA sequencing data from large cohorts of CRC patients, which are often available through public databases like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Researchers can then perform gene expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are specifically overexpressed or downregulated in certain CRC subtypes, such as CMS2 and/or CMS4.\n\nTo identify surface-expressed TAAs specifically, researchers may use additional bioinformatic tools to analyze gene ontology (GO) annotations or database searches for genes with known or predicted transmembrane domains, extracellular domains, or signal peptides. This can help filter out genes that are not expressed on the surface of cancer cells and narrow down the list of potential TAAs.\n\nOnce a list of candidate TAAs is generated, researchers may validate the expression of these genes at the protein level using techniques like immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting, or flow cytometry. Finally, functional assays can be used to determine the immunogenicity and potential utility of these TAAs as targets for cancer immunotherapy.",
