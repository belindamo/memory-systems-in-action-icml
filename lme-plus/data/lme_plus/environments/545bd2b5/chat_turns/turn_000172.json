Here's an expanded version of the medical 101 deck with full information on each slide.\n\nSlide 1: Introduction\n\n* Brief overview of myasthenia gravis\n* Importance of raising awareness of the condition and complement therapy\n\nSlide 2: What is Myasthenia Gravis?\n\n* Definition: Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the nervous system and causes muscle weakness.\n* Causes: Myasthenia gravis occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the receptors in the nerve endings, disrupting communication between the nerve and the muscle.\n\nSlide 3: Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis\n\n* List of common symptoms:\n\t+ Weakness in the arms and legs\n\t+ Double vision or drooping eyelids\n\t+ Difficulty speaking, chewing or swallowing\n\t+ Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n\nSlide 4: Diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis\n\n* Testing and procedures to diagnose the condition:\n\t+ Physical examination and medical history\n\t+ Blood tests\n\t+ Electromyogram (EMG)\n\t+ Single Fiber Electromyography (SFEMG)\n\t+ Imaging tests (such as MRI)\n\t+ Edrophonium (Tensilon) test\n\nSlide 5: Generalized Myasthenia Gravis\n\n* Definition and overview of the most common form of the condition\n* Generalized myasthenia gravis affects multiple parts of the body and is characterized by widespread muscle weakness.\n\nSlide 6: Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis\n\n* Overview of the various treatment options:\n\t+ Medications (such as cholinesterase inhibitors)\n\t+ Plasmapheresis (or plasma exchange)\n\t+ Immune-suppressing drugs\n\t+ Steroids\n\t+ Complement therapy\n\nSlide 7: Importance of Complement Therapy\n\n* Explanation of the role of complement therapy in treating generalized myasthenia gravis\n* Complement therapy is a relatively new approach to treating generalized myasthenia gravis, aimed at reducing the immune system's attack on the nerve receptors.\n\nSlide 8: What is Complement Therapy?\n\n* Definition and explanation of complement therapy:\n\t+ Complement therapy is a type of treatment that works by inhibiting the complement system, which is a part of the immune system.\n\t+ The goal of complement therapy is to reduce the activity of the complement system, which contributes to the autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis.\n\nSlide 9: Benefits of Complement Therapy\n\n* List of benefits for patients with generalized myasthenia gravis:\n\t+ Improved muscle strength\n\t+ Increased mobility and reduced muscle weakness\n\t+ Improved quality of life\n\t+ Reduced dependence on other treatments\n\nSlide 10: Introduction to Ultomiris (Ravulizumab)\n\n* Brief overview of the drug and its benefits\n* Ultomiris (ravulizumab) is a complement inhibitor, which has been approved for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis.\n\nSlide 11: What is Ultomiris (Ravulizumab)?\n\n* Definition and explanation of the drug\n* Ultomiris (ravulizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that works by inhibiting the complement system and reducing the autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis.\n\nSlide 12: How Ultomiris (Ravulizumab) Works\n\n* Explanation of the mechanism of action of the drug:\n\t+ Ultomiris (ravulizumab) binds",
