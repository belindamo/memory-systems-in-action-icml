This permit ensures that the truck or container doesn't obstruct traffic or pedestrian paths.\n2. **Weight and Size Restrictions:** Some residential areas in Oakwood have weight and size restrictions for moving vehicles, especially in neighborhoods with narrow streets or tight corners. Be sure to check with your moving company or the City of Oakwood to determine if there are any specific restrictions in your area.\n3. **Tree Ordinance:** Oakwood has a Tree Ordinance that protects its urban forest.
