Here are a few ways to send reminders:\n\n**Method 1: Zoom's Built-in Reminders**\n\n1. **Log in to your Zoom account**: Go to the Zoom website ([www.zoom.us](http://www.zoom.us)) and log in with your credentials.\n2. **Go to \"Meetings\"**: Click on the \"Meetings\" tab in the top navigation bar.\n3. **Find your recurring meeting**: Locate the recurring meeting you scheduled earlier and click on it.\n4. **Edit meeting settings**: Click on the \"Edit\" button next to the meeting title.\n5. **Enable reminders**: Scroll down to the \"Reminders\" section and toggle the switch to \"On\".\n6. **Set reminder timing**: Choose when you want to send reminders to your attendees (e.g., 1 hour, 30 minutes, or 15 minutes before the meeting).\n\nZoom will automatically send reminders to your attendees at the chosen time. Make sure to save your changes before exiting the meeting settings.\n\n**Method 2: Calendar Invitations**\n\n1. **Add the meeting to your calendar**: When you scheduled the recurring meeting on Zoom, you should have received a calendar invitation. If not, you can add the meeting to your calendar manually.\n2. **Set reminders on your calendar**: Open your calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook) and find the recurring meeting event.\n3. **Edit the event**: Click on the event to edit it.\n4. **Add reminders**: Set reminders for your attendees by clicking on the \"Reminders\" or \"Notifications\" tab. Choose the reminder timing and frequency (e.g., 1 hour, 30 minutes, or 15 minutes before the meeting).\n\nYour calendar will send reminders to your attendees at the chosen time.\n\n**Method 3: Manual Reminders**\n\n1. **Create a group chat**: Create a group chat on a messaging platform (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, GroupMe) with your friends.\n2. **Send reminders manually**: Send a reminder message to the group chat at a designated time before the meeting (e.g., 1 hour, 30 minutes, or 15 minutes before).\n\nThis method requires manual effort, but it's a simple way to send reminders if you don't want to rely on Zoom's built-in reminders or calendar invitations.\n\nBy using one or a combination of these methods, you can ensure your friends receive reminders before the video call and join on time.",
