  "content": "I'm liking the show so far, though I'm not as invested in it as I was with Stranger Things. I think the world-building is really interesting, and I love the monsters and the magic system. I'm also enjoying Cavill's performance as Geralt. However, I'm still getting used to the non-linear storytelling, and sometimes it feels a bit confusing. What's your take on the non-linear storytelling approach? Do you think it adds to the show or makes it harder to follow?",
