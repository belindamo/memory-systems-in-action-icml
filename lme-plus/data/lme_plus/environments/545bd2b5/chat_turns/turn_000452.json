When camping near Mount Rushmore, you're in an area with a moderate risk of bear encounters, primarily with black bears. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Bear-Resistant Containers (BRCs):**\n\n1. **Check with the campground:** If you're camping at a developed campground, check with the park's website or contact the campground directly to see if bear-resistant containers are required or recommended.\n2. **Black Hills National Forest:** In the Black Hills National Forest, which surrounds Mount Rushmore, bear-resistant containers are not mandatory but are highly recommended. You can rent or purchase BRCs at local outfitters or online.\n3. **Food Storage:** If you don't have a BRC, you'll need to store your food and scented items (e.g., toothpaste, soap) in airtight containers and hang them at least 10 feet off the ground and 4 feet out from the trunk of a tree.\n\n**Bear Safety Tips:**\n\n1. **Be aware of your surroundings:** When hiking, make noise to avoid surprising bears, and stay in groups.\n2. **Keep a clean campsite:** Keep your campsite clean and free of food scraps, dirty dishes, and trash.\n3. **Store attractants properly:** Store food, trash, and other attractants (e.g., pet food, bird seed) in airtight containers and keep them away from your campsite.\n4. **Make noise:** When hiking, make noise by talking, singing, or carrying bear bells to alert bears of your presence.\n5. **Be prepared for an encounter:** Know what to do in a bear encounter: remain calm, stay in a group, and slowly back away while keeping an eye on the bear. Avoid direct eye contact and do not run.\n6. **Carry bear spray:** Consider carrying bear spray as a deterrent in case of an encounter. Make sure you know how to use it properly.\n\n**Other Wildlife Safety Tips:**\n\n1. **Be mindful of other wildlife:** In addition to bears, the Black Hills are home to other wildlife like mountain lions, bison, and elk. Be aware of your surroundings and keep a safe distance.\n2. **Keep pets on a leash:** If you bring your pet, keep them on a leash and under control to avoid attracting wildlife.\n\nIt's great that you have experience with bear country from your Yellowstone trip!
