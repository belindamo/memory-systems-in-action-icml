Here are some suggestions to make your video calls more fun and interactive:\n\n1. **Themed calls**: Plan themed video calls, such as a cooking show, game night, or a movie night where you all watch the same movie and discuss it afterwards.\n2. **Games and challenges**: Play online games, like Jackbox, Among Us, or charades, that can be played remotely. You can also create your own challenges, like a trivia contest or a \"guess the song\" game.\n3. **Cooking or baking together**: Choose a recipe and cook or bake together over video call. This can be a fun way to bond over food and learn new recipes.\n4. **Wine and cheese night**: If you're all 21+, have a wine and cheese night where you taste different wines and cheeses while discussing your favorites.\n5. **Karaoke**: Sing your hearts out to your favorite songs, either solo or in groups. You can use apps like Smule or SingSnap to make it more interactive.\n6. **Book club**: Start a virtual book club where you discuss a book you've all read. This can lead to great conversations and debates.\n7. **Show and tell**: Have each person share something they've been working on, like a craft project, a new skill they've learned, or a pet they've adopted.\n8. **Virtual scavenger hunt**: Create a list of items for each person to find around their house, and see who can find everything on the list first.\n9. **Creative collaborations**: Collaborate on a creative project, like writing a short story, creating a piece of art, or making a video together.\n10. **Virtual outings**: Take virtual tours of each other's homes, neighborhoods, or local attractions. You can also explore museums or national parks together online.\n\nRemember to choose activities that everyone is comfortable with and that fit your group's interests. The goal is to have fun and make the experience more engaging and interactive!\n\nI hope these ideas help you plan some exciting and memorable video calls with your friends!",
