That's the first step to getting back on track.\n\nTo help you get back into your groove, I'd recommend the following:\n\n1. **Ease back into it**: Don't try to do too much too soon. Ease back into your routine with lighter workouts and gradually increase the intensity as you get back into the swing of things.\n2. **Focus on consistency**: Aim to get to the gym at least 3-4 times this week, even if it's just for a shorter workout. Consistency is key to getting back into a routine.\n3. **Stick to your usual routine**: Try to get back to your usual Tuesday and Thursday gym days, even if it means adjusting the time or type of workout you do. The familiarity will help you get back into the habit.\n4. **Make a plan for next week**: Take some time to plan out your workouts for next week, including any adjustments you need to make for meetings or appointments. Having a plan in place will help you stay on track.\n5. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to have setbacks, and it's normal to feel a bit rusty after a few weeks off. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results or if you don't feel like you're back to your usual self right away.\n\nYou got this! You've already taken the first step by acknowledging the setbacks and wanting to get back on track. Now, it's just a matter of taking it one workout at a time and being consistent.\n\nHow do you feel about trying to get back into your routine with a lighter workout this week, and then gradually increasing the intensity as you get back into the swing of things?",
