  "content": "I'm still getting to know the supporting characters, but I think Ciri is really interesting. I love her spirit and determination, and I'm curious to see how her storyline unfolds. Yennefer is also fascinating, and I appreciate her complexity and moral ambiguity. I'm still trying to figure out her motivations and backstory, but I think her character adds a lot to the show.\n\nSpeaking of complex characters, I've been watching a lot of movies lately, and I just rewatched The Shawshank Redemption. It's still one of my favorite films, and I think it's because of the characters. Red and Andy are so well-developed, and their friendship is really compelling. Have you seen it? What do you think of the film?",
