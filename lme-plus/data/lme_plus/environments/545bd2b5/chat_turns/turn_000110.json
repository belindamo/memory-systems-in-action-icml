  "content": "It's great to hear that you're feeling more organized and prepared for your meeting with your siblings! Having a clear agenda and a plan in place can make a big difference in ensuring that all important topics are covered and discussed.\n\nI'm also glad to hear that you've rented a storage unit to help declutter your garage. That's a great step in getting organized and freeing up space in your own home. And, as you mentioned, having that extra space can be really helpful when it comes to storing items from your parents' house temporarily while you all figure out what to do with the property.\n\nRemember to take your time, stay focused, and communicate openly with your siblings during the meeting. It's okay to take things one step at a time and to not have all the answers right away. The important thing is that you're taking the first steps towards making a decision and moving forward.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you and your siblings all the best with your meeting and the decision-making process ahead.",
