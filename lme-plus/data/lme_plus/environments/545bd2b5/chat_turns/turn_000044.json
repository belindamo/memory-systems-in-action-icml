  "content": "Fixed mounts are a great option when you don't need to adjust the TV's position frequently. The average price range for a fixed TV mount that can hold a 40-inch TV can vary depending on the brand, material, and features. However, here are some general price ranges to expect:\n\n* Basic fixed mounts: $20-$40\n\t+ These mounts are usually made of plastic or low-end metal and may not be as sturdy as more expensive options.\n\t+ They might not have a sleek design or advanced features, but they'll get the job done.\n* Mid-range fixed mounts: $40-$70\n\t+ These mounts are typically made of higher-quality metal and have a more robust design.\n\t+ They may have a more modern look and feel, and some might come with additional features like a built-in level or cable management.\n* Premium fixed mounts: $70-$120\n\t+ These mounts are often made of heavy-duty metal and have a sleek, slim design.\n\t+ They might come with advanced features like a built-in stud finder, adjustable tilt, or a security screw to prevent theft.\n\nFor a 40-inch TV, I'd recommend a mid-range fixed mount, which should cost between $40-$70. This price range offers a good balance between quality, features, and price.\n\nSome popular fixed mount options in this price range include:\n\n* Sanus VMF408: A sturdy, low-profile mount with a built-in level and cable management system. ($50-$60)\n* OmniMount OLF40: A slim, adjustable fixed mount with a built-in stud finder and security screw. ($60-$70)\n* VideoSecu MW380B3: A heavy-duty fixed mount with a robust design and built-in level. ($40-$50)\n\nKeep in mind that prices may vary depending on the retailer, and you might find deals or discounts that bring the cost down. Be sure to check reviews and product descriptions to ensure the mount is compatible with your TV's weight and VESA pattern.",
