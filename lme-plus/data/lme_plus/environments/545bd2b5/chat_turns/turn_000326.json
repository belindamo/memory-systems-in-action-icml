Congratulations on recognizing the issue and wanting to make a change.\n\nSetting a time limit of 30 minutes per day is a great starting point, but it might be a bit too drastic, considering you're used to spending 2 hours a day on Instagram. A more effective approach might be to set a limit that's challenging yet achievable, so you can build momentum and confidence.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n1. **Start with a 50% reduction**: Try setting a daily time limit of 1 hour (50% of your current average) for the first week. This will help you adjust to a new habit without feeling overwhelmed.\n2. **Gradually reduce further**: After a week, reassess your usage and reduce your daily limit by another 20-30 minutes. This will bring you down to around 40-45 minutes per day.\n3. **Aim for 30 minutes or less**: Once you've adjusted to the new limit, you can further reduce it to 30 minutes or less per day. This will help you develop a healthier habit and minimize mindless scrolling.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make sustainable changes that you can maintain in the long run. By gradually reducing your screen time, you'll be more likely to stick to your goals and develop healthier habits.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following tips to help you stay within your new time limit:\n\n* **Use Instagram's built-in features**: Take advantage of Instagram's \"Your Time on Instagram\" feature, which allows you to set a daily time limit and receive reminders when you've reached it.\n* **Remove Instagram from your home screen**: Move the app to a secondary screen or folder to make it harder to mindlessly open.\n* **Schedule Instagram use**: Allocate specific times of the day for Instagram use, e.g., during your lunch break or after dinner.\n* **Find alternative activities**: Replace Instagram time with other activities you enjoy, such as reading, drawing, or taking a short walk.\n\nYou got this! By setting a realistic goal and gradually reducing your screen time, you'll be well on your way to developing a healthier relationship with Instagram.",
