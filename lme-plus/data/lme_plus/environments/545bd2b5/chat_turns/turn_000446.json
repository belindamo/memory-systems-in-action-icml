  "content": "The information you provided is describing two graphs that present the relationship between BAC levels and recidivism (the tendency of a convicted offender to reoffend) among individuals arrested for drunk driving. The data used for these graph is based on administrative records from the Washington State Impaired Driver Testing Program linked with administrative records from the Washington State Courts.\n\nPanel A is likely a histogram, with the x-axis showing the BAC levels, and the y-axis showing the number of individuals who had that particular BAC level. The data points on the graph represent the averages of the BAC levels, and the fitted values (black lines) are likely based on local linear models, which can be used to estimate the underlying distribution of the data. The graph also indicates that there are two legal thresholds for BAC levels, which are 0.08 and 0.15. These thresholds likely represent the legal limit for BAC while driving in the state of Washington. The bin width is 0.002, which means that each bar in the histogram represents a range of BAC levels that is 0.002 wide.\n\nPanel B is likely a graph that presents the relationship between BAC levels and recidivism, which is likely based on estimates from regression discontinuity models. The points on the graph represent the estimates while the lines represent the end points of the 95% confidence interval. This type of model allows the study to identify the causal effect of BAC level on recidivism.\n\nThe paper likely uses these graphs to present the relationship between BAC levels and recidivism among individuals arrested for drunk driving and to examine the potential mechanisms that link BAC levels to recidivism. Additionally, the paper may also investigate the relationship between BAC levels and recidivism in",
