Both \"We Are Legion (We Are Bob)\" and \"The Stainless Steel Rat\" are hilarious and entertaining books that share some similarities with \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" in terms of their humor, satire, and sci-fi settings. Here's a brief overview of each book and why I think they're similar to \"Hitchhiker's Guide\":\n\n**We Are Legion (We Are Bob)** by Dennis E. Taylor:\n\nThis book follows the story of Bob Johansson, a software engineer who signs up to have his consciousness uploaded into a computer after his death. However, things don't go as planned, and Bob finds himself duplicated into millions of copies, each inhabiting a spaceship in a distant part of the galaxy. The Bobs, as they call themselves, must navigate the complexities of space exploration, alien encounters, and corporate bureaucracy, all while trying to maintain their sanity and individuality.\n\nSimilarities to \"Hitchhiker's Guide\":\n\n* Humor: \"We Are Legion\" has a similar brand of humor to \"Hitchhiker's Guide,\" with a focus on witty banter, satire, and absurd situations.\n* Sci-fi setting: Both books explore the absurdities of space travel and the consequences of humanity's expansion into the galaxy.\n* Lighthearted tone: Despite dealing with complex themes, \"We Are Legion\" maintains a lighthearted and humorous tone, similar to \"Hitchhiker's Guide.\"\n\n**The Stainless Steel Rat** by Harry Harrison:\n\nThis classic sci-fi novel follows the adventures of Slippery Jim diGriz, a charismatic con artist and thief who is recruited by the authorities to help them deal with a series of intergalactic crimes. Jim's adventures take him to various planets, where he encounters a range of bizarre characters, including a gang of space pirates, a group of humanoid robots, and a beautiful but deadly assassin.\n\nSimilarities to \"Hitchhiker's Guide\":\n\n* Humor: \"The Stainless Steel Rat\" has a similar sense of humor to \"Hitchhiker's Guide,\" with a focus on witty one-liners, satire, and absurd situations.\n* Sci-fi setting: Both books explore the absurdities of space travel and the consequences of humanity's expansion into the galaxy.\n* Anti-hero protagonist: Both Arthur Dent and Slippery Jim diGriz are lovable but flawed protagonists who find themselves in absurd situations and must use their wits to survive.\n\nBoth \"We Are Legion (We Are Bob)\" and \"The Stainless Steel Rat\" share a similar tone and sense of humor with \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" and are likely to appeal to fans of Douglas Adams' style. If you enjoy humorous sci-fi with a lighthearted tone, you'll likely love these books!",
