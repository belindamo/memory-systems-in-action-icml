LA Fitness and Planet Fitness are both popular options with a wide range of equipment and classes.\n\nNow, about prioritizing your workouts on a busy week...\n\nHere are some tips to help you make the most of your gym time:\n\n1. **Focus on compound exercises**: When you're short on time, focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows. These exercises are efficient and effective.\n2. **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)**: Consider incorporating HIIT workouts into your routine. These involve short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief periods of rest. HIIT workouts can be completed in as little as 20-30 minutes and are great for busy days.\n3. **Prioritize your goals**: Identify your fitness goals and prioritize your workouts accordingly. If you're trying to build strength, focus on weightlifting exercises. If you're looking to improve cardiovascular health, focus on cardio exercises like running, cycling, or swimming.\n4. **Split your workout**: If you only have 30 minutes to spare, consider splitting your workout into two shorter sessions. For example, do 20 minutes of cardio in the morning and 20 minutes of strength training in the evening.\n5. **Make a schedule and stick to it**: Treat your workouts as non-negotiable appointments and schedule them in your calendar. Even 20-30 minutes of exercise is better than nothing!\n6. **Focus on one or two muscle groups**: If you're really short on time, focus on one or two muscle groups per workout. For example, do a quick chest and triceps workout one day, and then focus on back and biceps the next.\n7. **Use a workout app or planner**: Consider using a workout app like Nike Training Club, JEFIT, or a physical planner to help you plan and track your workouts. These tools can help you stay organized and motivated.\n\nRemember, consistency is key. Even with a busy schedule, you can still make progress and maintain your fitness level with short, focused workouts.\n\nDo you have any specific fitness goals or preferences (e.g., weightlifting, cardio, yoga, etc.) that might help me provide more tailored advice?",
