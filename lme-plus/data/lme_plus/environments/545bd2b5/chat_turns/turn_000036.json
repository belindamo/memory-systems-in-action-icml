  "content": "Habitica is flexible and allows you to customize your habits and routines to fit your specific needs. You can definitely set up different morning routines for days when you don't have a 30-minute jog. Here's how:\n\n**Create a separate habit for non-jogging days:**\n\n1. **Create a new habit**: Tap the \"+\" icon in the top-right corner and select \"Habit.\" Name this habit something like \"Non-Jogging Morning Routine\" or \"M/W/F Morning Routine.\"\n2. **Add tasks**: Add tasks that you want to complete on days when you're not jogging, such as:\n\t* \"Wake up at 6:30 AM\"\n\t* \"Drink a glass of water\"\n\t* \"Meditate for 10 minutes\"\n\t* \"Stretch for 10 minutes\"\n\t* \"Prepare breakfast\"\n3. **Set task details**: Set the task type, priority, and reward values as desired.\n4. **Set reminders**: Set reminders for each task to ensure you stay on track.\n\n**Use Habitica's scheduling feature:**\n\nTo specify which days you want to follow each routine, use Habitica's scheduling feature:\n\n1. **Edit the habit**: Tap the three dots next to the habit name and select \"Edit Habit.\"\n2. **Schedule the habit**: Tap the \"Schedule\" tab and select the specific days you want to follow this habit (e.g., Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays).\n3. **Repeat for the jogging habit**: Edit the jogging habit and schedule it for Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\n**Habitica will automatically switch between habits:**\n\nOn days when you're not jogging, Habitica will display the Non-Jogging Morning Routine tasks. On jogging days, it will show the jogging routine tasks. This way, you can track your progress and stay consistent with your morning routine, even on days when your routine changes.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can create as many habits as you need to accommodate different routines or activities.\n* Use Habitica's tagging feature to organize your habits by category (e.g., \"Morning Routine,\" \"Workout,\" \"Study\") for easy tracking.\n* Don't forget to review and adjust your habits regularly to ensure they align with your changing needs and goals.\n\nBy setting up separate habits for different days, you can tailor your morning routine to fit your unique needs and stay consistent with your goals.
