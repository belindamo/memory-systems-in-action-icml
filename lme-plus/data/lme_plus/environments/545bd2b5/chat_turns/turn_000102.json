A 10x10 unit is a good size to hold a decent amount of items, and it's convenient that you already have it rented.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when using a storage unit to store items from the house:\n\n1. **Sort and purge before storing**: Try to sort through the items and get rid of anything that's broken, damaged, or no longer useful. This will save you space in the storage unit and make it easier to decide what to do with the remaining items.\n2. **Pack items carefully**: Make sure to pack items carefully to prevent damage during transport and storage. Use sturdy boxes, packing paper, and labels to keep things organized.\n3. **Label and inventory**: Label each box or item with its contents and keep an inventory of what's in the storage unit. This will make it easier to find things later and decide what to do with each item.\n4. **Store items by category**: Consider storing items by category, such as \"furniture,\" \"kitchen items,\" \"decorations,\" etc. This will make it easier to access what you need and make decisions about what to keep, donate, or sell.\n5. **Keep valuable or sensitive items separate**: If you have valuable or sensitive items, such as important documents, jewelry, or family heirlooms, consider storing them in a separate, secure area of the storage unit or in a safe deposit box.\n6. **Check the storage facility's rules**: Make sure to check the storage facility's rules and regulations regarding what can and can't be stored in the unit. Some facilities may have restrictions on certain items, such as hazardous materials or perishable goods.\n7. **Set a deadline**: Decide on a deadline for when you'll review the items in the storage unit and make decisions about what to do with them. This will help you avoid storing items indefinitely and keep the process moving forward.\n\nBy following these tips, a storage unit can be a great solution to temporarily store items from the house while you and your siblings figure out what to do with the property and its contents. Good luck with the process!",
