That's wonderful.\n\nNow, let's get organized and create a comprehensive guest list. Here's a simple, step-by-step approach to help you gather and prioritize your contacts:\n\n**Step 1: Brainstorming**\n\n* Take a few minutes to brainstorm all the people you'd like to invite to your dinner party. Write down names as they come to mind, including close friends, acquaintances, and anyone you've been meaning to catch up with.\n* Consider the occasion: Is this a special celebration or a casual get-together? This might influence your guest list.\n\n**Step 2: Categorize Your Contacts**\n\n* Create categories or groups to organize your contacts. For example:\n\t+ Close friends (inner circle)\n\t+ Social friends (people you regularly socialize with)\n\t+ Acquaintances (colleagues, neighbors, or people you'd like to get to know better)\n\t+ Significant others (partners, spouses, or plus-ones)\n\t+ Out-of-town friends (if you're planning a larger gathering or a special occasion)\n\n**Step 3: Review Your Contacts**\n\n* Go through your phone contacts, social media friends, and email contacts to ensure you haven't forgotten anyone.\n* Check your calendar and notes from past social events or gatherings to jog your memory.\n\n**Step 4: Prioritize Your Guest List**\n\n* Review your categorized list and prioritize guests based on importance and relationships. You may want to consider:\n\t+ How often you've seen or spoken to each person recently\n\t+ The significance of the occasion (e.g., a birthday or milestone celebration)\n\t+ The size of your dinner party and the number of guests you can accommodate\n\n**Step 5: Finalize Your Guest List**\n\n* Based on your priorities, finalize your guest list, making sure to include all the people you want to attend.\n* Be mindful of any plus-ones or significant others who should be invited.\n* Make sure to include any necessary details, such as dietary restrictions or special requests.\n\nTo ensure you don't forget anyone important, consider:\n\n* Creating a digital note or document with your guest list and categories\n* Setting reminders or notifications for upcoming events or birthdays\n* Regularly reviewing and updating your contacts to keep them organized and current\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a well-organized guest list and can focus on planning a memorable dinner party for your friends!\n\nRemember to enjoy the process, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance. Happy planning!"

Here are some tips to help you effectively use tags and notebooks in Evernote:\n\n**Notebooks:**\n\n1. **Create a \"Contacts\" Notebook:** Designate a notebook specifically for your contacts, where you'll store individual notes for each person.\n2. **Create Sub-Notebooks:** Within your \"Contacts\" notebook, create sub-notebooks for different categories, such as \"Close Friends,\" \"Social Friends,\" \"Acquaintances,\" or \"Colleagues.\" This will help you separate your contacts into distinct groups.\n3. **Event-Specific Notebooks:** Create separate notebooks for specific events, like \"Dinner Party\" or \"Birthday Party,\" to store notes, to-do lists, and reminders related to that event.\n\n**Tags:**\n\n1. **Use Tags for Categorization:** Assign relevant tags to each contact note, such as \"Close Friend,\" \"Social Friend,\" or \"Colleague.\" This allows you to quickly filter and find contacts within a specific category.\n2. **Use Tags for Events:** Create tags for specific events, like \"Dinner Party\" or \"Birthday Party,\" and apply them to relevant notes, to-do lists, and reminders.\n3. **Use Tags for Relationships:** Create tags for relationships, such as \"Mutual Friends\" or \"Family,\" to help you visualize connections between contacts.\n4. **Use Tags for Locations:** Create tags for locations, such as \"Local\" or \"Out-of-Town,\" to help you identify contacts based on their location.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use Note Links:** Create links between related notes, such as linking a contact note to a specific event note, to create a web of connected information.\n2. **Use Reminders:** Set reminders for upcoming events, birthdays, or anniversaries to ensure you stay on top of important dates.\n3. **Use Checklist:** Create checklists for events or tasks, like a to-do list for your dinner party, to help you stay organized.\n4. **Use Photos and Audio:** Attach photos or audio recordings to notes to add context and make them more engaging.\n5. **Search and Filter:** Use Evernote's powerful search function to find specific notes, tags, or keywords, and filter your notes by tag, notebook, or date.\n\nExample of a well-organized Evernote setup:\n\n* Notebook: \"Contacts\"\n\t+ Sub-Notebook: \"Close Friends\"\n\t\t- Note: \"Rachel\" (with tags \"Close Friend,\" \"Mutual Friends,\" and \"Local\")\n\t+ Sub-Notebook: \"Social Friends\"\n\t\t- Note: \"Emily\" (with tags \"Social Friend,\" \"Colleague,\" and \"Out-of-Town\")\n* Notebook: \"Dinner Party\"\n\t+ Note: \"Dinner Party Planning\" (with tags \"Dinner Party,\" \"To-Do List,\" and \"Reminders\")\n\t+ Note: \"Guest List\" (with tags \"Dinner Party,\" \"Guest List,\" and \"Close Friends\")\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to effectively use Evernote to categorize your contacts, keep track of events, and stay organized.
