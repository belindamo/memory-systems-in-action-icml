    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It depends on your preference and convenience. If you own snorkeling gear and feel comfortable using it, then you can bring it along with you. However, if you don't have your own gear or don't want to bring it with you, most snorkeling spots offer equipment rentals. Rental gear is usually of good quality but it's always a good idea to check beforehand. Make sure you try on the gear beforehand so that it fits properly and is comfortable. Additionally, some parks and tour operators may provide snorkeling gear as part of their tour packages."
