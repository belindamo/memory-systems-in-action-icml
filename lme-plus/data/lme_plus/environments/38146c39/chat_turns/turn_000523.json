In fact, frozen cherries are a great option because they're often picked at the peak of ripeness and flash-frozen, which helps preserve their flavor and texture.\n\nHere are a few tips for using frozen cherries:\n\n* Make sure to thaw the frozen cherries first by leaving them in room temperature for a few hours or by thawing them in the microwave according to the package instructions.\n* Pat the thawed cherries dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This will help prevent the clafoutis from becoming too soggy.\n* If your frozen cherries are particularly wet or icy, you might need to adjust the amount of sugar you use in the recipe. Frozen cherries can be more watery than fresh cherries, so you might need to reduce the sugar content to balance the flavor.\n* Frozen cherries can be more fragile than fresh cherries, so be gentle when mixing them with the sugar and flour to avoid crushing or mashing them.\n\nUsing frozen cherries will also affect the texture of the clafoutis slightly. The cherries might not hold their shape as well as fresh cherries, and they might release more juice during baking. However, this shouldn't affect the overall flavor and texture of the clafoutis.\n\nIn your case, since you have frozen cherries on hand, go ahead and use them! Just thaw and pat them dry according to the instructions above, and adjust the sugar content if needed. You'll still end up with a delicious and unique cherry clafoutis with the brown sugar, almond flour, and sliced almonds.\n\nI hope that helps! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Happy baking!",
