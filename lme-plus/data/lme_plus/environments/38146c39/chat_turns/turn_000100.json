  "content": "Based on the data provided, it is a fairly even matchup between Creighton and NC State. Creighton has a slightly better overall record and better shooting percentages, while NC State has a slightly better defense.\n\nHowever, as you mentioned earlier, upsets are common in March Madness. If you want to go with NC State as the underdog pick, that is certainly a possibility. It is worth noting that in the last 10 years of the tournament, a 6 seed has been upset by an 11 seed 7 times, so it is not out of the realm of possibility.",
