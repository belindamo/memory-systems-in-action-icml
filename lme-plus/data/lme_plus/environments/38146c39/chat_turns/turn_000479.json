I'd be happy to guide you through the US citizenship process and provide information on dual citizenship for Indians.\n\n**US Citizenship Process:**\n\nThe naturalization process involves several steps, which can take several months to a few years to complete. Here's an overview:\n\n1. **Determine Eligibility:** Your aunt must have been a lawful permanent resident (LPR) of the US for at least 5 years (or 3 years if married to a US citizen) and meet other eligibility requirements.\n2. **Prepare and Submit Form N-400:** Your aunt must fill out Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, and submit it to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) with required documents and fees.\n3. **Biometrics Appointment:** USCIS will schedule a biometrics appointment to collect fingerprints and other biometric data.\n4. **Naturalization Interview:** Your aunt will attend an interview with a USCIS officer to discuss her application, background, and civics knowledge.\n5. **English and Civics Test:** Your aunt will take an English proficiency test and a civics test on US history, government, and principles.\n6. **Oath of Allegiance:** If approved, your aunt will take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States, renouncing allegiance to any other country.\n7. **Naturalization Ceremony:** Your aunt will attend a naturalization ceremony, where she'll receive her Certificate of Naturalization, marking her official entry into US citizenship.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\nThe processing time for naturalization applications varies depending on the workload of USCIS and the complexity of the case. On average, the process takes around 6-12 months, but it can take longer in some cases.\n\n**Dual Citizenship for Indians:**\n\nIndia allows dual citizenship, but with certain restrictions. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) Card:** Indians who acquire foreign citizenship can apply for an OCI card, which allows them to live and work in India indefinitely.\n2. **Dual Citizenship:** India permits dual citizenship, but you must inform the Indian government about your foreign citizenship within six months of acquiring it.\n3. **Renunciation of Indian Passport:** If you're an Indian citizen and acquire foreign citizenship, you're required to surrender your Indian passport and obtain a Surrender Certificate from the Indian Embassy/Consulate.\n4. **Tax Implications:** Dual citizens may be subject to taxation in both countries. It's essential to understand the tax implications and comply with tax laws in both the US and India.\n5. **Travel Documents:** Dual citizens should carry valid travel documents, including a US passport and an OCI card or a valid Indian visa, when traveling to India.\n\nPlease note that dual citizenship laws and regulations can change, so it's essential to consult with the Indian Embassy/Consulate or a qualified immigration attorney for the most up-to-date information.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the US citizenship process and dual citizenship rules for Indians!",
