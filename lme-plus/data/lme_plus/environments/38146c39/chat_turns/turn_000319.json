  "content": "If you are a first-time snorkeler, I suggest checking out the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park in Key Largo. The reef is located just a few miles from the shore, which makes it easily accessible. This park is one of the most popular snorkeling spots in the Keys and the crystal clear waters offer great visibility to see the colorful marine life beneath the ocean. They also have guided snorkeling tours which are perfect for beginners, and the staff at the park is very experienced in helping first-timers get comfortable in the water. Have fun!",
