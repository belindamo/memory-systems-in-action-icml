  "content": "Based on the data provided, Creighton has a slightly better overall record and a higher winning percentage than NC State. However, NC State has a better field goal percentage and a higher number of rebounds per game. This could indicate that NC State has a stronger inside game and could potentially out-rebound Creighton. Ultimately, it's difficult to predict with certainty, but I would give a slight edge to Creighton.",
