New bikes can take some time to get used to, but it sounds like you're making progress and enjoying the ride.\n\nRemember to ask the mechanic at the bike shop about any specific questions or concerns you have about your bike's maintenance or performance. They can provide valuable insights and tips to help you get the most out of your ride.\n\nAlso, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance on bike maintenance or accessories. I'm here to help!\n\nHave a great ride, and I hope your bike tune-up goes smoothly!",
