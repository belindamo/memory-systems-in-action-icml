  "content": "While \"The Last Romantics\" is a literary fiction novel, it does have elements of magical realism and explores themes of family, love, and identity, which might pair interestingly with some of the fantasy and science fiction books I mentioned earlier.\n\nHere are a few pairing suggestions:\n\n1. **The Last Romantics** + **The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August**: Both novels explore themes of identity, family, and the consequences of extraordinary events. The magical realism in \"The Last Romantics\" might complement the time-traveling and reincarnation elements in \"Harry August\".\n2. **The Last Romantics** + **The Eyre Affair**: Both novels play with the idea of blurring the lines between reality and fiction. \"The Eyre Affair\" features a world where literature is alive, which might appeal to the literary and poetic elements in \"The Last Romantics\".\n3. **The Last Romantics** + **Good Omens**: While tonally different, both novels explore themes of family, love, and the power of relationships. The humorous and lighthearted tone of \"Good Omens\" might provide a nice contrast to the more introspective and emotional \"The Last Romantics\".\n\nThese pairings are just suggestions, but ultimately, the choice depends on your personal reading preferences. You might find that reading a fantasy or science fiction novel alongside \"The Last Romantics\" adds a new layer of depth or perspective to your reading experience.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to read what resonates with you and enjoy the journey!",
