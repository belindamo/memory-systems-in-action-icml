Your name and your parents' names (including mothers' maiden names).\n2. Your grandparents' names (paternal and maternal).\n3. Your great-grandparents' names (paternal and maternal), if you know them.\n4. Any other relatives you know, such as aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings.\n5. Any important dates, like birth, marriage, and death dates, if you have them.\n\nYou can also share any other information you think might be helpful, such as:\n\n* Nationalities or ethnicities of your ancestors\n* Places where your ancestors lived (cities, towns, countries)\n* Any notable events or stories about your ancestors\n* Photos or documents that might be useful for the tree\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a basic family tree. You can also use online tools like Ancestry.com, FamilySearch.org, or MyHeritage.com to build your tree, but we can get started here and then you can transfer the information to one of those platforms if you'd like.\n\nRemember, the more information you provide, the more detailed and accurate your family tree will be. Let's get started!",
