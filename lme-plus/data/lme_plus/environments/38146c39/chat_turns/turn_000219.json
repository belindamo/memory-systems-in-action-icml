Make sure the strings are still in good condition, and the frame is free from cracks or dents.\n\nIf you're not sure about the racket's condition or need help with inspecting it, you could consider taking it to a local tennis store or sports equipment shop for a professional assessment. They might be able to provide guidance on whether it's still suitable for play or recommend any necessary repairs or maintenance.\n\nOnce you've got your racket back and it's in good condition, you'll be ready to hit the courts with confidence. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further advice on preparing for your recreational tennis league adventure!",
