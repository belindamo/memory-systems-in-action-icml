Client-side data collection relies on browser-based JavaScript, while server-side data collection relies on server-side languages like PHP.\n2. **Data accuracy**: Server-side tracking can be more accurate as it is less affected by ad-blockers, browser extensions, or JavaScript errors that may prevent client-side tracking from working properly.\n3. **Data availability**: Client-side tracking captures user interactions with the website in real-time, such as clicks, scrolls, or form submissions, which are not available with server-side tracking. On the other hand, server-side tracking can capture data not available on the client-side, such as server response times or backend events.\n4. **User identification**: Client-side tracking uses cookies or local storage to identify and track users across sessions. Server-side tracking often relies on unique identifiers, such as user IDs or session IDs, passed from the server to GA4",
