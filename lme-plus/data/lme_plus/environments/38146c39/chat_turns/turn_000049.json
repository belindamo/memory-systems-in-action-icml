  "content": "Let's start with what you have so far. Here's a basic family tree with the names you've provided:\n\n**You**\n\n* Parents:\n\t+ Father: John\n\t+ Mother: Mary\n\n**John's side**\n\n* Grandparents:\n\t+ Grandfather: James\n\t+ Grandmother: Elizabeth\n\n**Mary's side**\n\n* Grandparents:\n\t+ Grandfather: Michael\n\t+ Grandmother: Patricia\n\nAs you gather more information, we can add more relatives to the tree. You can share the names of your aunts, uncles, and cousins as you remember them, and I'll help you organize them accordingly.\n\nHere's a suggestion to help you gather more information:\n\n1. Start by making a list of your aunts and uncles on both your dad's and mom's sides. Write down their names, and if you know, their spouses' names and children (your cousins).\n2. Next, try to gather information about your great-aunts and great-uncles (the siblings of your grandparents). This can help you expand your tree further.\n3. If you have any older relatives, consider asking them about your family history. They may have valuable information and stories to share.\n4. Look for any family documents, such as birth certificates, marriage certificates, or old photos, that can provide clues about your ancestors.\n\nFeel free to share any new information as you gather it, and I'll help you add it to your family tree.",
