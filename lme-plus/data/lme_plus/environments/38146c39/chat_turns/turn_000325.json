  "content": "Energy balls are a fantastic snack for workouts, and they're incredibly easy to make at home. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**No-Bake Energy Balls Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups rolled oats\n* 1 cup creamy peanut butter (or any nut butter you prefer)\n* 1/2 cup honey (or maple syrup)\n* 1/2 cup chia seeds\n* 1/4 cup chopped nuts (optional: walnuts, almonds, or pecans)\n* Pinch of salt\n* Optional: vanilla extract, cinnamon, or other spices to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, peanut butter, and honey. Mix until well combined and a dough forms.\n2. Stir in the chia seeds, chopped nuts (if using), and salt until they're evenly distributed throughout the mixture.\n3. If desired, add a pinch of vanilla extract, cinnamon, or other spices to give the energy balls a flavor boost.\n4. Use your hands or a small cookie scoop to shape the mixture into small balls, about 1-inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. You should end up with around 12-15 energy balls.\n5. Place the energy balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set.\n6. Once set, store the energy balls in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 2 months.\n\nTips:\n\n* You can customize the recipe by using different nut butters, seeds, or spices to suit your taste preferences.\n* If the mixture is too sticky, add a bit more oats. If it's too dry, add a bit more honey.\n* Energy balls are best consumed within a few days of making them, as they can become too soft or crumbly if stored for too long.\n* You can also make these energy balls in advance and freeze them individually in an airtight container or plastic bag. Simply thaw at room temperature or in the fridge when you're ready to snack.\n\nEach energy ball (approx. 1-inch diameter) contains:\n\n* Calories: 120-140\n* Protein: 2-3g\n* Fat: 7-8g\n* Carbohydrates: 15-18g\n* Fiber: 2-3g\n\nEnjoy your homemade energy balls and happy snacking!",
