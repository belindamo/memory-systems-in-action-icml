They're easy to pack and can be easily stowed away in your backpack.\n2. **Travel-sized books**: Look for travel-sized editions of your favorite books or classics. They're designed to be compact and lightweight.\n3. **E-reader**: If you have an e-reader, it's a great option for camping. You can store multiple books on it, and it's much lighter than carrying physical books.\n\n**Games:**\n\n1. **Cards**: A deck of cards is a classic camping entertainment option. You can play games like poker, blackjack, or even solitaire.\n2. **Travel-sized board games**: Look for travel-sized versions of your favorite board games, like chess, checkers, or Scrabble.\n3. **Portable puzzles**: Bring a portable puzzle book, like a crossword or Sudoku, to keep your mind engaged.\n\n**Other options:**\n\n1. **Journal or sketchbook**: Bring a journal or sketchbook to record your camping adventures, write poetry, or sketch the beautiful scenery.\n2. **Music**: Pack a portable speaker or a guitar (if you play) to enjoy some tunes around the campsite.\n3. **Star gazing guide**: If you're camping in an area with minimal light pollution, bring a star gazing guide to identify constellations and learn about the night sky.\n\nRemember to pack these items in waterproof bags or containers to keep them dry and protected from the elements.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you more of a bookworm, a game enthusiast, or a stargazer?",
