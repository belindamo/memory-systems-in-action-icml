To achieve this, you can use Google Tag Manager (GTM) for client-side tracking and GA4's Measurement Protocol API for server-side tracking.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the steps you need to follow:\n\n1. **Client-side tracking**: Set up Google Tag Manager on your website, and configure tags and triggers for various events you want to track. Use the GA4 Configuration tag to connect your GTM container with your GA4 property.\n2. **Server-side tracking**: Implement server-side tracking in your WordPress site using GA4's Measurement Protocol API. This involves sending HTTP requests to GA4's endpoint with the appropriate event data. You can refer to the PHP code provided in the previous response for sending GA4 events from the server-side.\n\nWhen you send data from both client-side and server-side, ensure that you're using the same GA4 property measurement ID. This way, all the data will be sent to the same GA4 property, allowing you to analyze both client-side and server-side events in a single location.\n\nKeep in mind that the data collected from client-side and server-side might have some differences in terms of accuracy, user identification, and availability. However, by using both methods together, you can get a more comprehensive view of user interactions and server events for your website.",
