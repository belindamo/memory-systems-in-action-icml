  "content": "That's a great lead! Yes, it would be extremely helpful to get in touch with your aunt and ask about the documents she found. Old family documents can be a treasure trove of information, providing valuable clues about your ancestors' lives, relationships, and migration patterns.\n\nSome potential documents your aunt might have found include:\n\n1. Birth, marriage, and death certificates\n2. Family Bibles or other historical records\n3. Immigration and naturalization papers\n4. Military records or discharge papers\n5. Wills, deeds, or land records\n6. Old photographs with names and dates\n7. Letters, diaries, or journals\n8. Family trees or genealogy research notes from previous generations\n\nAsk your aunt if she's willing to share the documents with you, either digitally or in person. You can also ask her about her research process and what she's learned so far. This can help you avoid duplicating her efforts and build upon her findings.\n\nSome questions to ask your aunt:\n\n* What kind of documents did she find, and what information do they contain?\n* Are the documents originals or copies? If copies, do she know where the originals are?\n* Did she transcribe or scan the documents? If so, can she share the transcriptions or scans with you?\n* Has she researched or organized the information from the documents, or is it still in its raw form?\n* Are there any specific ancestors or time periods that the documents focus on?\n* Does she have any theories or leads that she's been exploring?\n\nBy tapping into your aunt's research and resources, you can accelerate your own genealogical journey and gain a deeper understanding of your family's history.",
