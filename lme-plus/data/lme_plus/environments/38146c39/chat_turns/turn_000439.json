Building simple parts like machine gun barrels and aircraft antennas is an excellent way to start, and it's wonderful that you're already seeing the benefits.\n\nScratch-building can be a game-changer for modelers, especially when it comes to adding unique details that set your model apart from others. By creating your own parts, you can ensure that they're accurate, proportionate, and tailored to your specific model.\n\nAs you continue to hone your scratch-building skills, you'll find that it becomes easier to tackle more complex projects. Don't be afraid to experiment with different materials and techniques, and don't be too hard on yourself if things don't turn out as planned initially. It's all part of the learning process, and the more you practice, the better you'll become.\n\nRemember, scratch-building is not only about creating accurate parts but also about having fun and enjoying the process. It's a great way to express your creativity and add a personal touch to your models.\n\nKeep practicing, and I'm sure your USS Iowa model will turn out to be an absolute stunner!
