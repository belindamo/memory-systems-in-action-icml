  "content": "The success of Bambi demonstrated that audiences were capable of emotionally connecting with animated characters and that animated films did not have to solely rely on humor and entertainment. As a result, the success of Bambi influenced the decision to create more emotionally complex animated films in the future, incorporating themes such as loss, love, and personal growth. This led to the creation of films such as The Lion King, Toy Story, Up, and Inside Out, all of which explore deeper themes and emotions than previous animated films had.",
