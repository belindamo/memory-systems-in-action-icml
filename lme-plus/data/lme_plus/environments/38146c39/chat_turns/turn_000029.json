  "content": "**Higher Floor Rooms and Views:**\n\nIn general, higher floor rooms tend to offer better views, but it's not always the case. The view from a higher floor room can be obstructed by other buildings, trees, or even the hotel's own architecture. However, at the hotels I mentioned earlier, higher floor rooms generally offer more expansive views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains.\n\nHere's a rough guide to what you can expect from each hotel:\n\n* **The Edgewater Hotel**: Higher floor rooms (floors 5-10) offer stunning views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. Lower floor rooms (floors 1-4) may have partial views or views of the surrounding buildings.\n* **Four Seasons Hotel Seattle**: Higher floor rooms (floors 10-20) offer panoramic views of the city, Puget Sound, and the Olympic Mountains. Lower floor rooms (floors 1-9) may have partial views or views of the surrounding buildings.\n* **The Alexis Hotel**: Higher floor rooms (floors 10-16) offer views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains. Lower floor rooms (floors 1-9) may have partial views or views of the surrounding buildings.\n* **Hyatt at Olive 8**: Higher floor rooms (floors 10-15) offer views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains. Lower floor rooms (floors 1-9) may have partial views or views of the surrounding buildings.\n* **Pan Pacific Hotel Seattle**: Higher floor rooms (floors 10-20) offer views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains. Lower floor rooms (floors 1-9) may have partial views or views of the surrounding buildings.\n* **The Sheraton Seattle Hotel**: Higher floor rooms (floors 10-25) offer views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains. Lower floor rooms (floors 1-9) may have partial views or views of the surrounding buildings.\n* **Hotel Andra**: Higher floor rooms (floors 5-10) offer views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains. Lower floor rooms (floors 1-4) may have partial views or views of the surrounding buildings.\n\n**Balcony Rooms:**\n\nSome rooms at these hotels do come with balconies, which can be a great way to take in the views. Here's a rough guide to what you can expect:\n\n* **The Edgewater Hotel**: Some rooms on floors 5-10 have balconies with stunning views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains.\n* **Four Seasons Hotel Seattle**: Some rooms on floors 10-20 have balconies with panoramic views of the city, Puget Sound, and the Olympic Mountains.\n* **The Alexis Hotel**: Some rooms on floors 10-16 have balconies with views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains.\n* **Hyatt at Olive 8**: Some rooms on floors 10-15 have balconies with views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains.\n* **Pan Pacific Hotel Seattle**: Some rooms on floors 10-20 have balconies with views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains.\n* **The Sheraton Seattle Hotel**: Some rooms on floors 10-25 have balconies with views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains.\n* **Hotel Andra**: Some rooms on floors 5-10 have balconies with views of the city, Puget Sound, or the Olympic Mountains.\n\nKeep in mind that balcony rooms may come with an additional fee, and availability can be limited. Be sure to check with the hotel directly for availability and pricing.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect room with a view!",
