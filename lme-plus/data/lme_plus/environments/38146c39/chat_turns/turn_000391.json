  "content": "What a great idea! Creating a \"To-Scan\" folder is a fantastic way to keep track of physical documents that need to be scanned and digitized. This will help you stay organized and ensure that you don't forget to digitize important documents.\n\nHere's an updated folder structure that incorporates the \"To-Scan\" folder:\n\n**Top-Level Folders**\n\n* Personal\n* Financial\n* Work\n* Taxes\n* Receipts\n* Insurance\n* Someday/Archive\n* To-Scan\n\n**To-Scan Folder**\n\n* Physical documents that need to be scanned and digitized, such as:\n\t+ Paper receipts\n\t+ Bank statements\n\t+ Insurance documents\n\t+ Identification documents\n\t+ Contracts\n\nBy having a dedicated folder for documents that need to be scanned, you can:\n\n* Keep track of what needs to be scanned and digitized\n* Ensure that you don't forget to digitize important documents\n* Prioritize scanning and digitization tasks\n* Easily find and access the documents that need to be scanned\n\nOnce you've scanned and digitized the documents, you can move them to their respective folders (e.g., Financial, Insurance, etc.) and delete the physical copies.\n\nRemember to also consider the following:\n\n* Make sure you have a reliable scanner and a good scanning software to ensure high-quality digital copies.\n* Consider using a cloud storage service to store your digitized documents, so you can access them from anywhere and have a backup in case of a disaster.\n* Set reminders or schedule regular scanning sessions to stay on top of digitizing your documents.\n\nBy implementing this system, you'll be able to keep your physical and digital documents organized, and ensure that you have easy access to the information you need.",
