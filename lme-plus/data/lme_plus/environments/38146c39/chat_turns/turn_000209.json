Beaujolais: This light-bodied red wine pairs well with a variety of dishes, including coq au vin, beef stew, and roasted chicken.\n\n2. Burgundy (Pinot Noir): This medium-bodied red wine is perfect for rich and complex dishes, such as beef bourguignon or duck confit.\n\n3. Bordeaux: This full-bodied red wine is essential for serving with steak, especially with the classic French dish, entrecote (rib-eye steak).\n\n4. Champagne: This sparkling wine pairs well with many French dishes, such as escargots, salmon, and even desserts such as chocolate cake.\n\n5. Chablis: This light and mineral white wine pairs well with seafood dishes such as bouillabaisse or oysters.\n\n6.
