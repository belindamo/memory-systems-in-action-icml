As a large language model, I don't have specific knowledge about individual museums, but I can give you some general insights.\n\nMany museums, especially contemporary art museums, often have a caf\u00e9 or restaurant on site that offers a range of food and beverage options. These cafes might serve everything from light snacks and coffee to full meals and even fine dining experiences.\n\nTo confirm whether the Contemporary Art Museum you're visiting has a caf\u00e9 or restaurant, I would recommend:\n\n1. **Checking the museum's website**: Look for a section on \"Dining\" or \"Caf\u00e9\" on the museum's website. They might have a page that lists their dining options, hours of operation, and menus.\n2. **Social media**: Check the museum's social media accounts to see if they post about their caf\u00e9 or restaurant, including any special promotions or events.\n3. **Call the museum**: If you can't find the information online, you can always call the museum's information desk to ask about their dining options.\n\nIt's always a good idea to plan ahead and check the caf\u00e9 or restaurant's hours of operation, as they might be different from the museum's regular hours. You might also want to consider making a reservation if you're planning to eat during a peak time or if you have a large group.\n\nEnjoy your visit and your meal!",
