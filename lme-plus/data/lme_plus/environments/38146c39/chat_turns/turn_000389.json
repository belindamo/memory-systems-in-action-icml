  "content": "What a fantastic suggestion! Creating a \"Someday\" or \"Archive\" folder is an excellent way to store documents that don't have a specific deadline or expiration date. This can help keep your main folders organized and clutter-free, making it easier to find the documents you need when you need them.\n\nHere's an updated folder structure that incorporates the \"Someday\" or \"Archive\" folder:\n\n**Top-Level Folders**\n\n* Personal\n* Financial\n* Work\n* Taxes\n* Receipts\n* Insurance\n* Someday/Archive\n\n**Someday/Archive Folder**\n\n* Documents that don't have a specific deadline or expiration date, such as:\n\t+ Old tax returns\n\t+ Historical financial documents\n\t+ Memorabilia (e.g., certificates, awards)\n\t+ Reference materials (e.g., user manuals, instructions)\n\nBy having a dedicated folder for these types of documents, you can keep them organized and out of the way, while still making them easily accessible when needed.\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider creating subfolders within the \"Someday/Archive\" folder to further categorize these documents. For example:\n\n**Someday/Archive Folder**\n\n* Historical Financial Documents\n\t+ Old bank statements\n\t+ Closed credit card accounts\n\t+ Loan documents\n* Memorabilia\n\t+ Certificates\n\t+ Awards\n\t+ Diplomas\n* Reference Materials\n\t+ User manuals\n\t+ Instructions\n\t+ Tutorials\n\nThis way, you can still keep these documents organized and easily find them when needed, while keeping your main folders focused on current and active documents.\n\nThanks for the suggestion!",
