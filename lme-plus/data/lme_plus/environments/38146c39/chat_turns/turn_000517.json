  "content": "You can definitely substitute granulated sugar with brown sugar in the cherry clafoutis recipe, but it will affect the flavor and texture of the dish. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Flavor:**\n\n* Brown sugar will give the clafoutis a richer, deeper flavor with notes of caramel and molasses. This can complement the sweetness of the cherries nicely.\n* The flavor will be slightly more complex and nuanced compared to using granulated sugar.\n\n**Texture:**\n\n* Brown sugar contains more moisture than granulated sugar, which can affect the texture of the clafoutis.\n* The batter might be slightly more dense and moist, which can result in a slightly heavier or more cake-like texture.\n* The clafoutis might not puff up as much as it would with granulated sugar, but it will still be delicious and tender.\n\n**Tips for using brown sugar:**\n\n* If you decide to use brown sugar, use a light brown sugar (not dark brown sugar) to avoid overpowering the cherries.\n* Reduce the amount of brown sugar to 1 1/4 cups, as it's slightly sweeter than granulated sugar.\n* Keep an eye on the clafoutis while it's baking, as the brown sugar can make it more prone to browning. You might need to cover the top with foil during the last 10-15 minutes of baking to prevent over-browning.\n\nIn summary, using brown sugar will give your cherry clafoutis a unique flavor and texture, but it's definitely worth trying. Just be aware of the potential differences and adjust the recipe accordingly. If you're looking for a more traditional French clafoutis flavor, stick with granulated sugar. But if you want to add a twist to the recipe, brown sugar can be a great option!",
