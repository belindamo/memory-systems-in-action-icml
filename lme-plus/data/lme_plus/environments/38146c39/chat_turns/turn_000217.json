Consider the following:\n\t* Is your racket still in good condition, or is it showing signs of wear and tear?\n\t* Is the racket suitable for your skill level and playing style?\n\t* Does it provide the right amount of power, control, and feel for your shots?\n\nIf you're unsure or your racket is outdated, consider investing in a new one. You don't need to break the bank, but a good-quality racket can make a significant difference in your game.\n\n2. **Tennis balls:** It's always a good idea to have a few cans of new tennis balls on hand. Tennis balls can become worn out and lose their bounce over time, affecting the quality of your game. Consider buying a few cans of high-quality tennis balls specifically designed for recreational play.\n3. **Comfortable clothing and shoes:** Make sure you have comfortable, breathable clothing and tennis shoes that provide good support and traction on the court. You've already got new running shoes, but if you plan to play tennis regularly, consider investing in tennis-specific shoes.\n4. **Other accessories:** You might also consider getting a tennis bag, water bottle, and towel to complete your tennis gear.\n\nBefore making any purchases, you can:\n\n* Borrow a racket from a friend or the park's tennis center to try out different models and see what feels comfortable for you.\n* Ask the park's tennis staff or a coach for recommendations on tennis gear and equipment.\n* Read online reviews and do research to find the best value for your budget.\n\nRemember, you don't need to invest in top-of-the-line gear to enjoy playing tennis. Focus on finding equipment that feels comfortable and suits your playing style, and you'll be ready to hit the courts with confidence!",
