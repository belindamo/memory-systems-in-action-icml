  "content": "**Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)**: Yes, using gochugaru is an excellent idea! Gochugaru is a key ingredient in many Korean dishes, including bulgogi, and it will give your dish a distinctive spicy kick. Gochugaru has a unique flavor profile that's both spicy and slightly sweet, which pairs well with the savory flavors of bulgogi.\n\nWhen using gochugaru, keep in mind:\n\n* Start with a small amount (about 1/4 teaspoon) and adjust to taste, as gochugaru can be quite spicy.\n* Mix gochugaru with other ingredients, like soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and sugar, to create a balanced flavor profile.\n* Use a high-quality gochugaru that's fresh and aromatic, as this will affect the flavor and heat level of your dish.\n\n**Meat selection for bulgogi**: For bulgogi, you can use various types of beef, but here are some popular options:\n\n* **Ribeye**: A popular choice for bulgogi, ribeye is tender, juicy, and has a good balance of marbling (fat content). This makes it perfect for grilling or pan-frying.\n* **Sirloin**: Sirloin is another popular option, offering a leaner cut of beef with a slightly firmer texture. It's a great choice if you prefer a slightly less fatty bulgogi.\n* **Flank steak**: Flank steak is a leaner cut, making it a great option for those who prefer less fat. It's also a great choice if you want to achieve a more tender and juicy texture.\n\nWhen selecting meat, look for:\n\n* Freshness: Choose meat that's fresh and has a good color.\n* Marbling: A moderate amount of marbling (fat content) is desirable, as it adds flavor and tenderness.\n* Thickness: Opt for thinly sliced meat (about 1/4 inch or 6 mm) to ensure even cooking and a tender texture.\n\n**Tips for working with gochugaru and meat**:\n\n* When marinating, make sure to coat the meat evenly with the marinade, and let it sit for at least 2 hours or overnight for maximum flavor penetration.\n* When cooking, cook the meat to your desired level of doneness. For bulgogi, it's common to cook the meat to a medium-rare or medium temperature to preserve the tenderness and juiciness.\n* Don't overcook the meat, as this can make it tough and dry.\n\nBy experimenting with gochugaru and different types of meat, you'll be well on your way to recreating the flavorful and spicy bulgogi and spicy pork tacos you enjoyed at Hwang's Kitchen!",
