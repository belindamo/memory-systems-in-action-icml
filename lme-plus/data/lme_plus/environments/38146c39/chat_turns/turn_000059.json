  "content": "Congratulations on your sister's upcoming wedding! I'd be happy to help you find a great neighborhood to live in with your partner.\n\nHowever, I need a bit more information to give you personalized suggestions. Could you please tell me:\n\n1. Which city are you planning to move to?\n2. What type of lifestyle are you and your partner looking for? (e.g. urban, suburban, quiet, vibrant, close to nature, etc.)\n3. What's your budget for housing and living expenses?\n4. Are there any specific amenities or features you're looking for in a neighborhood (e.g. parks, public transportation, restaurants, gyms, etc.)?\n5. Do you have any preferences for the type of housing you're looking for (e.g. apartment, house, condo, etc.)?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your preferences, I can suggest some popular neighborhoods in the city that would be a great fit for you and your partner.\n\nAnd don't worry, I'll make sure to take into account your deadline of finalizing the move before your sister's wedding on June 15th!",
