But I can suggest a few ways for you to find out about special exhibits or events that might be happening during your visit.\n\n1. **Check the museum's website**: The Contemporary Art Museum's website should have a section on current and upcoming exhibits, as well as a calendar of events. You can check their website to see if they have any special exhibits or events planned for the weekend you're visiting.\n2. **Social media**: Follow the museum's social media accounts (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) to see if they've posted any updates about upcoming events or exhibits.\n3. **Contact the museum directly**: You can call or email the museum's information desk to ask about any special exhibits or events happening during your visit.
