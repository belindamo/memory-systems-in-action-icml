  "content": "Yeah, I've been reading more about the topics I've been learning about in the museums. Like, after the dinosaur exhibit, I started reading about different species and their habitats. And after the archaeology lecture, I read more about ancient cultures and their daily lives. \n\nI'm also looking forward to exploring more exhibits on modern and contemporary art. The photography exhibit at the Contemporary Art Museum is actually what got me interested in photography, and I've been thinking about taking a photography class or workshop to learn more.\n\nDo you think museums often offer classes or workshops like that? Or would I need to look elsewhere for something like that?",
