  "content": "The NRPA and IPEMA do not provide specific images of playground sign design standards, but they do offer guidelines and resources for playground signage design.\n\nThe NRPA has a publication called \"Playground Safety Inspections and Maintenance\" which includes information on the recommended types of signs and messages to post in and around playgrounds. The publication also includes guidance on the placement and design of signs to maximize their visibility and effectiveness.\n\nSimilarly, IPEMA has a \"Public Playground Safety Guidelines\" document that includes guidance on playground signage design, including recommendations for the use of symbols, colors, and language.\n\nWhile these resources do not provide specific images of playground sign designs, they can be helpful in providing guidance on how to create effective playground signage that meets industry standards for safety and accessibility. You may also be able to find examples of playground signage design that adhere to these guidelines by searching online or looking at other parks in your area.",
