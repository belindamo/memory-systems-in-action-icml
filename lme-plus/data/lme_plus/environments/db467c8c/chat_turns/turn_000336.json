I'd be happy to help you track your cashback earnings across multiple apps and credit card rewards.\n\nHere are a few methods to consider:\n\n1. **Spreadsheets:** Create a spreadsheet using Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to track your cashback earnings. Set up separate columns for each app or credit card, and update the spreadsheet regularly. This method is free and customizable, but it requires manual input.\n2. **Budgeting apps:** Utilize a budgeting app like Mint, Personal Capital, or YNAB (You Need a Budget) to track your cashback earnings. These apps often allow you to link your credit cards and some cashback apps, making it easier to monitor your rewards. Some budgeting apps may have a free version or a free trial, but premium features might require a subscription.\n3. **Cashback tracking apps:** Consider using a dedicated cashback tracking app like:\n\t* **Cashback Tracker** (iOS, Android): A simple app for tracking cashback rewards across multiple apps and credit cards.\n\t* **Reward Wallet** (iOS, Android): A comprehensive app that allows you to track cashback, discounts, and rewards from various sources.\n\t* **Savvy** (iOS, Android): A cashback tracking app that also provides personalized offers and deals.\n4. **Digital note-taking apps:** Use a digital note-taking app like Evernote, OneNote, or Simplenote to keep a running log of your cashback earnings. Create a separate note or section for each app or credit card, and update it regularly. This method is free and flexible, but requires manual input.\n5. **Physical notebook or binder:** If you prefer a more analog approach, use a physical notebook or binder to track your cashback earnings. This method is low-tech and free, but might require more effort to maintain.\n\nTo make tracking easier, consider the following tips:\n\n* Set reminders to update your tracker regularly, such as weekly or bi-weekly.\n* Take screenshots or save confirmations of your cashback earnings for reference.\n* Organize your apps and credit cards alphabetically or by category to simplify tracking.\n* Consider setting up a specific email folder or label for cashback notifications to keep them organized.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you and your style. Remember to stay consistent, and you'll be enjoying your cashback rewards in no time!",
