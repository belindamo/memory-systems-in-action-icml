  "content": "Al-Qaeda is a militant Islamist organization that emerged in the 1980s and gained global notoriety for carrying out terrorist attacks against civilian targets around the world. The organization's use of violence against civilizations was a central part of its strategy to achieve political aims in the 1980s and beyond.\n\nAl-Qaeda's primary goal was to establish a global Islamic caliphate, and it believed that violence against civilians and other targets was a legitimate means of achieving this aim. In the 1980s, Al-Qaeda focused its efforts on supporting Islamist militant groups in various countries, including Afghanistan, Egypt, and Sudan.\n\nOne of Al-Qaeda's most significant acts of violence during this period was the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed over 200 people and injured thousands more. This attack was part of a broader campaign by Al-Qaeda against the United States, which the organization viewed as a primary enemy due to its support for Israel and its military presence in the Middle East.\n\nAl-Qaeda also carried out a number of other attacks against civilian targets during the 1980s and 1990s, including the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City and the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.\n\nAl-Qaeda's use of violence against civilizations was intended to create fear and disrupt the social and economic fabric of societies, with the aim of forcing governments to change their policies or withdraw their support for certain causes. The organization also sought to recruit new members and gain support by portraying itself as a defender of Islam against Western aggression.\n\nOverall, Al-Qaeda's use of violence against civilizations in the 1980s and beyond was a key part of its strategy to achieve political aims and establish a global Islamic caliphate, and had a profound impact on global politics and security.",
