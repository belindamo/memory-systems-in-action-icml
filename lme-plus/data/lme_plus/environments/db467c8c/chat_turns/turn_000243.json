  "content": "After Kothe's guilt had been established, the tribe was filled with outrage at his actions and the betrayal of his own brother. The tribe's leaders gathered to determine a fitting punishment for his crime, which they ultimately decided would be exile.\n\nBefore being exiled, Kothe would undergo a shaming ritual to publicly acknowledge his wrongdoing and the harm he had caused the tribe. The ritual would take place in front of the entire tribe, and would involve several steps:\n\n1. Kothe would be stripped of all his possessions, including his clothes, weapons, and any other items he had with him. He would then be painted with red ochre, a symbol of shame.\n2. A circle would be drawn on the ground, and Kothe would be forced to stand inside it while the rest of the tribe gathered around him. The circle represented the boundaries of the tribe, and his standing inside it symbolized his being cast out.\n3. One by one, members of the tribe would step forward to publicly shame Kothe, expressing their anger and disappointment at his actions. They would recount how he had betrayed their trust and the trust of his own family.\n4. During this time, Kothe would be expected to remain silent and accept the criticism without responding or defending himself.\n5. Once all members of the tribe had spoken, Kothe would be given a staff and a small bundle of supplies, and would be forced to leave the tribe's territory, never to return. His staff would be marked with a symbol of shame, indicating to anyone who saw him that he had been cast out.\n\nThe shaming ritual was intended to serve as a warning to others in the tribe that actions such as Kothe's would not be tolerated, and to ensure that he left with a deep sense of the harm he had caused. Though it was a painful and humiliating experience, it was seen as necessary to maintain the tribe's honor and unity.",
