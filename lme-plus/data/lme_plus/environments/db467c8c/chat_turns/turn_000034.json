Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Salmon** (): A great choice for beginners, salmon is relatively easy to work with, and its fatty acid content makes it less prone to drying out.\n2. **Tuna** (): A classic sushi choice, tuna is another popular option for beginners. Look for \"sushi-grade\" or \"sashimi-grade\" tuna, as it's usually of higher quality.\n3. **Yellowtail** (): A mild-flavored fish, yellowtail is a good option for those new to making sushi. It's relatively easy to handle and has a smooth texture.\n4. **Cucumber rolls**: If you're feeling uncertain about working with raw fish, consider making cucumber rolls instead. They're a great option for beginners and are always a hit!\n\nWhen selecting fish, make sure to:\n\n1. Buy from a reputable fish market or a high-end grocery store with a good seafood department.\n2. Look for fish with a pleasant smell, firm texture, and a glossy appearance.\n3. Check the packaging for \"sushi-grade\" or \"sashimi-grade\" labels.\n4.
