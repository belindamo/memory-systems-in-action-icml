It's essential to understand the waiver of inadmissibility process and how it might apply to your parents' situation, given their nine-month overstay.\n\nWhen you meet with the attorney, be prepared to discuss the following:\n\n1. **The waiver of inadmissibility process**: Ask the attorney to explain the process in detail, including the requirements, eligibility, and potential outcomes.\n2. **Extreme hardship**: Discuss how the attorney plans to demonstrate extreme hardship to a qualifying relative (you) in the event of your parents' removal from the United States.\n3. **Rehabilitation**: Ask the attorney how they plan to demonstrate your parents' rehabilitation and how they have taken steps to rectify their immigration status.\n4. **Supporting evidence**: Discuss the types of supporting evidence that will be required to demonstrate extreme hardship and rehabilitation, such as:\n\t* Medical records\n\t* Financial documents\n\t* Letters from family members and friends\n\t* Evidence of community ties\n5. **Waiver application strategy**: Ask the attorney about their strategy for preparing and submitting the waiver application, including:\n\t* How they will present your parents' case in the best possible light\n\t* How they will address any potential weaknesses in the application\n\t* How they will respond to any requests for evidence (RFEs) or notices of intent to deny (NOIDs)\n6. **Timeline and fees**: Ask the attorney about the expected timeline for the waiver process and their fees for representing your parents.\n\nSome specific questions to ask the attorney during the consultation include:\n\n* What are the chances of success for a waiver of inadmissibility in my parents' case?\n* How will you demonstrate extreme hardship to me, as their qualifying relative?\n* What types of supporting evidence will be required to demonstrate rehabilitation?\n* How will you address any potential issues with my parents' immigration history, such as their nine-month overstay?\n* What is your strategy for preparing and submitting the waiver application?\n* What are your fees for representing my parents, and what services are included in your representation?\n\nBy asking these questions and discussing your parents' situation with the attorney, you'll get a better understanding of the waiver of inadmissibility process and how it might apply to their case.",
