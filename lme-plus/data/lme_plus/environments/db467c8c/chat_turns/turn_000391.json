  "content": "I think I'll find spinning to be a great change of pace from Zumba. I love the high-energy atmosphere of Zumba, but spinning seems like a more intense, focused workout. I'm excited to challenge myself and see how my body adapts to the different movements and pace. Plus, it'll be nice to have a low-impact workout option to balance out the higher-impact movements in Zumba. Do you have any tips on how to stay motivated and track my progress in spinning class?",
