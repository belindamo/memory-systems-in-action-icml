  "content": "That's awesome! Taking a cooking class is a great way to learn new skills, gain confidence in the kitchen, and discover new recipes and techniques. It's even more beneficial that you're applying what you learn to your meal prep, which will help you stay consistent and motivated.\n\nWednesday evenings must be a highlight of your week! What kind of cooking class are you taking? Is it focused on a specific cuisine, cooking technique, or dietary style (e.g., vegan, gluten-free)? Have you learned any new recipes or techniques that you're particularly excited about?\n\nSharing your experiences and learning from others can be really helpful, so feel free to share more about your cooking class adventures!",
