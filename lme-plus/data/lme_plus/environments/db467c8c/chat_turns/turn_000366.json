It's essential to find an attorney who has experience with similar cases and can provide guidance on addressing the potential issues with your parents' overstaying their visa.\n\nWhen you meet with the attorney, be prepared to discuss the following:\n\n1. **Your parents' immigration history**: Share details about their entry into the United States, their visa type, and how long they've overstayed (nine months).\n2. **Your concerns**: Express your concerns about the potential consequences of their overstaying, such as:\n\t* Inadmissibility due to unlawful presence\n\t* Bars to re-entry\n\t* Impact on your own immigration status or future applications\n3. **Your goals**: Explain your goal of obtaining a green card and how you'd like to address the issue with your parents' overstaying in a way that minimizes potential harm to your own application.\n4. **Attorney's experience**: Ask the attorney about their experience with similar cases, such as:\n\t* How many cases have they handled involving overstaying parents or family members?\n\t* What were the outcomes of those cases?\n\t* How do they plan to address the specific challenges in your case?\n5. **Potential solutions**: Discuss potential solutions with the attorney, such as:\n\t* Filing for a waiver of inadmissibility (Form I-601 or I-601A)\n\t* Exploring alternative immigration options for your parents\n\t* Addressing any other immigration-related issues that may arise\n6. **Strategy and approach**: Ask the attorney to outline their strategy for addressing your parents' situation and how they plan to help you navigate the complexities of the green card application process.\n\nSome specific questions to ask the attorney during the consultation include:\n\n* How will you address the issue of my parents' overstaying, given their nine-month stay?\n* What are the potential consequences of their overstaying, and how can we mitigate them?\n* Have you handled cases where family members have overstayed their visa, and what were the outcomes?\n* How will you ensure that my parents' situation does not negatively impact my own green card application?\n* What is your approach to communicating with clients, and how will you keep me updated on the progress of my case?\n\nBy asking these questions and discussing your situation with the attorney, you'll get a better understanding of their experience, approach, and how they can help you address the issue with your parents' overstaying while pursuing your own green card application.",
