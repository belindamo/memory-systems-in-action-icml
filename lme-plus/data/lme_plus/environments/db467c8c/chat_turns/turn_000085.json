Here's an overview of what happens next:\n\n**Biometric Services Appointment**\n\nUSCIS will schedule a biometric services appointment for you, which involves providing your fingerprints, photograph, and signature. This is usually done at a USCIS Application Support Center (ASC).\n\n**Background Checks**\n\nUSCIS will conduct background checks on you and your parents (if applicable) to ensure you don't have any criminal history or other issues that would make you inadmissible to the US.\n\n**Request for Evidence (RFE)**\n\nIf USCIS needs additional evidence or documentation to process your application, they'll issue a Request for Evidence (RFE). You'll need to respond to the RFE with the required documents or information.\n\n**Interview**\n\nIn some cases, USCIS may schedule an interview at a local USCIS office or a US embassy/consulate abroad. You'll receive a notice with the interview date, time, and location.\n\n**Medical Examination**\n\nYou'll need to undergo a medical examination by a designated civil surgeon to ensure you don't have any health issues that would make you inadmissible to the US.\n\n**Approval**\n\nIf your application is approved, you'll receive an approval notice and a green card will be mailed to you.\n\n**Oath Ceremony**\n\nIf you're in the US, you'll attend an oath ceremony to take the Oath of Allegiance and receive your green card.\n\n**Green Card**\n\nOnce your application is approved, you'll receive a green card, which serves as proof of your lawful permanent resident status in the US.\n\n**Processing Times**\n\nThe processing time for green card applications varies depending on the category and workload of USCIS. Here are some general processing times:\n\n1. **Immediate Relative Petitions**: 5-10 months\n2. **Family-Based Petitions**: 6-12 months\n3. **Employment-Based Petitions**: 6-12 months\n\nKeep in mind that these are general estimates, and processing times may vary depending on your specific case.\n\n**Tracking Your Application**\n\nYou can track the status of your application online using the USCIS case status tool or by contacting the USCIS National Customer Service Center.\n\nThat's a general overview of the next steps in the green card application process! Do you have any specific questions about these steps or the processing times?",
