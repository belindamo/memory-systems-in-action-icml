  "content": "That sounds like a great class! Learning a variety of cuisines and techniques will give you a solid foundation in the kitchen and make you a more versatile cook.\n\nThai curry is a fantastic dish to learn, and it's wonderful that you're already planning to make it again. There's nothing like recreating a dish that you've learned in a class and making it your own. The confidence boost you get from cooking a new dish successfully is incredible, and it's a great motivator to keep exploring new recipes and techniques.\n\nThai curry is also a great dish for meal prep, as it can be made in large batches and reheats well. You can also customize it to your taste by adding your favorite vegetables or proteins. Have you thought about experimenting with different types of protein or vegetables in your curry, or trying out different spice levels?\n\nWhat do you think is the most valuable thing you've learned so far in your cooking class? Is there a particular technique or concept that's really clicked with you, or a new ingredient that you're excited to incorporate into your cooking?",
