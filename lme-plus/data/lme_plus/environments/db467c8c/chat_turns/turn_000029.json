  "content": "Yes, sure!\n\nTo determine suspected infection (SI) in the MIMIC-3 v1.4 dataset, we can use the following criteria based on the Sepsis-3 definition:\n\n1. Infection-related diagnosis: Look for any ICD-9 diagnosis codes that are related to infections. This can be found in the \"DIAGNOSES\\_ICD\" table in the MIMIC-III dataset.\n\nFor example, we can use the following query to identify patients who have an infection-related diagnosis:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT subject_id\nFROM diagnoses_icd\nWHERE icd9_code LIKE '001%' OR icd9_code LIKE '002%' OR icd9_code LIKE '003%' OR icd9_code LIKE '004%' OR icd9_code LIKE '005%' OR icd9_code LIKE '006%' OR icd9_code LIKE '007%' OR icd9_code LIKE '008%' OR icd9_code LIKE '009%' OR icd9_code LIKE '010%' OR icd9_code LIKE '011%' OR icd9_code LIKE '012%' OR icd9_code LIKE '013%' OR icd9_code LIKE '014%' OR icd9_code LIKE '015%' OR icd9_code LIKE '016%' OR icd9_code LIKE '017%' OR icd9_code LIKE '018%' OR icd9_code LIKE '020%' OR icd9_code LIKE '021%' OR icd9_code LIKE '022%' OR icd9_code LIKE '023%' OR icd9_code LIKE '024%' OR icd9_code LIKE '025%' OR icd9_code LIKE '026%' OR icd9_code LIKE '027%' OR icd9_code LIKE '030%' OR icd9_code LIKE '031%' OR icd9_code LIKE '032%' OR icd9_code LIKE '033%' OR icd9_code LIKE '034%' OR icd9_code LIKE '035%' OR icd9_code LIKE '036%' OR icd9_code LIKE '037%' OR icd9_code LIKE '038%' OR icd9_code LIKE '039%' OR icd9_code LIKE '040%' OR icd9_code LIKE '041%' OR icd9_code LIKE '090%' OR icd9_code LIKE '112%' OR icd9_code LIKE '114%' OR icd9_code LIKE '115%' OR icd9_code LIKE '380%' OR icd9_code LIKE '481%' OR icd9_code LIKE '482%' OR icd9_code LIKE '483%' OR icd9_code LIKE '484%' OR icd9_code LIKE '485%' OR icd9_code LIKE '486%' OR icd9_code LIKE '487%' OR icd9_code LIKE '488%' OR icd9_code LIKE '518%' OR icd9_code LIKE '995%' OR icd9_code LIKE '996%'\n```\n2. Antibiotic administration: Look for the administration of antibiotics in the MIMIC-III dataset. This information can be found in the \"PRESCRIPTIONS\" table.\n\nFor example, we can use the following query to identify patients who have been administered antibiotics:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT subject_id\nFROM prescriptions\nWHERE drug LIKE '%amoxicillin%' OR drug LIKE '%cephalexin%' OR drug LIKE '%ciprofloxacin%' OR drug LIKE '%clindamycin%' OR drug LIKE '%doxycycline%' OR drug LIKE '%ertapenem%' OR drug LIKE '%gentamicin%' OR drug LIKE '%imipenem%' OR drug LIKE '%levofloxacin%' OR drug LIKE '%meropenem%' OR drug LIKE '%moxifloxacin%'\n```",
