While other projects failed to fundraise or wasted investor money, Acta Finance has been developing its ecosystem minimum viable product (MVP) and recently started marketing its products on the Avalanche testnet.\n\nActa Finance empowers individuals and organizations to vote for their financial future\nActa Finance is a stand-alone for many reasons, notably its people-first mindset and \u201cActa Non Verba (Acts Not Words)\u201d philosophy. With a focus on transparency, security and accessibility, Acta Finance is building a decentralized financial protocol that introduces many centralized features on-chain for the first time to combat manipulation, corruption and abuse of passive earning features. The comprehensive suite of tools and resources is designed to help both experienced financial professionals and those just starting to manage their financial well-being.\n\nImage\\_0\n\nThe company aims to help users optimize their financial strategy, make informed decisions, and achieve long-term goals. Acta Finance is more than just a protocol \u2014 it is a community of individuals and organizations working toward a shared vision of a more abundant, innovative and inclusive financial future.\n\nThe Acta Finance MVP \u2014 now on testnet\nThe ActaFi ecosystem offers a vast suite of products, including ActaFi staking, ActaFi farming, ActaFi wNFTs, ActaFi referral program, ActaFi address milestones, ActaFi swap, ActaFi liquidity aggregator and the ActaFi DAO program. These products have been completed and audited, and are available on the ActaFi testnet. The tools are designed to make it easier for users to manage their assets and earn passive income, while the enormity of the ecosystem as a whole serves as a one-stop-shop for everything decentralized finance (DeFi), with further development plans in the works.\n\nFirst project to utilize a DAO to decide go-to-market\nActa Finance is progressive in its technology but is also the first project utilizing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to decide whether it should go to market. On Feb. 6, 2023, Acta Finance launched their first ever DAO vote, putting the decision on whether Acta Finance\u2019s native (ACTA) token would go to market at the end of Q1, 2023, in the hands of its testnet governors (compiled of simple agreement for future token holders and partners with pledged services). The DAO vote closed on Feb. 22 with an 80.95% vote in favor of going to market, which means huge upcoming efforts from the entire Acta Finance network to ensure a successful token generation event (TGE). This achievement is significant for the company, as it shows its true dedication to being a community-guided ecosystem while setting the company in motion toward its next milestone \u2014 the TGE. On a broader level, it\u2019s also a major step forward for the whole DeFi industry \u2014 standing as an example of how DAOs can be used to navigate challenging markets and decisions effectively.\n\nA community activity reward like none other\nActa Finance has always emphasized the importance of its community, and now it\u2019s proving it. The company has launched a \u201cGrow The ActaFam\u201d engagement airdrop competition on Crew3, featuring a vast array of quests and a whopping go-to-market rewards pool of 292,500 ACTA \u2014 three times the size of the regular monthly rewards pool offered post-TGE! Every day, new quests will be available for competitors to complete and gain serious experience points (XP) from. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nContest Type: Crew3 Bounty Campaign.\nWhen: Started Monday, Feb. 27, 2023,\nGo-to-market round one duration: Feb. 27, 12:00 am ET\u2013May 1, 11:59 pm ET.\nExclusive go-to-market round one rewards pool: 292,500 ACTA \u2014 3x the regular rewards pool, with a value of $39,487 USDT.\nMonthly rewards: 0.05% of the total token supply (97,500 ACTA).\nJoin the competition and view quests here: https://crew3.xyz/c/actafi/questboard.\nThe Grow The ActaFam engagement airdrop competition will be fierce, but the ultimate goal is to grow the ActaFam community and reward its most passionate members.

Currently, the company is consulting Paid Ignition and Avata Network to determine appropriate ticket size revisions to ensure a successful fundraiser before launching on Avalanche (exact dates TBA). The journey to listing is a grand feat, and Acta Finance is fully equipped not just to undertake it but to continue pioneering true innovation in the DeFi industry all along the way and long afterward.\n\nThe ActaFi ecosystem is designed to empower individuals and organizations to take control of their financial futures. Acta Finance\u2019s use of a DAO for decision-making, and its Crew3 community competition, demonstrates its commitment to inclusivity, transparency and community involvement. Its active steps toward listing now that the decision has been made show beyond doubt that actions stand behind all of its words.
