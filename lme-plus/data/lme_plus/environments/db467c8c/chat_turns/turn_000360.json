  "content": "I'd be happy to help you with the green card application process. However, I have to clarify that having your parents stay with you for nine months may raise some red flags with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). As a general rule, visitors on a tourist visa (B-2) are not allowed to stay in the United States for more than six months, and overstaying can be considered a violation of their visa terms.\n\nThat being said, let's focus on the green card application process. The specific documents required may vary depending on your individual circumstances, but here's a general overview of the typical documents needed:\n\n**Step 1: Determine Your Eligibility and Choose the Correct Category**\n\nYou'll need to determine which green card category you're eligible for, such as:\n\n* Family-based (e.g., spouse, parent, child, sibling)\n* Employment-based (e.g., job offer, investor, special skills)\n* Diversity visa (DV) lottery\n* Refugee or asylum status\n\n**Step 2: Gather Required Documents**\n\n* **Biographic and Biometric Information:**\n\t+ Passport-style photos\n\t+ Fingerprints (you'll receive a biometric services appointment notice from USCIS)\n* **Identity and Citizenship Documents:**\n\t+ Valid passport\n\t+ Birth certificate (with translation, if not in English)\n\t+ National ID card (if applicable)\n* **Immigration History:**\n\t+ Copies of previous U.S. visas (if applicable)\n\t+ I-94 arrival/departure records (if applicable)\n* **Family Relationships (if applicable):**\n\t+ Marriage certificate (with translation, if not in English)\n\t+ Birth certificates of children (if applicable)\n\t+ Divorce or death certificate (if applicable)\n* **Employment Documents (if applicable):**\n\t+ Job offer letter\n\t+ Labor certification (if required)\n\t+ Education and experience documents\n\n**Step 3: File the Petition**\n\nYou'll need to file Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) or Form I-140 (Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker) with USCIS, depending on your category.\n\n**Step 4: Wait for Processing and Interview**\n\nUSCIS will process your petition, and you may be scheduled for an interview at a USCIS office or U.S. embassy/consulate.\n\n**Step 5: Medical Examination**\n\nYou'll need to undergo a medical examination by a designated civil surgeon to ensure you don't have any health issues that would make you inadmissible to the United States.\n\n**Step 6: Interview and Approval**\n\nAttend the interview, and if approved, you'll receive a green card.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to consult with an immigration attorney to ensure you're eligible for a green card and to guide you through the process.\n* Gather all required documents and translations before submitting your application.\n* Be honest and accurate when filling out forms and answering questions during the interview.\n\nRegarding your parents' stay, it's essential to address their immigration status to avoid any potential issues with your green card application. Consider consulting with an immigration attorney to discuss their options and ensure they're not overstaying their visa.\n\nRemember, this is a general overview, and specific requirements may vary depending on your individual circumstances. It's always best to consult with an immigration attorney to ensure a smooth and successful application process.",
