The `Event` class is used to represent a single event, the `EventStore` class is used to store a list of events, and the `Account` class is used to represent a bank account and the events that have occurred on it. The `Account` class has methods for making deposits and withdrawals, as well as getting the current balance. The events are appended to the event store every time a deposit or withdrawal is made.\n\nYou can add more complexity such as implementing the event sourcing pattern with Event Sourcing library like: `Axon Framework`, `EventStore` and etc. Also, you can add more functionality such as event replay, snapshotting and etc.",
