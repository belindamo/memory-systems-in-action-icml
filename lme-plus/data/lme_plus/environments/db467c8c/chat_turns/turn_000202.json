Here are some of the initiatives taken by the Nigerian government to improve living conditions and prevent migration:\n\n1. Economic reforms: The Nigerian Government has taken significant steps to implement economic reforms that aim to create more job opportunities, reduce poverty, and enhance economic growth.

Security: The Nigerian government has also focused on tackling the country's security challenges such as terrorism and kidnapping by setting up various security agencies and increasing the budgetary allocation to the security sector.\n\n3. Infrastructure development: The Nigerian government has invested in key infrastructure sectors such as transportation, power, and water supply, a development that is expected to provide a conducive and enabling environment for businesses to thrive and promote job creation.\n\n4. Education: The Nigerian government is working to improve the quality of education by setting up institutions such as the Tertiary Education Trust Fund and improving funding to education.\n\nWhile these initiatives aim to address some of the challenges causing migration in Nigeria, the country still faces significant challenges.
