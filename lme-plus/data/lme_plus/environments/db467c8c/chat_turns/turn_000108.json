I'll also consider using a spreadsheet to track my collection, as it'll give me more flexibility and customization options. Thanks for the recommendations! By the way, I recently inherited my grandfather's old coin collection, which includes some rare and ancient coins from around the world. Do you know any reliable resources or experts that could help me learn more about the collection and its potential value?",
