Here's an overview of what happens next:\n\n**Step 1: USCIS Receives and Reviews the Petition**\n\nUSCIS will receive and review your petition to ensure it's complete and includes all required documents and information. If everything is in order, they'll process your petition and send you a receipt notice.\n\n**Step 2: USCIS Issues a Receipt Notice**\n\nYou'll receive a receipt notice (Form I-797C) from USCIS, which confirms they've received your petition and provides a unique case number. This notice will also include information on how to track the status of your application online.\n\n**Step 3: USCIS Conducts Background Checks**\n\nUSCIS will conduct background checks on you and your parents (if applicable) to ensure you don't have any criminal history or other issues that would make you inadmissible to the US.\n\n**Step 4: USCIS Schedules an Interview (if required)**\n\nIf USCIS requires an interview, they'll schedule one at a local USCIS office or a US embassy/consulate abroad. You'll receive a notice with the interview date, time, and location.\n\n**Step 5: Attend the Interview (if required)**\n\nAttend the interview with all required documents and be prepared to answer questions about your application, background, and qualifications. If you're applying from abroad, you'll attend an interview at a US embassy/consulate.\n\n**Step 6: USCIS Makes a Decision**\n\nAfter the interview (if required), USCIS will make a decision on your application. If approved, you'll receive an approval notice and a green card will be mailed to you.\n\n**Step 7: Receive the Green Card**\n\nOnce your application is approved, you'll receive a green card, which serves as proof of your lawful permanent resident status in the US.\n\n**Processing Times**\n\nThe processing time for green card applications varies depending on the category and workload of USCIS. Here are some general processing times:\n\n1. **Immediate Relative Petitions**: 5-10 months\n2. **Family-Based Petitions**: 6-12 months\n3. **Employment-Based Petitions**: 6-12 months\n\nKeep in mind that these are general estimates, and processing times may vary depending on your specific case.\n\n**Tracking Your Application**\n\nYou can track the status of your application online using the USCIS case status tool or by contacting the USCIS National Customer Service Center.\n\nThat's a general overview of the next steps in the green card application process! Do you have any specific questions about these steps or the processing times?",
