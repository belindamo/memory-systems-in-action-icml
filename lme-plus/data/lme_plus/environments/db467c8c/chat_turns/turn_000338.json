If you're new to spreadsheets, Google Sheets is a great option since it's web-based and easy to use.\n\n**Step 2: Create a new spreadsheet**\n\nOpen your chosen spreadsheet platform and create a new spreadsheet. Give it a name, such as \"Cashback Tracker\" or \"Rewards Tracker.\"\n\n**Step 3: Set up the columns**\n\nCreate the following columns to organize your cashback earnings:\n\n1. **App/Credit Card**: List the names of your cashback apps (e.g., Ibotta, Fetch Rewards) and credit cards (e.g., Chase Freedom, Citi Double Cash).\n2. **Date**: Record the date you earned the cashback reward.\n3. **Category**: Categorize your cashback earnings by type (e.g., groceries, gas, dining, travel).\n4. **Amount**: Enter the amount of cashback earned.\n5. **Total Earnings**: Calculate the running total of cashback earnings for each app or credit card.\n6. **Pending**: Indicate if the cashback is pending or confirmed (optional).\n7. **Notes**: Add any notes or comments about the cashback earnings (e.g., specific offers, promo codes).\n\n**Optional columns:**\n\n1. **Transaction ID**: Record the transaction ID or reference number for each cashback earning.\n2. **Store**: List the store or merchant where you earned the cashback.\n3. **Offer**: Describe the specific offer or promotion that earned the cashback.\n\n**Step 4: Organize your data**\n\nArrange your columns in a logical order, such as:\n\n| App/Credit Card | Date | Category | Amount | Total Earnings | Pending | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n**Step 5: Enter your data**\n\nStart entering your cashback earnings into the spreadsheet. Make sure to update the \"Total Earnings\" column by adding the new amount to the previous total.\n\n**Step 6: Format and customize**\n\nFormat your spreadsheet to make it easy to read:\n\n* Use headers and borders to separate columns and rows.\n* Apply conditional formatting to highlight specific cells or categories.\n* Use formulas to calculate totals and percentages (if you're comfortable with formulas).\n* Add a chart or graph to visualize your cashback earnings over time.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Create separate sheets for different types of cashback apps (e.g., one sheet for grocery apps, another for credit cards).\n* Use filters or sorting to quickly view cashback earnings by category, app, or date.\n* Set up automatic calculations to update your total earnings when you enter new data.\n* Consider adding a \"Goal\" column to track your progress toward a specific cashback target.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a functional cashback tracking spreadsheet to help you monitor your rewards and stay organized.
