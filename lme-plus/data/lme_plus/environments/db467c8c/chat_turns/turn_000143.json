Could you please share your city or zip code with me?\n\nOnce I have that information, I can suggest upcoming art museum exhibits or lectures in your area that focus on modern art movements. You can also let me know if you have a specific interest in a particular movement, such as Abstract Expressionism, Surrealism, Pop Art, or others.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few ways to find upcoming exhibits and lectures in your area:\n\n1. Google search: Type in \"modern art exhibits near me\" or \"art museum lectures near me\" along with your city or zip code.\n2. Museum websites: Check the websites of local art museums and galleries in your area to see their upcoming exhibit schedules and lecture series.\n3.
