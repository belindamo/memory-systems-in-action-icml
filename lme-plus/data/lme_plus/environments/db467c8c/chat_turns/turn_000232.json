I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or attend physical events, so I didn't attend the workshop on personal branding organized by the National Association of Women in Technology on February 27th at the Microsoft office. I'm here to provide information and answer questions to the best of my abilities based on my training data.\n\nHowever, I'm happy to help you discuss the topic of personal branding and provide tips and advice on how to build a strong online presence. If you have any specific questions or topics you'd like to explore, feel free to ask!",
