It's great that you've seen 32 species already this year, and I'm sure you'll reach your goal of 50 by the end of summer.\n\nKeeping a journal is an excellent way to reflect on your experiences, track your progress, and identify patterns or areas for improvement. It's also a great way to develop your observation skills and learn more about the birds you're seeing.\n\nReaching 50 species by the end of summer is a challenging but achievable goal. With the bird sanctuary visit and potentially connecting with other birders through the Audubon chapter or \"The Feathered Flock\" podcast, you'll have plenty of opportunities to spot new species.\n\nWhat's been your most exciting or memorable birding experience so far this year? Have you had any surprises or encounters that stand out in your mind?\n\nAlso, do you have a favorite bird species or one that you're particularly hoping to spot during your visit to the sanctuary?",
