It's a versatile drink that can complement a variety of Japanese dishes, including sushi. Here are some sake recommendations and etiquette tips to enhance your dinner party:\n\n**Sake Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Junmai**: A premium sake with a rich, full-bodied flavor profile that pairs well with sushi and other Japanese dishes.\n2. **Ginjo**: A light, crisp sake with floral and fruity notes that complements delicate flavors like raw fish.\n3. **Daiginjo**: A high-end sake with a complex, elegant flavor profile that pairs well with richer, more savory dishes.\n\n**Sake Pairing Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Sushi**: Pair a Junmai or Ginjo sake with sushi, as they complement the delicate flavors of raw fish.\n2. **Grilled or broiled dishes**: Pair a Daiginjo sake with grilled or broiled dishes, as its complex flavors can stand up to the charred, savory flavors.\n3. **Ramen or udon**: Pair a Junmai sake with noodle dishes, as its rich flavor profile complements the savory broth.\n\n**Sake Etiquette:**\n\n1. **Serve sake in small cups**: Traditionally, sake is served in small ceramic cups called \"ochoko\" or \"sakazuki.\"\n2. **Pour sake for others**: It's considered polite to pour sake for your guests, rather than pouring for yourself.\n3. **Receive sake with both hands**: When receiving a poured sake, hold the cup with both hands as a sign of respect.\n4. **Never leave a sake cup empty**: It's considered impolite to leave a sake cup empty, so try to finish the cup before refilling.\n5. **Don't pour sake with your left hand**: In Japan, the left hand is considered unclean, so it's best to pour sake with your right hand.\n6. **Sake temperature**: Traditionally, sake is served at room temperature or slightly warmed. However, some premium sakes are best served chilled.\n7. **Store sake properly**: Sake is best stored in the refrigerator to preserve its flavor and aroma.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Choose a sake that fits your budget**: Sake prices can vary greatly, so choose a sake that fits your budget and the occasion.\n2. **Consider serving sake in a masu**: A masu is a traditional Japanese wooden box used to serve sake.
