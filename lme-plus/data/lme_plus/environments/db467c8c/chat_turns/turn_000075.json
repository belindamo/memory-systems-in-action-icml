This step can take several months to several years, depending on the category and workload.\n\n**Step 5: Apply for a Green Card**\n\nOnce the petition is approved, you'll need to apply for a green card:\n\n1. **Form I-485** (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) if you're already in the US\n2. **Form DS-260** (Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration Application) if you're outside the US\n\n**Step 6: Attend an Interview**\n\nYou'll be required to attend an interview at a USCIS office or a US embassy/consulate abroad.\n\n**Step 7: Receive a Decision**\n\nAfter the interview, USCIS will make a decision on your application.
