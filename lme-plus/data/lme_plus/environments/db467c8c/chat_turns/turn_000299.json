With the lake location and Osprey mention, I can try to help you narrow down the options.\n\nOspreys are indeed often found near lakes and bodies of water, as they're fish-eating birds of prey. If the sanctuary is near a lake, it's likely a suitable habitat for Ospreys.\n\nTo find more information, I'd recommend the following:\n\n1. Online Search: Try searching for \"bird sanctuaries near [lake name]\" or \"Osprey sightings near [lake name]\" to see if any relevant results come up. You can also try searching for \"birding hotspots near [lake name]\" or \"best bird watching near [lake name]\".\n2. eBird: eBird is a fantastic online platform for birders to report and track bird sightings. You can search for the lake location on eBird to see what species have been spotted in the area. You can also filter the results by species, date, and location.\n3. Local Audubon Society: The Audubon Society is a non-profit organization dedicated to bird conservation. They often have local chapters that provide information on birding hotspots, including sanctuaries. You can search for the local Audubon Society chapter near the lake and reach out to them for more information.\n4. Contact the Sanctuary Directly: If you're able to find the name of the sanctuary, you can contact them directly and ask about the types of birds you can expect to see, including Ospreys. They may also be able to provide information on guided tours, trails, and other amenities.\n\nSome other birds you might expect to see near a lake include:\n\n* Waterfowl like Canada Geese, Mallards, and Wood Ducks\n* Herons and egrets\n* Shorebirds like Killdeer and Spotted Sandpipers\n* Raptors like Bald Eagles, Red-tailed Hawks, and American Kestrels\n* Songbirds like Warblers, Sparrows, and Finches\n\nKeep in mind that the species you'll see can vary depending on the time of year, weather, and habitat. It's always a good idea to check with the sanctuary or local birding resources for up-to-date information on bird sightings and viewing opportunities.\n\nI hope this helps you get started, and I'm sure you'll have a great time at the sanctuary!",
