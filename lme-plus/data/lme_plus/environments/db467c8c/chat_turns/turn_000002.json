  "content": "As Sarah and her colleague continued to admire the mirror, the museum employee walked up to them and asked, \"What's so special about that thing? It's not even art.\"\n\nSarah laughed. \"That's what we were just saying. But there's something about it that draws people in. Maybe it's the history behind it.\"\n\nThe employee shrugged. \"All I know is that we got it from a private collection. The owner claimed that it was an ancient artifact with some kind of mystical power, but who knows if that's even true.\"\n\nSarah's colleague chimed in. \"I heard that it was passed down through generations of a noble family in England, and that each successive owner claimed that it could show them an alternate future where some tragedy or loss didn't happen.\"\n\nThe employee rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, right. And I've got a bridge to sell you.\"\n\nAs they continued to joke about the mirror's supposed mystical powers, a young boy walked into the room, his eyes immediately drawn to the reflective surface. Sarah watched as he approached the mirror, his gaze transfixed.\n\n\"It's definitely got some kind of pull to it,\" she murmured, almost to herself.",
