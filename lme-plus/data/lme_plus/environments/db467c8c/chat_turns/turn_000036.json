Here are some tips to help you properly assemble and serve maki rolls and nigiri for your party:\n\n**Maki Rolls:**\n\n1. **Rice preparation**: Prepare your sushi rice according to the recipe, and make sure it's at room temperature. This will help the rice stick together better.\n2. **Norimaki**: Use nori sheets that are specifically designed for making sushi. You can find them at most Asian markets or online.\n3. **Fillings**: Choose your fillings and prepare them according to your recipe. Make sure they're fresh and of high quality.\n4. **Assembling**: Lay a nori sheet flat on a sushi mat or a piece of parchment paper. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice onto the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Place your fillings in the middle of the rice. Roll the sushi using the mat or parchment paper, applying gentle pressure to form a compact roll.\n5. **Slicing**: Once the roll is formed, place it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to set. Slice the roll into 8 equal pieces using a sharp knife. Cut in a gentle sawing motion, applying gentle pressure.\n\n**Nigiri:**\n\n1. **Rice preparation**: Prepare your sushi rice as for maki rolls.\n2. **Shaping**: Shape small balls of sushi rice, about 1 inch in diameter. You can use a small ice cream scoop or your hands to shape the rice.\n3. **Topping**: Place a small piece of fish or other topping on top of the rice ball. Gently press the topping onto the rice to secure it.\n4. **Serving**: Serve nigiri immediately, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 hours.\n\n**Serving Tips:**\n\n1. **Garnishes**: Garnish your sushi with thinly sliced daikon, shiso leaves, or pickled ginger to add visual appeal and flavor.\n2. **Serve with soy sauce**: Provide soy sauce on the side for guests to dip their sushi. You can also serve wasabi and pickled ginger as accompaniments.\n3. **Serve immediately**: Serve your sushi immediately after assembly to ensure the best flavor and texture.\n4. **Labeling**: Consider labeling your sushi creations with small flags or cards, so your guests know what they're eating.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Handle with care**: Handle your sushi gently to avoid damaging the delicate rice and fillings.\n2. **Keep it cold**: Keep your sushi refrigerated until serving to prevent spoilage and foodborne illness.\n3. **Practice makes perfect**: Don't be discouraged if your first attempts at making sushi don't turn out perfectly. Practice makes perfect, so keep trying and experimenting until you get the hang of it!\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating delicious and visually appealing sushi for your party guests. Good luck, and I hope your party is a huge success!",
