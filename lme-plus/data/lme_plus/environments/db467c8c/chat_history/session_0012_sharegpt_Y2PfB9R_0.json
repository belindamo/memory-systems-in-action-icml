Rib injuries: A rib fracture, bruise or contusion can also cause sharp pain on the left side of the body when you breathe deeply or sneeze.\n3. Pleurisy: Inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs (pleura) can cause pain when you breathe deeply or cough.\n4. Pneumonia: A bacterial or viral infection of the lungs can cause sharp pain on one side of the chest, which can worsen with deep breathing or coughing.\n5.
