Always research beforehand to know the current exchange rates, and only exchange currency with reputable banks or exchange bureaus.\n\n2.

Always inspect the ATM card slot and keypad before using it, cover your hand while entering your PIN, and use ATMs in well-lit public places.\n\n3.

Always research beforehand, use reputable services, and avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Keep your passport and other valuables in a secure place such as a hotel safe.

Tuk-Tuk scams: Be wary of tuk-tuk drivers who offer to take you on a 'tour' of the city for a ridiculously low price. They may take you to overpriced shops where they receive a commission for bringing in tourists. Always agree on the price before getting into the tuk-tuk.\n\n2. Street Vendor Scams: Street vendors may try to sell you fake goods or products that don't work. Always check the product carefully before purchasing and be aware of the price of similar products elsewhere.\n\n3. Gemstone Scams: Be wary of gemstone scams where you are sold fake or low-quality gems at inflated prices. Only consider purchasing from reputable jewelers.\n\n4. Jet-Ski Scams: Jet-ski rental operators may try to charge you for damages that were not caused by you. Take pictures of the jet-ski before and after use, and agree on rental terms clearly before renting it.\n\n5. Currency Scams: Always check the currency conversion rate and commission rates before exchanging currency. Don't accept torn or damaged banknotes.\n\nIn general, always be cautious, research beforehand, and use reputable services when traveling to Thailand.
