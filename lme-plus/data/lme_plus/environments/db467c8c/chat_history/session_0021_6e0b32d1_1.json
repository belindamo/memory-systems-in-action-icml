For example:\n\n* What's the name of The Daily Grind's loyalty program?\n* How do you earn points or rewards? (e.g., buy a coffee, get a stamp, etc.)\n* What rewards can you redeem with your points? (e.g., free drinks, discounts, etc.)\n\nOnce we have this information, we can add it to a list to keep track of your loyalty programs. We can also include other programs you're part of, such as:\n\n* Credit card rewards\n* Hotel loyalty programs\n* Airline frequent flyer programs\n* Retail loyalty programs (e.g., grocery stores, pharmacies, etc.)\n* Any other loyalty programs you're a part of\n\nLet's get started!"
