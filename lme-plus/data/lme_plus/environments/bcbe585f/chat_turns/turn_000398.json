  "content": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. Manipal is a town in the Udupi district of Karnataka, India, and it does not produce bananas itself. However, Udupi district is one of the largest producers of bananas in Karnataka state. According to the Department of Horticulture, Government of Karnataka, Udupi district produced 229,700 metric tonnes of bananas in 2019-2020, which is a significant amount. This indicates that there is a good potential for sourcing banana fiber for a banana fabric business in Manipal or nearby areas.",
