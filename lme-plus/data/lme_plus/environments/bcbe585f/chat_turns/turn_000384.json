  "content": "There are several reasons why only Taiwanese citizens can run for the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan. \n\nFirstly, the Legislative Yuan is a political institution that represents the citizens of Taiwan and makes decisions on their behalf. Hence, it is important that only citizens, who have a stake in the country and its future, are allowed to hold these positions.\n\nSecondly, the Constitution of Taiwan defines citizenship as a requirement for holding public office, including being a member of the Legislative Yuan. This requirement serves as a way to ensure that those holding public office are loyal to the country and its people.\n\nThirdly, citizenship is also important in ensuring that those who hold public office are subject to the laws, regulations, and policies of the country. In general, foreigners are subject to their country's laws and regulations, which may not necessarily align with those of Taiwan.\n\nOverall, the restriction on candidacy in the Legislative Yuan to only Taiwanese citizens is meant to ensure that the country's political leaders are loyal to and invested in Taiwan's future.",
