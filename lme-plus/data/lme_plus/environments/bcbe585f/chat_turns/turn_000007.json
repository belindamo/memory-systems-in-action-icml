Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\nPros:\n\n* **Convenience**: You can charge your phone wirelessly on the go, without having to worry about carrying cables.\n* **Ease of use**: Simply place your phone on the power bank's wireless charging surface, and it'll start charging.\n* **Clutter-free**: No need to deal with tangled cables or lost charging cables.\n\nCons:\n\n* **Size and weight**: Wireless power banks tend to be slightly larger and heavier than their wired counterparts.\n* **Efficiency**: Wireless charging is generally less efficient than wired charging, so it may take longer to charge your phone.\n* **Compatibility**: Make sure your phone supports wireless charging and is compatible with the power bank's wireless charging standard (e.g., Qi).\n\nIf you value the convenience of wireless charging and don't mind the slight trade-offs, a wireless power bank can be a great option. However, if you're looking for a more compact and efficient solution, a wired power bank might be a better fit.\n\nSome popular wireless power banks include:\n\n1. **Anker PowerCore Fusion**: A compact wireless power bank with a 5,000mAh capacity and fast charging capabilities.\n2. **Mophie Powerstation Wireless XL**: A high-capacity wireless power bank with a 10,000mAh capacity and stylish design.\n3. **Jackery Titan S**: A wireless power bank with a 20,000mAh capacity and advanced features like solar charging.\n\nWhen shopping for a wireless power bank, make sure to check the product's specifications to ensure it's compatible with your phone and meets your needs.\n\nHow important is wireless charging to you? Is it a must-have feature, or are you open to considering wired power banks as well?",
