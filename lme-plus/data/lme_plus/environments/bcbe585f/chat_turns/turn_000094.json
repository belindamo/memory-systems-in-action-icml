You can also use Google Maps to search for dog-friendly parks and trails.\n2. **AllTrails**: AllTrails is a popular app and website that allows you to search for hiking trails based on location, difficulty level, and features like dog-friendliness. You can filter the search results to show only dog-friendly trails.\n3. **Local Parks and Recreation Department**: Contact your local parks and recreation department or visitor's center to ask about dog-friendly hiking trails in your area. They can provide you with information on trails, rules, and regulations.\n4. **Dog-Friendly Trail Websites**: Websites like BringFido, DogFriendly.com, and HikingWithDogs.com allow you to search for dog-friendly hiking trails and outdoor activities in your area.\n5. **Ask Local Dog Owners**: Ask fellow dog owners, friends, or family members who hike with their dogs for recommendations on dog-friendly trails in your area.\n\nRemember to always check the trail rules and regulations before heading out, as some trails may have specific rules or restrictions for dogs.\n\nOnce you find a trail, make sure to prepare Max with plenty of water, snacks, and poop bags. It's also a good idea to keep him on a leash and clean up after him to ensure the trail remains dog-friendly for future visitors.\n\nHave fun exploring new trails with Max!",
