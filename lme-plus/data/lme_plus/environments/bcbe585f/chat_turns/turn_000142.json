But I can suggest some ways for you to find out what's happening around town:\n\n1. **Check the museum's website**: Look up the website of the museum you're planning to visit and check their exhibits and events page. They usually list their current and upcoming exhibits, as well as any special events or programs.\n2. **Social media**: Follow the museum's social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) to stay up-to-date on their latest announcements and promotions.\n3. **Online event calendars**: Look up online event calendars like Eventbrite, Meetup, or local newspaper websites that list events happening in your area.\n4. **Ask around**: Ask your friends, colleagues, or family members if they've heard about any interesting exhibits or events happening around town.\n5. **Google search**: Simply type in \"museum events near me\" or \"exhibits in [your city]\" and see what comes up!\n\nRemember to check the dates and times of the exhibits and events to make sure they align with your plans. Have a great time at the museum!",
