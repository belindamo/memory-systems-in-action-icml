Aerosmith - they recorded the song \"Walk This Way\" for the film Herbie Fully Loaded.\n\n2. David Bowie - he provided the voice of Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth, which was produced by Jim Henson Productions and released by Tri-Star Pictures (now part of the Sony Pictures division of the Sony Corporation).\n\n3.
