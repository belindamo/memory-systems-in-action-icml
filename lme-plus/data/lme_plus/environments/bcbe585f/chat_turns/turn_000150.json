However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific museum events or schedules, nor do I have personal experiences or memories.\n\nBut I can suggest that you try the methods I mentioned earlier to find out about upcoming events or talks that might be of interest:\n\n1. **Check the museum's website**: Look for a section on events, lectures, or programs, and see if they have a calendar or list of upcoming events.\n2. **Sign up for their newsletter**: This can help you stay informed about upcoming events and exhibitions.\n3. **Follow them on social media**: The art museum likely has social media accounts where they post updates about upcoming events and exhibitions.\n4. **Contact the museum directly**: Reach out to the museum's education or programming department to ask about upcoming lecture series or events that might be of interest.\n5. **Look for online event calendars**: Websites like Eventbrite or local event calendars might list upcoming events at the art museum.\n\nYou can also try searching for keywords like \"Impressionism,\" \"Modern Art,\" or \"art lectures\" along with the name of the museum or your city to see if any upcoming events come up.\n\nI hope you find something that interests you, and I'm sure you'll have another inspiring experience at the art museum!",
