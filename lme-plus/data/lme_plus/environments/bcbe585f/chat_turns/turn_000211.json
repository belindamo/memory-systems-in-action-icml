  "content": "Merlin Bird ID also has a fantastic feature for identifying bird calls and songs!\n\nThe Merlin app includes a vast library of bird sounds, which you can browse through by species or search for specific sounds. You can listen to recordings of individual species, compare different calls and songs, and even record and upload your own observations to help improve the database.\n\nOne of the most useful features for learning bird songs is Merlin's \"Sound ID\" tool. You can record a bird call or song using your phone's microphone, and Merlin's AI algorithm will try to match it to a species in its database. This can be super helpful when you're out in the field and hear a bird calling, but can't quite place the sound.\n\nMerlin's Sound ID feature uses machine learning to improve over time, so the more people use it, the better it gets. You can even submit your recordings to help improve the algorithm and contribute to the birding community!\n\nAdditionally, Merlin provides a \"Sound Explorer\" feature, which allows you to browse through a species' different vocalizations, such as songs, calls, and alarm calls. This can help you learn the various sounds a species makes and improve your skills in identifying birds by ear.\n\nImproving your skills in identifying birds by their songs is a great goal, and Merlin is an excellent tool to help you achieve it. With practice and patience, you'll become more confident in your ability to recognize bird calls and songs, and it will open up a whole new dimension of birding excitement!\n\nKeep in mind that Merlin is a powerful tool, but it's not a replacement for learning and practice. The more you use it, the more you'll learn, and the better you'll become at identifying birds by their songs. Happy birding!",
