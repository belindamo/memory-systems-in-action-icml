I'm happy to help you with information on what birds you might see at the wildlife refuge this time of year.\n\nTo provide you with the most accurate information, could you please tell me:\n\n1. What is the location of the wildlife refuge you're planning to visit? (State or region)\n2. What time of year is it currently (spring, summer, fall, winter)?\n3. Are there any specific habitats or areas within the refuge you plan to focus on (e.g. wetlands, forests, grasslands)?\n\nWith this information, I can give you a better idea of what birds you might expect to see during your visit.",
