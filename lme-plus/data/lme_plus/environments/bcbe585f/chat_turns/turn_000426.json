This will give you a break in between and allow you to process what you've learned.\n* Choose a walking tour that complements the theme of the street art workshop. For example, if you're doing a stencil art workshop, the Street Art and Graffiti Tour might be a good fit.\n* Take notes and ask questions during the walking tour, and then use that knowledge to inform your creativity during the street art workshop.\n\nBy combining a street art workshop with a free walking tour, you'll get a comprehensive understanding of Berlin's culture, history, and art scene.
