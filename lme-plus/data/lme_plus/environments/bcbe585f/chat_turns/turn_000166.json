  "content": "**Rachel's Response:**\n\n\"Hmm, I suppose that's not a bad idea. But I'm still not convinced it's worth the resources. Can you make a strong case for why we should divert resources to email marketing, even if it's just a small-scale campaign? What kind of ROI are we talking about, and how will it impact our overall marketing strategy?\"\n\n**Your Turn Again:**\n\nRachel is starting to show signs of openness, but she's still skeptical. You need to provide a clear and compelling argument to win her over. What do you say next?\n\n(Remember to be specific, provide data or examples to support your claim, and emphasize the benefits of your idea.)\n\nHint: You could provide a brief example of a successful email campaign from the past, or offer to take ownership of the small-scale email campaign to minimize the resource impact on the team.",
