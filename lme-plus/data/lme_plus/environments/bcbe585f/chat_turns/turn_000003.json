A power bank is a device that can charge your phone on the go, so you can use it to top up your phone's battery when you're not near a power outlet.\n\nIf you're concerned about running out of storage space in the future, here are a few more suggestions:\n\n* **Consider a phone with more storage**: If you're due for an upgrade, look for a phone with more internal storage or one that has a microSD card slot, which allows you to expand your storage capacity.\n* **Use cloud storage**: As I mentioned earlier, consider using cloud storage services like Google Photos, iCloud, or OneDrive to store your files, photos, and videos. This way, you can access your content from any device and free up space on your phone.\n* **Be mindful of file sizes**: When taking photos or videos, consider using a lower quality setting or compressing your files to reduce their size. This will help you save storage space on your phone.\n* **Regularly back up and delete**: Set a reminder to regularly back up your important files and photos, and then delete them from your phone to free up space.\n\nIt's great to hear that you're enjoying your new phone case, though! A clear case with a built-in screen protector can be very convenient and provide great protection for your phone.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or concerns about managing your phone's storage space!",
