  "content": "Tracking time spent on tasks is an essential aspect of project management. While Trello doesn't have a built-in time tracking feature, there are several ways to log time in Trello or integrate with other tools that offer time tracking capabilities. Here are a few options:\n\n**1. Trello Power-Ups:**\n\n* **Trello Timer**: A free Power-Up that allows you to track time spent on tasks directly within Trello. You can start and stop the timer, and the time will be logged on the card.\n* **Harvest**: A time tracking and invoicing Power-Up that integrates with Trello. You can track time spent on tasks, and Harvest will sync the data with your Trello cards.\n* **Toggl**: A popular time tracking Power-Up that allows you to track time spent on tasks, projects, and clients. Toggl integrates seamlessly with Trello.\n\n**2. Browser Extensions:**\n\n* **Trello Time Tracker**: A browser extension that adds a timer to your Trello cards. You can start and stop the timer, and the time will be logged on the card.\n* **Clockify**: A free browser extension that allows you to track time spent on tasks across multiple platforms, including Trello.\n\n**3. Third-Party Integrations:**\n\n* **Trello + Harvest**: Integrate Harvest with Trello to track time spent on tasks and sync the data with your Trello cards.\n* **Trello + Toggl**: Integrate Toggl with Trello to track time spent on tasks and projects.\n* **Trello + Clockify**: Integrate Clockify with Trello to track time spent on tasks and sync the data with your Trello cards.\n\n**4. Manual Time Logging:**\n\nIf you don't want to use a Power-Up, browser extension, or third-party integration, you can still log time manually on each card using comments or a custom field. This approach requires more effort, but it's a viable option if you don't need automated time tracking.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your team's needs, and you'll be able to track time spent on tasks in Trello efficiently.",
