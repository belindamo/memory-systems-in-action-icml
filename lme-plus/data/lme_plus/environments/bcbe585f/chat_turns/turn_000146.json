As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I wasn't referring to a specific exhibit called \"Art of the Ancients\" or any guided tour. I'm just a computer program designed to provide general information and assist with tasks.\n\nHowever, it's great to hear that you have fond memories of attending an exhibit that sounds fascinating! The mummy display must have been a highlight for you. If you're interested in learning more about the museum's current exhibits or upcoming events, I would still recommend checking their website or contacting them directly.\n\nIf you do end up visiting the museum again, I hope you have another enjoyable experience!",
