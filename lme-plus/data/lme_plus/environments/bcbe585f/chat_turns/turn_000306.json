Using an external SSD can definitely help with file transfer speeds and free up space on your laptop's internal storage.\n\nSince you've already closed unnecessary programs and are using a portable SSD, let's dive deeper into potential causes for the slowdowns during video editing:\n\n1. **Video editing software:** Video editing software can be extremely resource-intensive, especially when working with 4K or high-resolution footage. Check if your video editing software is optimized for your laptop's hardware:\n\t* Ensure you're running the latest version of your video editing software.\n\t* Check the software's system requirements to ensure your laptop meets the minimum specs.\n\t* Consider adjusting the software's settings to optimize performance, such as:\n\t\t+ Reducing the preview resolution or quality\n\t\t+ Disabling unnecessary effects or plugins\n\t\t+ Using proxy files or lower-resolution versions of your footage\n2. **Cache and temporary files:** Video editing software often creates cache and temporary files to improve performance. However, these files can accumulate and slow down your laptop. Try:\n\t* Clearing the cache and temporary files for your video editing software\n\t* Setting the software to save cache files to an external drive, like your Samsung T5, to free up space on your laptop's internal storage\n3. **Disk usage:** Even with an external SSD, your laptop's internal storage can still fill up quickly. Check your available disk space and consider:\n\t* Moving your video editing projects to an external drive, like the Samsung T5, to free up space on your laptop's internal storage\n\t* Deleting unnecessary files or projects to free up space\n\t* Considering an internal SSD upgrade if your laptop's storage is consistently filling up\n4. **RAM usage:** 16GB of RAM is a good amount, but video editing can still be memory-intensive. Check your RAM usage:\n\t* Press the Ctrl + Shift + Esc keys to open Task Manager\n\t* In the \"Performance\" tab, check the \"Memory\" section to see how much RAM is being used\n\t* Consider closing other resource-intensive programs or background applications to free up RAM\n5. **Thermal throttling:** As mentioned earlier, thermal throttling can occur when your laptop overheats. Ensure your laptop is in a well-ventilated area, and consider:\n\t* Using a laptop cooling pad or external fan to keep your laptop cool\n\t* Cleaning dust from the vents and fans to improve airflow\n\nTo further optimize your video editing workflow, you might consider:\n\n* Using a more efficient video editing software or plugin, such as those optimized for GPU acceleration\n* Rendering your video projects in shorter segments or using a render queue to reduce the load on your laptop\n* Considering a laptop with more powerful hardware, such as a dedicated GPU, if video editing is a critical part of your workflow\n\nLet me know if you've tried any of these steps or if you have further questions!",
