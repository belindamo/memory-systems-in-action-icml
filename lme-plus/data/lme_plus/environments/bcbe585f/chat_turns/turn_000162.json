We've been focusing on expanding our reach and getting new customers in the door. I think social media is the way to go for that. Plus, we've already allocated a significant budget for the influencer partnerships. I'm not sure we can justify diverting funds to email marketing at this point.\"\n\n**Your Turn Again:**\n\nRachel has responded, but you can tell she's not fully considering your idea. You want to assertively reiterate the value of your suggestion without getting defensive or confrontational. What do you say next?\n\n(Remember, you can ask for clarification, provide additional information, or reframe your idea to address Rachel's concerns.)",
