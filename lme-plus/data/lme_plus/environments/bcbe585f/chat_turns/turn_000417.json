  "content": "I'm thinking of planning a trip to Europe and I'm trying to decide whether to go solo or with friends. I've had some great experiences traveling with family, but I've also loved the freedom of solo travel. When I'm alone, I tend to strike up conversations with fellow travelers or locals, which often leads to some really interesting and authentic experiences. Can you recommend some good cities in Europe for solo travelers?",
