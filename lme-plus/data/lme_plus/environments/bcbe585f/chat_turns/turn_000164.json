We've already committed to this approach, and I don't want to confuse the message by adding another channel to the mix. Let's focus on making the social media campaign a success first, and then we can revisit email marketing later.\"\n\n**Your Turn Again:**\n\nRachel is still hesitant to consider your idea, and you sense that she's trying to shut down the discussion. You want to assertively push back and ensure your idea is given proper consideration. What do you say next?\n\n(Remember to stay calm, avoid getting defensive, and focus on the benefits of your idea.)\n\nHint: You could try to reframe the conversation, ask a question to clarify Rachel's concerns, or suggest a compromise.",
