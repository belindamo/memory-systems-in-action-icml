Here are some results:\n\n**Boston (BOS) to Miami (MIA)**\n\n* **Delta**: Departing BOS at 6:00 AM, arriving MIA at 9:35 AM, with a layover in ATL (1h 35m). Price: $158 (earn 2,344 SkyMiles)\n* **American Airlines**: Departing BOS at 7:00 AM, arriving MIA at 10:35 AM, with a layover in CLT (1h 35m). Price: $173\n* **JetBlue**: Departing BOS at 8:00 AM, arriving MIA at 11:35 AM, non-stop. Price: $178\n\n**Boston (BOS) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL)**\n\n* **JetBlue**: Departing BOS at 7:00 AM, arriving FLL at 10:35 AM, non-stop. Price: $148\n* **Spirit Airlines**: Departing BOS at 8:30 AM, arriving FLL at 11:55 AM, non-stop. Price: $123 (basic fare, no checked bag)\n* **Delta**: Departing BOS at 9:00 AM, arriving FLL at 12:35 PM, with a layover in ATL (1h 35m). Price: $183 (earn 2,344 SkyMiles)\n\nConsidering your Delta SkyMiles card, the Delta options might be attractive, but they're not the cheapest. If you're willing to fly with Spirit Airlines, you can save around $30-40 compared to the other options. However, keep in mind that Spirit is a budget airline, and you'll need to pay extra for checked bags, seat selection, and other amenities.\n\nIf you prefer to fly with a more traditional airline, JetBlue's non-stop flights from BOS to MIA or FLL are good options. Their prices are competitive, and you'll get free live TV and Wi-Fi on board.\n\nWhich option do you think you might be interested in? Or would you like me to explore more options or different airlines?",
