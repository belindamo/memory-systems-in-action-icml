While the Power-Up doesn't provide a native way to do this, there's a workaround to achieve this. Here are a few methods:\n\n**Method 1: Using Trello's Filtering and Sorting**\n\n1. Go to your board and click on the \"Filter\" button in the top-right corner.\n2. Select \"Time\" as the filter type and choose \"Total Time\" as the filter option.\n3. Choose the list or board you want to view the total time for.\n4. Click \"Apply\" to apply the filter.\n5. Trello will show you a list of cards with their corresponding total time spent.\n6. You can then use the \"Sum\" function in a spreadsheet or calculator to add up the total time spent on all cards in the list or board.\n\n**Method 2: Using Trello's Export Feature**\n\n1. Go to your board and click on the \"More\" button in the top-right corner.\n2. Select \"Export\" and choose the format you prefer (e.g., CSV, Excel).\n3. In the export options, select the list or board you want to export.\n4. Make sure to include the \"Time\" column in the export.\n5. Export the data and open it in a spreadsheet program like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.\n6. Use the SUM function to calculate the total time spent on all cards in the list or board.\n\n**Method 3: Using a Third-Party Tool or Integration**\n\n1.

Some popular options include:\n\t* Trello Time Tracker: A Chrome extension that provides a dashboard to view total time spent on lists and boards.\n\t* Trello Analytics: A tool that provides detailed analytics and insights about your Trello boards, including time spent on lists and boards.\n\t* Harvest: A time tracking and invoicing tool that integrates with Trello and provides a dashboard to view total time spent on projects and tasks.\n\nThese workarounds should help you view the total time spent on a particular list or board in Trello.
