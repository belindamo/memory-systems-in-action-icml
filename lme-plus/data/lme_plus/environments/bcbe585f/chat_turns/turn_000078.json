A combination of regular exercise and a healthy diet is the most effective and sustainable way to manage weight. If you are short on time, you can incorporate small bursts of physical activity throughout the day, such as taking a brisk walk during your lunch break or doing a short workout at home. Remember that every little bit counts, and even small amounts of physical activity can have a positive impact on your health and well-being.",
