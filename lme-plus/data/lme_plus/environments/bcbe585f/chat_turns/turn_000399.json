The DNS is located at Google Domains and they issue a API-Key for each domain. Please allow for subdomains with the same key.\nPlease use credentials.yml file as the only data source for API-key, email and domains. \nExample: credentials.yml\ncredentials:\n credential1:\n api\\_key: \n email: user1@example.com\n domains:\n - example1.com\n - \\*.example1.com\n credential2:\n api\\_key: \n email: user2@example.com\n domains:\n - example2.com\n - \\*.example2.com\n\nFrom the container, create a GoLang application to iterate the certbot command and pass all the API-keys and set of domains.\nAlso create a CRON job so it renews once per day.\nPlease print out all files with detailed instructions.",
