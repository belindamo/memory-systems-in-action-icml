It received mixed reviews from critics but was still a commercial success, reaching No. 65 on the Billboard 200. The album showcased a range of different sounds and styles, incorporating electronic, hip-hop, and even country influences into the band's usual hard rock formula. However, some fans were put off by the album's experimentation and felt that it deviated too far from the band's established sound.\n\nUltimately, whether an album is underrated or not is a matter of personal opinion, and different fans might have different favorites or least favorites among Hinder's discography.",
