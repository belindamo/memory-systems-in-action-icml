This can include the time period, cultural influences, and the artist's biography.\n\n2. Symbolism: Interpreting the symbolism and imagery within the artwork can provide insight into its meaning. Certain objects, colors, and shapes may have a specific meaning in the artwork's context.\n\n3. Artist's Intent: The artist's intent can be a helpful guide to interpreting the meaning behind their artwork. This can come from statements they've made in interviews or written about the artwork.\n\n4.
