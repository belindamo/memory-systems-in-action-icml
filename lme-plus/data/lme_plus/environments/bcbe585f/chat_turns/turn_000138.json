  "content": "The spinach and feta stuffed French toast is a game-changer! I'm happy to share some tips to help you achieve that perfect balance of crispy outside and fluffy inside:\n\n**Crispy Outside:**\n\n1. **Use the right bread**: Choose a bread that's sturdy enough to hold the filling and can absorb the egg mixture without getting too soggy. Challah or brioche work well.\n2. **Dry the bread**: Let the bread slices sit out overnight or for a few hours to dry out slightly. This helps the egg mixture adhere better and creates a crisper exterior.\n3. **Use a mixture of eggs and cream**: Whisk together eggs, heavy cream, and a pinch of salt. The cream adds richness and helps create a tender crumb.\n4. **Don't over-soak the bread**: Dip each bread slice in the egg mixture just until coated, making sure to remove excess liquid. This prevents the bread from becoming too soggy.\n5. **Cook at the right temperature**: Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat (around 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C). This helps create a crispy exterior.\n6. **Don't overcrowd**: Cook the French toast in batches if necessary, to ensure each slice has enough room to cook evenly.\n\n**Fluffy Inside:**\n\n1. **Don't overfill the bread**: Leave a small border around the edges without filling to allow for even cooking and to prevent the filling from oozing out.\n2. **Use a gentle heat**: Once you add the filling, reduce the heat to medium-low (around 325\u00b0F/165\u00b0C) to cook the French toast slowly and evenly.\n3. **Cook until golden**: Cook the French toast for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.\n4. **Let it rest**: Once cooked, let the French toast rest for a minute or two before serving. This helps the filling to set and the bread to retain its fluffiness.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Use high-quality ingredients, like farm-fresh eggs and real cream, for the best flavor and texture.\n* Don't overmix the egg mixture, as this can create a dense French toast.\n* Experiment with different types of cheese, like goat cheese or ricotta, for a unique flavor profile.\n* Top with fresh fruit, maple syrup, or powdered sugar for added flavor and texture.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside spinach and feta stuffed French toast that will impress your family and friends!",
