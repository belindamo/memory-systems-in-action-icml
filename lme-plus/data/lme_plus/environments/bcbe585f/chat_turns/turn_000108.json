It's awesome that you've found an app that works for you and provides the features you need to stay on track.\n\nReminders can be especially helpful in developing a consistent reading habit. It's easy to get busy and forget to make time for reading, but with reminders, you can ensure that you don't miss a day.\n\nSeeing your overall reading stats can also be a great motivator. It's amazing how quickly those daily pages can add up, and being able to see your progress can give you a sense of accomplishment and pride in your reading habit.\n\nWhich app do you use to track your reading progress? I'm curious to know more about it!\n\n(Also, if you don't mind me asking, what kind of reminders do you set for yourself? Are they daily, weekly, or monthly reminders?)",
