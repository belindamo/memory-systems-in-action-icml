Here are some recommendations for art pieces with interesting symbolism:\n\n1. \"The Persistence of Memory\" by Salvador Dali: This is one of the most famous surrealism paintings with clocks draped unnaturally over tree branches and other objects. \n\n2. \"Nighthawks\" by Edward Hopper: This painting contains various symbols and includes mysterious themes that spark curiosity. \n\n3. \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" by Pablo Picasso: Picasso's masterpiece is the painting that launched cubism, and it features five naked women with disjointed body parts.\n\n4. \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\" by Hieronymus Bosch: This triptych painting is filled with cryptic symbols and bizarre, fantastical creatures that question our morals.\n\n5. \"Guernica\" by Pablo Picasso: This painting has many symbols that was created within the chaos of the Spanish Civil War, invoking the sad and painful state of humanity.\n\nI hope these recommendations inspire you to explore the rich symbolism in art further!",
