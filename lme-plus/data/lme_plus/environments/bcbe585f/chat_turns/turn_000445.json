  "content": "I'm leaning towards the JetBlue option from BOS to FLL, but I'm a bit worried about the lack of seat selection and limited amenities. Can you tell me more about their seat selection process and what kind of amenities I can expect on this flight? Also, since I had a bad experience with American Airlines' in-flight entertainment system on my previous flight from New York to Los Angeles, I'd like to know if JetBlue's system is any better.",
