Congratulations on taking cocktail mixing classes - you're going to have so much fun experimenting with new recipes and techniques!\n\nSummer is the perfect time to incorporate seasonal fruits and herbs into your cocktails, and I'd be delighted to provide you with some inspiration. Here are some refreshing summer cocktail ideas that feature seasonal ingredients:\n\n**Fruit-based cocktails:**\n\n1. **Strawberry Basil Martini**: Muddle fresh strawberries and basil leaves with vodka, lime juice, and a touch of simple syrup. Top with sparkling water and garnish with a strawberry slice and basil leaf.\n2. **Peach Bellini**: Blend peaches with Prosecco and a splash of peach liqueur for a sweet and fruity twist on the classic Bellini.\n3. **Watermelon Mint Cooler**: Combine watermelon puree, tequila, lime juice, and mint leaves in a shaker. Strain into a salt-rimmed glass filled with ice and garnish with a watermelon slice and mint sprig.\n4. **Cucumber Lime Refresher**: Muddle diced cucumber and lime juice with gin, simple syrup, and a splash of soda water. Garnish with a cucumber slice and lime wheel.\n\n**Herb-infused cocktails:**\n\n1. **Cucumber Basil Gimlet**: Infuse gin with fresh basil leaves and combine with lime juice, simple syrup, and a splash of soda water. Garnish with a basil leaf and cucumber slice.\n2. **Mint to Be**: Muddle fresh mint leaves with bourbon, lime juice, and a splash of simple syrup.
