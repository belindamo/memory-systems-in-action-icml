  "content": "Warblers are a delight to spot, and adding new ones to your life list is always exciting!\n\nYellow Warblers are one of the earlier warbler species to migrate through the southeast, and they typically start moving northward in late March to early April. Since you saw them on your guided bird walk a month and a half ago, it's likely that the Yellow Warblers you saw have already moved on to their breeding grounds.\n\nHowever, it's not impossible that some stragglers might still be lingering in the area. Yellow Warblers can be found in the southeast during the spring migration, and some individuals might take a bit longer to make their way north. Additionally, some Yellow Warblers might be breeding in the southeast, particularly in areas with suitable habitat.\n\nThat being said, you might want to focus on other warbler species that are more likely to be present during this time. Some warblers that are known to migrate through the southeast during the spring, around this time of year, include:\n\n* American Goldfinch\n* Black-and-white Warbler\n* Prothonotary Warbler\n* Northern Parula\n* Yellow-throated Warbler\n* Hooded Warbler\n\nKeep in mind that the exact timing of warbler migration can vary depending on weather conditions, food availability, and other factors. It's always a good idea to check with local birding reports and birding groups for up-to-date information on recent sightings in your area.\n\nGood luck on your birding trip, and I hope you spot some of the warbler species you're looking for!",
