  "content": "I'm excited to hear that you're experimenting with different flavor combinations for your BBQ cocktail. Since you're using a citrus-flavored vodka, I think adding a splash of lemon juice will complement the flavors nicely. Lemon and strawberry are a classic combination, and the citrus will help cut through the richness of the vodka and strawberries.\n\nStart with a small amount of lemon juice, about 0.25 oz, and taste as you go. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess juice. Remember to adjust the amount of lemon juice based on your personal taste preferences and the overall flavor profile you're aiming for.\n\nAlso, don't forget to garnish your cocktail with a strawberry slice and a sprig of basil to add a pop of color and freshness. It'll make the drink look visually appealing and Instagram-worthy for your BBQ guests!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope your strawberry-basil cocktail turns out amazing,",
