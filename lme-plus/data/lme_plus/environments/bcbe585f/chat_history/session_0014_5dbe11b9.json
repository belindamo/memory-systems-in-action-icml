      "content": "The city museum sounds like a great choice! Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific museums or their current exhibits. However, I can suggest a few things:\n\n1. **Check the museum's website**: As I mentioned earlier, the museum's website is a great resource to find out what's new and what's coming up. They usually list their current and upcoming exhibits, as well as any special events or programs.\n2. **Look for a \"What's New\" or \"Upcoming Exhibits\" section**: Many museum websites have a section dedicated to highlighting new exhibits, so be sure to check that out.\n3. **Contact the museum directly**: If you can't find the information you're looking for on the website, you can try contacting the museum directly via phone or email. They should be able to tell you what's new and what's coming up.\n4. **Check social media**: Follow the museum's social media accounts to see if they've posted any updates about new exhibits or events.\n\nSince you mentioned you attended an exhibit on ancient artifacts around mid-January, it's possible that it may have been a temporary exhibit that has since closed. However, the museum may have new exhibits or rotations that might be of interest to you.\n\nIf you do end up visiting the city museum, I hope you have a great time!"
