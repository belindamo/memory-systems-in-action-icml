This research will be used to inform the development of a new payroll platform, LumenPay, which aims to provide an easy-to-use and efficient solution for businesses that pay their employees in cryptocurrency.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo conduct this research, we analyzed the websites and marketing materials of several payroll platforms that facilitate the payment of employees in cryptocurrency. We also conducted interviews with users of these platforms to understand their experiences and feedback.\n\nFindings:\n\n* Feature set: Most of the payroll platforms that facilitate the payment of employees in cryptocurrency offer similar features, including the ability to set up employee wallets, manage payroll and payment schedules, and track transactions. However, there is a lack of integration with existing accounting and payroll systems, and limited options for off-ramping cryptocurrency earnings.\n* Pricing: The pricing for these payroll platforms varies, with some charging a flat fee per employee and others charging a percentage of the total payroll. In general, the pricing is higher than traditional payroll platforms, due to the additional complexity and risk associated with cryptocurrency payments.\n* Marketing: The marketing strategies of these payroll platforms primarily focus on targeting businesses in the technology, finance, and consulting sectors, as these industries are early adopters of cryptocurrency and have a high proportion of remote and freelance workers. Marketing efforts are mainly focused on online channels, such as social media and email marketing.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBased on our research, there is currently a lack of payroll platforms that effectively address the needs and challenges of businesses that pay their employees in cryptocurrency. There is an opportunity for LumenPay to differentiate itself by offering a more comprehensive feature set, including integration with existing accounting and payroll systems and more options for off-ramping cryptocurrency earnings. Additionally, LumenPay could consider different pricing models, such as a lower flat fee or a tiered pricing structure based on the size of the business, to make the platform more accessible to a wider range of businesses."

However, only 50% of these platforms offer integration with existing accounting and payroll systems, and only 30% offer more than two options for off-ramping cryptocurrency earnings.\n* Pricing: The pricing for these payroll platforms varies, with some charging a flat fee of $5-$10 per employee per month and others charging a percentage of the total payroll (1%-3%). In general, the pricing is higher than traditional payroll platforms, due to the additional complexity and risk associated with cryptocurrency payments.\n* Marketing: The marketing strategies of these payroll platforms primarily focus on targeting businesses in the technology, finance, and consulting sectors, as these industries are early adopters of cryptocurrency and have a high proportion of remote and freelance workers.

Additionally, LumenPay could consider offering a lower flat fee or a tiered pricing structure based on the size of the business, to make the platform more accessible and competitively priced. To effectively reach and target the target market, LumenPay should consider a marketing strategy that includes a mix of online and offline channels, and that targets a wider range of decision-makers within businesses, such as finance professionals and C-suite executives."
