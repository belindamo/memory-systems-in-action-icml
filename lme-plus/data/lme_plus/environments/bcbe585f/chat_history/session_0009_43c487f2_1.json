The twists and turns come quickly, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.\n\nThe story follows Amber Patterson, a woman who will stop at nothing to claim the life she feels she deserves. She sets her sights on the wealthy and glamorous Parrish family, and the novel becomes a game of cat and mouse as Amber manipulates her way into their lives.\n\n**The Poison Tree** by Erin Kelly:\n\n* Theme: Family secrets, trauma, and the power of the past to shape our lives.

When the patriarch of the family is released from prison, the family is forced to confront the truth about their past and the tragedy that occurred. The novel is a complex exploration of the human psyche and the ways in which our past experiences shape us.\n\nBoth novels are psychological thrillers, but they differ in tone and pace. **The Last Mrs. Parrish** is a faster-paced, more plot-driven novel with a focus on the twists and turns, while **The Poison Tree** is a slower-burning, more character-driven novel with a focus on the emotional toll of the characters' experiences."
