      "content": "1. A caveman: Beauty to me is the fiery red glow of the sun setting over the mountains. It is the roar of the waterfall that falls into the river and the soft glow of the stars in the night sky. Beauty is the majestic grace of the herd of deer that roam the land and the roar of the great beasts that roam the forest.\n2. A cow: Beauty is a lush field of green grass and the warm sun shining down on my back. It is the sound of my friends mooing and the feeling of my soft fur being stroked by the farmer's hand. Beauty is the peace and comfort I feel in my stall surrounded by the familiar sounds and scents of my herd.\n3. An ugly pagan: Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. To me, beauty is found in the power of the elements and the magic of the spirits that live within them. It is in the light of the full moon and the roar of the thunderstorm. Beauty is in the ritual dances that bring forth the magic of the gods and the offerings we make to appease their wrath.\n4. A lustful person: Beauty is all about the body. The curves and curves of a woman's form, the tight muscles of a man's physique, these are the things that bring me pleasure and desire. Beauty is in the way the body moves, the way the skin feels, and the sounds that are made in the height of passion.\n5. God: Beauty is not just about appearances, but about the inner goodness and love of a person. It is about their kindness, compassion, and the light that shines in their eyes. Beauty is the way a person lives their life and the impact they have on the world around them. It is the beauty of creation, the majesty of the universe, and the wonder of life itself."
