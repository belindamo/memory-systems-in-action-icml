However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or direct interactions with physical products or pets. But I can provide you with some general suggestions and ideas for mentally stimulating toys that are popular among dog owners.\n\nSince you mentioned Max has a favorite spot in the living room, I'll assume he's an indoor dog. Here are some ideas for mentally stimulating toys that might interest him:\n\n1. Interactive Puzzle Toys: These toys challenge dogs to figure out how to get a treat out, which can help reduce boredom and anxiety. Examples include Kongs, Tricky Treat Ball, and Nina Ottosson Dog Brick.\n2. Hide-and-Seek Toys: Toys with hidden compartments or treat-dispensing mechanisms can keep Max engaged and stimulated. Examples include Snuffle Mats, Hide-a-Squirrel, and Outward Hound Brick Puzzle.\n3. Problem-Solving Toys: Toys that require problem-solving, such as figuring out how to get a treat out of a container, can be very engaging. Examples include Buster Cube, Tug-a-Jug, and Outward Hound Sensory Maze.\n4. Sensory Toys: Toys that provide a variety of textures, smells, and sensations can be mentally stimulating. Examples include West Paw Design's Wobbler, Pet Zone Treat Wobbler, and Snuffle Ball.\n5. Treat-Dispensing Toys: Toys that dispense treats as the dog plays with them can be very engaging. Examples include Kong Wobbler, PetSafe SlimCat Interactive Toy, and Outward Hound Treat-Dispensing Ball.\n\nRemember to choose a toy that suits Max's age, breed, and individual personality. It's also essential to supervise your dog when introducing new toys to ensure their safety.\n\nAs for the dog bed, it sounds like you've made a great choice! A comfortable, dark-colored bed can be very appealing to dogs, and the soft cushioning will likely provide Max with a cozy spot to relax.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm happy to provide more suggestions or answer any questions you may have!"
