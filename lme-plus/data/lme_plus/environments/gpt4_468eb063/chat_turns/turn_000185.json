  "content": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains, there lived a little clay pot named Potty. Potty was used by the villagers to carry water from the well to their homes.\n\nOne day, as Potty was making her way back from the well, she stumbled and fell to the ground. The fall caused a small crack to appear in Potty's side.\n\nThe villagers tried to mend Potty's crack with some clay, but every time she was filled with water, the crack would grow a little bigger. Eventually, the crack became so large that Potty could no longer hold water.\n\nThe villagers were very sad, as they had grown fond of Potty and relied on her to bring them water. But Potty knew that she had served the village well, and it was time for her to retire.\n\nAs she lay on the ground, Potty remembered the wise words of an old proverb: \"Even a clay pot will break if it is struck often.\" Potty knew that she had been used and carried water for the villagers every day, and it was only natural that she would eventually break.\n\nBut Potty also knew that she had done her best to serve the villagers, and she was grateful for the time she had spent with them. And even though she was no longer able to carry water, Potty remained a beloved part of the village, serving as a reminder of the importance of taking care of oneself and not overworking.\n\nThe end.",
