  "content": "According to the backstory I am creating, Potty was created by a skilled potter named Kim Namjoon, who lived in a small village nestled in the mountains. Kim Namjoon was known for his beautiful and functional pots, which he made using traditional techniques passed down from his ancestors.\n\nOne day, a group of villagers approached Kim Namjoon with a special request. They needed a pot that could carry water from the well to their homes, and they wanted it to be sturdy and reliable. Kim Namjoon accepted the challenge and set to work, using his expert pottery skills to create a small, round clay pot with a narrow neck and sturdy handle.\n\nHe named the pot Potty, and the villagers were thrilled with the finished product. Potty quickly became an integral part of the village, carrying water for the villagers every day. Over time, Potty grew tired and worn from constant use, but she remained a beloved and valued part of the village. Even in her retirement, Potty remained a testament to Kim Namjoon's skill and dedication as a potter.",
