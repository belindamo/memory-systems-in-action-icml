Winning two out of three matches is a great achievement, and making it to the semi-finals with your partner Rachel is a fantastic effort.\n\nLosing to the CEO's team might be a bit tough, but it's all part of the game, right? I'm sure it was a fun experience playing against them, and you can always learn from the match to improve your game.\n\nIt's great that you're focusing on your serves and footwork, as those are essential skills to master in badminton. Keep up the good work and enjoy the process of continuous improvement.\n\nBy the way, how's your partnership with Rachel going? Are you guys planning to play together in future tournaments or just enjoying the casual games for now?",
