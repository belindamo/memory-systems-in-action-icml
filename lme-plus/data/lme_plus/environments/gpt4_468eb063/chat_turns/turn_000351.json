  "content": "Sure! Here's how we can add the entity of `season` to our existing data model:\n\n1. We would add a new table to our data model called `season`, with columns for the attributes of the season, such as season ID, start date, end date, and any other relevant information about the season.\n2. We would establish a relationship between the `season` table and the `company` table by adding a foreign key column to the `season` table that references the `company` table. This would allow us to associate each season with a specific company.\n3. Depending on the requirements of our domain, we might also establish relationships between the `season` table and other tables in our data model. For example, if we want to track which bookings occurred during which seasons, we might add a foreign key column to the `booking` table that references the `season` table.\n4. We might also add additional attributes or tables to represent information about the season, such as the types of crops that were grown during that season or the weather conditions that occurred. These attributes or tables would depend on the specific needs of our domain.",
