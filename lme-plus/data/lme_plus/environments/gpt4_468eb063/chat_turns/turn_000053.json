This will help you choose the right cleaning products and methods. Common types of leather include aniline, semi-aniline, and pigmented leather.\n2. **Use a soft, dry cloth**: Gently wipe away any dirt, dust, or debris from the surface of the shoes using a soft, dry cloth. This will prevent scratching the leather.\n3. **Choose the right cleaner**: Select a leather cleaner that's specifically designed for your type of leather. You can use a gentle leather soap or a leather cleaner with a pH level close to that of the leather (around 5.5).\n4. **Apply the cleaner**: Use a clean, damp cloth to apply the cleaner to the shoes. Work in small circular motions, making sure to cover the entire surface.\n5. **Let it sit**: Allow the cleaner to sit on the leather for a few minutes to penetrate the dirt and grime.\n6. **Wipe clean**: Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away the cleaner and dirt. Repeat if necessary.\n7. **Conditioning**: After cleaning, apply a leather conditioner or leather oil to moisturize and protect the leather.\n\n**Conditioning:**\n\n1. **Choose the right conditioner**: Select a leather conditioner or leather oil that's suitable for your type of leather.\n2. **Apply a small amount**: Use a clean cloth to apply a small amount of conditioner to the shoes. Work in small circular motions to cover the entire surface.\n3. **Let it absorb**: Allow the conditioner to absorb into the leather for a few minutes.\n4. **Buff with a clean cloth**: Use a clean cloth to buff the shoes and remove any excess conditioner.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, or excessive water, as these can damage the leather.\n* Test a small, inconspicuous area of the shoe first to ensure the cleaner or conditioner doesn't damage the leather.\n* Condition your leather shoes regularly to keep them soft and supple.\n* Store your leather shoes in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent fading or cracking.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep your leather shoes looking their best and extend their lifespan.\n\nDo you have any specific leather shoe care products you're considering using, or would you like some recommendations?",
