However, I can suggest a few ways to check for award seats on your desired route:\n\n1. **United's website**: You can log in to your United MileagePlus account and search for award flights on their website. Make sure to select \"Book with miles\" or \"Award travel\" to see available award seats.\n2. **ExpertFlyer**: ExpertFlyer is a powerful tool that allows you to search for award availability across various airlines, including United. You can sign up for a free trial or subscription to access their services.\n3. **AwardAvailability**: AwardAvailability is another tool that provides real-time award availability searches for multiple airlines, including United.\n4. **United's Twitter team**: You can tweet @United and ask their Twitter team to check award availability for your specific route. They might be able to provide you with information on available award seats.\n\nWhen searching for award seats, keep in mind the following tips:\n\n* Be flexible with your travel dates, as award availability can vary greatly depending on the day of the week and time of year.\n* Consider flying into alternative airports, such as Fort Lauderdale (FLL) instead of Miami (MIA), if you have flexibility in your travel plans.\n* Look for \"Saver\" or \"Standard\" award seats, which are typically the most affordable options. \"Premium\" awards might require more miles or have more restrictions.\n* If you don't find available award seats, you can set up award alerts or track the route using tools like ExpertFlyer or AwardAvailability to notify you when seats become available.\n\nGood luck with your award search, and I hope you find a suitable flight to Miami!",
