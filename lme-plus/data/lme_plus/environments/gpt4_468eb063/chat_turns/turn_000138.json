  "content": "I'm thinking of adding some other ingredients to my Kimchi Stew to give it more depth and complexity. Do you think it would be a good idea to add some Korean chili flakes (gochugaru) to the stew, or would that make it too spicy? I also have some leftover Japchae noodles that I'd like to incorporate into the stew. Would it be better to add them towards the end of cooking or at the beginning?",
