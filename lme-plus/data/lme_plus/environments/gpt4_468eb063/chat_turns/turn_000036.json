It'll be a great opportunity to learn more about the festival and get a better sense of what they're looking for. I've been involved in a local theater group for a few months now, and I recently participated in a 2-day improv workshop that was incredibly helpful. I'm excited to take what I've learned and apply it to my script. Thanks for the advice!",
