  "content": "It's possible that the change request is the root cause of the outage, in this case, the first step to fix the issue would be to revert the change made in the request. This would involve undoing the update to the storage security policy IAMPOLye62kt31 and restoring access to SAP-946-/dev/xvda.\nAdditionally, it's always good to check the logs and monitoring of the system before and after the change to confirm if the change was the root cause of the issue.\nIt would be also good to investigate the change request and check if it was thoroughly tested and if there were any known issues that could have been addressed before approving it.\nIf the change request was not thoroughly tested, it would be a good idea to implement a testing and validation process for future change requests to prevent similar outages from happening again.",
