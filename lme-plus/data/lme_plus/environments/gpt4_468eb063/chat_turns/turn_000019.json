  "content": "You're weighing the pros and cons of each option, and that's great!\n\nA customized phone case can be a thoughtful and practical gift, and it's definitely a more affordable option. If you think your brother would appreciate a functional gift that shows you care, a phone case could be the way to go.\n\nOn the other hand, a watch is a more premium gift that can make a bigger impact. A watch is a more substantial item that can be worn daily, and it can become a keepsake for years to come. If you want to splurge a bit and give a gift that will be remembered, a watch could be the better choice.\n\nIt ultimately depends on your brother's personality, preferences, and your budget. If you think he would appreciate a more luxurious gift, a watch might be worth the extra cost. However, if you're on a tighter budget or want a more casual gift, a phone case could be a great option.\n\nI'm glad you're considering both options and doing your research. The personalized photo album you found is a great idea, too! A photo album is a thoughtful gift that can be cherished for years to come, and it's a great way to celebrate your brother's graduation. You could even combine the photo album with a smaller gift, like a customized phone case or a nice card, to make it an even more special gift.\n\nHere's a question to help you decide: What's your brother's style? Is he more into functional gifts or luxury items? Does he appreciate sentimental gifts or something more practical?\n\nLet me know, and I can help you make a decision that fits your brother's personality and your budget!",
