Here are the details:\n\n**Price Matching Policy:**\n\n* Glowing Skin offers a price match guarantee within 7 days of your purchase.\n* If you find a lower price on an identical product at a competitor's website, Glowing Skin will match that price.\n* The competitor's product must be in stock and available for immediate shipment.\n* You'll need to provide proof of the lower price, such as a screenshot or a link to the competitor's website.\n\n**Price Adjustment Policy:**\n\n* If the price of an item you've purchased drops within 14 days of your order, Glowing Skin will adjust the price for you.\n* You'll need to contact their customer service team within 14 days of your purchase to request a price adjustment.\n* The price adjustment will be issued as a store credit or a refund, depending on the original payment method.\n\nPlease note that there are some exclusions to these policies, such as:\n\n* Prices from auction sites, discount sites, or third-party sellers are not eligible for price matching.\n* Price adjustments are not available for products that are part of a bundle or value set.\n* Glowing Skin reserves the right to modify or cancel these policies at any time.\n\nIt's always a good idea to review the price matching and price adjustment policies before making a purchase, so you're aware of your options if prices drop later.\n\nNow, go ahead and add those products to your cart!
