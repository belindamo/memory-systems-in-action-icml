  "content": "Sure! Here's how we can add the attribute of `species` to our existing `programme` table:\n\n1. We would add a column to the `programme` table called `species`, which would represent the species of animal being raised during the programme. For example, this column might contain values such as \"lamb\", \"beef\", or \"pork\".\n2. Depending on the requirements of our domain, we might also establish relationships between the `programme` table and other tables in our data model based on the `species` attribute. For example, we might have separate tables for different types of animals, such as a `lamb` table or a `beef` table, which would contain additional information about each animal.\n3. If we establish relationships between the `programme` table and other tables based on the `species` attribute, we would use foreign key columns to link the tables together. For example, we might add a foreign key column to the `booking` table that references the `lamb` table, which would allow us to track which bookings were for lamb meat.",
