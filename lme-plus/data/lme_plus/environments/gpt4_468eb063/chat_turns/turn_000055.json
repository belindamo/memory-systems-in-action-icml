Look for products that are specifically designed for brown or dark-colored leathers, as they may contain different ingredients than those for lighter-colored leathers.\n\nIf you're still unsure, it's always best to err on the side of caution and avoid using products that might damage your loafers. Instead, consider consulting with a professional cobbler or leather specialist who can assess the condition of your shoes and recommend the best cleaning and conditioning products.\n\nRegarding waterproofing sprays, they can be a good idea for protecting your loafers from water and stains. However, make sure to choose a waterproofing spray that's specifically designed for leather and follow the instructions carefully. Some waterproofing sprays can leave a residue or affect the color of the leather, so it's essential to test a small, inconspicuous area first.\n\nHere are some tips for using a waterproofing spray on your brown leather loafers:\n\n1. **Choose a leather-specific waterproofing spray**: Avoid using general-purpose waterproofing sprays, as they might not be suitable for leather.\n2. **Test a small area first**: Apply the waterproofing spray to a small, inconspicuous area (like the tongue or a seam) to ensure it doesn't affect the color or texture of the leather.\n3. **Follow the instructions**: Read and follow the instructions on the waterproofing spray carefully, and make sure you're using the recommended amount.\n4. **Apply sparingly**: Use a light, even coat of waterproofing spray to avoid leaving a residue or affecting the breathability of the leather.\n5. **Avoid over-application**: Don't apply too much waterproofing spray, as this can lead to a sticky or greasy finish.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be cautious when caring for old or valuable leather items. If you're still unsure about the best way to care for your brown leather loafers, consider consulting with a professional cobbler or leather specialist for personalized advice.\n\nDo you think you'll consult with a professional cobbler or try to find more information about the products you have at home?",
