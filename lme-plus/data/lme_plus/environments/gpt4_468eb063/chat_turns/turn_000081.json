It's great to hear you're enjoying them.\n\nCaring for your leather sandals is essential to maintain their quality, extend their lifespan, and keep them looking their best. Here are some tips and recommendations to help you care for your new Birkenstocks:\n\n1. **Conditioning:** You're on the right track by thinking about conditioning your sandals. A good leather conditioner will help keep the leather soft, supple, and protected from drying out. I recommend using a water-based conditioner specifically designed for leather, as it will be gentler on the materials. Some popular options include:\n\t* Birkenstock Leather Care Conditioner (available on their website or at authorized retailers)\n\t* Nikwax Tech Wash Leather Conditioner\n\t* Bickmore Leather Conditioner\n\t* Chamber's Leather Conditioner\n2. **Application:** When applying the conditioner, make sure to follow the instructions on the product label. Generally, you'll want to:\n\t* Apply a small amount to a clean, dry cloth.\n\t* Gently rub the conditioner into the leather in circular motions, focusing on the areas that tend to get the most wear (e.g., the straps, toe box, and heel counter).\n\t* Allow the conditioner to dry completely before wearing your sandals again.\n3. **Frequency:** Condition your sandals every 2-3 weeks, or more frequently if you wear them daily. You can also condition them after exposure to heavy rain or saltwater.\n4. **Cleaning:** Before conditioning, make sure to clean your sandals with a soft-bristled brush or a clean, damp cloth to remove any dirt, dust, or debris. Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or excessive water, as these can damage the leather.\n5. **Protection:** To add an extra layer of protection, consider applying a leather protector or waterproofing spray to your sandals. This will help repel water and stains, making cleaning easier and preventing damage.\n6. **Storage:** When not in use, store your sandals in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. You can stuff the toe box with paper towels or newspaper to help maintain their shape.\n7. **Avoid:** Never use heat to dry your sandals, as this can cause the leather to dry out and crack. Avoid exposing your sandals to extreme temperatures, such as leaving them in a hot car.\n\nBy following these tips and using a good leather conditioner, you'll be able to enjoy your Birkenstocks for a long time while keeping them looking their best.\n\nHappy wearing!",
