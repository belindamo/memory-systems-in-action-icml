  "content": "I'd like to try out the Kimchi Stew recipe you mentioned. Can you provide me with a basic recipe and some tips on how to customize it to my taste? Also, I'm curious - have you heard of any Korean recipes that incorporate Japchae noodles into a stew or soup? I've perfected my Japchae recipe recently, and I'd love to explore other ways to use those sweet potato starch noodles.",
