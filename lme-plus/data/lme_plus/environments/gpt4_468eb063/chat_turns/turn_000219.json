  "content": "You're welcome! That's a great approach. Trying a classic coffee first will give you a good baseline to judge the shop's quality and flavor profile. An Americano or pour-over are both excellent choices to start with.\n\nAn Americano is a great way to taste the espresso, and the addition of hot water will help bring out the flavors. A pour-over, on the other hand, will give you a more nuanced and delicate flavor profile, depending on the roast level and brewing technique.\n\nRemember to take your time, savor the flavors, and pay attention to the acidity, body, and overall balance of the coffee. You might even want to take notes or ask the barista questions about the beans, roast level, and brewing process.\n\nEnjoy your coffee adventure, and I hope you discover a new favorite spot!",
