But I can certainly help you plan out your weekend and suggest a reminder strategy.\n\nSince you usually wake up at 9:00 AM on weekends, you might want to set a reminder for your brunch plans around 8:00-8:30 AM to give yourself enough time to get ready. If your brunch plans are at a specific time, you can set a reminder for 30 minutes to 1 hour before the scheduled time.\n\nAs for last Sunday, it seems like an outlier since you usually wake up at 9:00 AM, but woke up at 10:00 AM that day. You can disregard that instance and stick to your usual wake-up time for planning purposes.\n\nTo set reminders, you can use a digital calendar like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any other calendar app on your phone or computer. You can also set reminders using a voice assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa.\n\nHere's an example of how you could set a reminder:\n\n* Set a recurring event on your calendar for Sundays at 8:30 AM with a reminder to \"Get ready for brunch!\"\n* Set a one-time event for the specific brunch plans with a reminder 30 minutes to 1 hour before the scheduled time.\n\nFeel free to adjust the reminder time based on your personal preference and the specifics of your brunch plans. Enjoy your weekend!",
