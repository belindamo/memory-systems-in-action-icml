  "content": "If you use ketchup instead of tomato paste, it will affect the flavor and texture of the final product. Ketchup is sweeter and thinner than tomato paste, so it will add a sweeter flavor to the sausage and make the mixture more wet. You may need to adjust the amounts of other ingredients, such as the vital wheat gluten and vegetable broth, to compensate for the added liquid from the ketchup. Additionally, the ketchup may change the color of the sausages slightly due to its red color, but this should not affect the taste or texture.",
