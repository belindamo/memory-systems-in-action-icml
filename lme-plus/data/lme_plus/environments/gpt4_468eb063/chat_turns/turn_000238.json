This could be due to changes made to the storage security policy that limit access to certain resources or parts of the application, causing it to become unavailable or malfunction.\nTo fix the issue, the change request would have to be reversed or modified to restore access to the affected resources, and the application would have to be tested to ensure that it is functioning properly again. Additionally, an investigation would have to be done to understand why the change request caused the outage and prevent it from happening again.",
