But I can suggest a few ways to find great coffee shops near the event:\n\n1. **Google Maps**: Simply type \"coffee shops near [event location]\" or \"coffee shops near me\" (if you have location services enabled) and Google Maps will show you the nearest options. You can filter the results by rating, distance, and hours of operation.\n2. **Yelp**: Yelp is a great resource for finding highly-rated coffee shops in a specific area. Just search for \"coffee shops in [event location]\" and sort the results by rating or distance.\n3. **Ask the event organizers**: You can also ask the event organizers or other volunteers if they know of any good coffee shops nearby. They might have some local knowledge and recommendations.\n4. **Mobile apps**: Apps like CoffeeFinder, Coffee Shop Finder, or even Uber Eats can help you discover nearby coffee shops.\n\nOnce you find a few options, you can check their reviews, menus, and hours of operation to find the perfect spot for your pre- or post-shift coffee break.\n\nRemember to plan your coffee break accordingly, so you're not running late for your volunteer shift or leaving early. Enjoy your coffee and your volunteering experience!",
