  "content": "Yes, it is true that some boxers consume raw eggs as part of their pre-fight nutrition plan to boost their energy levels. Raw eggs are rich in protein and other essential nutrients, including vitamins A, D, and E. The idea behind consuming raw eggs is that they provide a quick and easy source of protein and other nutrients that can help fuel the body during a match. However, consuming raw eggs also carries some risk, as they can be contaminated with salmonella, which can cause food poisoning.

Alternatively, boxers can consume other protein sources, such as cooked eggs or protein supplements, to meet their pre-fight nutrition needs.",
