  "content": "If you don't have tomato paste or prefer not to use it, you can substitute it with tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes or even ketchup. However, keep in mind that using a tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes will make the sausage mixture more wet and you may need to add more vital wheat gluten to compensate for the added liquid. Start by adding a small amount of the liquid and gradually adding more until you achieve the desired consistency of the sausage mixture.",
