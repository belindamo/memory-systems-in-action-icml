  "content": "Great, here's how we can add the entity of `week` to our data model based on your description:\n\n1. We would add a new table to our data model called `week`, with columns for the attributes of the week, such as week ID, start date, end date, and any other relevant information about the week.\n2. We would establish a relationship between the `week` table and the `programme` table by adding a foreign key column to the `week` table that references the `programme` table. This would allow us to associate each week with a specific programme.\n3. Depending on the requirements of our domain, we might also establish relationships between the `week` table and other tables in our data model. For example, if we want to track which bookings occurred during which weeks, we might add a foreign key column to the `booking` table that references the `week` table.\n4. We might also add additional attributes or tables to represent information about the week, such as the types of activities that occurred or the weather conditions during that week. These attributes or tables would depend on the specific needs of our domain.",
