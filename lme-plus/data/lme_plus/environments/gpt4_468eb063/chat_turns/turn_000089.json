You can still try selling them online, and I'd be happy to help you decide on the best platform.\n\n**eBay:** eBay is a popular platform for buying and selling used items, including shoes. You can list your Ugg boots on eBay, but keep in mind that:\n\n1. **Competition:** eBay has a large market for used Ugg boots, which means you'll face competition from other sellers.\n2. **Fees:** eBay charges various fees, including an insertion fee, final value fee, and payment processing fee, which can eat into your profit margin.\n3. **Buyer expectations:** eBay buyers often expect a certain level of quality and authenticity, so you'll need to be transparent about the condition and provide detailed photos.\n\n**Alternative platforms:** If you're not comfortable with eBay or want to explore other options, consider the following:\n\n1. **Facebook Marketplace or local online selling groups:** These platforms are often free to use, and you can target local buyers who might be more willing to purchase used items.
