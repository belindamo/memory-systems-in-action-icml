  "content": "Part 30 not relied upon this basis because the terms of cl 17 of the original contract for variations were not precisely followed or, arguably, apposite in some aspects.\nIf I am wrong on my preference for the owners' argument on practical completion date - because, for instance, it is accepted that the ordinary meaning of building works within the contract definition and within the definition of \"practical completion\" is the physical work, this is reinforced by \"handed over\" and governs \"completion\", or it is said that the owners did not use the mechanism in cl 26.3 to defer practical completion until issue of the FOC - then I would accept the thrust of the owners' submission on the meaning of \"completion\" under the contract (as opposed to \"practical completion\") to the following extent. The builder's obligations under the contract (irrespective of the definition and meaning of \"building works\", \"date of practical completion\" and \"practical completion\") were not complete at least until the owners received the FOC as part of planning and building approvals under item 11 in Sch 1; that provides the date that work is complete within the meaning of the original contract (a date is not required, just a specified activity) on the proper interpretation of the contract and also within the meaning of HBA s 3B(1). Accordingly, s 3B(2) and (3) have no work to do because s 3B(2) operates when s 3B(1) is not operative and s 3B(3) is parasitic on s 3B(2) because it requires a context of practical completion for the presumption about practical completion to operate.\nConclusion on grounds 6 and 7\nIn summary, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning process in relation to completion date was:\nThe builder was responsible for obtaining the FOC;\nThe builder\u2019s obligation to provide the FOC fell within the definition of \u201cbuilding works\u201d under the contract\nCompletion of the works occurred within the meaning of the contract and therefore for the purposes of s 3B(1) of the HB Act upon the owners\u2019 receipt of the Final Occupation Certificate (FOC);\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding in this respect is relevant to its finding that there was consideration in respect of the new contract it found that the parties had entered into. Given our findings in respect of Grounds 2 and 3, it is not strictly necessary for us to consider this ground, but we do so for completeness.\nWe conclude that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of relevant terms of the contract.\nFor this purpose we set out the relevant clauses of the contract, which is a standard form Housing Industry Association (HIA) contract.\nClause 1 of the contract defines \u201cbuilding works\u201d as:\nThe building works to be carried out, completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations.\nIn accordance with clause 1, \u201cpractical completion\u201d means:\nWhen the building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose.\nClause 7 of the contract is headed \u201cPlanning and Building Approvals\u201d. Clause 7.1states:\n7.1 The party named in Item 11 of Schedule 1 must obtain and pay for all building and planning approvals.\nItem 11 names the builder as the responsible party for the purposes of clause 7.\nPlease write in English language.",
