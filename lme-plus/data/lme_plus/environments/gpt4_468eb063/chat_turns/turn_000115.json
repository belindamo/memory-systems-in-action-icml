Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. **Ask the seller:** Inquire about the bike's maintenance history and if it's been serviced recently. A reputable seller should be able to provide you with records or documentation.\n2. **Inspect the bike:** Take a close look at the bike's condition, check for any signs of wear or damage, and take it for a test ride. This will give you a better understanding of its overall condition.\n3. **Negotiate or request:** If you're concerned about the bike's maintenance, you can either negotiate the price or request that the seller have it serviced before you purchase it. This ensures the bike is in good condition and can also provide peace of mind.\n\nAs a buyer, it's reasonable to expect the seller to provide a bike in good working condition. However, it's also important to do your due diligence and inspect the bike thoroughly.\n\n**Pro tip:** Consider having a mechanic or a knowledgeable friend inspect the bike with you. They may be able to identify potential issues that you might overlook.\n\nRemember to also ask about any warranties or guarantees the seller is offering. This can provide additional protection and assurance in case you encounter any issues with the bike after purchase.\n\nHow's your experience been with the bike shop down the street?
