  "content": "As a modern day take on a Korean style pot, Potty might be made of a more durable material such as ceramic or porcelain, rather than clay. She might have a more streamlined, sleek design, with smooth, glossy surfaces and clean, geometric lines. Potty might be decorated with intricate, colorful patterns inspired by traditional Korean art, or she might feature more minimalist, contemporary designs.\n\nPotty might also have additional features such as a spout or handle that are designed to be more ergonomic and comfortable to use. She might be equipped with a lid to keep contents fresh, or have a built-in strainer to make it easy to brew tea or coffee. Overall, Potty would be a functional, stylish, and highly versatile pot that would be at home in any modern kitchen.",
