  "content": "That's good to hear! If the AppArmor profile for Discord is in enforce mode, then it should be blocking any actions that are not allowed by the profile.\n\nOne thing you could try is to disable the AppArmor profile for Discord temporarily and see if that resolves the issue. To do this, you can run the following command:\n```bash\nsudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/snap.discord.discord\n```\nThis will disable the AppArmor profile for Discord, and any actions that were previously blocked by the profile should now be allowed. However, keep in mind that this is not a permanent solution, as it leaves your system less secure. So, make sure to re-enable the profile when you are done testing:\n```bash\nsudo aa-enable /etc/apparmor.d/snap.discord.discord\n```\nNote that this may not solve the underlying issue with Discord, but it will help you determine if the AppArmor profile is the cause of the repeated log messages.",
