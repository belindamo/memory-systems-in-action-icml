Attending the festival's events and workshops will definitely give you a better understanding of what they're looking for, and it's awesome that you're applying what you've learned from your improv workshop to your script.\n\nRemember to stay open to feedback and be willing to make changes to your script. It's a process, and it's okay to revise and refine your work. Don't be afraid to ask for help or advice from industry professionals, peers, and mentors.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that submitting to a festival like the New York International Fringe Festival is a competitive process, and there are no guarantees of acceptance. But by doing your research, attending events, and refining your script, you're increasing your chances of success.\n\nMost importantly, remember to enjoy the process and have fun! Writing a script and submitting it to a festival is a significant accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself for taking the leap.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'm always here to help. Good luck with your script, and I hope to see it on stage soon!",
