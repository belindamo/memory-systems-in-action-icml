  "content": "Stacking deals can be a great way to maximize your savings.\n\nAfter checking with Glowing Skin's terms and conditions, I found that they do allow stacking of certain promotions. However, there are some restrictions to keep in mind:\n\n* The 20% off sitewide code (GLOW20) can be combined with other promotions, but it will only apply to the first item in a buy one get 50% off deal.\n* The buy one get 50% off deal is a separate promotion that will automatically apply to the second item of equal or lesser value.\n\nHere's an example of how the stacking would work:\n\n* You add two facial moisturizers to your cart, one for $50 and another for $40.\n* The buy one get 50% off deal would apply to the second item, making it $20 (50% off $40).\n* The 20% off sitewide code (GLOW20) would then be applied to the first item, making it $40 (20% off $50).\n* Your total would be $60 ($40 + $20).\n\nSo, in this scenario, you'd get 20% off the first item and 50% off the second item, which is a great deal!\n\nKeep in mind that some promotions might have exclusions or limitations, so it's always a good idea to review the terms and conditions before making a purchase.\n\nIf you're ready to take advantage of these deals, I recommend adding the products to your cart and applying the GLOW20 code at checkout. The buy one get 50% off deal should apply automatically to the second item. If you have any issues or questions, Glowing Skin's customer service should be able to assist you.",
