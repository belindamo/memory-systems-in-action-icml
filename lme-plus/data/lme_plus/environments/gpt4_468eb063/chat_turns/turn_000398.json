It's wonderful that you met someone with similar interests and exchanged numbers.\n\nAs for inviting her to meet up for coffee before your volunteer shift, it's definitely a possibility. However, consider a few things before making the invite:\n\n1. **Time constraint**: Make sure you have enough time to grab coffee and chat before your volunteer shift. You don't want to feel rushed or worried about being late for your commitment.\n2. **Volunteer schedule**: Check your volunteer schedule and ensure that you're not scheduled to arrive too early or have a critical task to attend to before your shift starts.\n3. **Coffee shop location**: Choose a coffee shop that's conveniently located near the event venue, so you can easily get to your volunteer shift afterwards.\n4. **Your energy levels**: Consider your energy levels and whether you'll be able to engage in a conversation before diving into your volunteer work. You might want to prioritize your focus and energy for the volunteer event.\n5. **Keep it brief**: If you do decide to meet up, suggest a brief coffee break, like 30 minutes to an hour, to ensure you both have time for a quick catch-up before you need to head out.\n\nIf you've thought through these factors and feel it's a good fit, go ahead and invite her to meet up! It's a great way to nurture a new connection and grab a coffee before your volunteer shift.\n\nRemember to prioritize your volunteer commitment and make sure you're not compromising your responsibilities. But if you can make it work, it'll be a lovely way to start your day.",
