  "content": "Yes, there are often specific restrictions on what boxers can eat or drink leading up to a match. For example, boxers will typically avoid alcohol, caffeine, and salty or fried foods in the lead-up to a match as these can cause dehydration and negatively impact their performance in the ring. Boxers may also cut back on their overall calorie intake in the days leading up to a weigh-in to ensure that they make the required weight class. Additionally, some boxers may follow more extreme weight-cutting practices in order to make weight before a match, although this can be dangerous and is not recommended. Overall, the goal is to ensure that boxers are properly fueled and hydrated for their match while also minimizing the risk of any negative impacts on their performance.",
