  "content": "In this story, Potty is a small clay pot with a round, bulbous shape and a narrow neck. She may have a small handle on one side and a spout on the other to allow for easy pouring. Potty is likely made of a reddish-brown clay, with a rough, porous texture. She may be decorated with simple patterns or designs, but overall she is a functional, utilitarian object rather than a decorative one.",
