      "content": "Amazon Swords and Water Wisteria are both popular and easy-to-care-for plants that can thrive in a community tank. Here's some more information on their care and lighting requirements:\n\n**Amazon Swords (Echinocorys spp.)**\n\n* **Lighting:** Amazon Swords can tolerate a wide range of lighting conditions, from low to high. However, they'll produce more vibrant colors and grow faster in moderate to high lighting (2-4 watts per gallon). They can also benefit from some direct sunlight, but be careful not to overdo it, as this can cause algae growth.\n* **Water Parameters:** Amazon Swords prefer soft to moderately hard water (5-15 dGH) with a pH between 6.5-8.5. They can tolerate a temperature range of 72-82\u00b0F (22-28\u00b0C).\n* **Substrate:** Amazon Swords have a small root system, so they don't require a lot of substrate. A nutrient-rich substrate with a depth of 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) is sufficient.\n* **Fertilization:** Amazon Swords are heavy feeders and will benefit from regular fertilization. You can use a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n* **Pruning:** Amazon Swords can grow quite tall (up to 20 inches/50 cm), so regular pruning is necessary to maintain a desired height and encourage bushy growth. Simply trim off the top inch or two of the plant, and it will produce new leaves and stems.\n* **Propagation:** Amazon Swords can be easily propagated by dividing the rhizome (the thick, underground stem) or by planting the seeds produced by the plant.\n\n**Water Wisteria (Hygrophila difformis)**\n\n* **Lighting:** Water Wisteria prefers moderate to high lighting (2-4 watts per gallon), but it can tolerate low lighting conditions as well. However, it may not produce as many leaves or grow as quickly in low light.\n* **Water Parameters:** Water Wisteria prefers soft to moderately hard water (5-15 dGH) with a pH between 6.5-8.5. It can tolerate a temperature range of 72-82\u00b0F (22-28\u00b0C).\n* **Substrate:** Water Wisteria has a moderate root system, so it prefers a deeper substrate (2-3 inches/5-7.5 cm) with a nutrient-rich composition.\n* **Fertilization:** Water Wisteria is a fast-growing plant and will benefit from regular fertilization. You can use a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n* **Pruning:** Water Wisteria can grow quite long (up to 30 inches/75 cm), so regular pruning is necessary to maintain a desired length and encourage bushy growth. Simply trim off the longest stems, and the plant will produce new growth.\n* **Propagation:** Water Wisteria can be easily propagated by cutting off the stem tips (about 2-3 inches/5-7.5 cm long) and planting them in the substrate. You can also divide the roots or use the plant's natural ability to produce runners.\n\nSome general tips for both plants:\n\n* Make sure to provide adequate water circulation and oxygenation, as both plants can be prone to fungal infections in stagnant water.\n* Avoid over-handling the plants, as this can cause stress and lead to disease or algae growth.\n* Monitor the plants' growth and adjust their placement in the tank accordingly.
