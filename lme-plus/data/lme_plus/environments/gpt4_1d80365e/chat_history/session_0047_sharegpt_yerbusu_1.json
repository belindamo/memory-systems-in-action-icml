Today, I'll be sharing a delicious salad recipe with you that we have been making in different renditions for years now, and this version is the best yet. It has a few different components prepared in different ways, and this is the way to a good salad. If you want to learn more about the science behind how I compose salads, you can check out an article we made called \"Six Easy Steps to Level Up Your Salads\" that we posted last year. This salad has a base of crunchy veg that will be topped with delicious sticky ginger tofu, nuts, coriander, and spring onion.\n\nQuick Pickled Chilies:\n\nTo make quick pickled chilies, you will need two nondescript long green chilies, or jalapenos if you can't find this variety. Slice the peppers up and transfer them into a jar. In a small saucepan, add one quarter cup of water, one quarter cup of rice vinegar, one quarter of a teaspoon of sugar, and one quarter of a teaspoon of salt. Warm it up over low-medium heat and whisk it until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the liquid over the peppers in the jar and coat them all in the liquid. Let them sit while you prep the rest of the recipe.\n\nGinger Tofu:\n\nThe marinade or glaze for the tofu is very similar to the dressing that goes for the crunchy veg in the base of the salad. I like to prepare them at the same time. Pat dry 400g extra-firm tofu with a clean towel. If you are using plain firm tofu, press it for about half an hour to get rid of any excess liquid. Once it's dry, cut it into small cubes and place it in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together three tablespoons of soy sauce, two tablespoons of maple syrup, two tablespoons of rice vinegar, two tablespoons of grated ginger, and two grated garlic cloves. Pour the marinade over the tofu and let it sit for a few minutes.\n\nCrunchy Veg Base:\n\nThe crunchy veg base consists of two grated carrots, half a head of thinly sliced red cabbage, one thinly sliced red onion, one grated apple, and a handful of finely sliced snow peas. Mix all the vegetables together in a large bowl.\n\nSalad Dressing:\n\nTo make the dressing, mix together two tablespoons of olive oil, one tablespoon of soy sauce, one tablespoon of maple syrup, one tablespoon of rice vinegar, two grated garlic cloves, and one grated thumb-sized piece of ginger.\n\nAssembly:\n\nAdd the marinated tofu on top of the crunchy veg base, and sprinkle some chopped nuts, coriander, and spring onion on top. Finally, add the quick pickled chilies on top of the salad. Pour the dressing over the salad and enjoy!\n\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\nCook Time: 0 minutes\nTotal Time: 1 hour 20 minutes\n\nHigh CTR Meta Description: Learn how to make a delicious salad recipe with crunchy veg, sticky ginger tofu, nuts, coriander, and spring onion topped with quick pickled chilies."
