I prioritize my tasks based on their urgency and importance, and try to allocate specific time blocks for each task. However, I find it challenging to balance my leadership responsibilities with my technical tasks and personal life. I often feel like I'm being pulled in different directions and struggle to focus on a single task for an extended period.\n\nThe tip that resonates with me the most is learning to say no.
