  "content": "Staying at the Whitney Portal Campground is a fantastic idea, given its proximity to the trailhead. As for reserving a campsite, I'd strongly recommend making a reservation in advance, especially during peak season (June to September).\n\n**Why Reserve a Campsite in Advance:**\n\n1. **Limited Availability:** Whitney Portal Campground has only 42 campsites, and they fill up quickly, especially on weekends and during peak season.\n2. **First-Come, First-Served:** While the campground doesn't take reservations through the national forest website, it's operated on a first-come, first-served basis. This means that if you arrive late in the day, you might not get a spot.\n3. **Priority for Permit Holders:** The campground gives priority to hikers who have a Mount Whitney permit. If you have a permit, it's essential to reserve a campsite in advance to ensure you have a spot.\n\n**How to Reserve a Campsite:**\n\nYou can reserve a campsite through the Inyo National Forest's website or by calling (760) 876-6200. Reservations can be made up to 6 months in advance, and there's a $10 reservation fee. Keep in mind that you'll need to provide your Mount Whitney permit number when making the reservation.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make your reservation as early as possible, especially if you're planning to hike on a weekend or during peak season.\n* Be prepared to provide your Mount Whitney permit number and other required information when making the reservation.\n* If you're unable to reserve a campsite, consider arriving early in the morning to try and snag a spot on a first-come, first-served basis.\n* Keep in mind that there's a 7-day stay limit at the campground.\n\nBy reserving a campsite in advance, you'll ensure a spot for the night before your hike, which will help you get a good night's rest and be ready for your Mount Whitney adventure!",
