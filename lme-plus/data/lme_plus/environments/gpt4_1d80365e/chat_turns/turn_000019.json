  "content": "It can be incredibly frustrating and disheartening when we feel like our parents aren't seeing us as capable, autonomous individuals with unique thoughts and desires. However, it's important to recognize that your dad's desire to control your life may come from a place of love and concern for your wellbeing. Although it might not feel like it, he may believe he is doing what's best for you based on his own experiences and what he knows.\n\nIt's important to establish healthy boundaries with your dad and let him know that while you value his advice and guidance, you would also like the space to make your own decisions and learn from your mistakes. Having open and honest conversations with him about your values and goals can also help him understand your perspective and develop a greater appreciation for your individuality.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to assert your own agency and prioritize your own needs, desires, and values. While your dad may have your best interests at heart, it's important to remember that you are the one who knows yourself best and should make choices that reflect your authentic self.",
