  "content": "While supplements may provide some benefits in delaying the onset of sarcopenia in older individuals, they are not a substitute for exercise. Studies have shown that exercise, particularly resistance training, is the most effective way to preserve muscle mass and strength in older people. Supplements such as protein or creatine can also help to support muscle health, but they should be used in conjunction with exercise, rather than as a replacement. Additionally, it's important to note that supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and their effectiveness and safety may vary. Therefore, it's best to consult with a medical professional before starting any supplement regimen. In summary, while supplements may be helpful, regular exercise is still the most effective method for preventing or delaying the onset of sarcopenia in older individuals.",
