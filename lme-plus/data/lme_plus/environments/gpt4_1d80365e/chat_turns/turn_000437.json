  "content": "My apologies for the confusion earlier. Here's an updated version of the `docker-compose.yml` file that adds logging to a host volume:\n```bash\nversion: \"3.9\"\n\nservices:\n  certbot:\n    build: .\n    volumes:\n      - ./logs:/app/logs\n      - ./google.ini:/app/google.ini\n      - ./credentials.yaml:/app/credentials.yaml\n    command: bash /app/certbot.sh > /app/logs/certbot.log 2>&1\n```\nThis `docker-compose.yml` file is similar to the one I provided earlier, but it includes an additional volume mount for logs. Specifically, it maps the `./logs` directory on the host to the `/app/logs` directory in the container.\n\nThe `command` specified for the `certbot` service runs the `certbot.sh` script, and redirects its output to a log file at `/app/logs/certbot.log`. This log file is stored in the `./logs` directory on the host machine, which was mounted to `/app/logs` in the container.\n\nWhen you run `docker-compose up`, Docker will create the `./logs` directory on the host machine (if it doesn't already exist), and mount it as a volume inside the container. The `certbot` container will then write its logs to the `/app/logs/certbot.log` file, which will be stored in the `./logs` directory on the host machine.\n\nYou can monitor the logs in real-time by running `tail -f ./logs/certbot.log` on the host machine.",
