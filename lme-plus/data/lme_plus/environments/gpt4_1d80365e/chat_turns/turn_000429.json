The `certbot` command line tool is used to request, renew, and manage SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt, and it can be extended with plugins to support different DNS providers for the DNS-01 challenge.\n\nIn this example, we're using the `certbot-dns-google` plugin to support the Google Domains DNS provider. When you run the `certbot` command with the `dns-google` plugin, it will automatically configure your DNS settings to complete the DNS-01 challenge and obtain a certificate from Let's Encrypt.",
