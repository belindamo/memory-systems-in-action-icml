You can do this by:\n\n* Going to calendar.google.com\n* Clicking on the \"+\" icon next to \"Other calendars\"\n* Selecting \"New calendar\"\n* Naming it something like \"Concerts\" or \"Music Events\"\n* Clicking \"Create\"\n\n**Step 2: Add the COIN event**\n\n* Open your \"Concerts\" calendar\n* Click on the date April 15th\n* Click on the \"Create\" button\n* Enter the event details:\n\t+ Title: COIN\n\t+ Location: [Venue name], DC (you can add the exact venue name if you know it)\n\t+ Time: [Time of the event]\n\t+ Description: Add any notes you want to remember, like \"Tickets purchased on [date]\" or \"Meeting friends at [time]\"\n\t+ Reminders: Set a reminder for the day before or a few hours before the event to ensure you don't forget\n* Click \"Save\"\n\n**Step 3: Add the Lucy Dacus event**\n\nRepeat the same steps as above, but for the Lucy Dacus event:\n\n* Click on the date May 1st\n* Click on the \"Create\" button\n* Enter the event details:\n\t+ Title: Lucy Dacus\n\t+ Location: Union Transfer, Philly\n\t+ Time: [Time of the event]\n\t+ Description: Add any notes you want to remember, like \"Considering meeting friends at [time]\" or \"Need to buy tickets by [date]\"\n\t+ Reminders: Set a reminder for the day before or a few hours before the event to ensure you don't forget\n* Click \"Save\"\n\nNow you should have both events added to your \"Concerts\" calendar! You can easily access and edit them from any device with an internet connection.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to set reminders for the events so you don't forget.\n* You can also add a link to the event ticket or a website with more information about the concert.\n* If you have friends attending the same event, you can invite them to the calendar event and share the details.\n* Consider adding a hashtag or label to the event title, like \"#indieRock\" or \"#concertSeason\", to help you quickly filter and search for specific types of events.\n\nHow's that? Do you have any other upcoming events you'd like to add to your calendar?",
