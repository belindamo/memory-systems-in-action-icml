  "content": "That's a great decision! Ticket to Ride is an excellent game that's perfect for a group of 5, and it's a great choice for a fun and engaging game night. Azul is an amazing game, but it's indeed better suited for 2-4 players.\n\nIt's awesome that you've been enjoying Azul with your roommate, and I'm sure you'll have a blast playing Ticket to Ride with your group of 5. Ticket to Ride is a great game for a larger group, and it's easy to learn and teach, so it's perfect for a game night with friends.\n\nIf you're looking for more games that are similar to Azul, you might want to consider other games that are great for 2-4 players. Some recommendations could be:\n\n* Splendor: A fast-paced card game where you collect gems and build a deck to gain points.\n* 7 Wonders: A card-drafting game where you build up your civilization by collecting cards.\n* Carcassonne: A tile-laying game where you build a medieval landscape and place your followers to score points.\n\nThese games are all great options for 2-4 players, and they have a similar level of complexity and strategy to Azul.\n\nLet me know if you need any more recommendations or have any other questions!",
