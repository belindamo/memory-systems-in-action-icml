Here are their ideal temperature ranges:\n\n**Amazon Swords:**\n\n* Ideal temperature: 72\u00b0F - 82\u00b0F (22\u00b0C - 28\u00b0C)\n* Tolerable temperature range: 68\u00b0F - 86\u00b0F (20\u00b0C - 30\u00b0C)\n\nAmazon Swords can tolerate a relatively wide temperature range, but they'll grow faster and more vigorously within their ideal temperature range.\n\n**Water Wisteria:**\n\n* Ideal temperature: 75\u00b0F - 85\u00b0F (24\u00b0C - 29\u00b0C)\n* Tolerable temperature range: 70\u00b0F - 90\u00b0F (21\u00b0C - 32\u00b0C)\n\nWater Wisteria prefers warmer water and can tolerate slightly higher temperatures than Amazon Swords. However, it's essential to maintain a stable temperature within its ideal range to promote healthy growth.\n\nSome general tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Avoid sudden temperature changes**: Gradual temperature changes are less stressful for plants than sudden fluctuations.\n* **Maintain a consistent temperature**: Try to keep your tank's temperature consistent, with minimal daily fluctuations.\n* **Monitor temperature extremes**: Be aware of temperature extremes, such as those caused by direct sunlight, heaters, or cold water changes.\n* **Consider the tank's overall ecosystem**: Remember that temperature affects not only plants but also fish and other aquatic organisms in your tank.\n\nTo maintain an ideal temperature for your plants, you can use a reliable aquarium heater, such as a submersible heater or a hang-on-back heater. Just be sure to choose a heater suitable for your tank size and type.\n\nBy providing your Amazon Swords and Water Wisteria with the right temperature, you'll create an optimal environment for them to thrive. Happy planting!",
