  "content": "The supporting cast in \"The Lobster\" is fantastic, and each character adds to the film's absurdity and charm. Here's a brief rundown of the main supporting characters:\n\n**Rachel Weisz as Short Sighted Woman:**\nA rebellious and brooding woman who becomes David's (Colin Farrell) love interest. She's a complex character with a mysterious past, and her dry wit and intensity bring a lot of depth to the film.\n\n**John C. Reilly as Lisping Man:**\nA awkward, nervous, and endearing character who's also a guest at the hotel. He's desperate to find a partner, and his attempts at romance are both cringe-worthy and pitiful.\n\n**Olivia Colman as Hotel Manager:**\nThe strict, emotionless, and sinister hotel manager who's determined to ensure all guests find a partner. She's a master of deadpan delivery, and her character adds to the film's sense of unease and oppression.\n\n**Ben Whishaw as Limping Man:**\nA nervous, fumbling, and awkward character who's also a guest at the hotel. He's desperate to fit in and find a partner, but his social awkwardness makes it difficult.\n\n**Ashley Jensen as Biscuit Woman:**\nA bubbly, cheerful, and slightly unhinged woman who's also a guest at the hotel. She's obsessed with finding a partner and will stop at nothing to achieve her goal.\n\n**Jessica Barden as Nosebleed Woman:**\nA quirky, awkward, and introverted woman who's part of the hotel's rebellion against the system. She's a fascinating character with a unique perspective on the world.\n\nThe entire cast delivers standout performances, bringing depth and nuance to their characters. The supporting cast's interactions with Colin Farrell's David are often hilarious, awkward, and poignant, adding to the film's offbeat charm.\n\nNow that you know more about the supporting cast, are you even more excited to watch \"The Lobster\"?",
