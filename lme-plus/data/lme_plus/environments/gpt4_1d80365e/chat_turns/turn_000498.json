However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have have direct access to specific product information or manufacturer data. But I can provide some general guidance on what to look for when researching the ingredients and safety of a fly spray.\n\n**Ingredients:**\nWhen researching the Pyranha Wipe N' Spray or any other fly spray, look for the active ingredients listed on the product label or manufacturer's website. Common active ingredients in fly sprays include:\n\n* Pyrethrin: A natural insecticide derived from chrysanthemum flowers, which is toxic to flies and other insects.\n* Permethrin: A synthetic version of pyrethrin, which is also toxic to flies and other insects.\n* Picaridin: A synthetic compound that repels flies and other biting insects.\n\n**Safety around the face and eyes:**\nWhen using any fly spray, it's essential to exercise caution when applying it around Comet's face and eyes. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Always read and follow the product label instructions.\n* Avoid spraying directly into Comet's eyes, nostrils, or mouth.\n* Use a gentle, gentle spray or wipe application around the face, being careful not to get the product in the eyes or nostrils.\n* If you need to apply the spray around the eyes, use a clean cloth or sponge to gently wipe the area, taking care to avoid getting the product in the eyes themselves.\n* If Comet has sensitive skin or allergies, perform a patch test on a small area of his skin before using the fly spray extensively.\n\n**Manufacturer's guidance:**\nTo get specific guidance on using Pyranha Wipe N' Spray around Comet's face and eyes, I recommend checking the product label, the manufacturer's website, or contacting their customer service directly. They can provide you with detailed information on the product's ingredients, usage guidelines, and safety precautions.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when introducing new products to your horse's care routine. If you're unsure about any aspect of using a fly spray, consult with your veterinarian for personalized advice.",
