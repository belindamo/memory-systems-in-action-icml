  "content": "Amazon Swords and Water Wisteria are both popular and easy-to-care-for plants that can thrive in a community tank. Here's some more information on their care and lighting requirements:\n\n**Amazon Swords (Echinocorys spp.)**\n\n* **Lighting:** Amazon Swords can tolerate a wide range of lighting conditions, from low to high. However, they'll produce more vibrant colors and grow faster in moderate to high lighting (2-4 watts per gallon). They can also benefit from some direct sunlight, but be careful not to overdo it, as this can cause algae growth.\n* **Water Parameters:** Amazon Swords prefer soft to moderately hard water (5-15 dGH) with a pH between 6.5-8.5. They can tolerate a temperature range of 72-82\u00b0F (22-28\u00b0C).\n* **Substrate:** Amazon Swords have a small root system, so they don't require a lot of substrate. A nutrient-rich substrate with a depth of 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) is sufficient.\n* **Fertilization:** Amazon Swords are heavy feeders and will benefit from regular fertilization. You can use a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n* **Pruning:** Amazon Swords can grow quite tall (up to 20 inches/50 cm), so regular pruning is necessary to maintain a desired height and encourage bushy growth. Simply trim off the top inch or two of the plant, and it will produce new leaves and stems.\n* **Propagation:** Amazon Swords can be easily propagated by dividing the rhizome (the thick, underground stem) or by planting the seeds produced by the plant.\n\n**Water Wisteria (Hygrophila difformis)**\n\n* **Lighting:** Water Wisteria prefers moderate to high lighting (2-4 watts per gallon), but it can tolerate low lighting conditions as well. However, it may not produce as many leaves or grow as quickly in low light.\n* **Water Parameters:** Water Wisteria prefers soft to moderately hard water (5-15 dGH) with a pH between 6.5-8.5. It can tolerate a temperature range of 72-82\u00b0F (22-28\u00b0C).\n* **Substrate:** Water Wisteria has a moderate root system, so it prefers a deeper substrate (2-3 inches/5-7.5 cm) with a nutrient-rich composition.\n* **Fertilization:** Water Wisteria is a fast-growing plant and will benefit from regular fertilization. You can use a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n* **Pruning:** Water Wisteria can grow quite long (up to 30 inches/75 cm), so regular pruning is necessary to maintain a desired length and encourage bushy growth. Simply trim off the longest stems, and the plant will produce new growth.\n* **Propagation:** Water Wisteria can be easily propagated by cutting off the stem tips (about 2-3 inches/5-7.5 cm long) and planting them in the substrate. You can also divide the roots or use the plant's natural ability to produce runners.\n\nSome general tips for both plants:\n\n* Make sure to provide adequate water circulation and oxygenation, as both plants can be prone to fungal infections in stagnant water.\n* Avoid over-handling the plants, as this can cause stress and lead to disease or algae growth.\n* Monitor the plants' growth and adjust their placement in the tank accordingly. Both plants can grow quite large, so make sure to leave enough space for them to thrive.\n\nBy following these care guidelines, you should be able to keep your Amazon Swords and Water Wisteria happy and healthy in your community tank!",
