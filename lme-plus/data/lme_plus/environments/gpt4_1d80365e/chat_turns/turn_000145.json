Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Pain relievers**: Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help alleviate sinus pressure and headaches. However, be sure to follow the recommended dosage and consult with your doctor if you have any medical conditions or take other medications.\n2. **Decongestants**: Decongestants like pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) or phenylephrine (Sudafed PE) can help reduce nasal congestion and sinus pressure. However, they can have side effects like insomnia, anxiety, and increased heart rate, so use them with caution and only as directed.\n3. **Saline nasal sprays**: Saline nasal sprays like Ocean or Simply Saline can help moisturize the nasal passages, thin out mucus, and reduce congestion. You can use them as often as needed.\n4. **Nasal strips**: Adhesive strips like Breathe Right can help open up your nasal passages and reduce congestion.\n5. **Expectorants**: Expectorants like guaifenesin (Mucinex) can help thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. This can provide relief from chest congestion, but it may not directly address sinus pressure.\n6. **Combination products**: Some OTC medications, like NyQuil or DayQuil, combine pain relievers, decongestants, and expectorants. These products can provide relief from multiple symptoms, but be sure to follow the instructions and warnings carefully.\n\nRemember to always read and follow the label instructions, and talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. It's also important to note that OTC medications can interact with other medications or worsen certain health conditions, so it's essential to consult with your doctor if you have any underlying health issues.\n\nIn addition to OTC medications, you can try some home remedies to alleviate sinus pressure and congestion:\n\n* Apply a warm compress to your face to loosen mucus and reduce sinus pressure.\n* Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air, which can help thin out mucus and reduce congestion.\n* Try a neti pot or saline rinse to clear out your nasal passages and sinuses.\n* Elevate your head while sleeping to reduce congestion and promote drainage.\n\nI hope this helps! If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's always a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider for further guidance.",
