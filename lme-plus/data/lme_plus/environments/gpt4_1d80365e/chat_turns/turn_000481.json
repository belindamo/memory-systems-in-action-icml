The department recognizes that the community is an important ally in preventing terrorism, and encourages New Yorkers to report any suspicious activity or behavior they observe. The NYPD has established several community outreach programs to build trust and foster cooperation between law enforcement and local residents. These programs include community meetings where residents can voice their concerns, educational sessions to teach the public about terrorism, and opportunities for the NYPD to hear from community leaders and stakeholders. The department also partners with local businesses, religious institutions, and other organizations to ensure they have the necessary information and resources to protect their locations against potential attacks.
