  "content": "It's understandable to feel frustrated and hurt when it seems like your dad cares more about his own ego than your happiness. It's important to remember that your dad's expectations may be rooted in his own experiences and beliefs, and it may take time for him to understand and accept your perspective.\n\nHaving an open and honest conversation with your dad about your desires and your frustrations can be helpful in finding common ground. It's important to express your needs and feelings in a calm and respectful manner, while also being willing to listen to and address your dad's concerns.\n\nUltimately, it's important to prioritize your own happiness and wellbeing, and to make decisions that align with your values and passions. While it can be difficult to navigate conflicting expectations and desires, focusing on your own goals and seeking support from others who value and encourage your choices can help you move towards a fulfilling future.",
