  "content": "Street art has evolved from traditional forms of graffiti to a more diverse and sophisticated form of urban art. It has developed into a platform for self-expression and cultural commentary, inspiring a new generation of artists and influencing the aesthetics of urban landscapes.\n\nStreet art has impacted urban culture by bringing art to the streets, and the people. It has broken down the boundaries between what is considered \"high\" and \"low\" art, making it more accessible to everyone. It has also become a tool for social and political commentary, raising awareness about issues such as social injustice, gentrification, and environmentalism.\n\nStreet art has also influenced the commercial world, with businesses employing street artists to create murals and installations as part of their branding and marketing strategies. This has helped to further blur the lines between art and advertising, and has given a new level of exposure to this form of art.\n\nOverall, street art has become a significant element of urban culture, contributing to the diversity and vibrancy of cities, and providing a unique voice for artists and communities alike.",
