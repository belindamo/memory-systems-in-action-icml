Remember, it's always better to be open and honest with your healthcare providers about your health status, especially when it comes to procedures or surgeries.\n\nDon't worry too much about the shot for numbing, it's a quick and relatively painless process. And, before you know it, you'll be done with the procedure and on your way to a healthier, happier smile!\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Otherwise, take care of yourself, and I hope your dentist appointment goes smoothly and successfully!\n\n(And don't forget to take care of that cold, too!",
