Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to help you with your question about fly sprays!\n\nThere are many effective fly sprays available on the market, and the best one for you will depend on your personal preferences, Comet's needs, and the type of flies you're dealing with. Here are a few popular options:\n\n1. **Pyranha Wipe N' Spray**: A popular choice among horse owners, this spray provides long-lasting protection against flies, mosquitoes, and ticks.\n2. **Endure Sweat-Resistant Fly Spray**: As the name suggests, this spray is designed to stay on even when Comet sweats, making it a great option for hot summer days.\n3. **Tri-Tec 14 Fly Spray**: This spray contains a unique blend of ingredients that provide broad-spectrum protection against flies, mosquitoes, and ticks.\n\nWhen choosing a fly spray, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Active ingredients**: Look for sprays containing ingredients like pyrethrin, permethrin, or picaridin, which are effective against flies and other biting insects.\n* **Duration of protection**: If you're looking for a spray that will last all day, choose one that provides long-lasting protection.\n* **Skin sensitivity**: If Comet has sensitive skin, opt for a spray that's gentle and non-irritating.\n* **Environmental concerns**: If you're concerned about the environmental impact of your fly spray, look for eco-friendly or natural options.\n\nRemember to always read and follow the product label instructions, and consult with your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy trails with Comet!",
