  "content": "Carcassonne is a great fit for a group of 5. While the game is typically designed for 2-4 players, there is an official 5-6 player expansion called \"Inns and Cathedrals\" that adds more tiles and meeples to accommodate additional players.\n\nWith the expansion, the gameplay remains largely the same, but you'll need to adjust the scoring rules slightly. The expansion introduces new tiles with inns and cathedrals, which provide additional scoring opportunities.\n\nHere are some pros and cons to consider when playing Carcassonne with 5 players:\n\nPros:\n\n* More players can participate, making it a great option for larger game groups.\n* The additional tiles and meeples introduce more variety and possibilities to the game.\n* The gameplay remains relatively fast-paced, even with more players.\n\nCons:\n\n* The game may take slightly longer to complete with 5 players, as there are more players placing tiles and making decisions.\n* The scoring can become more complex with more players, so it's essential to keep track of points accurately.\n\nIf you don't have the \"Inns and Cathedrals\" expansion, you can still play with 5 players, but you'll need to use some house rules to accommodate the additional player. One common approach is to remove some of the tiles from the game to reduce the overall number of tiles in play.\n\nOverall, Carcassonne is an excellent choice for a group of 5, especially if you're looking for a game that's easy to learn but still offers depth and strategy. With the \"Inns and Cathedrals\" expansion, you'll have a great experience with 5 players.",
