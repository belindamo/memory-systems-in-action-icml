  "content": "Yes, the NYPD has been successful in stopping numerous potential threats thanks in part to its extensive counterterrorism procedures. For example, in 2017, the department thwarted a plot to detonate a bomb in Times Square. Two years earlier, they prevented a plot to attack the city during the Thanksgiving Day Parade. And in 2011, they intercepted an explosives-laden vehicle that was en route to detonate in the city. Additionally, the NYPD has a robust intelligence-gathering program that helps them recognize and prevent potential threats before they can materialize. While the threat of terrorism is always present, the NYPD's efforts to coordinate with other law enforcement agencies and implement preemptive measures have been successful in preventing attacks in New York City.",
