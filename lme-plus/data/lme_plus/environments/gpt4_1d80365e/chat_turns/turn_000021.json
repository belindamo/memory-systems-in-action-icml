  "content": "Feeling like your parent is controlling can be a frustrating and overwhelming experience. It can feel like you're not being trusted to make your own decisions and live your life on your own terms. It's important to remember that this dynamic can come from a place of care and love, but expressing your need for independence and autonomy is also valid.\n\nHaving a respectful conversation with your dad about your desire for more independence can help improve your dynamic. Approach the conversation with an open mind and willingness to listen. Try to address specific behaviors that bother you and suggest alternative ways your dad can show support while also empowering you to make your own choices.\n\nIt can also be helpful to focus on building trust between you and your dad. Show him that you're responsible and capable of making good decisions. Be open and honest with him about your thoughts and feelings, and communicate any challenges or mistakes in a mature and constructive way.\n\nRemember that boundaries are important, and it's okay to set limits on your dad's involvement in your life. Prioritize your own needs and values, and don't be afraid to respectfully enforce your boundaries when necessary.",
