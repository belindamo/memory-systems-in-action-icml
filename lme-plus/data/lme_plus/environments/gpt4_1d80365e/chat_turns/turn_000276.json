  "content": "AI algorithms have limitations in assessing soft skills that are crucial factors in hiring. Soft skills like communication, team collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving require human assessment because they are subjective and cannot be quantified easily. AI algorithms cannot recognize the nuance and context that human recruiters can evaluate when assessing a candidate's soft skills. However, AI algorithms can be used to identify certain soft skills by analyzing a candidate's language from their resumes, online profiles, or video interviews. But, human recruiters can better assess soft skills through face-to-face interactions during the interview process that AI algorithms cannot simulate as effectively. Therefore, human recruiters still have an edge over AI algorithms in assessing a candidate's soft skills.",
