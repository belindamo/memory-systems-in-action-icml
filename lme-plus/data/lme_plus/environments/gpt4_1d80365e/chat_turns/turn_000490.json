I can suggest a few ways to help you find Dr. Thompson's contact information:\n\n1. **Search online**: Try searching for \"Dr. Thompson vet clinic [your city/state]\" or \"vet clinics near me\" on a search engine like Google. This should give you a list of nearby vet clinics, including Dr. Thompson's, along with their contact information.\n2. **Check online directories**: Websites like Yelp, Healthgrades, or the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) directory can help you find vet clinics in your area, including Dr. Thompson's.\n3. **Ask for referrals**: Reach out to friends, family, or fellow goat owners in your area for recommendations or referrals to Dr. Thompson's clinic.\n4. **Check your phonebook**: If you still have a physical phonebook, you can look up \"Veterinarians\" or \"Animal Hospitals\" in the yellow pages to find Dr. Thompson's contact information.\n\nOnce you have Dr. Thompson's contact information, you can give them a call to schedule an appointment for Luna and Leo's microchipping.\n\nRemember to also ask about any specific requirements or preparations needed for the microchipping procedure, such as fasting or vaccination records.\n\nGood luck, and I hope the appointment goes smoothly for your adorable goats!",
