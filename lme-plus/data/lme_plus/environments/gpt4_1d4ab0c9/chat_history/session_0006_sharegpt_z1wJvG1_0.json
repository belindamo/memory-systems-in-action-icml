You can use the `type()` function in Python to get the type of the object, and then compare it to the `Pawn` class.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code to check if the captured piece is a `Pawn`:\n```python\ncaptured = board.squares[released_row][released_col].has_piece()\nif captured:\n    captured_piece = board.squares[released_row][released_col].piece\n    if type(captured_piece) == piece.Pawn:\n        # Do something if the captured piece is a Pawn\n        print(\"Captured piece is a Pawn\")\n    else:\n        # Do something else if the captured piece is not a Pawn\n        print(\"Captured piece is not a Pawn\")\n```\nIn this code, we first check if a piece was captured, and if so, we extract the captured piece from the board using `board.squares[released_row][released_col].piece`. We then use the `type()` function to get the type of the captured piece, and compare it to the `Pawn` class. If the captured piece is a `Pawn`, we print a message saying so, and if it is not a `Pawn`, we print a different message.\n\nYou can replace the print statements with whatever code you want to execute depending on the type of the captured piece."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To add 1 to the `White_Points` variable when a `Pawn` is captured, you can simply use the `+=` operator to increment the value of `White_Points` by 1. You don't need to use `append()` as it is used to add an element to a list, not to increment a variable.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the code to increment `White_Points` by 1 when a `Pawn` is captured:\n```scss\nWhite_Points = 0\n\ncaptured = board.squares[released_row][released_col].has_piece()\nif captured:\n    captured_piece = board.squares[released_row][released_col].piece\n    if type(captured_piece) == piece.Pawn:\n        White_Points += 1\n        print(\"Captured piece is a Pawn\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Captured piece is not a Pawn\")\n\nprint(\"White points:\", White_Points)\n```\nIn this code, we increment `White_Points` by 1 using the `+=` operator when a `Pawn` is captured. We then print the value of `White_Points` using `print(\"White points:\", White_Points)` to show the updated score.\n\nYou can modify the code to keep track of the score for other pieces as well, by adding similar variables and incrementing them appropriately."
