That means changing the way you carry yourself and move (the neutral spine and all that). But it also means adopting and staying with our carefully designed (and progressive) exercise regimen. It is designed for back pain and it is essential for a permanent cure. And you have to do it correctly. There is an awful lot of text and a bunch of pictures about exercise in this book. But it\u2019s not because you have to do so many exercises; there really aren\u2019t that many. It\u2019s because we want you to do them right. Remember, you are far more likely to do these exercises with the compensatory patterns you have been doing for years unless you read closely and concentrate on doing them the right way. Doing them the wrong way will just make you better at doing bad things. \nOne great key to doing them right is to go slow in the learning process. Whether you\u2019re the type or not, you have to take it step-by-step. This is a healing process, and you cannot rush a healing process; it has its own rhythm and you have to follow it. Roll out these exercises slowly over time, progressing from one level to the next only when you \u201cget\u201d the level you are on and are ready to move up. \nRemember, it is these daily exercises that\u2014more than anything else\u2014are going to give most of you a significant and permanent reduction in pain and tightness. Other steps get you past the immediate pain. These steps make the change permanent. \nBe Still to Heal; Be Still to Stay Well \nOne of the main goals of changing your movement patterns is to make the \u201cbe still to heal\u201d concept (Rule #2, in Chapter 7) part of your daily life. Once you have achieved an initial fix, you don\u2019t have to be as still. But it is a great idea to learn to move with relative stillness (without moving your lumbar spine too much) all the time. \nThis is a big change for most of you, and you have to take it in steps; as I say, you have to crawl before you walk. The first step in learning to keep your lumbar spine still routinely is simply to learn to march in place, with a neutral spine. (This is the \u201ccrawl\u201d part of the process; it may seem too easy to bother with. It is not.) The goal is to learn to march in place with no lower spine movement. Then you can move on to other movements in this chapter.\nKey tip: If any of these movements hurt, take a step back to the last thing you could do without pain (marching in place, for instance). Stay with that for a few more days and then try to progress again. In theory, if you can march in place without pain, you can walk without pain and move without pain. It\u2019s just a matter of building up your core, turning on the right muscles, and learning to use those muscles to move in the right way. Whenever you have difficulty, go back to the previous step and start again. \nOkay, you\u2019ve done marching in place without moving your lower spine. Once that feels relatively simple, try doing this while walking. Things become a little murkier here because there are many factors at play. Because you are now weight-bearing, you need the support of important muscle groups like the glutes and latissimus dorsi (lats) to support your spine, in addition to the muscles we talked about in the core. If you can\u2019t do this at first without pain, follow the advice in the book for a while, and it will come once you have developed enough strength to support your spine while standing. \nWalking with Neutral Spine \nLearning to walk with a neutral spine means applying the same mechanics of your Slow March with Neutral Spine exercise to an upright, weight-bearing position. Almost everyone can improve their ability to walk without pain if they can do the slow march exercise on the ground. The distance you can walk without pain, or without significant increases in pain, will increase as you build core and gluteal strength and endurance by doing the exercises in this book. To get started on increasing your ability to walk with decreased pain, follow these directions:\nStep 1: Stand with good posture. Stand tall, shoulders back, head over your shoulders. Think of sticking your chest out and pulling your shoulder blades down and back. Make sure you aren\u2019t leaning forward. Tilt your pelvis back and forth (just like you did on the floor earlier), and stop where your lower back feels the most comfortable. \nStep 2: Use your core to lock your neutral spine in place. \nStep 3: Now try to walk while maintaining the position of your lower back and with the good posture you just set. It can help to put one hand on your stomach and one on your low back to feel for movement. Once you feel like you\u2019ve mastered maintaining neutral spine while walking, start to swing your arms from the shoulders, arm to opposite leg. This means if your right leg is swinging forward, your left arm should be as well. Make sure to always swing your arms from the shoulders as you walk; this helps dissipate force away from the spine. This movement takes time to master so don\u2019t get frustrated. Keep practicing. It gets easier after you have built endurance and strength in the muscles that support the spine. \nStep 4: If you sense your back is about to hurt, stop and have a seat for a few minutes and give your back a break. Then try walking a little longer. Over time, the period between these sitting breaks should increase, allowing you to walk farther without pain.\nNow let\u2019s move on to more complex movements. To make it easier (and to improve your chances of success) we are going to break those more complex movements down into pieces and then put them all together at the end. We will start with movement from the hips, a very basic move in all our lives all the time. Let\u2019s start with hip-hinging. Hip-hinging is a way to bend forward without stressing (i.e., bending) the spine. Done right, the axis of movement is in the hips, not the low back. Your low back should be in a protected neutral position with the core engaged. As you bend forward, your low back doesn\u2019t round or move. Let\u2019s look at a picture of hip-hinging and a picture of lumbar flexion (low back bending); one is good, the other is bad. This is simple stuff, but it is very hard to get over your ancient, bad habits. Hard but essential. } { Hip-Hinge with Neutral Spine\nHere are a couple of pictures showing you the right way to hinge (on the left) and the wrong way (on the right). Notice the very slightly curved lower back in the hip-hinge picture on the left: no movement. Excellent! The pic on the right has quite a lot of spine movement; don\u2019t do that. When you first try this movement, it may feel awkward, and you may assume that you cannot reach as far forward with good posture. Not so. You\u2019ll soon realize that you can move just as far forward, using only your hips, as you did before, using your back. You don\u2019t lose anything and you avoid a ton of pain. Over time you will gain mobility. The reason is that moving with your lower back eventually causes pain and stiffness in your back. But moving from your hips will not have that result. Let\u2019s practice doing it right. } { Full-Body Rotation\nThe chest, navel, and hips all move together. This means there is no (or very little) movement in the spine. The body rotates by moving the hips, knees, and pelvis. If the hips and pelvis stay facing forward while the rib cage moves, the movement comes from the waist, and therefore the lumbar spine. This type of movement can wear down the discs and joints in the spine over time, especially when additional load is applied (like unloading the dishwasher for instance). Just like hip-hinging, rotation done properly doesn\u2019t cause you to lose mobility and will improve athletic performance. Let\u2019s give it a try. Once again, the new movement is not that hard. But you are trying to unlearn a lifetime of moving with your spine. That is hard } { Torso Rotation with Hip-Hinge and Squat\nNow let\u2019s try to put those two movements\u2014the hip-hinge and the rotation\u2014together with a squat for a realistic, three-dimensional movement that allows you to accomplish everyday tasks (think unloading the dishwasher, putting up groceries) without stressing your back. You are going to rotate and bend down (hip-hinge), then come back up to the other side and extend. \nNotice that within that entire chain of movement, the person in the drawing does not really move his spine (look at the waist if you\u2019re having trouble visualizing that). The rib cage remains locked onto the pelvis the entire time. These pictures show you that you can go almost 180 degrees from side to side, stooping as low as you can and then extending as high as your hands can go, without compromising your back. Let\u2019s try it. } { TROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Knee pain: If your knees hurt as you start to rotate the torso, be lighter on your feet. Allow the feet to pivot a little bit. If the knees hurt when you are hinged forward at the bottom of the movement, drop your buttocks back more so that you are in a squat position (think of a baseball catcher) and lessen your range of motion. Try doing small movements and increase your range of motion gradually.\n\u2022 Back pain: If your back hurts with this one, it is likely you are twisting at the waist, rounding the back, or don\u2019t have the gluteal strength yet to perform this movement to its full range of motion. Do a little investigating: Can you hip-hinge without pain? If so, that\u2019s not the issue. Can you do the torso rotation without pain? Can you squat without pain? If you can do all three without pain then it is likely you are having difficulty putting all of these moves together without sacrificing form on one of them. Try doing this movement in very small pieces in front of a mirror or loved one, and gradually increase your range of motion over time. If any one piece causes pain, work on that one until you can do it pain-free, and then come back and try this movement again. \nRemember, these movements must become habits. That sounds daunting but it really isn\u2019t that hard. Once your back starts to feel better, it will let you know when you move the wrong way and you\u2019ll avoid that at all costs }\n\n\n of original book that I sent you and save it in your memory. Then, based on this text of chapter 15 of original book and your own information, continue the text of chapter 15 of the new book as much as you like. morover, explain it with deep learning to me as if i were 10 years old.The text should be completely scientific and academic and based on science World Day should be written and repetition should be avoided. that are not repetitive and related to this topic. this chapter of an original book that I gave you is just a starting point and he has the right to add relevant foliage to this section. based on chapter 15 of original book, you can start"
