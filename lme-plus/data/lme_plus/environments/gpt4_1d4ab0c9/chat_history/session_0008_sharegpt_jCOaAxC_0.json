      "content": "If all of our beliefs were compatible with the belief \"I may fail, I may fail to notice I'm failing, and I'm trying to be a good person,\" it could lead to a more humble and self-aware approach to life. We would be more open to the possibility that we may be wrong or that we may have blind spots in our understanding. This could lead to more critical thinking and less dogmatic thinking. Additionally, the emphasis on \"trying to be a good person\" could lead to more empathy and compassion in our interactions with others."
