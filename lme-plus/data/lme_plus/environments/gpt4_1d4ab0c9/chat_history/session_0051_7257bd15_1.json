But I can suggest some ways for you to find out the weather forecast for your hometown.\n\nYou can try checking the following websites or apps:\n\n1. National Weather Service (NWS) - weather.gov: This is a reliable source for weather forecasts, warnings, and conditions in the United States.\n2. AccuWeather - accuweather.com: A popular weather forecasting website and app that provides detailed forecasts, including hourly and 15-day forecasts.\n3. Weather.com - weather.com: A well-known weather website and app that provides current weather conditions, forecasts, and weather news.\n4. Dark Sky - darksky.net (or download the app): A weather app that provides hyperlocal weather forecasts, which means it can provide minute-by-minute forecasts for your exact location.\n\nYou can also tune into local news or weather radio stations in your hometown to get the latest weather forecast.\n\nRegarding your morning jogging schedule, yes, the days are getting shorter during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, which means the sun rises later in the morning. This is because of the Earth's tilt and rotation. The exact time of sunrise varies depending on your location and time zone, but it's not uncommon for the sun to rise around 7:00 am or later during the winter months.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a wonderful trip to visit your family for Christmas!"

Here are some tips to help you stay warm and comfortable during your flight:\n\n1. **Dress in layers**: Wear breathable, comfortable clothing that can be easily added or removed as needed. This will help you regulate your body temperature. Consider wearing thermal underwear, fleeces, or sweaters.\n2. **Bring a travel blanket or scarf**: If you get cold easily, bring a lightweight blanket or scarf to keep yourself warm. Some airlines provide blankets, but it's always a good idea to bring your own.\n3. **Wear warm socks**: Cold feet can make you feel cold overall. Wear thick, warm socks or bring a spare pair in case your feet get cold during the flight.\n4. **Choose a comfortable seat**: If possible, opt for a seat near the front of the plane or over the wing, which tends to be warmer than seats near the back or over the engines.\n5. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the flight to stay warm and avoid dehydration.
