      "content": "Life expectancy, or the average amount of time that a person is expected to live, has increased significantly over the past few centuries due to advances in medicine and improvements in living conditions. In the past, life expectancy was often much lower due to the high rates of infant mortality and the prevalence of diseases.\n\nAs far as the progression of human invention, there have been countless inventions throughout history that have had a major impact on society. Some examples of notable inventions include the wheel, the printing press, and the internet. These inventions have greatly improved our ability to communicate, transport goods, and access information. Overall, the progression of human invention has greatly enhanced our quality of life and has greatly increased our life expectancy."

      "content": "The survivability of a person or group of people can often depend on the availability of resources, such as food, water, shelter, and medical care. In situations where these resources are scarce, the likelihood of survival may be greatly reduced. For example, if a person is stranded in a desert without access to water, their chances of survival may be very low.\n\nOn the other hand, if a person has access to a sufficient amount of resources, their chances of survival may be much higher. For example, if a person has access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, they may be able to survive for a longer period of time.\n\nOverall, the availability of resources can have a significant impact on a person's ability to survive in various situations."
