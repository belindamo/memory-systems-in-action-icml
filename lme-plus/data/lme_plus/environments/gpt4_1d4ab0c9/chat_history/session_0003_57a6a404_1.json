The Togo leather used in the Lindy is highly resistant to scratches, cracks, and fading, making it an excellent choice for daily use. With proper care, a Lindy can last for 10, 20, or even 30 years or more, depending on how well it's maintained.\n\nHerm\u00e8s' leather is carefully selected and worked to ensure that it develops a beautiful patina over time, giving the bag a unique character and charm. The leather will soften slightly with use, but it will retain its shape and structure.\n\n**Care Instructions:**\n\nTo maintain the quality and longevity of your Herm\u00e8s Lindy, follow these care instructions:\n\n1. **Avoid exposure to direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause the leather to fade, dry out, or become brittle. If possible, store your Lindy in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.\n2. **Keep it dry**: Avoid exposing your Lindy to water or excessive humidity. If it gets wet, gently blot the area with a soft cloth and allow it to air dry. Avoid using harsh chemicals or conditioners, as they can damage the leather.\n3. **Handle with care**: Be gentle when handling your Lindy, as rough handling can cause scratches or scuffs. Avoid throwing or dropping the bag, as this can cause damage to the leather or the frame.\n4. **Clean it occasionally**: Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe away dirt or debris from the leather. For more thorough cleaning, use a gentle leather cleaner specifically designed for Herm\u00e8s leather. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as they can damage the leather.\n5. **Condition it periodically**: Herm\u00e8s recommends conditioning your Lindy every 6-12 months to maintain the leather's suppleness and prevent it from drying out. Use a gentle leather conditioner specifically designed for Herm\u00e8s leather.\n6. **Store it properly**: When not in use, store your Lindy in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Use a dust bag or a soft cloth to cover the bag, and avoid stacking it on top of other bags or items.\n\n**Warranty and Repair:**\n\nHerm\u00e8s offers a 2-year warranty on all its products, including the Lindy. If you encounter any issues with your bag during this period, you can contact Herm\u00e8s for repair or replacement.\n\nAfter the warranty period, Herm\u00e8s offers a repair service for its products. If your Lindy requires repair, you can contact Herm\u00e8s or an authorized dealer for assistance. Herm\u00e8s' skilled artisans will carefully repair your bag to restore it to its original condition.\n\n**Resale Value:**\n\nThe Herm\u00e8s Lindy is a highly sought-after handbag, and its resale value is excellent. With proper care and maintenance, a pre-owned Lindy can retain up to 70-80% of its original value. This makes it a wise investment for those who plan to keep the bag for many years or resell it in the future.\n\nI hope this information helps you make an informed decision about the Herm\u00e8s Lindy!"
