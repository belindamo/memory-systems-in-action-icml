      "content": "Takoyaki is a popular Japanese street food consisting of small balls of batter filled with diced octopus, tempura scraps, green onions, and other ingredients, and then cooked in a special takoyaki grill or pan. Once cooked, takoyaki is typically topped with savory Okonomiyaki sauce, mayonnaise, and aonori (seaweed flakes). \n\nThe texture of Takoyaki is soft on the outside and slightly crispy on the inside. The filling of octopus gives it a chewy texture and a slightly fishy taste that is balanced by the tanginess of the Okonomiyaki sauce and sweetness of the mayonnaise. Overall, takoyaki has a savory and umami flavor that is sure to please any food lover."
