The arithmetica consisted\nof performing calculations on a counting board and with help of roman numerals, the theory of\nratios (as an introduction to musica), biblical numerology and the computus rules. Many Christian\nthinkers tended to agree upon the date of June 12, 5012 BC at noon, as the time for Creation. In a\ntime that the Bible was considered the most important text, one can imagine that these kind of\ncalculations were of the utmost importance. Musica consisted of the theory of chords in connection\nto ratios of string length, and the ways to indicate notes. The art of geometria was mostly\nrestricted to knowledge of the names of various geometrical objects. Triangles, cones, spheres\nand the regular solids were interesting for their connection to the world order. The equilateral\ntriangle, for example, was viewed in connection to the Holy Trinity. Mostly the objects themselves\nwere considered fascinating: proofs were not considered important, although use of the\nPythagorean theorem was known. Finally, astronomia consisted of knowledge about movement\nof the stars and planets on the basis of the Ptolemaic system. The connection with astrology was\nnot always popular, since it seemed to deny the possibility of a free choice of will. At courts,\nhowever, trust in or need for predictions was in cases considered more important than religious\npiety. So in practice, the knowledge of astrology was still valued and this implied interest in geometria\nas well.\nMathematical worlds 37\nIllustration I.9: God as a philosopher doing geometria in the act of Creation. Frontispiece of a Bible, codex Vindobonensis\n2554, France ca. 1250, \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek Wien. The discovery of ancient Greek manuscripts\nhad these kind of consequences for Christian iconography.\nEuclid seemed to be forgotten. The few manuscripts kept in the libraries of monasteries were\nhardly consulted until the 10th century. Boethius, on the contrary, was kept alive. The interest of\nChristian thinkers for knowledge of the quadrivium was mostly for its mystical aspects and for\nthe rules it had to offer. The fact that it was framed in four subjects that were fundamental and\nessential in the education of every free man, and that were not considered to be trivial (contrary\nto the subjects within the trivium), does illustrate the fact that knowledge of geometria and\narithmetica was valued, albeit for completely different reasons than we might recognise. Number\nand geometrical objects, through the ideas in musica and astronomia offered the possibility to\nmake the human mind rise to reach spiritual truths that were considered valuable. As such, it\nwas only natural that this knowledge would play a role in churches, monasteries and objects of\nart, visible and audible in the positioning of buildings, musical masses and christian iconography.\nIn a way, this implied a Christian version of the Platonic ideas about geometria, God had created\nthe world either with help of knowledge of geometria, or had hidden its purities in His Creation.\nThat made the field of knowledge worthy of study, if only because one wanted to be able to\nrecognise these elements in Creation.\nRise of the universitas\nThe life of Gerbert of Aurillac (946-1003) may be considered important to the rise of mathematical\nthinking in Europe. In three ways, his life illustrates that a new kind of purpose for the fields of\ngeometria and arithmetica was growing in importance. One could say, Gerbert illustrates how\nmathematics was cashing in on the possibilities it held for Christian philosophy. First of all, Gerbert\nstudied. He traveled extensively to find and read manuscripts and also studied texts from\nnon- and pre-Christian origin. His interest for Euclidean manuscripts gave impetus to his work De\nGeometria: a compilation of what he understood from The Elements, that became widespread\nthrough his extensive network of correspondence. It is easy to be dismissive of his grasp of Euclids\nwork, of which indeed, his knowledge would remain superficial, the correspondence giving\nevidence to shear endless confusion about the question what Euclid could have meant with the\nexterior angle in a triangle. But the level of understanding is not as important as the fact that he\ndid make these fields relevant, and open to study. To summarize: Gerbert set a new ideal of studying.\nTrying to understand something new, either by studying different sources or by thinking\nfor oneself, and testing knowledge by discussing it with others \u2014 in correspondence or life \u2014\nwas normalised.\nSecond, not only did he set a new standard to studying, he also managed to popularise it because\nhe was an influential Christian thinker. Perhaps it was exactly his newly acquired knowledge\nthat made him stand out at the court of emperor Otto II, perhaps he was already well connected\nand the emperor stimulated him in his studies. Whatever was the case, Gerbert was an important\nman at the imperial court. In those days it was only too easy to be dismissive of someone who\nhad studied geometria and arithmetica, certainly when his knowledge came from dubious and\nMathematical worlds 38\neven heretic sources. A pact with the devil was easily suggested, and that made it impossible to\nrise in the ranks of the court or the church. Political and papal opponents of Gerbert indeed did\ntry to blacken him, but the fact that they didn\u2019t succeed in blocking his rising star, first as the tutor\nof the later Otto III at the imperial court, and his eventual election to be the pope under the\nname of Sylvester II, illustrates that indeed his way of studying became a new example. If only\naccessible to the privileged, study would become a prerequisite for many positions \u2014 an idea\nthat would soon be copied by those who wanted to mimic the (papal) aristocracy.\nThird, and this might have been most significant, Gerbert took non Christian knowledge serious.\nOf course he was a very pious man, but by studying Arab and Greek manuscripts and taking\nthem at face value, and by the influential man he was (or became) by his position, he greatly enhanced\nthe possibilities of study. Most notably, Gerbert visited the Muselmen libraries of the Iberian\npeninsula. That is where he learned about Roman surveying techniques, use of the abacus\nand Arab numerals. With his impact on the political and cultural ways of his time, this made\nknowledge of the ancient arts of geometria and arithmetica open to a more fundamental role in\nEuropean society.\nKnowledge, in the shape of books and scrolls, was in the possession of monasteries. Libraries in\nsuch enormous monastery cities such as Cluny, set an example to the orders. Most notably in the\nwealthy cities, where the monasteries with help of local wealth would create enormous cathedrals\nthat helped to spread the splendour, grandeur and superiority of Christianity and its God\nfar beyond the city limits, knowledge was also considered as wealth. Either the court or local\nMathematical worlds 39\nIllustration I.10: Manuscript of De Geometria by\nGerbert of Aurillac. The discovery of geometria,\nmost notably Euclidean manuscripts, in the\nChristian world was connected to the idea that\nGod would have created the world with ruler\nand compass. Interest in the language of\ngeometria was therefor more precious than the\nproofs that had been the core to the Greek.\nNevertheless the language of the old manuscripts\nalso had as a consequence that the\nmanuscripts themselves became of interest.\nThe correspondence by Gerbert and the\nknowledge he obtained in Arabian occupied\nterritory, was to spread that knowledge\nthroughout the western world.\nmerchants, valued knowledge of Law, medicine and Theology, and accumulation of manuscripts\nwas considered part of that. The presence of manuscripts, attracting scholars who wanted to\nstudy these, in combination with eager students who wanted a part of that knowledge, made\nthat exactly at these kind of places, the first cathedral schools were founded: Bologna (1088), the\nSorbonne (1150) and Oxford (1164) all started a universitas, as it was called. A universitas was a\ngroup of scholars, mostly monks, that debated among each other and who took pupils to educate\non any subject they wanted to be taught in. The universitas was greatly valued by city or court\nofficials, who could benefit from the knowledge that dwelled in these places, and so it became\ncustomary that these places were funded and granted certain privileges. For example, students\nand professors at the universitas were exempted from paying taxes on the consumption of alcohol,\nin many places members of the universitas were allowed to carry weapons, and were subject\nto their own courts and internal laws. Thereby, the universitas developed into an own cultural\ncenter, a subculture with its own rules and habits, within society. And in that new subculture, the\nuse and purpose of knowledge of geometria and arithmetica could develop in a direction different\nfrom that outside its walls. And so it did.\n\nend",
