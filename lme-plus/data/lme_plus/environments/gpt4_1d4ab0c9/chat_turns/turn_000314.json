The song is an uplifting and energetic pop-rock anthem that contrasts with the band's previous post-punk sound.\n\nLyrically, the song touches on feelings of isolation and loneliness but encourages listeners to come together and celebrate the fact that \"we all are shining stars.\" The chorus repeats the line \"We all are shining in this light,\" emphasizing the idea that everyone has value and should be celebrated.\n\nThe verses touch on themes of personal growth and change, with references to \"the journey that we're on\" and \"the battles that we've fought.\" The overall message of the song is one of hope and community, urging everyone to be proud of who they are and to come together to celebrate life.\n\nSome other notable lyrics from the song include:\n\n- \"We've been lost, we've been found, we've been walking through the dark\"\n- \"We don't have to pretend, we don't have to belong\"\n- \"We all are shining in this light, we all are rising like the tide\"",
