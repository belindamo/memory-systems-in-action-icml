I've also been thinking about packing some comfort food like homemade cookies or energy bars to keep me fueled during the flight. Speaking of food, do you have any recommendations for hearty winter stews or soups that I can make before I leave? Something that can be easily reheated and packed in a thermos for the flight?",
