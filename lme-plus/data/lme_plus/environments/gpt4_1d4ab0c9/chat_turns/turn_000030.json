  "content": "Here are some additional considerations that you might want to keep in mind when designing a comprehensive leave management system that allocates leave days to employees based on their joined or confirmation date:\n\n1. Leave balance calculation: You might want to consider how to calculate the leave balance of employees. For example, you might choose to start employees with a full leave balance based on their joined or confirmation date, or you might choose to start them with a partial leave balance and allow them to accrue additional leave days over time.\n2. Leave rollover: You might want to include provisions in your leave policy to allow employees to roll over a certain number of unused leave days to the next year. For example, you might allow employees to roll over up to 10 days of unused leave to the next year. You can implement this by tracking the number of unused leave days in the leave audit table and adding them to the employee's leave balance at the start of the new year.\n3. Leave request history: You might want to include a feature in your comprehensive leave management system that allows employees to view their leave request history, including the dates and duration of their previous leave requests, the status of their requests (approved, rejected, or pending), and the reason for any rejections. You can implement this by storing the relevant information in the leave audit table and providing a user interface that allows employees to view and filter their leave request history.\n4. Leave request approvals by proxy: You might want to include a feature in your comprehensive leave management system that allows employees to delegate their leave request approvals to a proxy, such as a team leader or manager. You can implement this by adding a proxy field to the employee's record in the database and modifying the leave request approval process to check if the employee has a proxy designated. If the employee has a proxy, the leave request should be forwarded to the proxy for approval.\n5. Integration with Single Sign-On (SSO): If your organization uses a Single Sign-On (SSO) system, you might want to integrate your comprehensive leave management system with SSO to allow employees to use their SSO credentials to log in to the system and access their leave information. You can use a library like passport-saml to integrate your system with SAML-based SSO systems.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the types of features and considerations that you might want to include in a comprehensive leave management system that allocates leave days to employees based on their joined or confirmation date. The specific features and considerations will depend on the requirements and constraints of your specific use case. You might need to modify the approach to fit your specific needs and constraints.",
