Both have their pros and cons, which I'll outline below:\n\n**Niche-Focused Approach:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Targeted audience**: By focusing on a specific niche, you'll attract a targeted audience interested in that topic.\n2. **Establish authority**: You'll be seen as an expert in your niche, which can lead to more engagement and trust from your audience.\n3. **Content direction**: A clear niche gives you direction for future content, making it easier to plan and create videos.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Limited scope**: Focusing on a single niche might limit your creative freedom and scope for content.\n2. **Competition**: Niches can be competitive, making it harder to stand out and attract views.\n\n**Generalist Approach:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Creative freedom**: You'll have the freedom to create content on a wide range of topics, allowing you to explore different interests and passions.\n2. **Broader appeal**: Your channel will appeal to a broader audience, as you'll cover various topics that might interest different people.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Lack of focus**: Without a clear niche, your content might seem scattered or unfocused, making it harder to attract a dedicated audience.\n2. **Difficulty standing out**: With a generalist approach, it can be challenging to stand out in a crowded YouTube landscape.\n\n**My Suggestion**\n\nSince you're just starting out, I recommend starting with a generalist approach. This will give you the freedom to experiment with different content types, find your voice, and understand what resonates with your audience.\n\nAs you create more content, you'll naturally find that certain topics or themes emerge as favorites among your viewers. You can then use this feedback to refine your content and potentially focus on a specific niche or sub-niche.\n\n**Your Beach Trip Vlog**\n\nFor your beach trip vlog, you can simply focus on sharing your experience and thoughts without worrying too much about fitting into a specific niche. This will help you get started with creating content and building your YouTube presence.\n\nOnce you've uploaded a few videos, you can reassess and refine your content strategy based on audience feedback and your own preferences.\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any other questions about getting started with YouTube or content creation?",
