  "content": "The issue seems to be that you are trying to compare an object to a class rather than an instance of the class. Instead of comparing `the_captured_piece` to `piece.Pawn`, you should compare it to an instance of the `Pawn` class, like this:\n```python\nif isinstance(the_captured_piece, Pawn):\n    # do something\n```\nThis code will check if `the_captured_piece` is an instance of the `Pawn` class and execute the code inside the `if` statement if it is.",
