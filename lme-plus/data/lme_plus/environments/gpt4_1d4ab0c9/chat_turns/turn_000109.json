  "content": "In the early middle ages, the study of mathematics was seen as an important aspect of the education of a free man. The mathematical fields of arithmetica, musica, geometria, and astronomia were considered to be part of the quadrivium, and were valued for their mystical and spiritual aspects. These fields were used to understand and recognize the connections to the world order, the Holy Trinity, and even the creation of the world itself. Gerbert of Aurillac, who lived from 946-1003, was an influential Christian thinker who helped popularize the study of mathematics by studying and spreading knowledge of Euclidean manuscripts, and setting a new standard for studying and understanding. Despite political opposition, Gerbert's knowledge of mathematics made him an important figure at the imperial court.",
