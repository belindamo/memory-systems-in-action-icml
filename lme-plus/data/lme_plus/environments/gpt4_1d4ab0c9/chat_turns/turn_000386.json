However, I have to say that the details about when and where you bought the backpack, including the discount, aren't really relevant to packing efficiently. But I'm excited to help you with some general tips!\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you pack efficiently:\n\n1. **Plan ahead**: Make a list of the activities you'll be doing and the weather forecast for your destination. This will help you determine what clothing and gear to pack.\n2. **Pack multipurpose items**: Choose items that can serve multiple purposes, like a sarong that can be used as a blanket, towel, or dress.\n3. **Roll your clothes**: Rolling your clothes instead of folding them can help reduce wrinkles and save space in your backpack.\n4. **Use packing cubes**: Packing cubes or small stuff sacks can help you organize your gear and compress your clothing to make the most of your backpack's space.\n5. **Pack essentials in easy-to-reach places**: Pack your passport, phone charger, and other essentials in easily accessible pockets or compartments.\n6. **Wear bulky items**: Consider wearing your bulkiest items, like your coat or boots, on the plane or during travel to save space in your backpack.\n7. **Use every available space**: Make the most of your backpack's compartments and pockets by filling them with smaller items like socks or underwear.\n8. **Pack a portable laundry kit**: A small laundry kit with travel-sized detergent, a travel wash line, and a few clothespins can be a lifesaver if you need to wash clothes on the go.\n9. **Keep valuables safe**: Keep your valuables, like your laptop or camera, in a safe and secure compartment, and consider using a luggage tracker or lock for added security.\n10. **Pack a first-night bag**: Pack a small bag with essentials like a change of clothes, toiletries, and medications in case your backpack is delayed or lost.\n\nRemember to check the weather forecast and adjust your packing list accordingly. It's also a good idea to weigh your packed backpack to ensure you're within the airline's weight limits.\n\nI hope these tips help you pack efficiently for your trip!",
