  "content": "To use the information that the captured piece is a Pawn, you can extract the type of the piece from the printed output. You can use the `type()` function in Python to get the type of the object, and then compare it to the `Pawn` class.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code to check if the captured piece is a `Pawn`:\n```python\ncaptured = board.squares[released_row][released_col].has_piece()\nif captured:\n    captured_piece = board.squares[released_row][released_col].piece\n    if type(captured_piece) == piece.Pawn:\n        # Do something if the captured piece is a Pawn\n        print(\"Captured piece is a Pawn\")\n    else:\n        # Do something else if the captured piece is not a Pawn\n        print(\"Captured piece is not a Pawn\")\n```\nIn this code, we first check if a piece was captured, and if so, we extract the captured piece from the board using `board.squares[released_row][released_col].piece`. We then use the `type()` function to get the type of the captured piece, and compare it to the `Pawn` class. If the captured piece is a `Pawn`, we print a message saying so, and if it is not a `Pawn`, we print a different message.\n\nYou can replace the print statements with whatever code you want to execute depending on the type of the captured piece.",
