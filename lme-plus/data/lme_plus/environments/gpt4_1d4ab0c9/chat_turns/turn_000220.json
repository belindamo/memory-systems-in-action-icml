  "content": "A squares pool is a fantastic way to add some extra excitement to your fantasy football draft party!\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to setting up a squares pool:\n\n**What is a Squares Pool?**\nA squares pool is a popular contest where participants buy squares on a 10x10 grid, with each square corresponding to a score combination (e.g., 0-0, 1-1, 2-2, etc.). At the end of each quarter, the last digit of each team's score is used to determine the winner.\n\n**How to Set Up a Squares Pool:**\n\n1. **Create a 10x10 Grid:** You can use a piece of paper, a whiteboard, or even a digital tool like Google Sheets to create a 10x10 grid. Label the rows and columns 0-9.\n2. **Sell Squares:** Divide the grid into 100 individual squares, and sell each square to your guests for a set amount (e.g., $5-10 per square). You can also offer discounts for buying multiple squares.\n3. **Assign Numbers:** Randomly assign numbers 0-9 to each row and column. This will determine the winning squares.\n4. **Determine Payouts:** Decide on the payout structure for each quarter. A common format is:\n\t* 1st Quarter: 20% of the pot\n\t* 2nd Quarter: 20% of the pot\n\t* 3rd Quarter: 20% of the pot\n\t* 4th Quarter (Final Score): 40% of the pot\n5. **Collect Money:** Collect the money from each guest and put it into a central pot.\n6. **Display the Grid:** Display the grid prominently at the party, so everyone can see the squares and the corresponding numbers.\n7. **Update and Announce Winners:** After each quarter, update the grid with the current scores and announce the winning squares.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Use a Random Number Generator:** To add an extra layer of randomness, use a random number generator to determine the winning numbers for each quarter.\n* **Offer Multiple Pools:** Consider offering multiple pools with different entry fees or payout structures to cater to different guests' preferences.\n* **Make it More Engaging:** Consider offering additional prizes for specific scenarios, such as \"most points scored in a quarter\" or \"longest touchdown of the game.\"\n* **Keep it Simple:** Make sure to explain the rules clearly and concisely, so all guests understand how the pool works.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a fun and engaging squares pool to add to your fantasy football draft party. Good luck, and may the best square win!",
