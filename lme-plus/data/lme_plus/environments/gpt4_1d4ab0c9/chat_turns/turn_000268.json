While opinions may vary, here's a general idea of what to expect:\n\n**Difficulty Level:**\nSekiro is a challenging game, but its difficulty is different from other FromSoftware titles. It's not necessarily harder or easier, but rather, it requires a unique set of skills and strategies. Here's why:\n\n1. **Stealth and Strategy:** Sekiro emphasizes stealth, strategy, and patience. You'll need to use your wits to overcome obstacles, rather than relying solely on brute force.\n2. **Combat:** Combat is still challenging, but it's more focused on timing, positioning, and exploiting enemy weaknesses. You'll need to learn enemy patterns, use your prosthetic tools effectively, and parry attacks to succeed.\n3. **No Summoning:** Unlike Dark Souls or Bloodborne, Sekiro doesn't allow co-op or summoning other players for assistance. You're on your own, which adds to the game's sense of isolation and challenge.\n4. **Resurrection:** When you die, you can resurrect on the spot, but at the cost of some of your power.

It's a more methodical game that requires a different set of skills.\n4. **Demon's Souls:** Demon's Souls is often considered the most accessible FromSoftware game, with a more gradual difficulty curve and a greater emphasis on exploration.\n\n**Tips for New Players:**\nIf you're new to FromSoftware games or Sekiro, here are some tips to help you overcome the challenge:\n\n1. **Take your time:** Sekiro is a game that rewards patience and strategy.
