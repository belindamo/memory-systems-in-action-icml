Here are some recipes for homemade fertilizers that you can try:\n\n1. **Epsom Salt Fertilizer**: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom salt with 1 gallon of water. Epsom salt provides magnesium and sulfur, which can help with seed germination, root growth, and overall plant health.\n2. **Banana Peel Fertilizer**: Bury banana peels around the base of your plants. As they break down, they'll release potassium, which is essential for fruiting and flowering. You can also dry and crush the peels to make a fertilizer tea.\n3. **Coffee Ground Fertilizer**: Use spent coffee grounds to add nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to your soil. Mix 1 part coffee grounds with 10 parts water to create a fertilizer tea.\n4. **Eggshell Calcium Fertilizer**: Crush eggshells and mix them into your soil to provide calcium, which is essential for plant cell wall development and root growth.\n5. **Bokashi Compost**: Create a bokashi bin using a mixture of vegetable scraps, sawdust, and microorganisms. This will break down organic matter quickly and create a nutrient-rich fertilizer.\n6. **Manure Tea**: Steep a bucket of animal manure (e.g., chicken or cow) in water for 2-3 weeks. Strain the liquid and use it as a fertilizer tea. This is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n7. **Fish Emulsion Fertilizer**: Mix 1 tablespoon of fish emulsion with 1 gallon of water. Fish emulsion is high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, making it an excellent fertilizer for fruiting and flowering plants.\n8. **Compost Tea**: Steep a bucket of compost in water for 24-48 hours. Strain the liquid and use it as a fertilizer tea. This is rich in beneficial microorganisms and nutrients.\n\nRemember to always use these homemade fertilizers in moderation and in combination with other fertilizers as needed. It's also essential to test your soil pH and nutrient levels to ensure you're providing the right balance of nutrients for your plants.\n\nFor your cherry tomato plants, you can try using a combination of Epsom salt fertilizer and compost tea to provide a balanced diet of nutrients.\n\nKeep in mind that these homemade fertilizers might not provide the same immediate results as commercial fertilizers, but they can be a more sustainable and cost-effective option in the long run. Happy gardening!",
