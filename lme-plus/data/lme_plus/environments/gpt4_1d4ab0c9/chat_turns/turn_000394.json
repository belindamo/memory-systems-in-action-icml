Wearing your bulkiest shoes on the plane is a great idea, as it will save space in your backpack and make your journey more comfortable.\n\nUsing a shoe bag to keep your shoes clean and organized is also a great idea. It will not only protect your shoes from dirt and scuffs but also keep your clothes and other gear clean and organized.\n\nWith your new backpack's multiple compartments, you'll be able to keep your shoes, clothes, and other gear separate and easily accessible. Just remember to pack smart, pack light, and pack only what you need.\n\nIt's great that you're thinking ahead and planning your packing strategy. You're going to have a fantastic trip, and with your new backpack and packing skills, you'll be ready for anything that comes your way!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, happy packing, and safe travels!",
