Construction of schools and educational institutions in low-income areas to improve access to education for children from low-income families. 2. Building of hospitals and healthcare facilities in remote and underserved areas to improve access to healthcare services for disadvantaged communities. 3. Development of public transportation systems with a focus on improving safety for women, such as designated women-only coaches, helpline services, and CCTV surveillance. 4. Creation of community-based water supply and sanitation systems in rural areas, especially those occupied by low-caste communities, to improve access to clean water and sanitation services. 5. Construction of affordable housing for marginalized groups with secure tenant rights and access to basic amenities, such as electricity and sanitation facilities. 6. Development of economic and social infrastructure in tribal areas, such as roads, irrigation systems, and markets, to improve economic opportunities for tribal communities.
