  "content": "If your company's annual turnover is below the GST registration threshold of INR 40 lakhs, your company is not required to register for GST or charge GST on its taxable supplies. However, you may still be required to pay GST on your business inputs (e.g., the goods and services you purchase for your business). You may be able to claim GST credits for the taxes paid on your business inputs if you are registered for GST.\n\nAs a partner in the business, you will also be required to pay income tax on your share of the profits at the applicable tax rates. You will need to file an income tax return each year to report your income and pay any taxes due.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.",
