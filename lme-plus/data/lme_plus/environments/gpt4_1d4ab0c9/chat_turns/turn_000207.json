  "content": "Yes, based on the available information, Freddie Freeman is actually performing well against left-handed pitchers this season. Here are some statistics from the 2021 season:\n\n- AVG vs LHP: .361\n- OBP vs LHP: .444\n- SLG vs LHP: .573\n- OPS vs LHP: 1.017\n\nAs you can see, Freeman's batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS are all higher against left-handed pitchers than they are against right-handed pitchers this season. His success against left-handed pitchers is likely due to his ability to adjust his hitting approach and use his opposite-field power, as he has hit four homers to the opposite field so far this season.\n\nOverall, it seems that Freddie Freeman is not struggling against left-handed pitchers this season and is performing well against them.",
