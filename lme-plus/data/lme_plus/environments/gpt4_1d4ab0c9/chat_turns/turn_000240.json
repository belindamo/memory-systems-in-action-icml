Caffeine: Coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks should be avoided before bedtime as they can hinder sleep.\n\n2. Alcohol: Although alcohol may initially make you feel drowsy, it can disrupt sleep patterns and cause awakening during the night.\n\n3. Spicy, fatty, or heavy meals: Large meals, spicy or fatty foods can cause indigestion or heartburn, which may keep you up at night.\n\n4. Sugary foods: Eating sugary foods or drinks before bedtime may lead to a spike in blood sugar levels and disrupt sleep patterns.\n\n5.
