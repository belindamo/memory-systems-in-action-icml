Here are some tips to help you stay warm and comfortable during your flight:\n\n1. **Dress in layers**: Wear breathable, comfortable clothing that can be easily added or removed as needed.

Consider wearing thermal underwear, fleeces, or sweaters.\n2. **Bring a travel blanket or scarf**: If you get cold easily, bring a lightweight blanket or scarf to keep yourself warm. Some airlines provide blankets, but it's always a good idea to bring your own.\n3. **Wear warm socks**: Cold feet can make you feel cold overall. Wear thick, warm socks or bring a spare pair in case your feet get cold during the flight.\n4. **Choose a comfortable seat**: If possible, opt for a seat near the front of the plane or over the wing, which tends to be warmer than seats near the back or over the engines.\n5. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the flight to stay warm and avoid dehydration.
