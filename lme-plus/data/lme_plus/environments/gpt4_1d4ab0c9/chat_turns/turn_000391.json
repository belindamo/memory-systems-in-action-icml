  "content": "I'm glad I got the laptop sleeve, it'll definitely provide extra protection for my laptop. For my clothes, I think I'll pack a few multipurpose items, like a sarong that can be used as a blanket or a dressy accessory. I'll also try to roll my clothes to save space in my backpack. But I'm still unsure about how to pack my shoes. Do you have any suggestions on how to pack shoes efficiently in a backpack?",
