Generally, frozen herbs can be used for:\n\n* 6-12 months: Most herbs like basil, cilantro, parsley, and dill retain their flavor and aroma well for 6-12 months.\n* 3-6 months: Delicate herbs like mint, lemongrass, and chives may start to lose their flavor and aroma after 3-6 months.\n* 1-3 months: Herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano may become less potent after 1-3 months.\n\n**Signs of Spoilage**\n\nWhen checking frozen herbs, look for these signs of spoilage:\n\n* **Off smell**: If the herbs have an unpleasant or strong odor, it's best to err on the side of caution and discard them.\n* **Slime or mold**: If you notice any signs of slime or mold, it's time to toss the herbs.\n* **Discoloration**: If the herbs have turned brown, gray, or black, they may have oxidized and lost their flavor.\n* **Loss of flavor**: If the herbs have lost their characteristic flavor or aroma, it's likely they've gone bad.\n\n**Using Frozen Herbs**\n\nWhen using frozen herbs, simply thaw the desired amount and use them as you would fresh herbs. You can add them to soups, stews, sauces, or use them as a garnish. Keep in mind that frozen herbs may be more prone to breaking down when thawed, so use them accordingly.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can enjoy your frozen herbs for months to come and add fresh flavor to your dishes all year round!",
