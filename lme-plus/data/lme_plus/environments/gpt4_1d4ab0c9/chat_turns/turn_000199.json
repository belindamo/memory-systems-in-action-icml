  "content": "Certainly! Here's an example code snippet in JavaScript for making a fetch request:\n```javascript\nfetch('https://example.com/data')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => {\n    console.log(data); // Do something with the data\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    console.error(error); // Handle any errors that occur\n  });\n```\nIn this example, we're making a GET request to the URL `https://example.com/data`, which returns data in JSON format. The `fetch()` function returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the server.\n\nWe're using the `then()` method to handle the response data. The first `then()` converts the response object to JSON format using the `json()` method. The second `then()` receives the data in JSON format and logs it to the console. Finally, we're using the `catch()` method to handle any errors that may occur during the request.",
