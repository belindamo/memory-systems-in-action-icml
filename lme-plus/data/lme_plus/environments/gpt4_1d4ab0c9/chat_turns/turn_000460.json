This is because of the Earth's tilt and rotation. The exact time of sunrise varies depending on your location and time zone, but it's not uncommon for the sun to rise around 7:00 am or later during the winter months.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a wonderful trip to visit your family for Christmas!",
