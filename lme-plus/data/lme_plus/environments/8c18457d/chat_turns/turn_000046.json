You can share the following details for each purchase:\n\n1. Date of purchase\n2. Item description (e.g., product name, brand)\n3. Category (if you're not sure, don't worry, I can help you categorize it)\n4. Price\n\nYou can share this information in a list format, like this:\n\n* Date: [Insert date]\n* Item: [Insert item description]\n* Category: [Insert category or leave blank]\n* Price: [Insert price]\n\nOnce you provide the list, I can help you categorize your purchases into groups like skincare, fashion, electronics, and more.\n\nIf you have a lot of purchases to track, you might also consider using a spreadsheet or a budgeting app to help you stay organized. I can offer suggestions on how to set that up if you're interested!",
