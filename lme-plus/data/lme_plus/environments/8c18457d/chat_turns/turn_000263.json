The BBQ sauce will be the star of the show, and the addition of bacon and cheese will add smoky, savory flavors.\n\nNow, about those perfect grill marks:\n\n1. **Preheat your grill**: Make sure your grill is hot, hot, hot! Aim for a medium-high heat (around 375\u00b0F to 400\u00b0F). This will help sear the burgers quickly and create those beautiful grill marks.\n2. **Clean the grates**: Use a grill brush to clean the grates before cooking. This will prevent burgers from sticking and ensure even grill marks.\n3. **Oil the grates**: Use a paper towel dipped in oil to brush the grates. This will prevent sticking and promote even browning.\n4. **Don't press down**: Resist the temptation to press down on the burgers with your spatula. This can squeeze out juices and prevent even grill marks.\n5. **Don't overcrowd**: Cook burgers in batches if necessary, to ensure they have enough room to cook evenly. Overcrowding can lead to steaming instead of searing.\n6. **Rotate for symmetry**: Rotate the burgers 90 degrees after 3-4 minutes to get those perfect, symmetrical grill marks.\n7. **Don't flip too often**: Flip the burgers only when necessary. You want to get a good sear on one side before flipping.\n8. **Use a thermometer**: Ensure the internal temperature of the burger reaches 160\u00b0F for medium-rare, 165\u00b0F for medium, and 170\u00b0F for well-done.\n9. **Let it rest**: Once cooked, let the burgers rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the burgers even more juicy and flavorful.\n\nSome additional tips for a beginner:\n\n* Make sure to handle the burgers gently when forming them, as over-working the meat can lead to dense, tough burgers.\n* Don't overcook the burgers. A slightly pink center is perfect for a juicy burger.\n* Keep an eye on the grill temperature and adjust as needed to prevent flare-ups.\n\nWith these tips and the Classic BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger recipe, you'll be well on your way to creating mouth-watering burgers with perfect grill marks!",
