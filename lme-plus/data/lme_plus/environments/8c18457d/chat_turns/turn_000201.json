However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal access to your daily routine or habits, so I don't know what time you usually wake up on weekdays.\n\nBut I can help you figure it out! Take a moment to think about your typical morning routine. What time do you usually wake up on weekdays? Is it early, like 6:00 or 7:00 am, or do you sleep in a bit later, like 8:00 or 9:00 am?\n\nOnce you remember your usual wake-up time, you can start planning out your week ahead!",
