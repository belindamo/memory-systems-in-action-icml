  "content": "Adding protein to your One-Pot Pasta is a great idea! Both chicken and sausage are excellent options. Here are some suggestions on how to cook them and add them to the dish:\n\n**Chicken:**\n\n1. **Boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs:** Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and season with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs (e.g., Italian seasoning, paprika).\n2. **Cook the chicken:** Add the chicken to the pot with the onion and garlic in step 2 of the recipe. Cook until the chicken is browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.\n3. **Shred or chop:** Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and shred or chop it into smaller pieces. Return the chicken to the pot and stir to combine with the sauce.\n\n**Sausage:**\n\n1. **Italian sausage or Chorizo:** Slice the sausage into thin rounds or remove the casing and crumble it into small pieces.\n2. **Cook the sausage:** Add the sausage to the pot with the onion and garlic in step 2 of the recipe. Cook until the sausage is browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.\n3. **Drain excess fat:** Remove the cooked sausage from the pot and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess fat. Return the sausage to the pot and stir to combine with the sauce.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Cook the protein before adding the pasta to the pot, so it has a chance to brown and develop flavor.\n* If using sausage, you can also cook it separately in a pan and then add it to the pot with the pasta and sauce.\n* Adjust the amount of protein according to your personal preference and the number of servings you're planning.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to try out your new cookware and kitchen utensil set! One-Pot Pasta is a great dish to break them in, and I'm sure they'll perform beautifully.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with your recipe. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.",
