However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your exact location or GPS coordinates. But I can suggest a few ways to find a great bike shop near you:\n\n1. **Google Search**: Type in \"bike shops near me\" or \"commuter bike shops in [your city-name]\" and Google will show you the nearest shops along with their addresses, phone numbers, and reviews.\n2. **Online Directories**: Websites like Yelp, Google Maps, or online bike shop directories like BikeShopFinder or The League of American Bicyclists' Bike Shop Finder can help you find bike shops in your area.\n3. **Ask Around**: Ask your colleagues, friends, or neighbors who bike to work for recommendations. They might have some great insights into local bike shops and their experiences.\n\nWhen you visit a bike shop, consider the following:\n\n* **Look for a shop that specializes in commuter bikes**: They'll have a better understanding of your needs and can offer more suitable options.\n* **Check the shop's reputation**: Read online reviews, ask about their warranty and return policies, and ask to see their workshop to ensure they're a reputable shop.\n* **Test ride a few bikes**: Don't be afraid to take a few bikes for a spin to see how they feel and handle on the road.\n* **Get a professional bike fitting**: A good bike shop will offer a bike fitting service to ensure the bike is the right size and comfortable for you.\n\nRemember to also consider accessories like locks, lights, and helmets, as well as any local bike laws and regulations.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect commuter bike and bike shop near your new location!",
