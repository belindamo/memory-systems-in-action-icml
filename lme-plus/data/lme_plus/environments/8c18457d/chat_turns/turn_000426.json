  "content": "I'm interested in learning more about non-linear editing, particularly in films like \"Memento\" and \"Pulp Fiction\". Can you explain how the editors of these films used non-linear editing to create a specific narrative structure and what techniques they employed to make the storytelling effective? By the way, I attended a Q&A session with Wes Anderson after the screening of \"The French Dispatch\" at the New York Film Festival, and he talked about his unique approach to editing and how it contributes to the tone and pacing of his films.",
