  "content": "The port you choose depends on the specific requirements of your application and how you configure your Nginx container. In the provided example, port 10000 is used as the public-facing port, which is mapped to port 80 inside the container. Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic.\n\nHere's the relevant configuration in the `render.yml` file:\n```yaml\nstartCommand: docker run -p 10000:80 my-nginx\nports:\n  - 10000\n```\nIn this example, port 10000 is exposed to the public, and port 80 (inside the container) is where the Nginx service is listening for incoming connections.\n\nYou can choose any available port number that suits your needs, as long as it does not conflict with other services running on the same Render host. Just make sure to update the `startCommand` and `ports` settings accordingly.\n\nFor example, if you prefer to use port 8080 as the public-facing port, update the configuration like this:\n```yaml\nstartCommand: docker run -p 8080:80 my-nginx\nports:\n  - 8080\n```\nOnce your service is deployed, you can access your Nginx container using the provided URL and the chosen port number.",
