When it comes to travel, you have several options:\n\n1. **Book Travel through Chase:** You can book travel directly through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal, which offers a wide range of travel options, including flights, hotels, rental cars, and activities. When you book travel through Chase, you'll earn 1.25 cents per point (Sapphire Preferred) or 1.5 cents per point (Sapphire Reserve) towards your travel purchases.\n2. **Transfer to Travel Partners:** Chase has a network of airline and hotel transfer partners, including popular loyalty programs like United Airlines MileagePlus, American Airlines AAdvantage, Delta SkyMiles, and Marriott Bonvoy. You can transfer your points to these partners at a 1:1 ratio, and then redeem them for travel according to the partner's loyalty program rules.\n3. **Pay Yourself Back:** With the Sapphire Preferred and Sapphire Reserve, you can redeem your points for a statement credit towards travel purchases made within the past 90 days. This option offers 1 cent per point redemption value.\n\n**Travel Redemption Examples:**\n\nHere are some examples of how you could redeem your 60,000-point bonus for travel:\n\n* Book a $750 flight through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal (60,000 points x 1.25 cents per point)\n* Transfer 60,000 points to United Airlines MileagePlus and redeem for a domestic round-trip flight (depending on the route and availability)\n* Redeem 60,000 points for a $600 statement credit towards a travel purchase made within the past 90 days\n\nKeep in mind that the redemption value may vary depending on the travel option you choose and the program's terms and conditions.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how the Chase Sapphire card's points can be redeemed for travel!",
