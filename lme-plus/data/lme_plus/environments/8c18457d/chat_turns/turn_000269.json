You won't regret it.\n\nNow, about storing homemade BBQ sauce, it's essential to follow proper storage and handling techniques to maintain its flavor, texture, and safety. Here are some tips to help you store your homemade BBQ sauce:\n\n1. **Air-tight containers**: Store your BBQ sauce in air-tight containers, such as glass jars with tight-fitting lids or plastic containers with screw-top lids. This will prevent air from entering the container and causing the sauce to spoil or become contaminated.\n2. **Refrigeration**: Refrigerate your BBQ sauce at a temperature of 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below. This will slow down the growth of bacteria and mold. You can store it in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.\n3. **Freezing**: If you don't plan to use your BBQ sauce within 6 months, consider freezing it. Transfer the sauce to an airtight container or freezer bag, making sure to remove as much air as possible before sealing. Frozen BBQ sauce can be stored for up to 12 months. When you're ready to use it, simply thaw it in the refrigerator or at room temperature.\n4. **Label and date**: Be sure to label the container with the date it was made and the ingredients used. This will help you keep track of how long it's been stored and ensure you use the oldest sauce first.\n5. **Acidity level**: If your BBQ sauce has a high acidity level (e.g., from vinegar or citrus), it will be more resistant to spoilage. However, if your sauce has a low acidity level, it's more susceptible to spoilage and should be stored in the refrigerator and used within a shorter timeframe.\n6. **Sterilization**: Before filling containers with BBQ sauce, make sure they're clean and sterilized. You can wash them in hot soapy water, then rinse and sanitize them with a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar.\n7. **Keep it away from light**: Light can cause the flavors and colors of your BBQ sauce to degrade over time. Store your containers in a dark place, like a pantry or cupboard, to maintain the sauce's quality.\n8. **Check for spoilage**: Before using your stored BBQ sauce, always check it for signs of spoilage, such as off smells, slimy texture, or mold growth. If you notice any of these signs, it's best to err on the side of caution and discard the sauce.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you'll be able to enjoy your homemade BBQ sauce for a longer period while maintaining its flavor and quality.\n\nNow, get ready to fire up your new charcoal grill and slather on that delicious BBQ sauce!",
