  "content": "**Chicken Broth vs. Vegetable Broth vs. Water:**\n\nYou can definitely use vegetable broth as a substitute for chicken broth in this recipe. In fact, vegetable broth can add a more neutral flavor and make the dish more vegetarian-friendly.\n\nAs for using water, it's not the best option, but it's not a deal-breaker either. Water will dilute the flavor of the sauce, making it less rich and savory. If you do choose to use water, you may need to adjust the amount of salt and herbs you add to the dish.\n\n**Purpose of Chicken Broth:**\n\nThe chicken broth serves a few purposes in this recipe:\n\n1. **Moisture:** Broth helps to cook the pasta and adds moisture to the dish, preventing the sauce from becoming too thick and sticky.\n2. **Flavor:** Chicken broth adds a rich, savory flavor to the sauce, which complements the tomato sauce and herbs.\n3. **Body:** Broth helps to create a more velvety, saucy consistency in the dish.\n\nIf you choose to use vegetable broth or water, you can still achieve a delicious One-Pot Pasta. Just keep in mind that the flavor profile might be slightly different.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If using vegetable broth, you can use a low-sodium option to control the salt content.\n* If using water, you may want to add a bit more tomato paste or herbs to enhance the flavor.\n* You can also use a combination of broth and water if you prefer a lighter sauce.\n\nI hope that helps!
