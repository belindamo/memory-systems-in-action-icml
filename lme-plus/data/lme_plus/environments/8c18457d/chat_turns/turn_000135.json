This will help with recovery, flexibility, and overall strength.\n\n**Tips to Make it Work**:\n\n1. **Prioritize**: Focus on the most important workouts for your triathlon training, and adjust the schedule as needed.\n2. **Be flexible**: Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a workout. Reschedule or replace it with a different activity.\n3. **Communicate**: Inform your tennis, biking, and yoga partners about your triathlon training schedule to ensure you can accommodate all activities.\n4. **Listen to your body**: Rest when needed, and don't push yourself too hard. Injuries can set you back significantly.\n5. **Use your commute**: Consider using your daily commute to fit in a bike ride or run, if possible.\n6. **Make it a habit**: Consistency is key. Try to perform your workouts at the same time every week to make it a habit.\n\nRemember, this is just a sample structure, and you should adjust it to fit your specific needs, schedule, and goals.
