I can still help you organize what you have so far.\n\nHere's a categorized summary of your recent online purchases:\n\n**Electronics**\n\n* Wireless headphone (20% off, exact price unknown) - 10th last month\n* Laptop bag (around $30) - 5th this month\n\n**Books**\n\n* Books (around $50) - 10th last month\n\n**Skincare**\n\n* Facial cleanser, toner, moisturizer (around $100) - 17th last month\n* Eyeshadow palette (around $40) - 14th this month\n\n**Fashion**\n\n* Dress, boots (around $150) - 3rd this month\n\nLet me know if you'd like to add the last item to the list or if you need any further help with categorization or tracking your purchases. Also, I noticed that you mentioned the eyeshadow palette under skincare, but it's typically considered a makeup product. If you'd like, I can move it to a \"Makeup\" category or keep it under skincare - your preference!",
