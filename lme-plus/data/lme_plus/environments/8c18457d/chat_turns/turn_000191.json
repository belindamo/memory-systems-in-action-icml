  "content": "That's a great idea! The Kong Classic Dog Toy is a timeless favorite among dogs, and it's perfect for keeping Max occupied and stimulated during the road trip. The Kong's hollow center can be filled with treats, peanut butter, or even canned dog food, which will challenge Max to figure out how to get them out. This will not only keep him busy but also provide mental stimulation and exercise.\n\nAnd, absolutely, don't wait to order those flea meds! Fleas can be a real nuisance, and it's essential to stay on top of flea prevention to keep Max comfortable and healthy. Remember to consult with your vet before ordering any new flea medication, especially if Max has any sensitivities or allergies.\n\nIt sounds like you're all set for a fun and comfortable road trip with Max and Luna! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further recommendations. Safe travels, and I hope you all have a fantastic adventure together!",
