However, as your friend mentioned, it can be quite expensive.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of what you can expect to pay for a taxi ride from the airport to Tokyo:\n\n* From Narita Airport:\n\t+ Daytime (5:00 AM - 10:00 PM): around \u00a515,000 - \u00a520,000 (around $140 - $180 USD)\n\t+ Late night (10:00 PM - 5:00 AM): around \u00a518,000 - \u00a525,000 (around $160 - $220 USD)\n* From Haneda Airport:\n\t+ Daytime (5:00 AM - 10:00 PM): around \u00a56,000 - \u00a510,000 (around $55 - $90 USD)\n\t+ Late night (10:00 PM - 5:00 AM): around \u00a58,000 - \u00a514,000 (around $70 - $125 USD)\n\nKeep in mind that these prices are estimates and can vary depending on traffic, the time of day, and other factors.\n\nIf you do decide to take a taxi, here are a few tips to help you prepare:\n\n* Make sure you have some cash on hand, as not all taxis accept credit cards.\n* Consider booking a taxi in advance through a service like Japan Taxi or Nihon Kotsu, which can provide a fixed price and help you avoid any language barriers.\n* If you have a lot of luggage, consider booking a larger taxi or a van-style taxi, which may be more comfortable and have more storage space.\n* Don't be afraid to ask your taxi driver to take the highway (, k\u014dsoku d\u014dro) if you're in a hurry, as this can save you time and money.\n\nThat being said, if you're on a budget, there are some alternative options you could consider:\n\n* The train: As I mentioned earlier, the train is a more affordable option, and you can use a luggage cart or porter service to help you with your bags.\n* A private car service: Some private car services, like Japan Car Service or Tokyo Private Car, offer fixed prices and can be more affordable than a taxi, especially if you're traveling in a group.\n* A shuttle bus: Some shuttle bus services, like the Airport Limousine Bus, offer fixed prices and can be a more affordable option than a taxi.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision about how to get to Tokyo from the airport!",
