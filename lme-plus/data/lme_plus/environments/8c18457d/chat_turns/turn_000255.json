  "content": "Making your own garlic bread from scratch is a great idea! It's surprisingly easy and only requires a few ingredients. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Classic Garlic Bread Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 loaf of Italian bread (or French bread), about 1 pound\n* 3 cloves of garlic, minced\n* 1/2 cup of butter, softened\n* 1/2 teaspoon of salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper\n* 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n2. Slice the Italian bread into 1-inch thick slices.\n3. In a small bowl, mix together the minced garlic and softened butter until well combined.\n4. Spread the garlic butter mixture evenly onto each bread slice, making sure to get both sides.\n5. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese (if using) over the garlic butter.\n6. Place the bread slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n7. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the bread is toasted golden brown and the garlic is fragrant.\n8. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use high-quality ingredients: Fresh garlic and real butter make a big difference in flavor.\n* Don't overdo the garlic: 3 cloves should be enough, but you can adjust to taste.\n* Keep an eye on the bread: Garlic bread can go from perfectly toasted to burnt quickly, so check on it every 2-3 minutes during the last 5 minutes of baking.\n\nThat's it! This recipe makes 6-8 slices of garlic bread, perfect for serving alongside your Creamy Tomato Pasta Bake.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different variations, such as adding dried herbs (e.g., oregano, thyme) or using different types of cheese (e.g., mozzarella, provolone). Enjoy!",
