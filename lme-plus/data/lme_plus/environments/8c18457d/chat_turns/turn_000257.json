  "content": "Dried oregano is a great addition to garlic butter, and it pairs perfectly with the Italian-inspired flavors of the Creamy Tomato Pasta Bake. The earthy, slightly bitter notes of oregano will complement the richness of the garlic and butter beautifully.\n\nRemember to use a light hand when adding the oregano, as it can be quite potent. Start with a small amount, such as 1/4 teaspoon, and taste as you go. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess oregano flavor.\n\nI'm thrilled to have been able to help, and I hope your Creamy Tomato Pasta Bake with garlic bread turns out amazing! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.\n\nBuon appetito, and happy cooking!",
