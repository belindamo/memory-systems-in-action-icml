That's a great way to make the most out of your experience.\n\nFirstly, it's wonderful that you're looking to deepen your practice and explore new styles like Kundalini yoga. Sometimes, a change of scenery and a fresh perspective can be just what you need to break through a plateau.\n\nIn terms of setting intentions, I think you're on the right track with focusing on mindfulness and self-care. Here are a few suggestions to consider:\n\n* **Set specific goals:** Instead of just focusing on mindfulness and self-care, try setting specific goals like \"I want to practice meditation for 10 minutes each day\" or \"I want to try a new yoga style every day.\"\n* **Be open-minded:** Remember to approach the retreat with an open mind and a willingness to try new things. You never know what you might discover!\n* **Take time for self-reflection:** Make sure to schedule some downtime into your retreat, whether that's reading a book by the pool or taking a solo walk on the beach. This will give you time to reflect on your practice and your life.\n* **Connect with others:** Don't be afraid to strike up conversations with your fellow retreat-goers. You might make some amazing connections and learn from others' experiences.\n* **Listen to your body:** Remember to listen to your body and take rest when you need it. A yoga retreat is not a competition, and it's okay to take a break or modify a pose if you need to.\n* **Journal your experience:** Consider keeping a journal during your retreat to reflect on your experiences, insights, and goals. This can be a great way to process your thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn terms of trying new activities, meditation and pranayama are both great options. You might also consider trying some yoga Nidra, sound healing, or even a yoga philosophy workshop. Remember to pace yourself and not overdo it \u2013 the goal is to relax and rejuvenate, not to exhaust yourself!\n\nLastly, don't forget to enjoy yourself and have fun! A yoga retreat is a special treat, and you should savor every moment.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any other intentions or goals you're considering for your retreat?",
