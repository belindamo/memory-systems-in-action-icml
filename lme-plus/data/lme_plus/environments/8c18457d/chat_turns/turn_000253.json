  "content": "The Creamy Tomato Pasta Bake is a comforting and satisfying dish. \n\nFor a side dish, I'd recommend something light and refreshing to balance out the richness of the creamy pasta. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Garlic Bread**: A classic Italian staple that pairs perfectly with pasta. Simply butter slices of bread, sprinkle with minced garlic, and bake until crispy.\n2. **Roasted Asparagus**: Asparagus is a natural pairing with creamy sauces. Toss fresh asparagus spears with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven until tender and slightly caramelized.\n3. **Green Salad**: A simple mixed green salad with a light vinaigrette dressing provides a refreshing contrast to the rich pasta. Add some cherry tomatoes or sliced cucumbers for extra flavor and texture.\n4. **Steamed Broccoli**: Quickly steaming broccoli florets until tender can provide a nice contrast in texture to the al dente pasta. Serve with a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkle of salt.\n5. **Garlic and Herb Roasted Cherry Tomatoes**: If you want to stay in the Italian theme, try roasting cherry tomatoes with minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and herbs like basil or parsley. They'll add a burst of flavor and color to the dish.\n\nChoose one or more of these options to serve alongside your Creamy Tomato Pasta Bake. You can't go wrong with any of them!\n\nDo you have a preferred side dish or would you like more suggestions?",
