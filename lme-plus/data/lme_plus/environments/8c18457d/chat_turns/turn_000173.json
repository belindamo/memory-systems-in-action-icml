It's efficient, relatively affordable, and a great way to get a feel for the city's public transportation system.\n\nHowever, your friend is right that there are other options to consider. Here are a few pros and cons of taking the train, as well as some alternative options:\n\n**Train:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Efficient: The train is one of the fastest ways to get to Tokyo from the airport, with journey times ranging from 45-60 minutes depending on the type of train and your destination.\n* Frequent departures: Trains run frequently, so you can easily find a departure time that fits your schedule.\n* Scenic: If you take the Narita Express (N'EX), you'll get to see some of the Japanese countryside during your journey.\n\nCons:\n\n* Can be crowded: Trains can be very crowded, especially during peak travel seasons.\n* Limited storage: If you have a lot of luggage, you may find it difficult to store it on the train.\n* Not the cheapest option: While the train is relatively affordable, it's not the cheapest option.\n\n**Alternative options:**\n\n* **Bus:** The bus is a cheaper option than the train, with tickets starting from around \u00a51,000. However, the journey time is longer (around 1-2 hours), and buses can be less frequent.\n* **Taxi:** Taxis are a convenient option, especially if you have a lot of luggage or are traveling in a group. However, they can be expensive, with fares starting from around \u00a510,000.\n* **Private car service:** If you want a more luxurious and hassle-free experience, you can book a private car service. This can be more expensive than a taxi, but you'll get a comfortable ride and help with your luggage.\n* **Uber:** Uber is available in Tokyo, but it's not as widely used as in other cities. You may find that prices are higher than you're used to, and availability can be limited.\n\n**Other tips:**\n\n* If you do decide to take the train, consider buying a Suica or Pasmo card, which can be used to ride trains, buses, and subways throughout Tokyo.\n* If you have a lot of luggage, consider taking a bus or taxi, as they may offer more storage space.\n* Check the airport's website for information on train schedules, prices, and alternative options.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision about how to get to Tokyo from the airport!",
