  "content": "There is a significant body of research that suggests that diet plays a crucial role in cancer risk. The World Health Organization has estimated that approximately one-third of all cancers diagnosed worldwide could be prevented by individuals adopting healthier diets, increasing physical activity and avoiding tobacco.\n\nStudies show that consuming a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources is associated with a lower risk of various cancers. Conversely, diets that are high in processed foods, red meats, and saturated fats appear to increase the risk of cancer.\n\nFurthermore, research suggests that certain types of foods and nutrients may be particularly beneficial or harmful regarding specific types of cancer. For example, consuming high levels of alcohol, red and processed meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. In contrast, eating a diet rich in fiber, poultry, fish, and low-fat dairy products may lower the risk.\n\nOverall, while more research is needed to unravel the complex relationship between diet and cancer, current evidence supports that adopting and maintaining a healthy diet should be one component of a comprehensive approach to cancer prevention.",
