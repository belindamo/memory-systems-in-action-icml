Fold the bottom half of the wrapper over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll up the wrapper to form a tight cylinder. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.\n9. Serve the spring rolls fresh, or fry them in hot oil for about 2-3 minutes on each side until crispy and golden brown. Drain on paper towels.\n\n**Spinach and Artichoke Dip Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 (14 oz) can of artichoke hearts, drained and chopped\n* 1 package of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained\n* 1 cup of mayonnaise\n* 1 cup of sour cream\n* 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese\n* 1 clove of garlic, minced\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
