You can also offer a non-fish option, like the Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms I mentioned earlier.\n* For the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, prepare the custard base ahead of time and refrigerate it until ready to bake. Caramelize the sugar just before serving.\n\nFeel free to adjust the quantities based on your guests' preferences and appetites. Enjoy your dinner party!",
