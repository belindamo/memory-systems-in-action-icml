  "content": "I'm happy to help you with hotel recommendations in LA! However, I have to break it to you that there is no Hotel Zeppelin near Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. It's possible that you might be thinking of a different hotel, or maybe you stayed at a different location.\n\nIf you could provide me with more information about what you liked about your stay in San Francisco, I'd be happy to help you find a similar hotel in LA. For example:\n\n* What was your budget for the stay?\n* What amenities were important to you (e.g. location, free breakfast, gym, etc.)?\n* What type of atmosphere were you looking for (e.g. modern, boutique, historic, etc.)?\n\nAdditionally, LA is a large city with many different neighborhoods and areas to stay in. Are you looking to stay in a specific part of town, such as Hollywood, Beverly Hills, or Downtown LA?\n\nLet me know and I can give you some personalized recommendations for hotels in LA that might fit what you're looking for!",
