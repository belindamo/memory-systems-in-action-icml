A 3-course menu is a great way to impress your guests, and I'll suggest some easy-to-make yet impressive options. Since you mentioned you and Sarah shared a love for cooking, I'll include some dishes that are sure to spark conversations and satisfy your guests' taste buds.\n\n**Course 1: Appetizer**\n\n* **Grilled Peach and Prosciutto Bruschetta**: Toasted baguette slices topped with caramelized grilled peaches, crispy prosciutto, fresh arugula, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. This sweet and savory combination is perfect for a summer evening.\n\n**Course 2: Main Course**\n\n* **Herbed Crusted Salmon with Roasted Vegetables**: Fresh salmon fillets coated with a mixture of parsley, dill, lemon zest, and breadcrumbs, then baked to perfection. Serve with a colorful medley of roasted vegetables like asparagus, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes, tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n* **Alternative Option**: If you prefer a non-fish option, consider **Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms** filled with a mixture of saut\u00e9ed spinach, garlic, and feta cheese, baked until golden brown.\n\n**Course 3: Dessert**\n\n* **Lemon Lavender Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e**: Rich and creamy lemon-lavender infused custard base topped with a caramelized sugar crust. This elegant dessert is sure to impress your guests. You can also serve it in small ramekins for a more personalized touch.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Consider a wine pairing for each course to elevate the dining experience. For example, a dry Riesling pairs well with the bruschetta, a Pinot Grigio complements the herbed salmon, and a Moscato d'Asti pairs nicely with the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n* Plan ahead and prep as much as you can in advance to minimize stress on the day of the dinner party.\n* Don't hesitate to ask your guests about dietary restrictions or preferences, and have some options available for those with specific needs.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create a memorable dinner party that will impress your colleagues and friends!",
