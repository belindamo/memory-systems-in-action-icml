  "content": "US financial regulators have accused Do Kwon, the former head of the now-collapsed South Korean cryptocurrency firm Terraform Labs, of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud. Kwon and his company are said to have raised billions of dollars from investors by selling them an interconnected suite of crypto asset securities, with many transactions being unregistered. The SEC also alleges that Kwon and Terraform claimed repeatedly that the tokens would increase in value, and misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD. The collapse of the tokens last year is thought to have cost investors more than $40bn. Globally, investors in TerraUSD and Luna lost an estimated $42bn, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.",
