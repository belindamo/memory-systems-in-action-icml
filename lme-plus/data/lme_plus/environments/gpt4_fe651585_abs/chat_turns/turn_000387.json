  "content": "While crushed oyster shells or eggshells can be a great calcium supplement for chickens, they're not necessarily suitable for horses like Starlight. Here's why:\n\n**Horses have different calcium needs:**\n\nHorses, especially adult horses like mares, have different calcium requirements compared to chickens. Horses require a more balanced calcium-phosphorus ratio, and their digestive system is designed to process larger amounts of fiber and roughage.\n\n**Crushed oyster shells or eggshells may not be easily digestible for horses:**\n\nHorses have a larger, more complex digestive system than chickens, and their stomachs are designed to break down and extract nutrients from plant material, not shell fragments. Crushed oyster shells or eggshells may not be easily digestible for horses, which could lead to:\n\n1. **Gastrointestinal upset:** Undigested shell fragments could cause stomach irritation, diarrhea, or even colic in horses.\n2. **Impaction:** If the shells accumulate in the digestive tract, they could cause an impaction, which can be a serious health issue.\n\n**Better calcium sources for horses:**\n\nInstead, you can provide Starlight with a calcium supplement specifically formulated for horses. Here are some options:\n\n1. **Calcium carbonate:** A common, easily absorbed calcium source for horses.\n2. **Dicalcium phosphate:** A calcium-phosphorus supplement that provides a balanced ratio of these essential minerals.\n3. **Limestone:** A natural source of calcium carbonate that's often used in horse feed.\n\n**Consult with an equine nutritionist or veterinarian:**\n\nBefore adding any supplements to Starlight's diet, consult with an equine nutritionist or veterinarian to determine the best calcium supplement for her specific needs. They can help you choose a supplement that's safe, effective, and balanced for her age, breed, and nutritional requirements.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your horse's health and nutrition.",
