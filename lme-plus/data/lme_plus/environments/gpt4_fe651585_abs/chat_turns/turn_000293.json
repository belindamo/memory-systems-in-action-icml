I recently attended a potluck dinner at my coworker's house last weekend and it was great to socialize with my colleagues outside of the office. I sat next to Sarah and her partner, and we talked about our shared love of cooking and trying out new recipes. Do you have any recommendations for a 3-course menu that's easy to make and impresses guests?",
