  "content": "SeaWorld Orlando has some thrilling rides, but they're not exactly similar to Revenge of the Mummy in terms of indoor, dark ride experience. However, if you're looking for thrill rides with a similar adrenaline rush, here are a few options at SeaWorld:\n\n1. **Mako, Kraken, and Manta**: These three roller coasters offer a similar thrill factor to Revenge of the Mummy, but with a marine-life twist. They're outdoor coasters with steep drops, loops, and corkscrews.\n\t* Mako: A hyper coaster with a 200-foot drop, reaching speeds of up to 73 mph.\n\t* Kraken: A floorless coaster with a 144-foot drop, featuring a beyond-vertical drop of 90 degrees.\n\t* Manta: A flying coaster with a 98-foot drop, where you'll experience the sensation of flying through the air like a manta ray.\n2. **Steel Curtain**: This is a more recent addition to SeaWorld's thrill ride lineup. It's a floorless coaster with a unique design, featuring a 90-degree drop, a barrel roll, and a corkscrew.\n\nWhile these rides don't offer the same indoor, dark ride experience as Revenge of the Mummy, they'll still provide an adrenaline rush and stunning views of the park. If you're looking for a more intense experience, you might want to consider visiting during the evening or at night, when the park's thrill rides can feel even more exhilarating.\n\nKeep in mind that SeaWorld's focus is on marine life and conservation, so you'll also find many animal exhibits, shows, and interactive experiences throughout the park. Make sure to plan your day accordingly to fit in both the thrill rides and the animal attractions.",
