Make this around 400 words, and again, focus heavily on giving us a sense on where we are, what time we are in history through describing the scene but only giving any backstory on the mirror through the movers talking while they are getting the mirror ready for shipment. But refrain from narrating any history or making comments about it's powers except vaguely through dialog",
