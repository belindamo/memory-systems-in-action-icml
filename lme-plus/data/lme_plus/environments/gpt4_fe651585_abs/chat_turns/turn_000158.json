  "content": "Carmine's has three locations in Manhattan:\n\n1. **Upper West Side**: 205 W 90th St, New York, NY 10024\n2. **Theater District**: 165 W 52nd St, New York, NY 10019\n3. **Greenwich Village**: 81 7th Ave S, New York, NY 10014\n\nThe Theater District location is probably the most convenient for most tourists, as it's close to many major attractions and hotels.\n\nI'm glad you got to stretch your legs after the long flight! An exit row seat definitely makes a big difference, especially on a delayed flight. United Airlines can be a bit hit-or-miss, but it sounds like you had a decent experience overall.\n\nNow, back to Carmine's: I recommend making a reservation, especially if you're planning to dine during peak hours (lunch or dinner). You can do so through their website or through a reservation platform like OpenTable.\n\nJust a heads up: Carmine's is a family-style restaurant, which means they serve large portions meant to be shared with the table. So, be prepared for a hearty meal!\n\nDo you have any other questions or would you like me to make a reservation for you at Carmine's?",
