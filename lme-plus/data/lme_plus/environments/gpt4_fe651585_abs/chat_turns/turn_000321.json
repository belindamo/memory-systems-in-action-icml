Here is the revised book summary and chapter outline:\n\nTitle: The Mirror's Reflection\n\nBook Summary:\nThe Mirror's Reflection tells the story of a mirror that shows the viewer an alternate future where a tragedy or loss never occurred. The mirror has been passed down through the centuries, and as people become enamored with the alternate future, it takes a toll on their present relationships and overall well-being. The story follows a series of characters who come into contact with the mirror and the impact it has on their lives.\n\nChapter 1: The Mirror's Arrival\n\n* We are introduced to the mirror in its past history in England many years before it was shipped off to America.\n* The mirror is boxed up and shipped to the United States.\n* We see it in a New York museum, and the employees discuss its history.\n\nChapter 2: The Teenager\n\n* The mirror is moved to a new location where a teenage boy is able to sit and stare at it for hours.\n* The boy becomes increasingly drawn to the alternate future the mirror shows him.\n\nChapter 3: The Married Woman\n\n* The mirror is sold to a married woman who lost her child.\n* She becomes consumed by the alternate future the mirror shows her.\n\nChapter 4: The Elderly Man\n\n* The mirror is inherited by an elderly man who lost his wife.\n* He becomes isolated and fixated on the alternate future the mirror shows him.\n\nChapter 5: Breaking Free\n\n* The mirror is broken or removed from each character's life, freeing them from the grip of the alternate future.\n* The characters are able to grieve the loss of the alternate future and begin living in the present.\n\nChapter 6: Moving On\n\n* The mirror is now in the possession of a woman who lost her husband in a tragic accident.\n* Her friends and family are concerned about the toll the mirror is taking on her life.\n* They come together to break the mirror, freeing her from its grip and allowing her to move forward with her life.\n\nNote: The focus of the story is on the impact of the mirror on each character's life and how it affects their relationships and overall well-being. There is no villain or heroic character, only flawed individuals trying to cope with loss and tragedy in their own way. The ending is not a final resolution but a new beginning, as each character is given the opportunity to move forward in their lives.",
