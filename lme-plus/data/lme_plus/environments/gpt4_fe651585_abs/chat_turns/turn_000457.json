If some of the significant historical events didn't happen, the world would be a very different place today. It's impossible to say precisely how different, but we can make some educated guesses.\n\nFor instance, if Archduke Franz Ferdinand wasn't assassinated, it's unlikely World War I would have happened in the same way, if at all. The aftermath of World War I had a significant impact on world politics and set the stage for the rise of Hitler and World War II. If these events had not happened, the world would be a dramatically different place today.\n\nSimilarly, if Rosa Parks didn't refuse to give up her seat on the bus, the civil rights movement in the United States might have been delayed or taken a different course. If penicillin had not been discovered, many people might have died from bacterial infections that are now easily treatable.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but it's clear that small events can have a big impact on the world, and we can only speculate about how different the world would be without them.",
