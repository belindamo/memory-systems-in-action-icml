  "content": "Okay thanks.\nX = my ideal client is an entrepreneur with their own business or a business leader of an SME. They are between 25 and 65 years old, male or female, with 2-5 yrs experience in business. They live any wherer in the world that has internet access. They aspire for their business to be setting them free financially, but this isn't working out. \nY = In fact they are busier than ever and in danger of buring out. They also lack certain emotional intelligence skills like self awareness and self knowing; they are not very aware of others in their teams, so communication can sometimes become stressful and even result in conflict; because of the lack of awareness they also do not manage themselves or their emotions very well; this can result in their poor health. They also can easily fall pray to negative mindsets when under stress and just battle through without being able to have a clear strategy to change that mindset. However they have a successful service or product, they have the drive and initiative to carry it through and make things happen. They suffer stress problems which is effecting their physical health, their sleep, and their energy levels. They rarely take a break. \nZ = I am a high performance executive coach who has the ability to ask very powerful and insightful questions that get to the root of their problem . I can then help my clients develop great habits, including maintaining focus, obtaining clarity, how to retain great energy, sustain courage, and mazimise productivity. I can also help my clients with gaining influence and developing skills in persuasion. I also have consultancy skills in 10 competencies in emotional intelligence, I'm qualified in DiSC which is a helpful behavioral model and helps teams understand their differences and therefore work better together as teams. I'm a qualified stress managment consultant, and I've been an osteopath (a primary health care worker) for 25 yrs which gives me specialist still in healthcare. I bring all these skills together with 40 years of developing my own business and entrepreneurial journey. My idea of the myself is as a coach, however I am able to know when to coach, when to offer consultancy and training and when to teach and mentor. I therefore sometimes refer to myself as an integrative coach.\n\nFor the Y in \"How to X in Y without Z\" statement, I offer 12 week coaching solutions, I offer 12 months coaching.\n\nPlease write me both statements to describe what I do and how I help people.
