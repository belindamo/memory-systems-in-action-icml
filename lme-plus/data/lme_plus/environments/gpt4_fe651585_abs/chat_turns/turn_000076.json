It confirms that the person who signed the document or message is who they claim to be.\n2. Non-repudiation: A signature provides evidence that the person who signed the document or message cannot later deny having signed it. This is known as non-repudiation and is an important aspect of electronic transactions.\n3. Authorization: A signature is often used to authorize a document or message, giving it legal effect. This is particularly important in legal and financial transactions.\n4. Integrity: A signature can be used to verify the integrity of a document or message, ensuring that it has not been tampered with or altered in any way.\n5. Evidence: A signature can be used as evidence in a court of law. It can be used to prove that a document or message was signed by a particular person, and that the contents of the document or message have not been altered.\n6. Access Control: A signature can also be used to control access to a document or message, allowing only authorized parties to view or edit it.\n7. Time-stamping: A digital signature can also be used as a time-stamping mechanism, which can be used to prove that a document existed at a certain point in time.\n8. Secure Communication: Signature is also used to ensure secure communication between two parties. The signature is verified by the recipient to ensure that the communication is not tampered or compromised.\n9. Compliance: Signature can also be used to comply with different regulatory and legal requirements.
