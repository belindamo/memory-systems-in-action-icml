  "content": "I think I'll start with some classic summer tunes like \"Summertime\" and \"Summer Breeze\". Those songs always bring back memories of warm summer days and family gatherings. Then, I can move on to some old family favorites like \"Unchained Melody\" and \"Can't Help Falling in Love\". Those songs are always crowd-pleasers and are sure to get everyone singing along. Finally, I might throw in some acoustic/folk favorites like \"Fire and Rain\" and \"Homeward Bound\" to round out the setlist.",
