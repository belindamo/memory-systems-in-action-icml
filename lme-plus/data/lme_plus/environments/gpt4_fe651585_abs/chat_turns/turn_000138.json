It is an exciting time for the entertainment industry as more female-driven stories are being recognized, celebrated, and given the opportunity to shine. The increased demand for diverse representation in theater and film is driving the push for more women-driven stories, and it is important to continue this trend so that it becomes the norm and not just an exception. The entertainment industry has immense power to shape societal norms, beliefs, and values, thereby presenting a more inclusive and diverse representation on stage and screen can make an immense difference. The momentum gained so far is indeed encouraging, and we must continue to support and uplift women in the entertainment industry to further drive this change.",
