I can provide general information on common vaccinations, but I strongly recommend consulting with your veterinarian to obtain accurate and up-to-date information on your animals' vaccination records.\n\nYour veterinarian can provide you with a detailed vaccination schedule and recommendations based on your animals' specific needs, age, breed, and health status. They can also review their records and let you know what vaccinations are due and when.\n\nIt's essential to keep accurate and up-to-date records of your animals' vaccinations to ensure their health and well-being. Your veterinarian can help you develop a vaccination plan that meets the specific needs of Starlight, Bessie, and Billy.\n\nPlease schedule a consultation with your veterinarian to review their records and get personalized advice on their vaccination needs.",
