  "content": "Max loves going on hikes and exploring new trails, and he's really good at sniffing out squirrels! He's also a big fan of playing fetch in the park. As for mental stimulation, I've been using puzzle toys with him, and he enjoys figuring out how to get the treats out. I've also been hiding treats around the house to keep him engaged and active.\n\nWhat about recommendations for dog-friendly hiking trails? I'd love to explore some new spots with Max.",
