It seems like just yesterday they were born, and now they're already celebrating their first birthday!\n\nI'm glad you're excited about the Art Studio Party for Olivia. It's going to be a fantastic celebration of her creativity and individuality. The art stations will provide a wonderful opportunity for her and her friends to express themselves and take home some amazing artwork as party favors.\n\nRemember to have fun and be flexible during the party. Encourage the kids to experiment and explore their creativity, and don't worry too much about the mess. It's all part of the creative process, and the kids will have a blast!\n\nIf you need any more help or advice, feel free to ask. I'm always here to help. Otherwise, I hope you and Olivia have an amazing time at the party, and I wish Jackson and Julia a happy birthday in advance!",
