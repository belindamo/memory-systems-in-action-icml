  "content": "That's a lot of great ideas! For Olivia's party, I think the Art Studio Party would be perfect. I was thinking of setting up different art stations with various materials like paint, markers, glue, and paper. Can you give me some ideas on how to organize the art stations and what kind of art projects I can have for each station? Also, what are some fun ways to display the kids' artwork afterwards?",
