However, if you're looking for thrill rides with a similar adrenaline rush, here are a few options at SeaWorld:\n\n1. **Mako, Kraken, and Manta**: These three roller coasters offer a similar thrill factor to Revenge of the Mummy, but with a marine-life twist.

It's a floorless coaster with a unique design, featuring a 90-degree drop, a barrel roll, and a corkscrew.\n\nWhile these rides don't offer the same indoor, dark ride experience as Revenge of the Mummy, they'll still provide an adrenaline rush and stunning views of the park. If you're looking for a more intense experience, you might want to consider visiting during the evening or at night, when the park's thrill rides can feel even more exhilarating.\n\nKeep in mind that SeaWorld's focus is on marine life and conservation, so you'll also find many animal exhibits, shows, and interactive experiences throughout the park. Make sure to plan your day accordingly to fit in both the thrill rides and the animal attractions."
