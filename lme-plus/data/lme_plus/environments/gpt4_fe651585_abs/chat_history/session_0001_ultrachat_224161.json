During the Ottoman Empire, many of the buildings were constructed in a traditional Ottoman style, featuring domes and arched colonnades. However, in the early 20th century, when Albania gained its independence, Italian architects came to Vlor\u00eb and introduced their own architectural style, which emphasized symmetry, order, and neoclassical elements.\n\nDuring the communist era, which lasted from 1945 to 1991, many buildings were constructed in a utilitarian style, with little regard for aesthetics or individual expression. However, since the fall of communism, there has been a movement towards restoring and preserving historic buildings in Vlor\u00eb, including those in the downtown area. This has led to a renewed interest in traditional Albanian architecture, as well as a continued appreciation for the neoclassical style introduced by the Italians. Today, Vlor\u00eb's downtown architecture reflects this mix of styles and historical influences."
