I am a female born in the democratic republic of Congo on 15 October 1986. I have been raised by a black Congolese mother and a white Belgian adoptive father. My family and I moved to Conakry when I was 3 years old for my dad\u2019s job, where he worked as CFO of an international brewery. My mum owned a restaurant specialising in french cuisine with a few signature Congolese dishes. At age 12 we had to move to Brussels because of my dad\u2019s cancer. Unfortunately, he did in November 1999 from it. I had a very happy and privileged childhood during which I received a lot of love from both my parents. I had the chance to travel a lot and I have been fortunate to live memorable and exceptional adventures. At the death of my dad, our lifestyle changed and I lived a more modest life with my mum. I always had whatever I needed and my mum did a great job following through with my education.\n\nFrom Belgium and Congo. I'm pretty laid back and don't take myself too seriously. I sometimes need a while to warm up, but when I'm comfortable around people I'm lively, talkative, a bit crazy at times and always interested in hearing other peoples' stories, thoughts and plans.\n\nIf you were a fly on my wall, you would see that I love to dance around my room and have the habit of talking to myself with the occasional laughter at my own jokes.\n\nI'm really passionate about storytelling and love to listen to podcasts, watch TED videos, read graphic novels or simply watch a good movie or TV series... ok I might have a bit of an obsession with TV series. I'm really interested in storytelling, psychology, personal development, no code, tech and creativity.\n\nI absolutely love music and never leave the house without my headphones. My taste is quite eclectic and depends on my mood.\n\nAnd I guess like almost everyone else I like to hang with my friends, go out for a drink, and discover new places and things. If I had the chance I would definitely travel more. My dream would be to be able to work from anywhere in the world and discover new cultures and use storytelling and interactive event to share what I learn.\n\nMy curiosity always led me to try different things. When I was a kid, maybe 7 or 8, my mum used to watch \u201cThe young and the restless\u201d. In the show, one of the protagonists, Ashley Abbot was a perfume maker. I was fascinated by the lab environment, being able to fiddle with tubes and the idea of creating something that didn\u2019t exist. With a friend, we then decided to do the same and start making perfume with the plant in the garden. Obviously, it was a disaster, but it was fun lol.\n\nDuring high school, I wanted to start a law practice with a friend after watching way too many episodes of Ally McBeal. We were really committed. We looked for a university where we could study law and even had a name HAM & WILL(Hamdani & Willems) law firm. Not sure what happened to the idea but it clearly never happened.\n\nMy curiosity always led me to try different things and my recklessness to try without too much thought. After high school, I wasn\u2019t too sure what to do with my studies, but I was sure at some point that I wanted to open a business. Not sure what it meant at the time or in what industry. So I choose Economics as an option at Uni. I hated that choice and during most of my studies didn\u2019t pay too much attention to what was happening. I also realised that I was spending more time crafting our group presentation than caring about the content.\n\nOne of my cousins was living in London and proposed I moved there. At first, I wasn\u2019t too sure, but I decided to take the leap. The first few months were horrible. The city was moving super fast, I didn\u2019t know many people and wasn\u2019t sure what I was doing. It ended up being one of the best life experiences I had. I learned to hustle in that city as opposed to being scared of approaching people and opportunities in Belgium. During the transition between Brussels and London, I tried to do a change in my study (Music and Business) but it didn\u2019t go through with my mother lol.\n\nFor some reason, I was determined to work in the creative industry (event, at the time) and decided I would try job experience on the side and see where it leads.\n\nI mediocrely finished my study in Economics and apply for a Master's in Digital media and the creative economy. This was an incredible eye-opener. This is where I was introduced to design thinking and open innovation. It was a bit of a revelation for me as I really enjoyed my master's. During that time I also had the best work experience ever. I worked in a coworking space for about 6 months and it was amazing. I just loved the vibe, the openness of people and the creativity flowing. It was laid back and friendly while working on an amazing project.\n\nWhile in my undergraduate study in 2011, I started a project called WHY!CREATE with a friend of mine. The idea was to create a platform to showcase creativity around us and do meetups to gather and share our experiences. We had the chance to be selected to be the official ambassador for Behance in London. It was a great experience, but we didn\u2019t really have long-term goals and it died.\n\nDuring my master, I started a similar project called FYREFLY, where the idea was to connect people through storytelling and serendipity. The idea was really cool, but maybe a bit too fluffy and not tangible enough.\n\nToward the end of the master, I was learning more about the creative industry and wanted to get into design, so I learn pretty much all I know on the internet. I participated in an event to showcase my portfolio. I wasn\u2019t expecting too much of it, as I suffered from a massive imposter syndrome (up to this day). Not really sure how I got where I got or if I had the skills to succeed. I had the chance to get a 3-day work placement in an agency that needed junior motion graphics to help out with their pitch. They promised to pay me for it and never did. I was a bit delusion by this as I felt used. Another person from that portfolio review event contacted me asking if I wanted a week's internship in their agency. I was really sceptical because of my previous experience and was really prepared when I showed up for the interview. Since I was new in the industry, I didn\u2019t really know the big player or even the jargon. It happened that the agency was HAVAS. It started with a 1-week work placement that turned into a 1-month internship as a junior designer and ended as a full-time contract as a Junior motion & graphic designer. I worked for about 4 years at HAVAS and it has been a great experience and learning curve. Unfortunately in the end I was a bit blaz\u00e9e. I loved what I did but not the industry. I felt it lack purpose. What\u2019s the point to create ads to sell more \u201cuseless\u201d products? I needed a change.\n\nAt the same time in 2015, one of my best friends was moving to the Democratic Republic of Congo and was trying to convince me to come as there was a job opening at an agency there. At first, I laughed and said no, but in the end, I went because I was bored of my situation with HAVAS and curious to see what Congo had to offer. I spent 4 years in that agency where toward the last 2 years I was promoted to creative director and team leader. Once more I felt frustrated with my job and felt I reached a plateau. I wasn\u2019t learning any more and I couldn\u2019t see the future perspectives. Toward the end of the year, I was exhausted and felt I was putting in more energy and passion than my own boss. In December 2018, I decided I was going to quit. After the Xmas holidays, I did. I didn\u2019t have much of a plan and figured I would jump first and look for a parachute on the way down.\n\nIt has been a challenging journey so far, but an interesting adventure I don\u2019t regret starting.\n\nAt age 33 I learned that my mum wasn\u2019t my biological mother and this create great confusion and overwhelmed me. What made it even more confusing is learning that the woman I thought was my aunt was my biological mother, making 3 of my cousin my actual half-sibling. I discovered that I was the family secret. This led me to feel lost and develop some serious trust issues. I didn\u2019t trust myself and my judgment anymore and I didn\u2019t trust my family member. At the same time, I started my own Branding and event Agency in Lubumbashi Congo. Although I have learned a lot and met incredible people, this experience was very hectic and overwhelming. Adding the family drama, the hardship of entrepreneurship and the Covid crisis I burn out. It was a massing explosion but a subtle and growing implosion. Only now I am slowly breaking free from this. After all this, I have decided to come back to Belgium where I followed a 9-month coaching program with COACHING WAYS international. In June 2022 I got an ACTP certification from ICF\n\nOver the past 15 years, I have worked as a designer, brand strategist, agency owner and now as a certified coach. I bring together everything I have learned to co-create with my client the life they always wanted for themselves.\n\nMake the tone of voice friendly and approachable yet professional. I am a bubbly ENFP person and would like it to subtly show in the writing style. I don\u2019t want to be positioned as a teacher but as a passionate and experienced professional sharing my experience and knowledge. My expertise is backed by practice, trial and a lot of errors. I have a Master's degree in Digital Media and the Creative Economy from Kingston University London.\n\nI hate prestige and academia. The best people and places I learned from came from the internet. They are all passionate professionals sharing their day-to-day challenges and expertise. As an autodidact, I need to experience things to internalise them. As someone who is interested in personal growth and wants to help people be the best version of themselves, my commitment is to focus on science-based, practical, and realistic [strategies](https://nesslabs.com/why-most-strategies-fail), while acknowledging the fact that I don\u2019t have any magic bullet and that it takes more than applying one to a specific area of your life to get beyond the tip of the happiness iceberg.\n\nLots of self-help content will focus on \u201chacks\u201d as if there was a magic bullet to happiness. As a result, people may temporarily feel better, but will soon go back to their normal state. Personal development should be about long-term improvement and built on a deep understanding of how the brain and the mind work, not on quick fixes that won\u2019t have a lasting impact. \n\nPlease write in humorous tone, narrative writing style."
