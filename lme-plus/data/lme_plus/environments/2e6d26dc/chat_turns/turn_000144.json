It makes the gift even more personal and special. Here are some ideas for messages or details you could consider adding:\n\n* **Birthdate**: \"Ava and Lily, born April [date]\" or \"[Date] - The day our hearts doubled in size\"\n* **Special message**: \"Double the joy, double the love\" or \"Twice the sweetness, twice the fun\"\n* **Names and initials**: \"Ava & Lily\" or \"A.L. + L.L.\" (their initials)\n* **Quote or phrase**: A short quote or phrase that resonates with your aunt or the twins, such as \"Love is in the air\" or \"Twice blessed\"\n\nWhen adding a message or details, keep the following in mind:\n\n* **Character limit**: Check with the seller to see if there's a character limit for the message or text.\n* **Font style and size**: Choose a font style and size that fits with the blanket's design and is easy to read.\n* **Color**: Select a thread color that complements the blanket's color and design.\n\nRemember to communicate clearly with the seller about the design, message, and any specific requirements you have. Etsy sellers are known for their attention to detail and willingness to work with customers to create unique products.\n\nBy adding a personal touch to the blanket, you'll make it an even more meaningful and treasured gift for your aunt and the twins.",
