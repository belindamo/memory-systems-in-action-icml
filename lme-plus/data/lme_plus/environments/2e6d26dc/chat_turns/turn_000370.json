  "content": "To prevent contamination, brewers use various sanitation techniques throughout the brewing process. Before brewing, all equipment and surfaces are cleaned and sanitized to kill any unwanted bacteria or yeast. During the brewing process, brewers take care to avoid any splashing, which can introduce oxygen and potential contaminants into the beer. They also take measures like controlling the temperature and pH of the wort during the fermentation process, which can discourage the growth of unwanted bacteria.\n\nTo ensure the yeast used for fermentation is healthy and dominant, brewers often employ \"yeast management\" techniques, including making sure the yeast is viable and adequately nourished before pitching it, and carefully monitoring the fermentation process so the yeast can divide and ferment the beer evenly.\n\nAdditionally, many breweries use specialized equipment, such as conical or cylindroconical fermenters, which allow them to gravity-transfer the beer into secondary or tertiary fermentation vessels, avoiding any exposure to oxygen or potential contaminants. Overall, brewers take a lot of precautions to create an environment that's unfavorable to unwanted bacteria and yeast during the fermentation process, helping to ensure a high-quality, delicious beer.",
