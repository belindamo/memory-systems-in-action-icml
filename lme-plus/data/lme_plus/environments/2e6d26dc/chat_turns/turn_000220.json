That will definitely help you find relevant listings and narrow down your options.\n\nRemember to also check the product descriptions, material, and size of the blankets to ensure they meet your requirements. And don't hesitate to contact the seller if you have any questions or need further customization options.\n\nSaving your favorite designs is a great idea, too! It's always good to take your time and come back to your options with a fresh perspective. You might find that one design stands out to you more after revisiting your favorites.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you find the perfect neutral personalized baby blanket for your friend's little one!",
