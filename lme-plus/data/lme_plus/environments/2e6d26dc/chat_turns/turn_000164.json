  "content": "The Immunoassay Systems are diagnostic analyzers that use antibodies or antigens to measure the concentration of a molecule, utilizing test cartridges. The systems are designed to test and detect using different methods, such as enzymes, radioactive isotopes, DNA probes, fluorescence, and electrochemilumenescence, to cater to a variety of diagnostic needs. The devices come equipped with various test modes, including read now and walk away modes, to ensure flexibility and convenience. The read now mode is intended to provide quick results for immediate decisions, while the walk away mode is designed to perform a series of tests automatically, eliminating the need for manual interventions. Immunoassay Systems are capable of analyzing multiple samples simultaneously, increasing efficiency and throughput. Additionally, the systems are engineered to be user-friendly, and some even offer touch screen interfaces for easy operation. Immunoassay Systems provide accurate and reliable results, making them essential tools in the diagnosis and management of various medical conditions.",
