  "content": "CAPIOX Hemoconcentrators are medical devices that are used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures to remove excess fluid from the blood, maintaining the proper hematocrit and protein concentration and enabling reinfusion of blood remaining in the circuit after bypass. The membrane of the hemoconcentrator is composed of polysulfone and is designed to achieve a high ultrafiltration rate (UFR) for efficient blood concentration in a short amount of time while restricting the removal of albumin. The inlet blood port is also designed to ensure smooth blood flow and reduce possible stagnation and prevent thrombus formation. The filters have a low priming volume, which is intended to keep them compact and light, requiring minimal storage space and offering easy disposal. The no-rinse hollow fibers are designed to enable quick setup even during the operation, and the entire housing, including blood ports, is transparent, making it easy to visually check the device. Overall, the CAPIOX Hemoconcentrators are effective and efficient devices that are designed to improve the outcomes of cardiopulmonary bypass procedures.",
