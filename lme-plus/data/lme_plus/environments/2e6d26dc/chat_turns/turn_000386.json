  "content": "Subject: Logo Design Feedback for Our New Brand\n\nHello cosmicbeauty2,\n\nThank you for the designs you have delivered so far. I understand that it may be challenging to create the perfect logo without enough information, so I'd like to provide additional feedback to help guide your work.\n\nOption 2 has some elements that I appreciate, such as the elegant font and minimalist concept. However, there are a few aspects that could be improved. The mountain shape resembles the logo of one of our competitors (which I included in the briefing), and we would like to differentiate our brand more. Additionally, the lines appear to form a letter \"M,\" which doesn't relate to our brand identity.\n\nUnfortunately, Option 1 did not resonate with me, and I had trouble understanding the concept behind Option 3. I believe that Option 2 has the most potential, and I hope you can refine it based on my feedback.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification or guidance. I truly appreciate your time and effort, and I am confident that we can work together to create a logo that represents our brand well.\n\nBest regards,",
