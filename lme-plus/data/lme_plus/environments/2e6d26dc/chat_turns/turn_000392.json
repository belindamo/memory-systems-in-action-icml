I understand that you have put a significant amount of effort into creating the logo designs for our new brand. However, after careful consideration, I have decided not to proceed with the current designs.\n\nPlease know that this decision is not a reflection of your skills or talent as a graphic designer. It is simply a matter of finding the right fit for our brand identity. I genuinely appreciate your time and effort, and I hope that you will understand my decision.\n\nPer Fiverr's terms and conditions, I will proceed with canceling the order and processing any necessary refunds. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nOnce again, I want to express my gratitude for your work, and I wish you continued success in your future projects.\n\nBest regards,",
