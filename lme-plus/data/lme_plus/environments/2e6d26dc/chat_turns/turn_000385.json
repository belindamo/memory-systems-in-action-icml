  "content": "Hello cosmicbeauty2, thank you for the work you have delivered so far. Maybe I didn't do a good job providing you enough information to create the information you needed to do the work.\n\nI do like some things of option 2: I think the font you used is pretty nice, and it's a minimalist concept I think, those are things I like about it. However, looking the logo the things I spot are a mountain, which would make it look very similar to the logo from one of the competitors (the one I sent you as part of the briefing). The other aspect I don't like about it is that the lines make it look like there's a letter M forming out of it, which does not have any relation with our brand.\n\nSadly I didn't like Option 1 either, and didn't understand Option 3. I do appreciate the work and time you have spent on this but I hope that you could improve on Option 2, as being the one who approximates to my liking.\n\nHope this could be helpful.",
