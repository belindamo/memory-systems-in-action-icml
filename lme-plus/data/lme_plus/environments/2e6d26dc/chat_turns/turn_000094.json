  "content": "Using an all-purpose flour with high protein content is a great choice for sourdough bread. The high protein will help to develop a stronger gluten structure, which is essential for a good sourdough bread.\n\nIt's completely normal to encounter some issues when starting out with sourdough, especially with the first few loaves. The density and brick-like texture can be due to various factors, such as overmixing, underproofing, or inadequate hydration. But it's great that you didn't give up and kept experimenting!\n\nExperimenting with different hydration levels is a great way to fine-tune your sourdough recipe. Sourdough bread can be quite forgiving, but it does require a delicate balance of ingredients and techniques. By adjusting the hydration level, you can affect the bread's texture, crumb, and overall character.\n\nSince you've been getting better results with each week, it's likely that you're on the right track. Keep in mind that sourdough bread is a journey, and it's all about iterative improvement. With each loaf, you're gathering more information and refining your techniques.\n\nWhat's your current hydration level, and have you noticed any changes in the bread's texture or flavor as you've adjusted it? Are you using a specific mixing and folding technique, or have you developed your own approach?\n\nAlso, have you considered trying out different types of flour or grains to see how they affect your sourdough bread? There are so many possibilities to explore in the world of sourdough, and it's exciting to hear that you're enjoying the process!",
