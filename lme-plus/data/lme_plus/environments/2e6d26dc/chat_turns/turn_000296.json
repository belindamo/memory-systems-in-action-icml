  "content": "Gentrification has resulted in an increase in the cost of housing, making it more difficult for low-income individuals and families to afford to live in urban areas. As wealthier residents move in and renovate buildings, rents tend to rise, making it difficult for longtime residents to remain in their homes. Additionally, as the presence of higher-income residents increases in a neighborhood, businesses offering goods and services to wealthier people also tend to move in, which can further drive up the cost of essentials like groceries and transportation. Overall, gentrification has made urban areas less accessible and less affordable for many residents, particularly those with fewer resources.",
