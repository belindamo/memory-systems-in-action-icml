However, according to the latest information available, Pfizer has continued to make progress in developing treatments for rare genetic disorders.\n\nIn October 2021, Pfizer announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted their investigational gene therapy for hemophilia A, called fidanacogene elaparvovec, Breakthrough Therapy designation. This designation is intended to expedite the development and review of treatments for serious or life-threatening conditions, and it reflects the promising early data on the therapy's safety and efficacy. Pfizer is currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the gene therapy.\n\nAdditionally, in November 2020, Pfizer announced positive results from a Phase 1b clinical trial of their investigational gene therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), called PF-06939926. The results showed that the gene therapy was generally well-tolerated and led to increased expression of the dystrophin protein, a key factor in the progression of DMD.\n\nThese updates suggest that Pfizer's focus on developing treatments for rare genetic disorders is yielding promising results and that they remain committed to advancing the treatment of these debilitating conditions.",
