It depends on the type of interruption and its importance in relation to the presentation. Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether to address an interruption immediately or wait until the end of the presentation:\n\nAddressing an interruption immediately:\n\n- Can help resolve the interruption quickly and move the presentation back on track.\n- Can demonstrate that the presenter is listening and responsive to the audience's needs.\n- Can set expectations for the rest of the presentation, such as asking the audience to hold all questions until the end.\n\nWaiting until the end of the presentation:\n\n- Can allow the presenter to maintain their flow and keep to their presentation time limit.\n- Can avoid derailing the presentation with a lengthy discussion of the interruption's topic.\n- Can keep the attention of the audience focused on the presentation without distractions.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be based on what will best serve the presentation's overall goals and be respectful of the audience's time and attention.",
