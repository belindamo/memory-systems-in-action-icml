  "content": "The Zagg InvisibleShield is designed to provide a smooth, responsive touch experience, and it's unlikely to significantly affect the touch sensitivity of your smartwatch.\n\nThe tempered glass material used in the InvisibleShield is very thin (only 0.33mm) and has a special oleophobic coating that helps reduce fingerprints and improve touch sensitivity. In fact, many users report that the screen protector actually enhances the touch experience by providing a smooth, gliding feel.\n\nAs for the extra strap in black, it shouldn't affect the touch sensitivity of the screen protector at all. The strap is a separate component that attaches to the watch body, and it doesn't come into contact with the screen protector. So, you can enjoy the added protection and style of the strap without worrying about it interfering with the screen protector's performance.\n\nThat being said, it's worth noting that some users may notice a slight decrease in touch sensitivity, especially if they're used to the feel of the bare screen. This is usually due to the added thickness of the screen protector, which can take some getting used to. However, most people adapt to the new feel within a few days.\n\nIf you do experience any issues with touch sensitivity, you can try the following:\n\n1. Adjust your touch settings: Go to your smartwatch's settings and adjust the touch sensitivity to your liking.\n2. Clean the screen: Make sure the screen is clean and free of fingerprints or debris, as these can affect touch sensitivity.\n3. Check for dust or debris: Inspect the screen protector for any dust or debris that may be affecting touch sensitivity.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues, you can contact Zagg's customer support for assistance. They may be able to provide additional guidance or replace the screen protector if it's defective.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the Zagg InvisibleShield or smartwatch accessories in general?",
