  "content": "That's a wonderful idea! Adding David's phone number and a note to send a congratulatory message will ensure that you don't forget to reach out to him and his wife on Jasper's birthday. It's great that you want to stay connected and celebrate this special day with them.\n\nBy including the phone number, you'll have it handy when you need it, and the note will serve as a reminder to send a heartfelt message. You can even set a reminder to send the message at a specific time, so you don't forget.\n\nRemember to keep your notes concise and easy to read, so you can quickly glance at them and take action. You might also consider adding a brief message idea or a few words to get you started, like \"Happy birthday to Jasper! Hope you're all doing well.\"\n\nBy staying organized and thoughtful, you'll be able to maintain strong relationships with your friends and family, even when life gets busy. Kudos to you for taking the initiative to stay connected and celebrate the special moments in their lives!",
