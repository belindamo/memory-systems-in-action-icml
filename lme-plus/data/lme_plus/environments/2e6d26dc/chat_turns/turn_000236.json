As they grow, their parents teach them the ways of the dark side, grooming them to be their successors and continue their rule over the galaxy.\n\nHowever, as the children mature, they begin to question the actions of their parents and the legacy they seek to leave behind. They see the harm that their parents have caused and the lives they have destroyed, and they know that they do not want to continue down the same path.\n\nSo, the Jedi children overthrow their parents and take control of the galaxy, determined to bring peace and justice to all those who have suffered under their rule. They are determined to break the cycle of darkness that has consumed their parents and to use their power for good.\n\nIn the end, Rey and Kylo Ren are brought to justice for their crimes and their children rule the galaxy with wisdom and compassion, becoming legends in their own right and a symbol of hope for generations to come.",
