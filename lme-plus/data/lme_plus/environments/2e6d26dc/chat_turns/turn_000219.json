  "content": "I think I'll start by searching for neutral baby blankets on Etsy and Zazzle. I'll use specific keywords like \"neutral personalized baby blanket\" or \"custom baby blanket with initials\" to find relevant listings. I'll also filter by categories and check seller reviews to ensure I'm buying from a reputable source. If I find a design I like, I'll save it to my favorites and come back to it later. Thanks for the tips!",
