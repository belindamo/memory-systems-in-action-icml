  "content": "There is currently limited evidence to suggest certain lifestyle choices may increase the risk of developing a brain tumor. However, research is ongoing, and some factors that have been suggested to increase the risk include:\n\n1. Cell phone use: While there is currently no conclusive evidence to suggest that cell phone use increases the risk of brain tumors, some studies have suggested a possible link.\n\n2. Obesity: Some studies have suggested that obesity may increase the risk of brain tumors.\n\n3. Smoking: Smoking has been linked with a higher risk of certain types of cancer, but there is limited evidence to suggest that it increases the risk of brain tumors specifically.\n\n4. Alcohol consumption: Heavy alcohol consumption has been linked with a higher risk of some cancers but again, there is limited evidence to suggest that it increases the risk of brain tumors specifically.\n\nIt's important to note that these factors have not been conclusively proven to increase the risk of brain tumors and further research is needed to clarify their impact.",
