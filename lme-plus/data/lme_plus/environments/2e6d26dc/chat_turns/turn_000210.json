  "content": "What a lovely gesture! A personalized blanket is a great idea for a baby gift. Since you have recent experience with baby showers, you know how much thought and love goes into choosing a gift. Here are some suggestions to help you make your gift extra special:\n\n1. **Name and Initials**: A blanket with the baby's name and initials is a classic choice. You can opt for a simple, elegant font or something more playful, depending on your friend's style.\n2. **Special Message**: Consider adding a heartfelt message to the blanket, such as \"Little One\" or \"Sweet Dreams.\" This adds an extra layer of thoughtfulness to the gift.\n3. **Custom Design**: If you want to make it more unique, you can choose a custom design that reflects the baby's personality or the parents' interests. For example, a sports-themed blanket for a sports-loving family or a nature-inspired design for an outdoor-loving family.\n4. **Soft and Cozy Material**: Opt for a blanket made from super-soft, plush materials like Sherpa, fleece, or muslin. Babies love to snuggle up in cozy blankets, and parents appreciate the comfort and practicality.\n5. **Neutral or Theme-Based**: If you're unsure of the baby's nursery theme or color scheme, consider a neutral blanket that will fit in with any decor. Alternatively, if you know the theme, you can choose a blanket that matches, such as a jungle-themed blanket for a safari-inspired nursery.\n6. **Size**: Choose a blanket that's large enough to be useful, but not so large that it's overwhelming. A standard baby blanket size is around 30x40 inches, but you can opt for a larger or smaller size depending on your preference.\n7. **Quality and Durability**: Look for a high-quality blanket that will withstand repeated washing and use. A well-made blanket will become a treasured keepsake for years to come.\n\nSome popular online stores for personalized baby blankets include:\n\n* Etsy (for unique, handmade options)\n* Personalization Mall\n* Amazon (with various sellers offering customization options)\n* Pottery Barn Kids\n* Buy Buy Baby\n\nRemember to check the production and shipping times to ensure your gift arrives in time for the baby shower.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find the perfect personalized blanket for your friend's baby!",
