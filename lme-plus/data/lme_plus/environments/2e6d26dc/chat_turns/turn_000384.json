  "content": "Subject: Logo Design Feedback for Our New Brand\n\nDear [Graphic Designer's Name],\n\nThank you for your hard work on the logo designs for our new brand. I appreciate the time and effort you have invested in this project. However, I have reviewed the designs, and I would like to share some feedback to help us move towards a logo that better represents our brand vision.\n\nFirstly, I want to emphasize that I value your creativity and expertise. While the current designs have some interesting elements, they do not quite capture the essence of our brand identity. In order to achieve the desired outcome, I'd like to offer some specific suggestions for revisions",
