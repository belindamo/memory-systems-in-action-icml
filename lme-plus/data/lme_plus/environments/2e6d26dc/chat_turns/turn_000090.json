Crusty bread can be a bit finicky, but with the right recipe and techniques, it's totally achievable. Here's a simple recipe for a delicious crusty bread that'll pair beautifully with your salad:\n\n**Crusty Bread Recipe (French-Style Boule)**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups warm water\n* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Autolyse**: In a large mixing bowl, combine warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until the yeast is activated and foamy.\n2. **Mix**: Add flour and salt to the bowl. Mix the ingredients using a wooden spoon or a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass.\n3. **Knead**: Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or knead by hand.\n4. **First rise**: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n5. **Shape**: Gently deflate the dough and shape it into a boule (round loaf). Place the dough onto a baking sheet or a proofing basket lined with parchment paper, with the seam side down.\n6. **Second rise**: Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a clean towel and let it rise for another 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size again.\n7. **Score**: Just before baking, use a sharp razor or a lame to make 2-3 diagonal cuts on the top of the loaf, about 1/4 inch deep.\n8. **Bake**: Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) with a baking stone or a baking steel inside. Place the loaf on the preheated stone or steel and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n9. **Cool**: Let the bread cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.\n\nTips for a crusty crust:\n\n* Use a high-protein flour, such as bread flour or all-purpose flour with a high protein content, to help create a stronger gluten network.\n* Keep the dough at a cool temperature (around 75\u00b0F to 78\u00b0F) during the rising process to slow down the fermentation and promote a more even crumb.\n* Use a steamy oven to create a crusty crust. You can place a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven or use a steam injector.\n* Score the loaf just before baking to control the way the crust cracks and develops.\n\nThis recipe should give you a delicious, crusty bread with a soft interior. Feel free to experiment with different flours, yeast, and techniques to find your perfect crusty bread!\n\nNow, go ahead and enjoy your Watermelon and Feta Salad with your freshly baked crusty bread!",
