In general, practicing yoga just a few times a week can provide numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. Some people find that practicing daily for shorter sessions, such as 15-30 minutes, is more manageable and helps them maintain consistency. The most important thing is to listen to your body and find a routine that works for you. The benefits of yoga can be seen at any frequency, so start with a realistic goal and adjust as needed. Remember, consistency is key, so even a short daily practice can make a big difference in your mind-body wellness.",
