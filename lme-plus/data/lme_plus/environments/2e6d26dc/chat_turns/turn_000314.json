  "content": "It sounds like you're thinking of a lot of people you care about! However, I have to clarify again that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal knowledge or access to information about your friends, family, or their personal lives. I'm just an AI, I don't retain any information from previous conversations, and I don't know anything about your aunt or her twin girls, Ava and Lily.\n\nBut it's wonderful that you're thinking of your aunt and wanting to catch up with her! Make sure to reach out to her directly and extend an invitation to your gathering. You might say something like:\n\n\"Hi Aunt [Aunt's Name], I'm hosting a potluck dinner and I'd love for you to join us! If you're available, please bring the twins along and we can catch up. Let me know if you have any special requests or needs for the little ones.\"\n\nRemember to be respectful of people's time and schedules, and don't assume they can attend or bring their kids. By being considerate and flexible, you'll create a warm and welcoming atmosphere for all your guests.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!",
