Congrats on the coilover upgrade, and I'd be happy to help you with your suspension questions.\n\nAdjustable sway bars can be a great addition to your suspension setup, but it depends on your driving style, goals, and preferences. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**What do adjustable sway bars do?**\n\nSway bars (also known as anti-roll bars) help reduce body roll during cornering, which can improve handling and stability. Adjustable sway bars allow you to fine-tune the stiffness of the bar to suit your driving style and the conditions you're driving in.\n\n**Benefits of adjustable sway bars:**\n\n1. **Improved handling**: By reducing body roll, you'll experience more precise cornering and better overall handling.\n2. **Customization**: Adjustable sway bars let you dial in the perfect balance of stiffness and comfort for your driving style and the roads you frequent.\n3. **Flexibility**: You can adjust the stiffness to suit different driving conditions, such as track days, autocross, or daily driving.\n\n**When to consider adjustable sway bars:**\n\n1. **You're a track enthusiast**: If you regularly participate in track days or autocross events, adjustable sway bars can help you optimize your car's handling for the track.\n2. **You drive aggressively**: If you enjoy spirited driving on twisty roads, adjustable sway bars can help you maintain better control and stability.\n3. **You've already upgraded your coilovers**: Since you've already invested in coilovers, adjustable sway bars can complement those upgrades and further improve your car's handling.\n\n**Things to keep in mind:**\n\n1. **Additional cost**: Adjustable sway bars can add to your overall suspension upgrade cost.\n2. **Installation complexity**: Installing adjustable sway bars may require more time and expertise compared to coilovers.\n3. **Ride comfort**: Stiffer sway bars can affect ride comfort, so you'll need to find a balance between handling and comfort.\n\nConsidering your recent coilover upgrade and your interest in autocross events, adjustable sway bars might be a great addition to your setup. However, it's essential to weigh the benefits against the added cost and complexity.\n\nBefore making a decision, you may want to:\n\n1. Research different brands and models to find the best fit for your car and budget.\n2. Read reviews and talk to fellow enthusiasts who have installed adjustable sway bars on their Civics.\n3. Consider consulting with a suspension expert or a reputable tuner to get personalized advice.\n\nGlad to hear you had a blast at the auto racking event in Anaheim!",
