However, I can suggest a few ways for you to find out:\n\n1. Check your phone or computer's clock/calendar: You can quickly glance at your device's clock or calendar to see the current day of the week.\n2. Ask a virtual assistant: If you have a virtual assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, you can ask them \"What day is it today?\"\n3. Look out the window: If you can see the sun or the sky, you can take a guess based on the time of day and the lighting.\n\nOnce you know the day of the week, you can start planning your to-do list and scheduling your tasks for the next few days. Good luck with your planning, and I hope you enjoy your stir-fry dinner!",
