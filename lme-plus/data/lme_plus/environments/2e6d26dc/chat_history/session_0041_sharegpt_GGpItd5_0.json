I appreciate the time and effort you have invested in this project. However, I have reviewed the designs, and I would like to share some feedback to help us move towards a logo that better represents our brand vision.\n\nFirstly, I want to emphasize that I value your creativity and expertise. While the current designs have some interesting elements, they do not quite capture the essence of our brand identity. In order to achieve the desired outcome, I'd like to offer some specific suggestions for revisions"

      "content": "Hello cosmicbeauty2, thank you for the work you have delivered so far. Maybe I didn't do a good job providing you enough information to create the information you needed to do the work.\n\nI do like some things of option 2: I think the font you used is pretty nice, and it's a minimalist concept I think, those are things I like about it. However, looking the logo the things I spot are a mountain, which would make it look very similar to the logo from one of the competitors (the one I sent you as part of the briefing). The other aspect I don't like about it is that the lines make it look like there's a letter M forming out of it, which does not have any relation with our brand.\n\nSadly I didn't like Option 1 either, and didn't understand Option 3. I do appreciate the work and time you have spent on this but I hope that you could improve on Option 2, as being the one who approximates to my liking.\n\nHope this could be helpful."

I understand that it may be challenging to create the perfect logo without enough information, so I'd like to provide additional feedback to help guide your work.\n\nOption 2 has some elements that I appreciate, such as the elegant font and minimalist concept. However, there are a few aspects that could be improved. The mountain shape resembles the logo of one of our competitors (which I included in the briefing), and we would like to differentiate our brand more. Additionally, the lines appear to form a letter \"M,\" which doesn't relate to our brand identity.\n\nUnfortunately, Option 1 did not resonate with me, and I had trouble understanding the concept behind Option 3. I believe that Option 2 has the most potential, and I hope you can refine it based on my feedback.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification or guidance. I truly appreciate your time and effort, and I am confident that we can work together to create a logo that represents our brand well.\n\nBest regards,"
