      "content": "I'm glad you're getting ready to head out!\n\nFor quickly cooking the chicken for the stir-fry recipe, I recommend using a high-heat method to get the chicken cooked through and browned in a short amount of time. Here are a few options:\n\n**Option 1: Pan-searing**\n\n* Heat a skillet or wok over high heat (around 4-5 on a scale of 1-10).\n* Add a small amount of oil (about 1-2 teaspoons) to the pan.\n* Add the chicken to the pan and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until browned on all sides and cooked through.\n* Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.\n\n**Option 2: Grilling**\n\n* Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat (around 4-5 on a scale of 1-10).\n* Cook the chicken for 5-6 minutes per side, or until cooked through.\n* Remove the chicken from the grill and set aside.\n\n**Option 3: Microwaving**\n\n* Place the chicken in a microwave-safe dish.\n* Cook on high for 3-4 minutes, or until cooked through.\n* Check the chicken every minute to avoid overcooking.\n\nRemember to always cook the chicken to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n\nOnce the chicken is cooked, you can proceed with the rest of the stir-fry recipe. Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces and add it to the skillet with the veggies and seasonings.\n\nYou should be able to cook the chicken quickly and get to your yoga class on time. Don't forget to relax and enjoy your calming music afterwards!"
