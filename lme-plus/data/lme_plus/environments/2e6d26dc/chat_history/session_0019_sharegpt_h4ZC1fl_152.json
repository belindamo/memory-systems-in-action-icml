      "content": "CAPIOX Hemoconcentrators are medical devices that are used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures to remove excess fluid from the blood, maintaining the proper hematocrit and protein concentration and enabling reinfusion of blood remaining in the circuit after bypass. The membrane of the hemoconcentrator is composed of polysulfone and is designed to achieve a high ultrafiltration rate (UFR) for efficient blood concentration in a short amount of time while restricting the removal of albumin. The inlet blood port is also designed to ensure smooth blood flow and reduce possible stagnation and prevent thrombus formation. The filters have a low priming volume, which is intended to keep them compact and light, requiring minimal storage space and offering easy disposal. The no-rinse hollow fibers are designed to enable quick setup even during the operation, and the entire housing, including blood ports, is transparent, making it easy to visually check the device. Overall, the CAPIOX Hemoconcentrators are effective and efficient devices that are designed to improve the outcomes of cardiopulmonary bypass procedures."

Remember the structure, style and content in context to the product description manual:\n\nThe Sofia Fluorescent Immunoassay Analyzer is a bench top analyzer used for fluorescent detection of various pathogens. The system uses an ultraviolet LED source and a sensor to collect data from each test cassette. Available tests which are purchased separately include hCG, Influenza A and B, RSV, and Strep A. The analyzer may be used in two different workflow modes. The walk away mode is designed for use with a single patient sample that is placed in the Sofia and the cassette is developed and scanned before displaying the results. The read now mode is designed for use with several patient samples and the user manually develops the sample outside the analyzer. Once development is complete, the sample is placed in the Sofia and immediately scanned. Results are displayed within one minute. \n\nThe Sofia Fluorescent Immunoassay Analyzer has an integrated printer and results may be printed, stored on the provided SD card, or sent to a laboratory information system (LIS).\n\nAbove Here is an example of an immunoassay system product profile.
