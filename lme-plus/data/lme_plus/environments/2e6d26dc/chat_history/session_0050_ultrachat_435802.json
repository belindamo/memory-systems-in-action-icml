Violence against women: Turkey has high rates of violence against women, and Istanbul is no exception. Women in Istanbul often face physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at home, at work, and in public spaces.\n\n2. Employment discrimination: Women in Istanbul are often paid less than men for the same work, and they also face discrimination in hiring and promotions.\n\n3. Limited representation in politics and leadership positions: Women in Istanbul are underrepresented in decision-making positions, both in the public and private sectors.\n\n4. Difficulty accessing education: While Istanbul has a relatively high literacy rate, women still face significant obstacles in accessing education, particularly at the university level.\n\n5. Discrimination based on religious or ethnic background: Women who are marginalized due to their religious or ethnic background face additional challenges in accessing education, healthcare, and equal opportunities in the workforce.\n\n6. Restrictions on dress and behavior in public: Women in Istanbul often face limitations on their freedom of dress and behavior, particularly in conservative areas of the city.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many ways in which gender inequality manifests in Istanbul, and they are by no means exhaustive."
