  "content": "Jack sat at the grand banquet hall, trying to calm his nerves. He felt a tickle in his nose, an all-too-familiar feeling that signaled the start of a sneezing fit. He looked over at Phil, his old friend and coworker, who was deep in conversation with his wife. Jack's heart raced as he felt the first sneeze build up inside him.\n\nPhil caught Jack's eye and the look of recognition on his face was all too familiar. \"Jack, you feeling okay?\" Phil asked, his voice low.\n\n\"I'm fine, Phil,\" Jack replied, trying to downplay the situation. \"Just a little tickle in my nose, that's all.\"\n\n\"That's what you always say,\" Phil said, his voice growing louder. \"But then you let loose with those humongous sneezes, and before we know it, we're cleaning up the wreckage.\"\n\nJack's nose twitched, and he could feel the first sneeze building up inside him. \"Phil, I swear, I can control it,\" he said, trying to convince himself as much as Phil.\n\nBut Phil wasn't having it. \"Jack, you need to face the truth. Your sneezes are like a force of nature. You've got to accept that they're going to be big, and that they're going to cause destruction.\"\n\nJack's eyes widened as he felt the first sneeze starting to take hold. He tried to hold it back, but it was too strong. He let out a mighty sneeze, and the entire banquet hall shook. Dishes crashed to the floor, silverware clattered against the table, and guests looked around in alarm.\n\nPhil just laughed. \"That's what I'm talking about, Jack! When you sneeze, you don't mess around.\"\n\nBut Jack was already feeling the second sneeze coming on. He tried to hold it back, but it was too strong. He let out another mighty sneeze, and the entire hall shook again. Guests started to stand up from their tables, looking around in alarm.\n\nPhil's wife was apologizing profusely, but Jack could hardly hear her over the sound of his own sneezes. He could feel them coming faster and faster, each one more powerful than the last.\n\nPhil grabbed Jack's arm, trying to steady him. \"Jack, you need to calm down,\" he said, his voice urgent. \"Your sneezes are out of control.\"\n\nBut Jack was beyond calming down. He was in the grip of a sneezing fit, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. The guests in the hall started to flee, and Jack was left alone, convulsing with sneeze after sneeze, until he was finally spent.\n\nWhen the last sneeze had passed, Jack looked around the banquet hall, now in ruins. He was surrounded by debris, and all the guests were gone. He looked over at Phil, who was still standing beside him, a look of concern on his face.\n\n\"Jack, are you okay?\" Phil asked, his voice soft.\n\nJack nodded, feeling the weight of his own power. \"Yeah, I'm okay,\" he said. \"But I think it's time for us to leave this place.\"",
