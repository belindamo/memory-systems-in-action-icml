Catching the sunrise at Tunnel View is a fantastic way to start your day in Yosemite!\n\nAccording to the official Yosemite National Park website, the road to Tunnel View is open year-round, but there may be some restrictions or closures due to weather or maintenance.\n\nIn the early morning hours, you can expect the road to be open, but it's always a good idea to check the park's website or call the park's road information hotline (209-372-0200) to confirm road conditions and any possible closures before you head out.\n\nAdditionally, keep in mind that during peak season (May to October), Tunnel View can get crowded, especially during sunrise. You might want to plan to arrive a bit earlier to secure parking and a good viewing spot.\n\nIf you're planning to drive to Tunnel View, make sure to follow all park rules and regulations, including speed limits, and be mindful of pedestrians, cyclists, and wildlife.\n\nIf you're not comfortable driving in the dark or prefer not to drive, you can also consider using the park's free shuttle bus service, which runs from 7 am to 10 pm. However, the shuttle bus service might not be available during the early morning hours, so it's best to check the park's website for the current schedule.\n\nLastly, don't forget to bring warm clothing, as it can get chilly in the early morning, especially in the spring and fall. And, of course, don't forget your camera to capture the breathtaking views!\n\nHave a fantastic time at Tunnel View, and enjoy your sunrise moment in Yosemite!",
