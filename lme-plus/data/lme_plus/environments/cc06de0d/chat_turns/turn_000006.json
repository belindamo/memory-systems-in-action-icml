  "content": "I'm really excited about my upcoming road trip to Yellowstone National Park! I've been spending a lot of time editing my recent portraits on Lightroom, and I think I've finally got the hang of it. Speaking of which, I spent at least 5 hours on Tuesday evening editing those photos, trying out different presets and styles. Do you have any tips on how to shoot landscapes in manual mode, especially when it comes to capturing the right exposure and focus?",
