Here are a few ways to do it:\n\n**Method 1: Using Conditional Formatting in Google Sheets**\n\nYou can use conditional formatting in Google Sheets to highlight cells when you reach a certain threshold. Here's how:\n\n1. Create a new column next to the \"Category Total\" column, let's call it \"Alert\".\n2. In the \"Alert\" column, use a formula like this: `=IF(B2>400,\"Approaching Limit\",\"\")`, where B2 is the cell containing the Category Total for Clothing.\n3. Format the cell to change color or display a warning message when the formula returns \"Approaching Limit\".\n\n**Method 2: Using Google Sheets Scripts**\n\nYou can create a script in Google Sheets to send you an email notification when you reach a certain threshold. Here's how:\n\n1. Create a script by going to Tools > Script editor.\n2. Write a script like this:\n```javascript\nfunction sendNotification() {\n  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();\n  var clothingTotal = sheet.getRange(\"B2\").getValue();\n  if (clothingTotal > 400) {\n    var subject = \"Clothing Spending Alert\";\n    var body = \"You've reached $400 in clothing purchases this month!\";\n    MailApp.sendEmail(\"your_email@example.com\", subject, body);\n  }\n}\n```\nReplace \"B2\" with the cell containing the Category Total for Clothing, and \"your_email@example.com\" with your email address.\n3. Set up a trigger to run the script daily or weekly, depending on your preference.\n\n**Method 3: Using Third-Party Budgeting Tools**\n\nYou can also explore third-party budgeting tools like Mint, Personal Capital, or YNAB, which offer alert systems and notifications for reaching certain spending limits or thresholds. These tools often integrate with your bank accounts and credit cards, making it easier to track your spending.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and you'll be notified when you approach your spending limit!\n\nDo you have any other questions about setting up these methods, or would you like more information on using third-party budgeting tools?",
