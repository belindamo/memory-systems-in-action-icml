Structuring your workout routine with a split focus on upper body, lower body, and core-functional exercises can be an effective way to improve overall fitness and running performance. Here's a breakdown of your proposed plan:\n\n**Upper Body Day:**\n\n* Focus on exercises that target your chest, back, shoulders, and arms, such as:\n\t+ Push-ups, dumbbell presses, or bench press\n\t+ Rows, lat pulldowns, or pull-ups\n\t+ Bicep curls, tricep extensions, or shoulder presses\n\n**Lower Body Day:**\n\n* Focus on exercises that target your legs, glutes, and calves, such as:\n\t+ Squats, lunges, or deadlifts\n\t+ Leg press, leg extensions, or leg curls\n\t+ Calf raises or calf presses\n\n**Core-Functional Day:**\n\n* Focus on exercises that target your core muscles, as well as functional exercises that mimic running movements, such as:\n\t+ Planks, Russian twists, or leg raises\n\t+ Single-leg squats, step-ups, or box jumps\n\t+ Lateral shuffles, carioca drills, or agility ladder exercises\n\nThis structure allows you to dedicate specific days to targeted exercises, which can help improve overall strength and endurance. However, here are a few suggestions to consider:\n\n* **Incorporate full-body exercises:** While it's great to focus on specific muscle groups, incorporating full-body exercises like burpees, mountain climbers, or jump squats can help improve overall fitness and running performance.\n* **Add progressive overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets over time to continue challenging your muscles and promoting strength gains.\n* **Incorporate active recovery:** Consider adding active recovery exercises like yoga, stretching, or light cardio on your non-strength training days to help with recovery and flexibility.\n* **Listen to your body:** Rest and recovery are crucial. If you're feeling fatigued or experiencing muscle soreness, take an extra rest day or modify your workout routine as needed.\n\nRemember to also prioritize your running training and incorporate rest days or cross-training to avoid overreaching and prevent injuries.\n\nHow does this sound? Are you ready to start implementing your strength training plan and taking your running to the next level?",
