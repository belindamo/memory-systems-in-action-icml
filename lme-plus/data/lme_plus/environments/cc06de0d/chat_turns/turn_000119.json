Warm up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching before strength training.\n5. Listen to your body and adjust your routine as needed.\n\nRemember to consult with a healthcare professional or certified trainer to create a personalized workout plan tailored to your fitness goals and needs.\n\nHow does this help?
