Let's assume it's $90.\n\n**Break-Even Analysis:** Calculate how many days you need to use public transportation to break even with the cost of the monthly pass.\n\n$90 (monthly pass) \u00f7 $3 (average daily bus fare) = 30 days\n\nThis means you need to use public transportation at least 30 days in a month to break even with the cost of the monthly pass. If you use public transportation regularly, a monthly pass might be a good option for you.\n\n**Pros of a Monthly Pass:**\n\n1. **Cost savings:** If you use public transportation frequently, a monthly pass can help you save money in the long run.\n2. **Convenience:** You won't need to worry about buying individual tickets or carrying cash for bus fare.\n3. **Flexibility:** A monthly pass often allows you to use public transportation as many times as you need without worrying about the cost.\n\n**Cons of a Monthly Pass:**\n\n1. **Upfront cost:** You need to pay the full amount upfront, which might be a significant expense.\n2. **Limited flexibility:** If you don't use public transportation as frequently as you thought, you might not get the most value out of your monthly pass.\n3. **Unused days:** If you have days off or don't need to use public transportation, you'll still need to pay for the full month.\n\nConsidering your previous month's expense was $120, and you're looking to reduce your spending further, a monthly pass might be a good option for you. However, make sure you'll use public transportation enough to break even with the cost of the pass.\n\nBefore making a decision, ask yourself:\n\n* Will I use public transportation at least 30 days in a month?\n* Are there any other ways I can optimize my commute to reduce my spending further?\n* Do I have the budget to pay for the monthly pass upfront?\n\nIf you've thought it through and believe a monthly pass is the best option for you, go for it! If not, you can continue to track your expenses and explore other ways to optimize your commute.",
