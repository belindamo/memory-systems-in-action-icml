  "content": "I'm looking for some tips on shooting portraits with my new 50mm prime lens. I just got back from a photo shoot with my sister and her kids, and I'm still editing the photos. Speaking of which, I spent at least 5 hours on Tuesday evening editing those photos on Lightroom, trying out different presets and styles. Do you have any general tips on editing portraits, especially when it comes to skin tones and contrast?",
