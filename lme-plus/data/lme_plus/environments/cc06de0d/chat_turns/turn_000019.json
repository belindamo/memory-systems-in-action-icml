A 2019 report by GLAAD found that LGBTQ+ representation in the music industry decreased from the previous year, accounting for 11.5% of all artists in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, compared to 14.4% in 2018.\n\n2. In a study of the Top 40 songs in 2019, the PRS Foundation found that only 20% of them were created by a songwriter who identified as a woman, nonbinary, or gender non-conforming. And out of those songs, less than 5% were created by LGBTQ+ women.\n\n3. A 2019 survey by Soundcharts found that 0.4% of artists on Spotify\u2019s Top 2000 playlist identified as LGBTQ+.\n\n4. In a 2020 article by Rolling Stone, several LGBTQ+ musicians and industry executives reported experiencing bias and discrimination in the music industry, including unequal pay, exclusion from certain opportunities, and microaggressions.\n\n5. Despite these challenges, many LGBTQ+ artists have still achieved mainstream success, including Elton John, Freddie Mercury of Queen, Lady Gaga, and Sam Smith.\n\nThese statistics and reports highlight the ongoing need for greater representation and equity for LGBTQ+ musicians in the music industry.",
