  "content": "That's great! It sounds like you've got a thoughtful gift for your coworker's new baby. A onesie and a set of baby washcloths are always appreciated, and they're very practical for new parents.\n\nGetting a card and wrapping the gift will add a nice touch to your present. You can choose a card that matches the baby's gender or a neutral one that's suitable for any baby. You could also include a heartfelt message inside the card, congratulating your coworker on the new addition to their family and expressing your excitement for them.\n\nIf you need any ideas for wrapping the gift, you could consider using a cute baby-themed wrapping paper or a neutral color that matches the onesie. You could also add some decorative elements like a bow or a small stuffed animal on top of the gift.\n\nIt's great that you're taking the time to put thought into your gift, and I'm sure your coworker will appreciate it. Remember, it's the thought that counts, not the price tag!\n\nDo you have any plans to give the gift to your coworker in person or will you be leaving it on their desk or mailing it to them?",
