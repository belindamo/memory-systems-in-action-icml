Take a break when the timer goes off.\n3. **Create a trip planning document or spreadsheet**: Organize your research and notes in a document or spreadsheet. This will help you keep track of your progress and avoid duplicated effort.\n4. **Use website blockers or productivity apps**: Tools like Freedom, SelfControl, or StayFocusd can block distracting websites or apps during your planning sessions.\n5. **Schedule planning sessions**: Allocate specific times of the day or week for trip planning, and stick to those times. This will help you avoid mindless scrolling and minimize the temptation to check YouTube or social media.\n6. **Prioritize offline research**: Consider visiting your local library or bookstore to gather travel guides, maps, and books about Japan. This will not only reduce screen time but also provide a more immersive and tactile experience.\n7. **Make a 'Stop Doing' list**: Identify common distractions, such as checking email or social media, and make a conscious effort to avoid them during your planning sessions.\n8. **Use technology to your advantage**: Utilize travel planning apps like TripIt, Google Trips, or Rome2rio to help you organize your itinerary and stay on track.\n9. **Take breaks and practice self-care**: It's essential to take breaks and recharge. Schedule time for exercise, meditation, or other activities that bring you joy and help you relax.\n10. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for achieving your planning goals or milestones. This could be something as simple as a favorite snack or a short break to watch a funny video (like David Dobrik or Liza Koshy).\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to stay focused, reduce distractions, and make the most of your online research while planning your trip to Japan.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding a balance between enjoying the planning process and staying mindful of your screen time. Happy planning!",
