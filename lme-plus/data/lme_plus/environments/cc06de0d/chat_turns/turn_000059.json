Posting a photo of your cat, Luna, might not be directly related to your vegan recipe content, and might not resonate as strongly with your audience.\n\nThat being said, if you still want to post a photo of Luna, it's great that you're thinking about the best day to post it! According to various studies, the best days to post on Instagram vary depending on your audience and their schedules. However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are considered the best days to post on Instagram, as they tend to have higher engagement rates.\n* Avoid posting on Mondays and Fridays, as they tend to be slower days.\n* If you're targeting a younger audience, you might want to consider posting on a Thursday or Friday, as they tend to be more active on Instagram during these days.\n\nUltimately, the best day to post depends on your specific audience and their schedules. You might want to experiment with different days and times to see what works best for you.\n\nBut again, if you want to maximize engagement and relevance, you might consider posting a vegan recipe-related content instead. Your audience is likely following you for vegan recipes, so it's a good idea to keep your content consistent and aligned with their interests!",
