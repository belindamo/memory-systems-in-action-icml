It provides a set of Azure-specific commands that allow you to manage Azure resources through PowerShell.\n\nAzure CLI is a command-line program that allows administrators and developers to execute administrative commands on Azure resources. It provides cross-platform command-line tools for managing Azure resources and can be installed locally on computers running Linux, macOS, or Windows.\n\nAzure Cloud Shell is an interactive, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources. It provides a browser-based command-line experience and is built with Azure management tasks in mind. Cloud Shell is temporary and requires a new or existing Azure Files share to be mounted.
