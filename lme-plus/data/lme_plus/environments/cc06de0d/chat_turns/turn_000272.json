  "content": "The defense may make demands that are improper, not applicable, or unreasonably burdensome for a few reasons:\n\n1. To delay or obstruct the discovery process: By making unreasonable demands, the defense can delay the plaintiff's access to evidence, and potentially delay the case overall. This could be a strategic move to gain an advantage in the case.\n2. To test the plaintiff's compliance: The defense may make requests for documents or information that they know the plaintiff does not have or cannot produce. This could be an attempt to test the plaintiff's compliance with discovery rules, or to gauge the strength of the plaintiff's case.\n3. To obtain information that could be used for settlement negotiations: The defense may make broad requests for information or documents that could be used to obtain leverage in settlement negotiations. Even if the requests are not entirely relevant to the case, the defense may use the information to paint a picture of the plaintiff's claims or negotiating position.\n\nIt's important for the plaintiff's legal team to carefully review and respond to any improper, not applicable, or unreasonably burdensome demands from the defense, in order to protect the plaintiff's rights and interests in the case.",
