It sounds like the conference was a great catalyst for your startup, and you made some valuable connections.\n\nI'm happy to help you with resources on AI applications in your industry. However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have have access to specific information about the conference, Sarah from Google, or Rachel from ABC Startups, as they seem to be fictional entities.\n\nBut don't worry! I can still provide you with general resources and guidance on AI applications in various industries.\n\nTo get started, could you please tell me more about your startup and the industry you're operating in? What specific challenges or areas do you think AI could help address or improve?\n\nAdditionally, are there any specific AI applications or technologies you're interested in exploring, such as:\n\n1. Machine learning for predictive analytics or automation?\n2. Natural language processing for chatbots or text analysis?\n3. Computer vision for image recognition or object detection?\n4. Robotics or autonomous systems?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your needs and goals, I can provide you with more tailored resources, including articles, research papers, online courses, or even potential partners or collaborators.",
