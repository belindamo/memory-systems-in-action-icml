Asking your audience for feedback is an excellent way to ensure you're creating content that resonates with them and provides value.\n\nHere are some questions you can ask your audience to help you create a journaling series that meets their needs:\n\n1. **What topics would you like to see covered in a journaling series?** (e.g., mindfulness, goal-setting, self-care, creativity, etc.)\n2. **What's your current journaling experience level?** (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced) This can help you tailor the prompts to their needs.\n3. **What's the biggest challenge you face when it comes to journaling?** (e.g., staying consistent, coming up with ideas, making it a habit, etc.)\n4. **What format would you prefer for the journaling series?** (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly prompts, themed prompts, etc.)\n5. **Would you prefer prompts that are more structured or open-ended?** (e.g., do they want specific questions to answer or more freedom to explore)\n6. **Are there any specific areas of your life where you'd like to focus on through journaling?** (e.g., relationships, career, personal growth, etc.)\n7. **How much time do you realistically have to dedicate to journaling each day/week?** (e.g., 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) This can help you create prompts that fit their schedule.\n8. **Would you like to see examples of journal entries or prompts from the series?** (e.g., to get inspiration or see how others approach journaling)\n9. **Are there any specific journaling techniques or styles you're interested in learning more about?** (e.g., bullet journaling, art journaling, morning pages, etc.)\n10. **How can I make this journaling series more engaging and interactive for you?** (e.g., would they like live sessions, Q&A, or a community to share their progress)\n\nYou can ask these questions through a social media post, an email newsletter, or even a survey. This will help you gather valuable feedback and create a journaling series that resonates with your audience.\n\nRemember to keep your questions open-ended and encouraging, and make sure to thank your audience for their feedback.
