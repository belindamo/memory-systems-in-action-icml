However, there are resources that you can check for recent sightings and updates on bird activity in the area. I would recommend checking local birdwatching groups, such as the Four Harbors Audubon Society, the Long Island Birding Club, and the New York State Ornithological Association. These groups often share and update sightings, and can provide valuable information about birdwatching in Stony Brook. You can also check online resources, such as eBird, which allows birdwatchers to report and share sightings of different bird species.",
