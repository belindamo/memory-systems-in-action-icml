  "content": "You're experiencing the common phenomenon of \"sleep inertia\" after the daylight saving time change.\n\nGradually adjusting your wake-up time by setting your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier each day is an excellent strategy to help your body adjust to the new wake-up time. This approach is called a \"gradual wake-up\" or \"wake-up creep.\" It's a gentle way to train your body to wake up earlier without feeling too abrupt or shocking.\n\nHere's why this approach can be effective:\n\n1. **Gradual adjustment**: By incrementally adjusting your wake-up time, you're giving your body a chance to adapt to the new wake-up time without feeling too drastic.\n2. **Builds habits**: This approach helps you build a consistent wake-up habit, which can be more sustainable in the long run.\n3. **Reduces sleep inertia**: By slowly adjusting your wake-up time, you can reduce the feeling of grogginess and disorientation that often comes with waking up earlier.\n\nTo make this strategy even more effective:\n\n1. **Stick to a consistent sleep schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends, to help regulate your body's internal clock.\n2. **Create a wake-up routine**: Develop a consistent morning routine that signals to your body that it's time to wake up and start the day. This can include activities like stretching, meditation, or reading.\n3. **Get some morning sunlight**: Exposure to natural light in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythms, making it easier to wake up.\n4. **Avoid snoozing**: Try to resist the temptation to hit the snooze button, as it can disrupt your sleep patterns and make it harder to wake up in the long run.\n\nRemember, it may take some time for your body to adjust to the new wake-up time. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. With consistent effort, you should be able to adjust to your desired wake-up time of 7:00 AM.",
