  "content": "That's wonderful! Giving the gift in person will definitely make it a more special and personal gesture. It's great that you want to congratulate your coworker in person and catch up with them after the baby's arrival.\n\nI'm sure your coworker will appreciate the thought and effort you're putting into the gift and the visit. It's a great way to show that you care about them and are excited for them during this significant life event.\n\nWhen you give the gift, be sure to take a moment to chat with your coworker and ask about the baby. Ask about the baby's name, weight, and any fun milestones they've reached so far. Showing genuine interest and enthusiasm will make the moment even more special.\n\nAlso, consider asking your coworker how they're doing and if they need any help or support during this time. Being a new parent can be overwhelming, and a little bit of support from a colleague can go a long way.\n\nRemember to be respectful of their time and boundaries, especially if they're still adjusting to life with a new baby. A quick visit and a thoughtful gift will likely be appreciated, and you can always catch up more later when they're feeling more settled.\n\nI hope the visit goes well, and I'm sure your coworker will appreciate your thoughtfulness!",
