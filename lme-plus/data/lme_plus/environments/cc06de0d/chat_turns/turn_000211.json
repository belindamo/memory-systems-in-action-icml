It's great that you're recognizing the importance of building in some flexibility to your routine.\n\nHere are a few additional tips to help you make the most of your new buffer time:\n\n1. **Use the extra time wisely**: Instead of just standing around waiting, use the extra time to do something productive or relaxing. You could read a book, listen to music, or even do some stretching exercises to get your day started on a positive note.\n2. **Make it a habit**: Try to make leaving a bit earlier a consistent part of your routine. The more you do it, the more it'll become second nature, and you'll be less likely to get caught out by unexpected delays.\n3. **Review and adjust**: As you start leaving earlier, pay attention to how it affects your commute and your overall morning routine. If you find that you're still feeling rushed or stressed, you might need to adjust your timing further.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding a balance that works for you. By building in a buffer and making it a habit, you'll be better equipped to handle unexpected setbacks and start your day on a more positive note.\n\nHow do you think you'll use your extra time, and what do you hope to achieve by leaving a bit earlier?",
