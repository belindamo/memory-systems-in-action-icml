      "content": "Upper Pines Campground is a great spot to spend the night in Yosemite Valley!\n\nAccording to the official Yosemite National Park website, Upper Pines Campground does provide bear lockers for storing food and scented items. However, it's always a good idea to check with park rangers or the campground's website for the most up-to-date information before your trip.\n\nIn Yosemite, bear lockers are typically available on a first-come, first-served basis, and they can fill up quickly.
