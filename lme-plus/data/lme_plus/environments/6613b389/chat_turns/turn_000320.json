We're all really excited to dive into the multiverse and explore all the different possibilities.\n\nI think I'll finalize the movie list soon, but I'm still considering adding one or two more films to the mix. Do you have any other recommendations that might fit the theme? Maybe something a bit more light-hearted or humorous to balance out the more intense movies?\n\nAlso, I was thinking of creating a playlist with some multiverse-themed music to set the mood before the marathon starts. Do you have any song suggestions that might fit the theme?",
