  "content": "There are a few ways you can try to retrieve a tennis ball that has fallen under your bed:\n\n1. Use a flashlight: Shine a flashlight under the bed to help you see the ball and retrieve it by hand.\n2. Use a long-handled tool: A broom, a mop, or a hooked tool can help you reach under the bed and retrieve the ball.\n3. Move the bed: If the ball is too far back to reach with a tool, you may need to move the bed away from the wall so you can access the space under it.\n4. Vacuum: If the ball has rolled into a tight space, you can try using the hose attachment on a vacuum cleaner to suck it out.\n5. Ask for help: If you're still having trouble getting the ball, consider asking a friend or family member for help. With two people, you can easily move the bed or use a tool to retrieve the ball.\n\nRegardless of which method you choose, be careful not to damage your bed or the surrounding area while trying to retrieve the ball.",
