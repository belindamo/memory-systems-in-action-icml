Greetings: The Brazilian culture is known for being friendly and welcoming, and a common way to greet someone is with a hug or a kiss on the cheek. In formal settings, a handshake is appropriate. 2. Dress code: Brazilians tend to dress casually and comfortably, with lightweight and colorful clothing being popular due to the warm climate. However, some places like high-end restaurants and clubs have a dress code. 3. Tipping: Tipping is not mandatory in Brazil, but it's appreciated. A standard tip is around 10% of the total bill at restaurants. Taxi drivers and hotel staff may also be tipped. 4.

Safety: Like any other country, it's important to be aware of your surroundings and take precautions to stay safe while traveling in Brazil.
