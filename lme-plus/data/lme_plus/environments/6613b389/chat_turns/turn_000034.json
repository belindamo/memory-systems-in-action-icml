I might record some footage of special places we've been to, like our first date spot or where we got engaged. And I'll definitely include some personal anecdotes and inside jokes that are just between us. Thanks for the tips!\n\nBy the way, I was thinking of giving my partner a small gift to go along with the video message. Do you have any ideas for something small and romantic that I could give them?",
