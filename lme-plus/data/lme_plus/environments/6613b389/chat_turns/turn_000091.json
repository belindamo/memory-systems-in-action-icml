If some dolls are more popular or rare than others, it might be worth breaking up the set.\n2. **Rarity**: If the set is extremely rare or hard to find, selling it as a whole might be the best option to preserve its collectibility.\n3. **Your target audience**: If you're targeting collectors who are looking for specific dolls, breaking up the set might be a better option. If you're targeting buyers who want a complete set, selling it as a whole might be better.\n4. **Your pricing strategy**: If you're willing to offer a discounted price for the entire set, selling it as a whole might be a good option. If you want to maximize your profit, breaking up the set and selling individual dolls might be a better choice.\n\nYou could also consider a hybrid approach:\n\n1. **List the set as a whole**: Create a listing for the entire set, highlighting its rarity and collectibility.\n2. **Offer individual dolls as an option**: In the listing, mention that you're open to selling individual dolls separately and provide prices for each doll.\n\nThis way, you can attract buyers who are interested in the entire set while also giving individual buyers the option to purchase specific dolls.\n\nRemember to research the market demand and prices for each doll before making a decision. Good luck with your sale!",
