However, the developers have hinted that the game might be more accessible to new players than their previous titles.\n\nIn an interview, Hidetaka Miyazaki, the director of Elden Ring, mentioned that the game would have a \"more gentle\" learning curve compared to Dark Souls or Sekiro. He also stated that the game would have a more \"open\" and \"exploratory\" feel, which might make it easier for new players to get into.\n\nThat being said, it's still a FromSoftware game, and you can expect a certain level of challenge and complexity. The game's world is designed to be vast and interconnected, with many secrets and hidden areas to discover. The combat system is also expected to be deep and nuanced, with a focus on strategy and player choice.\n\nIt's likely that Elden Ring will strike a balance between accessibility and challenge, making it appealing to both new players and veterans of the Soulsborne genre. New players might find the game's early areas and introductory mechanics more forgiving, while veterans will likely appreciate the depth and complexity that emerges as they progress through the game.\n\nUltimately, the difficulty level of Elden Ring remains to be seen, but it's clear that FromSoftware is aiming to create a game that's both challenging and rewarding for players of all skill levels.",
