Here's an updated version of the email:\n\n**Subject: Request for Presentation Recording and Attendee List from InvestFest**\n\nDear InvestFest Organizers,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to request a copy of the recording of my presentation, \"Digital Marketing Trends for 2023,\" which I delivered at InvestFest in New York last month. I'm interested in obtaining a copy of the recording for my personal records and to share with some colleagues who were unable to attend the event.\n\nWould it be possible to provide me with a digital copy of the recording, either in video or audio format? I understand that InvestFest may have certain policies or procedures in place for sharing presentation recordings, and I'm happy to comply with any necessary requirements.\n\nAdditionally, I was wondering if it would be possible to obtain a copy of the attendee list from the event. I'd like to follow up with some of the attendees who showed interest in my presentation and continue the conversation. If this is something that can be shared, please let me know and I'll be happy to provide any necessary information or agreements.\n\nIf there's any additional information you need from me to facilitate these requests, please let me know. I appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Break out the requests into separate paragraphs to make it clear and easy to read.\n* Be specific about what you're requesting, including the presentation recording and attendee list.\n* Show willingness to comply with any necessary procedures or requirements that InvestFest may have in place.\n* Keep the tone polite and professional, and avoid making demands or assumptions about the organizers' ability to provide the requested information.\n\nBy including both requests in the same email, you can simplify the process and reduce the back-and-forth with the InvestFest organizers. However, if you prefer to send separate requests, that's also perfectly fine!",
