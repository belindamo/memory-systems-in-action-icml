Like No Way Home, it brings together a multitude of characters from previous Marvel movies for an epic adventure.\n2. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) - As a fellow Marvel movie, Doctor Strange 2 explores the concept of the multiverse, which is also a key element in No Way Home. You'll see connections to other Marvel films and characters, as well as some mind-bending action sequences.\n3. The Batman (2022) - While not part of the MCU, The Batman is a superhero film that shares some similarities with Spider-Man: No Way Home in its darker tone and complex storytelling. It's a fresh take on the Caped Crusader, with a strong focus on character development and detective work.\n4. Logan (2017) - This X-Men film is a critically acclaimed, character-driven story that explores the Wolverine's legacy.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) - This Marvel sequel is known for its nostalgic value, humor, and heartfelt moments. Like No Way Home, it explores themes of family, identity, and the power of friendship.\n8. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) - This MCU classic is a political thriller that delves into the world of espionage and conspiracy.
