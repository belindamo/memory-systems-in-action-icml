  "content": "The Spring Fling is a refreshing and delicious choice for your event.\n\nTo give you a rough estimate of the ingredients needed for 200 servings, I've broken down the recipe into individual components. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate, and you may need to adjust based on individual serving sizes and guest preferences.\n\n**Spring Fling Recipe (200 servings)**\n\n* **Gin**: 400 oz (approximately 12-13 bottles of 1.75L gin)\n* **Fresh Grapefruit Juice**: 200 oz (approximately 12-13 cups of fresh grapefruit juice)\n* **Honey Syrup**: 200 oz (approximately 12-13 cups of honey syrup, 1:1 honey and water, dissolved)\n* **Fresh Mint Leaves**: 400-500 sprigs of fresh mint (depending on size and desired garnish)\n* **Sparkling Water**: 200 oz (approximately 12-13 liters of sparkling water)\n\nFor the honey syrup, you can make a large batch in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. To make the syrup, combine 1 cup of honey with 1 cup of water in a saucepan, heat until dissolved, and let cool.\n\nAs for the fresh grapefruit juice, you can either juice the grapefruits on-site or prepare the juice in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.\n\n**Non-Alcoholic Version: Spring Fling Spritzer**\n\nOffering a non-alcoholic version of the cocktail is an excellent idea, as it ensures that all guests can participate and enjoy a special drink. For the Spring Fling Spritzer, you can substitute the gin with a non-alcoholic ingredient, such as:\n\n* **Ginger Ale**: This will add a spicy kick and a similar effervescence to the drink.\n* **Sparkling Water with a splash of Fresh Lime Juice**: This will provide a refreshing and light alternative.\n* **Fresh Fruit Infusion**: You can infuse water with fruits like strawberries, raspberries, or oranges to create a flavorful and fruity drink.\n\nFor the Spring Fling Spritzer, you can use the same amount of grapefruit juice, honey syrup, and fresh mint as the original recipe. Simply omit the gin and add the non-alcoholic ingredient of your choice.\n\n**Tips and Considerations**\n\n* Make sure to have plenty of ice on hand to keep the drinks cold and refreshing.\n* Consider setting up a signature cocktail station with all the ingredients and garnishes, allowing guests to customize their drinks to their liking.\n* Have a plan in place for disposing of used mint leaves and grapefruit slices to keep the area clean and tidy.\n* If you're serving the drinks in a glass, consider using a custom-designed glass or a unique garnish to make the drink stand out.\n\nI hope this helps you plan an amazing event with a delicious and refreshing signature cocktail!",
