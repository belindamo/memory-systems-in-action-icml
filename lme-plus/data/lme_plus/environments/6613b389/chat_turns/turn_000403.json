  "content": "\"Hunger stones\" are large stones or boulders inscribed with warnings or messages about low water levels and droughts in rivers. Some \"Hunger stones\" have been found along the River Rhine. These stones were used as a marker to indicate the level of the water, during low water levels the inscriptions on the stones were visible, and during high water levels the inscriptions were submerged.\n\nExamples of such \"Hunger stones\" along the River Rhine include:\n\n1. The Hungerstein in the town of Decin, Czech Republic, which bears an inscription dating back to 1616 warning of a severe drought.\n2. The Hunger Stone in the town of Sch\u00f6na, Czech Republic, which bears an inscription dating back to 1616 warning of a severe drought.\n3. The Hungersteine in the town of Lauchringen, Germany, which bears inscriptions warning of low water levels and droughts dating back to the 16th century.\n\nIn recent years, these stones have been exposed again due to the low water levels on the Rhine, which is a consequence of the climate change and human activities such as river regulation and water abstraction. It is an important reminder of the impact of human activities on the environment and the importance of sustainable management of water resources.",
