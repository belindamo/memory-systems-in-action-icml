  "content": "A sugar-free mojito sounds like a refreshing idea! Monk fruit sweetener and lime bitters will add a unique twist to this classic cocktail. Here are some tips for making a great mojito and incorporating the monk fruit sweetener and lime bitters:\n\n**Tips for Making a Great Mojito:**\n\n1. **Use fresh mint**: Fresh mint is essential for a great mojito. Choose a variety like peppermint or spearmint, and make sure it's fresh and fragrant.\n2. **Muddle correctly**: Muddling is key to releasing the oils and flavor from the mint leaves. Use a gentle pressing motion to avoid tearing the leaves and making the drink bitter.\n3. **Use the right rum**: A good mojito needs a high-quality white rum that's crisp and clean. Look for a rum with a high proof (around 80-90) for a better flavor profile.\n4. **Balance the flavors**: A mojito should have a balance of sweet, sour, and herbal flavors. Adjust the amount of sweetener, lime juice, and mint to your taste.\n\n**Incorporating Monk Fruit Sweetener and Lime Bitters:**\n\n1. **Replace simple syrup with monk fruit sweetener**: Use 1-2 teaspoons of monk fruit sweetener to sweeten your mojito, depending on your taste. You can adjust the amount to balance the flavor.\n2. **Add lime bitters for depth**: Add 2-3 dashes of lime bitters to your mojito for a burst of citrus flavor and a hint of complexity.\n3. **Adjust the lime juice**: With the lime bitters adding a citrus flavor, you may want to reduce the amount of lime juice in your recipe. Start with 1/2 ounce and adjust to taste.\n\n**Sugar-Free Mojito Recipe:**\n\n* 2 oz white rum\n* 1 oz fresh lime juice\n* 1-2 tsp monk fruit sweetener\n* 2-3 dashes of lime bitters\n* Handful of fresh mint leaves\n* Soda water\n* Ice\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a cocktail shaker, gently press the mint leaves with a muddler or the back of a spoon to release the oils and flavor.\n2. Add the rum, lime juice, monk fruit sweetener, and lime bitters to the shaker. Fill with ice and shake vigorously for about 15-20 seconds.\n3. Fill a highball glass with ice and strain the mixture into the glass.\n4. Top with soda water and stir gently.\n5. Garnish with a sprig of fresh mint and a lime wheel.\n\nRemember to adjust the amount of monk fruit sweetener and lime bitters to your taste.
