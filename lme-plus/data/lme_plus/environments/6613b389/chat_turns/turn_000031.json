You can include captions or quotes to make it even more personal.\n2. **Video Message**: A heartfelt video message is a great way to express your feelings. You could record a series of short videos sharing your favorite memories, reasons why you love your partner, or simply telling them how much they mean to you.\n3. **Love Letter Scavenger Hunt**: Create a scavenger hunt with clues leading your partner to different places that hold special memories for the two of you. At each location, have a new love letter or note waiting for them to find.\n4. **Personalized Map**: Create a customized map with all the places you've been together, including the place where you first met, your first date, and other significant locations.
