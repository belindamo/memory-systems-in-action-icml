  "content": "If you only have a fishing rod, you could try the following method to retrieve the lost tennis ball:\n\n1. Extend the fishing rod: Unravel the fishing rod and extend it to its full length. Attach the hook at the end of the line.\n2. Lower the fishing rod: Carefully lower the end of the fishing rod with the attached hook under the bed, trying to locate the lost tennis ball.\n3. Retrieve the ball: If the hook of the fishing rod snags the lost tennis ball, gently lift it out. If the hook doesn't snag the ball, you can try gently maneuvering it around until it catches on the ball.\n\nNote: Be careful when using the fishing rod, as you don't want to damage your bed or the surrounding area while trying to retrieve the ball.",
