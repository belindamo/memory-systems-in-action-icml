  "content": "I'd like to compare prices for a 4-night trip to Rome, including flights and accommodation, for one person. I'm flexible with my travel dates, but I'd prefer to travel during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October). I'm looking for a mid-range hotel or apartment with a good location.
