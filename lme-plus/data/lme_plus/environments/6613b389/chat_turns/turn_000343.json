  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! Adding some of the peppers you've been experimenting with to the salsa will not only give it an extra kick but also add a level of complexity and depth to the flavor profile. The spicy mango salsa will complement the Mango Habanero Spritz perfectly, and the peppers will tie everything together.\n\nRemember, when working with hot peppers, it's all about balance. Start with a small amount and taste as you go, adjusting the heat level to your liking. You can always add more heat, but it's harder to remove it once it's added.\n\nSome tips for incorporating your homemade hot sauce into the salsa:\n\n* **Start with a small amount**: Add a teaspoon or two of your hot sauce to the salsa and taste. You can always add more, but it's better to err on the side of caution.\n* **Choose the right pepper**: Select a pepper that complements the flavors in the salsa. For example, if you're using habaneros in the Mango Habanero Spritz, you might want to use a similar type of pepper in the salsa.\n* **Consider the flavor profile**: Think about the flavor profile of your hot sauce and how it will interact with the mango, onions, and other ingredients in the salsa. You might want to adjust the amount of acidity or sweetness in the salsa to balance out the flavors.\n\nBy incorporating your homemade hot sauce into the salsa, you'll create a unique and delicious pairing that showcases your creativity and experimentation with peppers. Have fun and enjoy the process!",
