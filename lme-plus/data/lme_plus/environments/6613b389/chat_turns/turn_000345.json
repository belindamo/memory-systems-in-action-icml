  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce will add a rich, smoky heat to the salsa that will complement the Mango Habanero Spritz perfectly. The smokiness will tie in nicely with the grilled shrimp, and the adobo sauce will add a depth of flavor that will enhance the overall experience.\n\nThe chipotle peppers will also add a slightly sweet and slightly spicy flavor that will balance out the sweetness of the mango and the heat of the habanero. The adobo sauce will add a tangy, slightly sweet flavor that will tie everything together.\n\nI think the smoky heat from the chipotle peppers will work really well with the Mango Habanero Spritz. The drink's sweetness will help to balance out the heat, and the habanero peppers will add a similar type of heat to the salsa. The combination of the two will create a beautiful harmony of flavors that will elevate the entire experience.\n\nJust be sure to taste the salsa as you go and adjust the heat level to your liking. You can always add more chipotle peppers, but it's harder to remove the heat once it's added.\n\nI'm excited to hear how it turns out! The combination of the Mango Habanero Spritz, grilled shrimp skewers, and spicy mango salsa with chipotle peppers is going to be a real showstopper. Your guests are in for a treat!",
