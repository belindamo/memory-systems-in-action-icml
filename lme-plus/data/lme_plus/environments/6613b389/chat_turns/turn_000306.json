Speaking of gear, I've been thinking about my backpack and I'm not sure if it's the right size for this trip. I've been using it for my local hikes, but I'm not sure if it'll be big enough for all the gear I'll need for the multi-day hikes in New Zealand. Do you have any recommendations for backpacks that would be suitable for this type of trip?",
