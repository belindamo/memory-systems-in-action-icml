  "content": "Yes, you can try a simpler plan without using all of those objects:\n\n1. Move the bed: If the ball is too far back to reach with your hand, try moving the bed away from the wall. This will give you access to the space under it and allow you to retrieve the ball by hand.\n2. Use a broom or mop: If moving the bed is not an option, try using a broom or mop to retrieve the ball. The long handle will give you the extra reach you need to get under the bed and grab the ball.\n3. Vacuum: If the ball has rolled into a tight space, you can try using the hose attachment on a vacuum cleaner to suck it out.\n\nThese methods should allow you to retrieve the ball without making a mess or creating a complicated retrieval tool.",
