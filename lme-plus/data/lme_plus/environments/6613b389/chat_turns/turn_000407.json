Tamil cuisine often uses a variety of chilies, including Byadgi, Guntur, and Kashmiri chilies.\n4. **Cumin seeds** (Jeeragam): Cumin seeds are used whole or ground into a powder to add warmth and earthiness to dishes like sambar, rasam, and kootu.\n5. **Coriander seeds** (Kothamalli): Coriander seeds are used whole or ground into a powder to add a sweet, citrusy flavor to dishes like sambar, rasam, and chutneys.\n6. **Fennel seeds** (Sombu): Fennel seeds are used to add a sweet, aniseed flavor to dishes like sambar, rasam, and kootu.\n7. **Mustard seeds** (Kadugu): Mustard seeds are used to add a pungent flavor and aroma to dishes like sambar, rasam, and chutneys.\n8. **Asafoetida** (Perungayam): Asafoetida is used to add a savory, umami flavor to dishes like sambar, rasam, and kootu.\n9. **Turmeric** (Manjal): Turmeric is used to add color and a slightly bitter flavor to dishes like sambar, rasam, and kootu.\n10. **Ghee** (Nei): Ghee is used as a cooking medium and to add flavor to dishes like rice, idlis, and dosas.\n\n**Differences from other Indian cuisines:**\n\n1. **Use of coconut**: Tamil cuisine relies heavily on coconut oil, coconut milk, and grated coconut, which is not as prevalent in North Indian cuisine.\n2. **Less use of garam masala**: Tamil cuisine uses fewer whole spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves, which are commonly found in North Indian garam masala blends.\n3. **More emphasis on tamarind**: Tamarind is a staple in Tamil cuisine, used to add sourness and depth to dishes, whereas other Indian cuisines might use yogurt or lemon juice for similar effects.\n4. **Use of curry leaves**: Curry leaves are a distinctive element in Tamil cuisine, adding a fresh, herbaceous flavor to dishes. They are not as commonly used in North Indian cuisine.\n5. **Rice-based dishes**: Tamil cuisine emphasizes rice-based dishes like idlis, dosas, and pongal, which are not as central to North Indian cuisine.\n6. **Regional spice blends**: Tamil cuisine has its own unique spice blends, like sambar powder and rasam powder, which differ from the garam masala blends used in North Indian cuisine.\n\nThese differences contribute to the distinct flavor profile of Tamil cuisine, which is known for its bold, aromatic, and slightly sour flavors.",
