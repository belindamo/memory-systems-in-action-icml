The Vindobona: The remains of a Roman military camp in Austria, which was discovered during a period of low water in the late 19th century.\n2. The Celtic Oppidum of Manching: The remains of a large Celtic settlement in Germany, which was discovered during a period of low water in the 1960s.\n3. The Roman Harbour at Carnuntum: The remains of a Roman harbor in Austria, which was discovered during a period of low water in the late 20th century.\n4. The Roman Bridge of Kostolac: The remains of a Roman bridge in Serbia, which were discovered during a period of low water in the 1970s.\n5. The Roman shipwreck: The remains of a Roman shipwreck, which was discovered in the Danube Delta in Romania in 2006 when the water level was low.\n\nThese findings give us a glimpse of how the ancient civilizations were utilizing the river and its resources and also they are a great source of information for the historians and archaeologist to understand the past civilizations."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "\"Hunger stones\" are large stones or boulders inscribed with warnings or messages about low water levels and droughts in rivers. Some \"Hunger stones\" have been found along the River Rhine. These stones were used as a marker to indicate the level of the water, during low water levels the inscriptions on the stones were visible, and during high water levels the inscriptions were submerged.\n\nExamples of such \"Hunger stones\" along the River Rhine include:\n\n1. The Hungerstein in the town of Decin, Czech Republic, which bears an inscription dating back to 1616 warning of a severe drought.\n2. The Hunger Stone in the town of Sch\u00f6na, Czech Republic, which bears an inscription dating back to 1616 warning of a severe drought.\n3. The Hungersteine in the town of Lauchringen, Germany, which bears inscriptions warning of low water levels and droughts dating back to the 16th century.\n\nIn recent years, these stones have been exposed again due to the low water levels on the Rhine, which is a consequence of the climate change and human activities such as river regulation and water abstraction. It is an important reminder of the impact of human activities on the environment and the importance of sustainable management of water resources."
