  "content": "The War Domain does indeed provide clerics with powerful combat abilities, making them effective fighters in the front lines of battle. With bonus proficiency in armor and weapons, and the ability to make additional attacks as a bonus action, War Domain clerics can dish out a lot of damage in melee combat. They can also use their abilities to protect allies, using their spells and abilities to bolster others' attacks or defend against enemy attacks. If you enjoy playing aggressively, the War Domain can be an excellent choice for a cleric.",
