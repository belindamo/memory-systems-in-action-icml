  "content": "The passage describes a method for analyzing the equilibrium of a frame, which is a structure composed of straight or curved pieces joined at various points. The forces that act between these points can either be tension forces, which act to pull the points together, or pressure forces, which act to push them apart.\n\nTo analyze the equilibrium of the frame, the author suggests dividing the pieces that join each pair of points into imaginary sections. The internal force acting between these sections can be considered equivalent to the tension or pressure of the piece.\n\nBy drawing the frame as a skeleton, in which the points are connected by straight lines representing the tension and pressure forces, the mechanical action of the frame can be exhibited in a simple and elementary manner.\n\nThe author also mentions the concept of reciprocity, which is a geometric property that can be applied to the solution of mechanical problems. This concept involves a relationship between two figures such that the properties of the first figure relative to the second are the same as those of the second figure relative to the first. The author proposes to investigate a type of reciprocity that can be used to analyze frames and other mechanical structures.",
