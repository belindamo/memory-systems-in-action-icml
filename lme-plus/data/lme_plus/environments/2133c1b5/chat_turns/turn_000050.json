  "content": "Subject: English Skills Test Result: 0\n\nDear Fiverr Support Team,\n\nI am writing to request assistance with an issue I recently encountered with the English Skills Test on your platform. Despite my proficiency in English, I received a score of 0 on the test, which was taken on [date of test]. I was not able to complete the test as the exam stopped working properly on my browser, and I was not able to submit any answers.\n\nI would like to request that the issue be investigated and resolved as soon as possible, and that my test results be corrected to reflect my actual level of proficiency in the language. I believe that I have been unfairly penalized by this technical issue, and I would appreciate your help in resolving the matter.\n\nPlease let me know if there is any additional information or documentation that you need from me in order to assist with this issue.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
