I'm not aware of your physical surroundings or the specific location of the event.\n\nHowever, I can suggest a few options to help you find a nearby restaurant or cafe:\n\n1. Check online review sites like Yelp or Google Maps to search for restaurants near the gala venue.\n2. Ask the event organizers or other volunteers if they know of any nearby eateries.\n3. Use your phone's GPS to find the nearest restaurants or cafes.\n4. Look for signs or posters in the area that might advertise local food options.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find a great spot to grab a quick lunch during your break!",
