  "content": "I completely agree. the accessibility of technology is a significant issue for smaller farmers, who may not have the resources to invest in high-tech equipment and systems. governments and industry leaders have a role to play in ensuring that technology is developed and distributed in a way that benefits farmers of all sizes, not just large agribusinesses. this could involve measures such as providing financial support for small farmers to adopt new technologies, creating training programs to help farmers learn how to use and maintain new equipment, and promoting the development of open-source technology that can be used by anyone. by making technology more accessible to farmers of all sizes, we can ensure that the benefits of automation are shared equitably across the industry.",
