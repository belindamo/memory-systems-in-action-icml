  "content": "Companion planting is a fantastic approach to creating a more balanced and resilient garden ecosystem. Marigolds are an excellent choice for combating nematodes, and pairing them with tomatoes can be very beneficial.\n\n**Marigolds vs. Nematodes**\n\nMarigolds (Tagetes spp.) contain a chemical called alpha-terthienyl, which is toxic to nematodes. These microscopic worms can be detrimental to tomatoes, causing damage to the roots and reducing plant growth. By planting marigolds around your tomatoes, you can help suppress nematode populations and reduce the risk of infestation.\n\n**Additional Benefits of Marigolds**\n\n1. **Pest Repellent**: Marigolds also repel other pests, such as whiteflies, aphids, and nematode-carrying insects, which can be beneficial for your tomatoes.\n2. **Attract Beneficial Insects**: Marigolds attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings, which prey on pests that might harm your tomatoes.\n3. **Soil Health**: Marigolds have deep taproots, which can help break up compacted soil and improve its structure, making it more conducive to healthy root growth for your tomatoes.\n\n**Tips for Companion Planting Marigolds with Tomatoes**\n\n1. **Plant Marigolds Around the Perimeter**: Plant marigolds around the perimeter of your tomato bed, rather than intermingling them with your tomatoes. This will help prevent competition for water and nutrients.\n2. **Use a Variety of Marigold**: Opt for a variety of marigold that is specifically bred for nematode control, such as 'Nema-Gone' or 'Nemagold'.\n3. **Plant Marigolds Before Tomatoes**: Plant marigolds 2-3 weeks before planting your tomatoes to give them a head start in establishing themselves and releasing their nematode-repelling chemicals.\n4. **Maintain a Balanced Ecosystem**: Remember that marigolds are just one part of a balanced ecosystem. Ensure your soil is healthy, and your tomatoes are receiving adequate sunlight, water, and nutrients.\n\nBy incorporating marigolds into your tomato garden, you'll be taking a holistic approach to managing nematodes and creating a more resilient garden ecosystem. Happy planting!",
