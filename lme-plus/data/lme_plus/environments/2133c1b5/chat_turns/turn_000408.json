  "content": "You are correct that \"not enough information\" is the appropriate answer for the previous question, and I apologize for not providing a more rigorous explanation. I will strive to be more precise in the future.\n\nRegarding the new claim and evidence, based on the following key information from the evidence:\n\n* According to Iranian health authorities, there had been 1,812 COVID-19 deaths in Iran.\n* According to the same source, there were more than 23,049 confirmed infections in Iran.\n\nWe cannot conclude whether the claim \"There were less than 2,000 COVID-19 deaths in Iran with less than 25,000 confirmed infections during the pandemic, according to Iranian health authorities\" is true or false. The evidence provided shows that there were more than 1,812 deaths and more than 23,049 confirmed infections, but it does not give information about the total number of deaths and infections during the pandemic. Therefore, we do not have enough information to verify or refute the claim.",
