I am following up on an email I sent to you on [date of previous email] regarding switching sections in your course [Course Name]. I have yet to receive a response from you and I am running out of time to resolve this issue as the classes are starting soon.\n\nI would greatly appreciate if you could let me know if there is any possibility of switching to a different section of the course, as the scheduled time conflicts with another class that I am also trying to take. If not, any alternative solutions would be greatly appreciated as well.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
