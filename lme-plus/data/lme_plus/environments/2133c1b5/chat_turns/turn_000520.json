Personality: It's important to think about your cleric's personality and how they interact with others. Do they have a strong sense of justice or morality? Are they wise and level-headed or impulsive and emotional? Consider their attitudes, beliefs, and motives, and how they might manifest in different situations.\n\n2. Backstory: Your cleric's backstory can add depth and intrigue to the character. Consider questions like: How and why did they become a cleric? Do they have any significant events or relationships that shaped who they are today? Delving into your character's past can offer ideas for interesting character quirks and mannerisms.\n\n3. Relationship with the Divine: Since clerics derive their powers from a divine source, it's important to establish a relationship between your character and their deity. Do they fully embrace their faith, or do they have doubts and questions about their religion? Is their deity an imposing presence in their life, or are they more of a benevolent guide?\n\n4. Conflict: Adding a personal conflict or struggle can make your cleric more dynamic and relatable. Do they have doubts about their role or purpose? Are they grappling with a moral dilemma? Exploring these conflicts can make your character more complex and sympathetic.\n\n5. Interactions with Others: Finally, consider how your cleric interacts with other members of the party. Do they have a certain role in the group, such as being the moral compass, the protector, or the peacekeeper? Do they have close relationships with other members of the party, or do they keep to themselves? These interactions can help bring your character to life and make them more integral to the party dynamics.\n\nThese tips can help you create a well-rounded and engaging character that stands out from the rest!",
