  "content": "Yes, meiosis happens in all organisms that reproduce sexually. This includes animals, plants, fungi, and many other organisms. Meiosis is necessary in sexual reproduction because it produces haploid cells, which are necessary to combine with another haploid cell to form a diploid zygote. The zygote then develops into a new individual. Meiosis also ensures genetic diversity among offspring, which helps populations adapt to changing environments and increases their chances of survival. Although the details of meiosis may vary among different organisms, the basic process of meiosis is conserved across most eukaryotic species.",
