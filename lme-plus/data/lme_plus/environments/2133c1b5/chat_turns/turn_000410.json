That can be a daunting task, but it sounds like you've created a more open and airy space.\n\nNow, let's find some plants that will love their new home in your living room! To give you the best suggestions, I'll need to know a bit more about the space. Please tell me:\n\n1. How much natural light does your living room receive? Is it bright and sunny, or is it more dim and shaded?\n2. What is the temperature like in the room? Is it warm, cool, or average (around 68-72\u00b0F/20-22\u00b0C)?\n3. How much time and attention are you willing to dedicate to plant care? Do you want low-maintenance plants or are you happy to water and prune regularly?\n4. Are there any specific plant types or styles you're drawn to (e.g., succulents, ferns, flowering plants, etc.)?\n\nWith this information, I can provide you with some personalized plant recommendations that will thrive in your living room.\n\n(And, by the way, two hours is a great accomplishment for rearranging furniture! You must feel proud of your newly organized space)",
