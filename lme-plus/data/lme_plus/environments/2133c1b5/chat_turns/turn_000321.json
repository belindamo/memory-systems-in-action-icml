C is shown to be a function of the applied forces and the coordinates of their points of application, and independent of the form of the frame.\nStarting from this result, we can find in certain cases lower limits to the quantity of material necessary to sustain given forces, and also assign the forms of frames which attain the limit of economy.\nIf the greatest tensile stress allowable in the material which is to be employed is P, and the greatest compressive stress Q, the least volume of material in a given frame, consistent with security, is\n=\n(2)\nCommunicated by the Author. + Scientific Papers, ii. pp. 175-177.\nPhil.
