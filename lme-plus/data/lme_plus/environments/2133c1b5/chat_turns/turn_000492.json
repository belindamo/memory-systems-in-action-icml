  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to the latest data regarding the environmental policies implemented by the government in Xiamen. However, I have found that the government has been taking steps towards reducing pollution in recent years. For example:\n\n1. Xiamen has implemented a strict \"Blue Sky, Clear Water, and Clean Land\" campaign to improve the city's environment.\n\n2. The government has promoted the development of clean energy and has set a goal to have renewable energy sources account for 30% of the city's total energy consumption by 2020.\n\n3. The government has invested in the construction of new tram lines to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road.\n\n4. The government has also implemented policies to reduce emissions from industries, which includes the closure of heavily polluting factories.\n\n5. The government has encouraged the use of public transportation and electric vehicles by offering subsidies on vehicle purchases.\n\nHowever, there is still a long way to go to ensure a sustainable and healthy environment in Xiamen. It will require continuous efforts from the government, businesses, and individuals to reduce pollution and protect the environment.",
