But I can suggest a few ways to remind your brother to return your cycling helmet:\n\n1. **Text Message**: Send a text message to your brother's phone reminding him to return your helmet.\n2. **Phone Call**: Give your brother a quick call to remind him about the helmet.\n3. **Email**: Send an email to your brother with a friendly reminder about the helmet.\n4. ** Messaging Apps**: If you both use a messaging app like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Signal, send a message to remind him.\n5. **In-Person**: If you see your brother in person, don't forget to ask him about the helmet!\n\nYou can also try to make it a gentle reminder by adding a bit of humor or a personal touch to your message. For example:\n\n\"Hey bro, just a friendly reminder to return my helmet. I don't want to have to start wearing a cone of shame on my head\"\n\nRemember to be polite, respectful, and patient when asking your brother to return your helmet. Good luck!",
