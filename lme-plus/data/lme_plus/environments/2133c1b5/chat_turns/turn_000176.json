It's a great way to express your feelings and tell your love story in a unique and meaningful way.\n\nThe unity candle or sand ceremony is also a wonderful idea! Those types of rituals can be so powerful in symbolizing your commitment to each other and creating a sense of unity. It's a beautiful way to visualize your love and commitment to each other, and it can be a really special moment to share with your guests.\n\nAnd, of course, personal and meaningful vows are a must! Writing your own vows can be a really romantic and intimate way to express your love and commitment to each other. It's a great way to make the ceremony feel more personal and special, and it's something that you'll both treasure for years to come.\n\nIt sounds like you're on the right track in terms of creating an intimate and romantic ceremony. Remember to take your time, be creative, and don't be afraid to think outside the box. Your ceremony should reflect your personalities, your love story, and your commitment to each other.\n\nWhat's been the most fun part of planning your ceremony so far?
