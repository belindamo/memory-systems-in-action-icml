It also adds new factors that CFIUS must consider when reviewing transactions, including whether the transaction involves critical technologies, sensitive personal data, or control of infrastructure or energy assets.\n\nSection 4 of FIRRMA establishes new procedures for CFIUS to follow in reviewing transactions, including the ability to initiate a review on its own without waiting for a notification from the parties to the transaction. It also sets forth the timing and content of notifications that must be provided by parties to a covered transaction.\n\nSection 5 of FIRRMA sets forth the procedures for CFIUS to follow in reviewing transactions that have been voluntarily submitted for review.\n\nSection 6 of FIRRMA establishes the ability for parties to a covered transaction to file a notice of withdrawal of their notification with CFIUS.\n\nSection 7 of FIRRMA authorizes CFIUS to charge a fee for reviewing covered transactions.\n\nSection 8 of FIRRMA establishes certain requirements for CFIUS to report to Congress on its activities and the impact of the Act.\n\nSection 9 of FIRRMA authorizes CFIUS to impose civil penalties for violations of the Act, and sets forth the procedures for imposing such penalties.\n\nSection 10 of FIRRMA establishes certain protections for whistleblowers who report potential violations of the Act.\n\nSection 11 of FIRRMA provides for the judicial review of actions taken under the Act, subject to certain limitations.\n\nSection 12 of FIRRMA defines \"classified information\" and sets forth the administrative and judicial review procedures for actions taken by the President and the Secretary under the Act.\n\nSection 13 of FIRRMA clarifies that the Act does not alter or affect any other authority, process, regulation, or review provided by any other provision of federal law.\n\nSection 14 of FIRRMA provides for the continuation of certain actions taken under Executive Order 13873 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nSection 15 of FIRRMA establishes certain administrative procedures, limitations on access to information, and exemptions from the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nSection 16 of FIRRMA provides that if any provision of the Act is held to be invalid, the remainder of the Act will not be affected.\n\nSection 17 of FIRRMA authorizes the appropriation of funds necessary to carry out the Act.\n\nOverall, FIRRMA provides CFIUS with expanded authority to review foreign investments in U.S. companies and real estate that may pose national security risks.
