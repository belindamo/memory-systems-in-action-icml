Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Miracle-Gro Cactus, Palm & Citrus Soil**: This is a popular, well-draining potting soil that's perfect for Aloe Vera.\n2. **Black Gold Cactus Mix**: This soil is designed for cacti and succulents, with a blend of perlite, vermiculite, and sand to provide excellent drainage.\n3. **E.B. Stone Organics Cactus & Succulent Soil**: This is an organic, eco-friendly option that's specifically formulated for cacti and succulents.\n\nWhen choosing a potting soil, make sure it's labeled as \"well-draining\" or \"cactus and succulent mix.\" Avoid using regular potting soil, as it can retain too much water and cause root rot in Aloe Vera.\n\nAs for your furniture-moving adventure, I'm impressed you got it done in two hours! It's always a great feeling to rearrange your space and create a fresh look. I'm sure your roommate was happy to help, and it's always more fun with a friend by your side.\n\nRemember to take breaks and stretch when lifting heavy objects, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Now, go enjoy your newly arranged living room and get ready to welcome your new Aloe Vera plant!",
