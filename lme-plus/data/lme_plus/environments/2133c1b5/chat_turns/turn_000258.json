It's amazing how a single piece of furniture can make a big impact on the overall look and feel of a room.\n\nAs for area rugs, I'd be happy to provide some recommendations! Area rugs can add warmth, texture, and color to a room, and they can also help define different spaces within an open-plan living area.\n\nHere are a few things to consider when choosing an area rug:\n\n1. **Size**: Make sure to measure your space carefully and choose a rug that fits comfortably in the room. You'll want to leave a little bit of border around the rug to create a cohesive look.\n2. **Material**: Area rugs come in a wide range of materials, from natural fibers like wool and jute to synthetic materials like polypropylene and nylon. Consider the amount of foot traffic in the room, as well as any pets or allergies you may have.\n3. **Pattern and color**: Choose a rug that complements your existing furniture and decor. You can also use a rug to add a pop of color or create a bold statement in the room.\n4. **Pile height**: Area rugs come in different pile heights, from low and flat to high and plush. Consider the comfort level you're looking for, as well as any mobility issues you may have.\n\nSome popular area rug styles include:\n\n1. **Moroccan-inspired**: These rugs feature bold, geometric patterns and bright colors.\n2. **Natural fiber**: Rugs made from natural fibers like jute, sisal, and seagrass are perfect for adding warmth and texture to a room.\n3. **Shag**: Shag rugs are perfect for adding a cozy, retro vibe to a room.\n4. **Flat-weave**: Flat-weave rugs are great for high-traffic areas, as they're easy to clean and maintain.\n\nSome popular online retailers for area rugs include:\n\n1. **West Elm**: West Elm offers a wide range of stylish and affordable area rugs in a variety of materials and patterns.\n2. **Crate & Barrel**: Crate & Barrel carries a selection of high-quality area rugs from popular brands like Safavieh and Loloi.\n3. **Wayfair**: Wayfair is a great resource for affordable area rugs in a wide range of styles and materials.\n4. **Overstock**: Overstock offers a vast selection of area rugs at discounted prices.\n5. **Rugs USA**: Rugs USA is a specialty rug retailer that offers a wide range of area rugs in different materials, patterns, and sizes.\n\nI hope these recommendations are helpful!
