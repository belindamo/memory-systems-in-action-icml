  "content": "This is a great project idea that aligns well with the learning objectives you've provided. Here are some suggestions to help guide your students as they design and build their rubber band powered vehicles:\n\n1. Encourage students to use the scientific method when conducting their investigations. Have them start by posing a question (e.g. \"How can we make our rubber band powered vehicle travel further?\"), then have them plan and carry out an investigation to answer that question.\n2. Have students brainstorm different variables that could affect the distance their vehicle travels. Some examples might include the tension of the rubber band, the weight of the vehicle, and the surface on which the vehicle is traveling.\n3. Have students design and build their vehicles using materials such as popsicle sticks, plastic cups, and cardboard. Encourage them to be creative with their designs and to consider how different design elements might affect the distance their vehicle travels.\n4. Have students conduct experiments to test how different variables affect the distance their vehicle travels. Make sure they keep some variables constant and only change one variable at a time.\n5. After conducting experiments, have students evaluate the experimental results and communicate their findings. Encourage them to consider how their results might be applied to real-world situations.\n6. Throughout the project, remind students to use the attitudes of creativity, objectivity, integrity, open-mindedness and perseverance.\n7. Have them document their process and progress with pictures, notes and videos.\n8. Finally, have students present their design and investigation to the class and have a showcase of the different designs.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to help you.",
