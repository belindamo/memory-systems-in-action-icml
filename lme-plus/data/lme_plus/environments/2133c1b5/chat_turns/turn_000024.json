  "content": "Yes, the process of meiosis always results in four haploid cells. These four cells are genetically diverse because of the crossing-over and random segregation of homologous chromosomes that occur during the two stages of meiosis. The haploid cells produced by meiosis are then ready to combine with another haploid cell during fertilization, resulting in a diploid zygote. This ensures genetic diversity in offspring and helps to maintain the correct number of chromosomes within a species across generations.",
