An apple and some nuts are a great choice - they're nutritious, easy to eat on the go, and will definitely hold you over until you can get a proper lunch.\n\nIt was my pleasure chatting with you, and I'm happy to have been able to assist in some small way. You're doing a wonderful thing by volunteering at the charity gala, and I'm sure you'll make a positive impact.\n\nTake care, and I hope you have a fantastic time volunteering!",
