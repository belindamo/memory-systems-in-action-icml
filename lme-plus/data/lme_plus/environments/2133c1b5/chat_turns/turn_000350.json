  "content": "Yokohama is known for its fresh seafood, and you've picked two great local specialties to try! Kanimeshi and namashirasu are both delicious and popular among locals and visitors alike.\n\nFor kanimeshi, I highly recommend trying **Kanemasa**, a well-known restaurant in Yokohama's Chinatown. They've been serving high-quality kanimeshi for over 30 years, and their crab is always fresh and flavorful. Be prepared for a queue, though, as it's a popular spot among locals and tourists!\n\nFor namashirasu, you should head to **Tsukiji Itadori Uogashi Nihon-Ichi**, a sushi restaurant located near the Yokohama Fish Market. They're known for their fresh, seasonal ingredients, and their namashirasu is a must-try. Be sure to get there early, as they often sell out of their daily catch quickly!\n\nIf you're looking for a more casual, affordable option, you could try **Yokohama Fish Market's** food stalls. They offer a variety of fresh seafood, including kanimeshi and namashirasu, at reasonable prices. It's a great way to try local specialties without breaking the bank.\n\nLastly, if you have time, consider visiting the **Yokohama Central Market**, which is located near the Fish Market. It's a bustling marketplace with many food stalls and restaurants serving fresh seafood, including sushi, sashimi, and grilled fish. You can also find some nice souvenirs and local goods there.\n\nEnjoy your seafood adventure in Yokohama!",
