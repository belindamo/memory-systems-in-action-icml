      "content": "The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) is a law that allows the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review and block foreign investments in U.S. companies that may pose national security risks.\n\nSection 1 of FIRRMA provides the short title and sets forth the findings and purposes of the Act.\n\nSection 2 of FIRRMA defines certain key terms used throughout the Act, including \"covered transaction,\" \"critical technologies,\" \"foreign person,\" and \"national security.\"\n\nSection 3 of FIRRMA expands the jurisdiction of CFIUS to cover transactions that were previously outside its purview, including non-controlling investments and real estate transactions. It also adds new factors that CFIUS must consider when reviewing transactions, including whether the transaction involves critical technologies, sensitive personal data, or control of infrastructure or energy assets.\n\nSection 4 of FIRRMA establishes new procedures for CFIUS to follow in reviewing transactions, including the ability to initiate a review on its own without waiting for a notification from the parties to the transaction. It also sets forth the timing and content of notifications that must be provided by parties to a covered transaction.\n\nSection 5 of FIRRMA sets forth the procedures for CFIUS to follow in reviewing transactions that have been voluntarily submitted for review.\n\nSection 6 of FIRRMA establishes the ability for parties to a covered transaction to file a notice of withdrawal of their notification with CFIUS.\n\nSection 7 of FIRRMA authorizes CFIUS to charge a fee for reviewing covered transactions.\n\nSection 8 of FIRRMA establishes certain requirements for CFIUS to report to Congress on its activities and the impact of the Act.\n\nSection 9 of FIRRMA authorizes CFIUS to impose civil penalties for violations of the Act, and sets forth the procedures for imposing such penalties.\n\nSection 10 of FIRRMA establishes certain protections for whistleblowers who report potential violations of the Act.\n\nSection 11 of FIRRMA provides for the judicial review of actions taken under the Act, subject to certain limitations.\n\nSection 12 of FIRRMA defines \"classified information\" and sets forth the administrative and judicial review procedures for actions taken by the President and the Secretary under the Act.\n\nSection 13 of FIRRMA clarifies that the Act does not alter or affect any other authority, process, regulation, or review provided by any other provision of federal law.\n\nSection 14 of FIRRMA provides for the continuation of certain actions taken under Executive Order 13873 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nSection 15 of FIRRMA establishes certain administrative procedures, limitations on access to information, and exemptions from the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nSection 16 of FIRRMA provides that if any provision of the Act is held to be invalid, the remainder of the Act will not be affected.\n\nSection 17 of FIRRMA authorizes the appropriation of funds necessary to carry out the Act.\n\nOverall, FIRRMA provides CFIUS with expanded authority to review foreign investments in U.S. companies and real estate that may pose national security risks. It sets forth new procedures for notifying CFIUS of covered transactions, imposes civil penalties for violations of the Act, and establishes certain administrative procedures for implementing the Act."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "No, the provisions of this act apply to transactions and investments involving foreign entities and have no direct authority over civilians. However, certain provisions of the act may impact the activities of U.S. businesses and foreign investors operating in the United States, which could indirectly affect civilians. For example, the act may require businesses to disclose information to the U.S. government or undergo review of their transactions, which could potentially impact their operations and supply chains."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "There are several sections of the Act that could potentially affect civilians and/or their activities online:\n\n* Section 2(b) requires the Secretary to establish a process for the identification of \"critical technologies\" that are essential to U.S. national security. If a technology is designated as critical, any transaction involving that technology could be subject to review under the Act, which could potentially affect civilians who use or develop such technology.\n* Section 4(a) authorizes the President to review any transaction that could result in the control of a U.S. business by a foreign person, if the transaction involves a \"critical technology\" or is located in or near certain sensitive areas. Depending on how broadly these terms are interpreted, this section could potentially affect civilians who are involved in such transactions.\n* Section 6 authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations to identify and address \"emerging and foundational technologies\" that may be critical to U.S. national security. If a technology is designated as such, it could be subject to review under the Act, which could potentially affect civilians who use or develop such technology.\n* Section 8 authorizes the Secretary to establish a voluntary program to engage with \"critical infrastructure\" owners and operators to identify and mitigate potential security risks. Depending on how this program is implemented, it could potentially affect civilians who own or operate critical infrastructure.\n* Section 9(a) authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring certain U.S. businesses to submit certain information to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) regarding foreign ownership, control, or influence. Depending on how these regulations are implemented, they could potentially affect civilians who own or operate such businesses.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Act is primarily focused on transactions involving foreign persons and entities that could pose a threat to U.S. national security, and it's not clear how many of these provisions would directly affect civilians. However, depending on how broadly certain terms are interpreted and how regulations are implemented, civilians could potentially be affected by some aspects of the Act."
