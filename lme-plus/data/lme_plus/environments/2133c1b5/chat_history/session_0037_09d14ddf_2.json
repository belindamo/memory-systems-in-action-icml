Since you have spin class on Wednesday and Friday mornings, I'll recommend exercises that can be done on other days or at a different time of day. Here are some effective core exercises to add to your routine:\n\n**Monday (or any non-spin day):**\n\n1. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise targets your abs, obliques, and lower back.\n2. **Russian twists**: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Twist your torso from side to side, touching your hands to the ground each time. Do 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n3. **Leg raises**: Lie on your back with arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n\n**Tuesday (or any non-spin day):**\n\n1. **Bicycle crunches**: Lie on your back with hands behind your head and alternate bringing your knees towards your chest, as if pedaling a bicycle. Do 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n2. **Pallof press**: Hold a resistance band or cable handle and press it away from your body, keeping your core muscles engaged. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each side.\n3. **Side plank**: Lie on your side with feet stacked and hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds. Switch sides and repeat. Do 3 sets on each side.\n\n**Thursday (or any non-spin day):**\n\n1. **Reverse crunches**: Lie on your back with arms extended overhead and lift your hips off the ground, squeezing your glutes and lower back muscles. Hold for 1-2 seconds and lower back down. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n2. **Woodchoppers**: Hold a weight or medicine ball and twist your torso from side to side, keeping your arms straight. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n3. **Superman**: Lie on your stomach with arms extended in front of you and lift your arms, shoulders, and legs off the ground. Hold for 1-2 seconds and lower back down. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Start with lower reps and sets and gradually increase as you build strength and endurance.\n* Warm up before each workout with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching.\n* Focus on proper form and engage your core muscles throughout each exercise.\n* Listen to your body and rest when needed.\n\nThese exercises should complement your spin class routine nicely and help improve your overall core strength and stability.
