The number 6, on the other hand, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6. Prime numbers play an important role in number theory and have many applications in mathematics and computer science."

      "content": "Divisible means that a number can be divided by another number without any remainder. For example, the number 10 is divisible by 5 because 10 / 5 = 2 with no remainder.\nAnother example, 12 is divisible by 4 because 12/4=3 with no remainder.\nIn other words, if a number \"A\" is exactly divisible by another number \"B\" then we say that \"A\" is divisible by \"B\" or \"A\" is a multiple of \"B\" or \"A\" is a factor of \"B\""

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That is correct. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible by only 1 and itself. This means that the only factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself, so it can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. For example, the number 5 is prime because the only numbers that divide into it without leaving a remainder are 1 and 5."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "If you want to determine if a number is greater than 100, you can simply compare it to 100 using a relational operator such as \"greater than\" (>).\nFor example, if you have a variable x that holds a number, you can use the following code:\n```\nif x > 100:\n    print(\"x is greater than 100\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is not greater than 100\")\n```\nYou can also use other relational operators like <, >=, <=, ==, != to compare your number with 100 to see if it is greater, less, equal or not equal to 100.\n```\nif x >= 100:\n    print(\"x is greater than or equal to 100\")\n```\nOr\n```\nif x < 100:\n    print(\"x is less than 100\")\n```\nNote that the relational operator '>=' will test whether the number is greater than or equal to 100 and '<=' will test whether the number is less than or equal to 100."
