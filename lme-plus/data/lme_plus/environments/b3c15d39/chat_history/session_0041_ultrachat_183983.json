      "content": "No, it is not possible to play all games from available consoles on the Virtual Console. Nintendo selects and releases specific titles from each console for the Virtual Console, and some games may not be included due to licensing or technical issues. Additionally, the Virtual Console is not available on all Nintendo consoles."

      "content": "As an AI language model, I am always happy to help. If you are unable to find the games you want on the Virtual Console, you can try searching for them on other online marketplaces or see if they are available on newer consoles with backward compatibility. Alternatively, you can also try searching for similar games or remakes that may scratch that nostalgia itch."

      "role": "user",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It's always disappointing when we can't find what we're looking for, but there are so many great new games out there as well. I hope you find something you enjoy! If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask."
