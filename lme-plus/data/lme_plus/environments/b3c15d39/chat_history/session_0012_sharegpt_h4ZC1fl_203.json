      "content": "The VIDAS Nephrocheck is a diagnostic tool designed to assist in the early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. It works in conjunction with the VIDAS 3 to test for the protein biomarkers IGFBP7 and TIMP2 in order to calculate the approximate AKI risk score in patients with acute cardiovascular and/or respiratory compromise. The system consists of NEPH Reagent Strips, NEPH Solid Phase Receptacles (SPR), and a NEPH control and calibrator. The VIDAS Nephrocheck principle combines an enzyme immunoassay competition method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The interior of the NEPH SPR is coated with mouse monoclonal IgG anti\u2011IGFBP\u20117 and anti\u2011TIMP\u20112, serving as both the solid phase and pipetting device for the assay. The system is designed to automatically perform all assay steps, providing quick and reliable results.\n\nThe VIDAS Nephrocheck is intended to identify high-risk patients within 12 hours of assessment, allowing for the implementation of early renal-protective actions to reduce AKI frequency and severity. Additionally, the system is designed to rule out patients with confidence, adapt treatment using goal-directed protocols, and help healthcare professionals make informed decisions about patient care. The Reagent Strips consist of 10 wells covered with a labeled foil seal, with six wells containing conjugate, wash buffers, and substrate, and the last well containing the fluorescence substrate. This system is intended for use in the clinical evaluation of patients, with NEPH liquid controls and calibration verification kits sold separately."

      "content": "Sure, here are the steps needed to write a product profile description:\n\n1. Begin with a clear and concise product title that accurately describes the product.\n2. Write a brief, informative introduction that provides an overview of the product, including its purpose, function, and key features.\n3. In the body of the description, provide more detailed information about the product's features, specifications, and benefits.\n4. Use bullet points or numbered lists to make information easy to read and understand.\n5. Use clear, concise language and avoid technical jargon whenever possible.\n6. Provide any relevant technical specifications, such as dimensions, weight, power requirements, and compatibility with other products.\n7. Use the IDEAL technique to structure your description: Identify the product, Describe its features, Explain its benefits, Address any potential concerns or drawbacks, and List any additional information or features.\n\nThe first step is to identify the product with a clear and concise title that accurately describes it. The second step is to provide an informative introduction that gives an overview of the product, including its purpose, function, and key features. The body of the description should provide more detailed information about the product's features, specifications, and benefits, using bullet points or numbered lists to make it easy to read and understand.\n\nThe IDEAL technique is a useful structure to follow when writing a product description. It stands for:\n\n* Identify: Start by identifying the product and its key features.\n* Describe: Describe the product in more detail, including any technical specifications or other relevant information.\n* Explain: Explain how the product works and what benefits it offers to the user.\n* Address: Address any potential concerns or drawbacks of the product.\n* List: List any additional information or features that might be relevant to the user.\n\nFollowing these steps and using the IDEAL technique can help you write a clear, informative, and unbiased product description that accurately represents the product and its features."

Learn from the given examples as a template.\n\nManual:\nThe first sentence always contains the product name, what the product is, and what it is used for. \u200b\nAlways start the description with the name of the product profile. Use the full name exactly as it is.\u200b\nDescribe what the product is in a couple of words (adjective, adjective noun) when not obvious from the name. This is often a reference to the group the product is in.\u200b\nWhat the product is used for should be derived from the approved indications/intended use and/or manufacturer literature.\u200b\nWhen restating the indications/intended use, be concise while not excluding critical information. \u200b\nDo not just restate the exact wording of the indications/intended use from the filing or other source that will be displayed on the profile as these will be shown on the same tab as well.\u200b\nState the components, materials, ingredients, etc. that make up the product.\u200b\nA layperson that has never heard of this product should be able to visualize it in their head or \"put a face to a name\" with the product image.\u200b\nWhat other product(s) is this used in conjunction with and how? If the product is meant to be used along with another product, explain the purpose and the end goal.\u200b\n\nExample 1:\n\nThe Anchor Tissue Retrieval System is used to capture and remove tissue and organs from the body during laparoscopic surgeries, including appendectomy, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and oophorectomy procedures.\u200b\n\nFiling: The Anchor Tissue Retrieval System is a sterile disposable pouch used with a dedicated introducer for the encapture and removal of an organ or tissue from the body cavity during laparoscopic surgery.\u200b\nExample 2:\nThe Target 360 Detachable Coil is an embolization coil used in neurovascular and peripheral vessels to occlude or obstruct the flow of blood, including use for intracranial aneurysms. \u200b\n\nFiling: Target Coils are intended to endovascularly obstruct or occlude blood flow in vascular abnormalities of the neurovascular and peripheral vessels. Target Coils are indicated for endovascular embolization of: Intracranial aneurysms, other neurovascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulae, arterial and venous embolizations in the peripheral vasculature\u200b"

Next, state what the product is used for, derived from approved indications or manufacturer literature, and be concise while not excluding critical information. Provide a visual description of the product's components, materials, or ingredients to help laypeople understand its function. Finally, if applicable, explain what other product(s) this is used in conjunction with and how it serves the end goal. The IDEAL description writing technique emphasizes being informative, descriptive, engaging, accurate, and brief.\n\nIn the first sentence, always include the product name, what the product is, and what it is used for. The description should avoid restating the exact wording of the indications/intended use from the filing or other sources. Rather, it should provide a clear and concise description of the product's function, components, and intended use.
