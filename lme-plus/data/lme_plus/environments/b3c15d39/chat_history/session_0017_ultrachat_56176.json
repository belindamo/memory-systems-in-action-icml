But, it's important to note that the exact number of calories burned during any given exercise will depend on various factors like age, gender, weight, and overall fitness level."

Check online retailers: Online retailers such as Amazon or Walmart may have a wide variety of kettlebell options at competitive prices, with reviews by other customers. 3. Check sporting goods stores: Many sporting goods stores have kettlebells available for purchase. You can check with stores like REI, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Academy. 4. Check kettlebell manufacturers directly: Some kettlebell manufacturers sell directly to consumers through their own websites.

Look for smooth handles that are comfortable to grip and check for any rough spots or imperfections on the kettlebell. Also, keep in mind that kettlebells are an investment in your fitness, so opt for quality over price. A high-quality kettlebell can last for years and provide a more satisfying and safe workout compared to a cheap and poorly made kettlebell."
