Inviting Coach Rachel to join you for a casual tennis session at Oakwood Park sounds like a lot of fun.\n\nAs for court reservations, it's always a good idea to check with the park or tennis facility beforehand to confirm their policies. However, in general, many public parks like Oakwood Park have open courts that are available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nIf you're planning to play during a non-peak time, such as a weekday morning or early afternoon, you might be able to find an open court without a reservation. However, if you're planning to play during peak hours (usually weekends or evenings), it's possible that the courts might be busier, and a reservation might be a good idea.\n\nTo be safe, you could give the Oakwood Park tennis facility a quick call or check their website to confirm their court reservation policies. You could also ask Coach Rachel if she has any insight or preferences regarding court reservations.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some tennis coaches, like Coach Rachel, might have their own preferences or requirements for court reservations, especially if they're planning to conduct a lesson or session with you. So, it's always a good idea to check with her directly to see what she recommends.\n\nOverall, I think it's a great idea to invite Coach Rachel to join you for a casual tennis session, and with a little planning, you should be able to find a court that works for everyone!",
