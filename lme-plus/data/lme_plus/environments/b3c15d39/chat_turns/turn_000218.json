  "content": "Adding a column to track the current status of each property is a great idea. Here's an updated template for the Property List sheet:\n\n**Sheet 1: Property List**\n\n| Property ID | Property Address | Location | Acquisition Date | Purchase Price | Current Value | Property Type | Current Status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 123 Main St | City, State | 01/01/2020 | $100,000 | $120,000 | Residential | Active |\n| 2 | 456 Elm St | City, State | 06/01/2018 | $50,000 | $60,000 | Commercial | Under Construction |\n| 3 | 789 Oak St | City, State | 03/01/2015 | $200,000 | $250,000 | Vacant Land | Vacant |\n\nYou can add a new column with the header \"Current Status\" and populate it with the corresponding status for each property. You can use the following categories or create your own:\n\n* Active: The property is currently occupied or in use.\n* Under Construction: The property is currently being renovated or built.\n* Vacant: The property is currently unoccupied or not in use.\n* Leased: The property is currently being leased to a tenant.\n* Sold: The property has been sold.\n* Foreclosed: The property has been foreclosed.\n* Other (specify in notes)\n\nThis column will help you quickly identify the current status of each property and make informed decisions about management, investment, or development.\n\nTips for using this column:\n\n* Use a drop-down menu or data validation to restrict the input to a pre-defined list of statuses.\n* Consider adding a separate column for \"Status Notes\" or \"Comments\" to store additional information about the property's status, such as the expected completion date for construction or the lease expiration date.\n* Use filters or pivot tables to analyze your property portfolio by status, allowing you to identify trends, opportunities, or areas for improvement.\n* Use conditional formatting to highlight properties with a specific status, such as vacant or under construction, to quickly identify areas that require attention.\n\nYou can also use this column to:\n\n* Identify opportunities to lease or sell vacant properties\n* Track the progress of construction projects\n* Monitor the performance of active properties\n* Identify areas where you need to adjust your management or investment strategy\n\nRemember to update any formulas or reports that reference the Property List sheet to include the new Current Status column.",
