  "content": "1. Transitioning to electric or hybrid buses: This reduces emissions and noise pollution that comes with traditional diesel buses.\n\n2. Bike-sharing programs: Promoting bicycle use can lower the dependence of the people on personal vehicles, which reduces fuel consumption. To facilitate this, cities need to provide properly marked paths which follow major hubs, residential areas, and commercial centers.\n\n3. Encouraging ride-sharing: This will help to minimize the number of cars on the road. Numerous ride-sharing programs and companies were started to meet the growing electric and autonomous system needs of the public.\n\n4. Implementing congestion charges: To deter the use of personal vehicles, cities could consider implementing charges on driving inside designated busy zones, especially downtown areas.\n\n5. Expanding and modernizing metro and light rail: Mass transit lowers fuel consumption and pollution since more people are transported at once.\n\n6. Incorporating smart technology in public transport systems: This would increase the efficiency of public transport systems through improved scheduling, adopting \u2018green\u2019 fuels, optimizing routes and timings, and creating dynamic ticketing systems.\n\n7. Providing electric vehicle corridors: This would be part of the smart city infrastructure by establishing special lanes for electric vehicles, which would lower fuel consumption and emissions. \n\n8. Using energy-efficient systems: Upgrading some of the city\u2019s basic services such as lighting, air conditioning, and ventilation can help to decrease energy consumption, resulting in lower energy and fuel bills.  \n\n9. Improving walkability: Creating more pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods around mass transit stop can help in reducing the vehicular traffic on the roads. \n\n10. Creating connected intercity transportation with rail, electric, and busing options: Making mass transit accessible to people in suburban areas would decrease demand for personal vehicle use, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
