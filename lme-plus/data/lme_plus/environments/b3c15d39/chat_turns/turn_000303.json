  "content": "To organize a round-robin tournament with 29 people playing 3-on-3 basketball, you will need to create a schedule that allows each team to play every other team once.\n\nOne way to do this would be to divide the 29 players into 9 teams of 3 players each. Then, you can create a schedule that has each team playing every other team once. This will result in a total of 36 games (since each team plays 8 other teams once).\n\nTo create the schedule, you can use a spreadsheet or a piece of paper to make a table with the team names down the left side and the dates or times across the top. Then, fill in the table with the match-ups for each game.\n\nFor example, if you have the following teams:\n\nTeam 1\nTeam 2\nTeam 3\nTeam 4\nTeam 5\nTeam 6\nTeam 7\nTeam 8\nTeam 9\n\nYour schedule might look something like this:\n\n| Date/Time | Team 1 | Team 2 | Team 3 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1/1 10am |  |  |  |\n| 1/1 11am |  |  |  |\n| 1/1 12pm |  |  |  |\n| 1/2 10am |  |  |  |\n| 1/2 11am |  |  |  |\n| 1/2 12pm |  |  |  |\n\nYou would then fill in the match-ups for each time slot, making sure that each team plays every other team once.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
