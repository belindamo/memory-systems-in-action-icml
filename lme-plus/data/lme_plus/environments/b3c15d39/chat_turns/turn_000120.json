  "content": "The VIDAS Nephrocheck is a diagnostic tool designed to assist in the early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. It works in conjunction with the VIDAS 3 to test for the protein biomarkers IGFBP7 and TIMP2 in order to calculate the approximate AKI risk score in patients with acute cardiovascular and/or respiratory compromise. The system consists of NEPH Reagent Strips, NEPH Solid Phase Receptacles (SPR), and a NEPH control and calibrator. The VIDAS Nephrocheck principle combines an enzyme immunoassay competition method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The interior of the NEPH SPR is coated with mouse monoclonal IgG anti\u2011IGFBP\u20117 and anti\u2011TIMP\u20112, serving as both the solid phase and pipetting device for the assay. The system is designed to automatically perform all assay steps, providing quick and reliable results.\n\nThe VIDAS Nephrocheck is intended to identify high-risk patients within 12 hours of assessment, allowing for the implementation of early renal-protective actions to reduce AKI frequency and severity. Additionally, the system is designed to rule out patients with confidence, adapt treatment using goal-directed protocols, and help healthcare professionals make informed decisions about patient care. The Reagent Strips consist of 10 wells covered with a labeled foil seal, with six wells containing conjugate, wash buffers, and substrate, and the last well containing the fluorescence substrate. This system is intended for use in the clinical evaluation of patients, with NEPH liquid controls and calibration verification kits sold separately.",
