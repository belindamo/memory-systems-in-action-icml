Can you please tell me:\n\n1. What time do you need to arrive at work?\n2. What time do you want to wake up in the morning?\n3. How long does it take you to get ready in the morning (e.g., exercise, shower, breakfast, etc.)?\n4. How long does your bus ride take (approximately)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you calculate your commute time and ensure you're allocating enough time for your morning routine.\n\nRemember, it's essential to factor in some buffer time for unexpected delays or traffic, so we'll want to add a bit of extra time to your commute estimate.\n\nLet me know your answers to these questions, and I'll help you calculate your commute time!",
