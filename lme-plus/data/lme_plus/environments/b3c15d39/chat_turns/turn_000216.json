  "content": "Adding a column to track the payment method is a great idea. Here's an updated template for the Expenses by Property sheet:\n\n**Sheet 2: Expenses by Property**\n\n| Property ID | Expense Category | Date | Amount | Payment Method |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Property Taxes | 01/01/2022 | $2,000 | Check |\n| 1 | Insurance | 02/01/2022 | $800 | Credit Card |\n| 2 | Maintenance | 03/01/2022 | $500 | Cash |\n| 3 | Utilities | 04/01/2022 | $1,200 | Online Transfer |\n\nYou can add a new column with the header \"Payment Method\" and populate it with the corresponding payment method for each expense. You can use the following categories or create your own:\n\n* Cash\n* Credit Card\n* Check\n* Online Transfer\n* Wire Transfer\n* Bank Draft\n* Other (specify in notes)\n\nThis column will help you track how you're paying for expenses and identify areas where you might be able to optimize your payment methods.\n\nTips for using this column:\n\n* Use a drop-down menu or data validation to restrict the input to a pre-defined list of payment methods.\n* Consider adding a separate column for \"Payment Reference\" or \"Transaction ID\" to store additional information about the payment, such as the check number or credit card transaction ID.\n* Use filters or pivot tables to analyze your expenses by payment method, allowing you to identify trends, opportunities, or areas for improvement.\n\nYou can also use this column to:\n\n* Identify opportunities to earn rewards or cashback on credit card expenses\n* Optimize your payment methods to minimize fees or processing times\n* Track cash flow and identify areas where you might need to adjust your budget\n\nRemember to update any formulas or reports that reference the Expenses by Property sheet to include the new Payment Method column.",
