  "content": "Yes, Zen Buddhism has had a profound impact on Japanese poetry, and its influence can still be seen in modern Japanese poetry. However, modern Japanese poetry has also been shaped by other cultural and aesthetic influences.\n\nFor example, in the early 20th century, many Japanese poets were influenced by modernist poetry movements in Europe and the United States. This led to the development of new poetic forms, such as free verse, and a greater emphasis on individuality and self-expression.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, poets were also influenced by the political and social upheavals of the time, and their work often reflects these concerns. Some poets experimented with new forms and techniques, while others continued to work within the traditional Japanese poetic forms.\n\nToday, Japanese poetry is a vibrant and diverse field, with poets drawing from a wide variety of cultural and aesthetic influences. While Zen Buddhism continues to be a significant influence on Japanese poetry, modern Japanese poets also draw inspiration from many other sources, including popular culture, contemporary literature, and global social issues.",
