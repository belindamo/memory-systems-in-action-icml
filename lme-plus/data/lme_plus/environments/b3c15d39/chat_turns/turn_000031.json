  "content": "That sounds like a great idea! Getting a group of friends together for a run can be a wonderful way to stay motivated and make exercise more enjoyable.\n\nOakwood Park is a great location for a run, with plenty of scenic routes to choose from. Here are a few options you might consider:\n\n1. **The Oakwood Park Loop**: This is a popular route that takes you on a 2.5-mile loop around the park. The path is paved and relatively flat, making it suitable for runners of all levels. You'll get to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the park, including the lake, walking trails, and plenty of greenery.\n2. **The River Trail**: This route takes you along the river that runs through Oakwood Park and offers a more challenging 3.5-mile out-and-back route. The trail is a mix of paved and gravel paths, and you'll get to enjoy the scenic views of the river and surrounding woods.\n3. **The Neighborhood Route**: If you're looking for a slightly longer route, you could take a run through the neighborhoods surrounding Oakwood Park. This route would take you on a 4-5 mile loop through the quiet streets, with a mix of flat and gently rolling hills.\n\nAll of these routes are relatively safe, with minimal traffic and plenty of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Just be sure to follow basic running safety rules, such as running facing traffic and staying aware of your surroundings.\n\nBefore you plan your group run, you might want to consider a few logistics:\n\n* Meetup spot: Choose a convenient spot to meet up with your friends, such as the Oakwood Park parking lot or a nearby coffee shop.\n* Water and snacks: Consider bringing water and snacks to refuel after your run.\n* Pace: Make sure to discuss the pace of your run with your friends beforehand, so you can all stick together and enjoy the experience.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a great time on your Sunday runs with your friends!",
