  "content": "To write a product profile description, start with the product name and describe what it is in a couple of words. Next, state what the product is used for, derived from approved indications or manufacturer literature, and be concise while not excluding critical information. Provide a visual description of the product's components, materials, or ingredients to help laypeople understand its function. Finally, if applicable, explain what other product(s) this is used in conjunction with and how it serves the end goal. The IDEAL description writing technique emphasizes being informative, descriptive, engaging, accurate, and brief.\n\nIn the first sentence, always include the product name, what the product is, and what it is used for. The description should avoid restating the exact wording of the indications/intended use from the filing or other sources. Rather, it should provide a clear and concise description of the product's function, components, and intended use. A layperson that has never heard of this product should be able to visualize it in their head or \"put a face to a name\" with the product image.",
