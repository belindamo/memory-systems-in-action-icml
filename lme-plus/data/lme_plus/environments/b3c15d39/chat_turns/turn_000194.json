  "content": "It can be challenging to stay positive when people around you are negative. Here are a few additional tips you can try:\n\n1. Take breaks: When you feel overwhelmed or stressed by the negativity around you, take a break. Go for a walk outside or spend some time alone. This will give you the opportunity to regroup and recharge.\n\n2. Reframe your mindset: Try to reframe negative situations into something positive. Focus on what can be gained or learned from the experience, rather than dwelling on the negatives.\n\n3. Seek support outside of the family: Sometimes it's helpful to seek support from outside of the family. Talk to friends, join a support group or seek therapy.\n\n4. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Be intentional about self-care habits like getting enough sleep, eating well, and doing activities that bring you joy.\n\n5. Set healthy boundaries: It's okay to set boundaries around negative behavior. Let your family know when their negativity is impacting you and communicate the behaviors that you will no longer tolerate.\n\nRemember, you can't control other people's behavior or attitudes, but you can control your own response. By taking care of yourself and setting boundaries, you can create a positive space for yourself even in a negative environment.",
