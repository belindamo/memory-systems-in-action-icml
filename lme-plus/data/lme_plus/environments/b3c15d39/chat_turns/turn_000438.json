  "content": "The Thule Evo 2 is a popular and highly-regarded bike rack.\n\nThe Evo 2 is a versatile rack that can accommodate a wide range of bike styles and sizes, including hybrid bikes like your Trek FX 3. Here are a few things to consider to ensure the Evo 2 is a good fit for your bike:\n\n1. **Wheel size and type**: The Evo 2 can accommodate wheels up to 29 inches in diameter and 3 inches wide. If your Trek FX 3 has wheels within these dimensions, you should be good to go.\n2. **Bike weight**: The Evo 2 has a weight capacity of 40 pounds (18 kg) per bike. Hybrid bikes like the Trek FX 3 typically weigh between 25-35 pounds (11-16 kg), so you're well within the weight limit.\n3. **Frame style and design**: The Evo 2 uses a clamp-style attachment system that grips the bike's frame. Hybrid bikes often have a more upright riding position, which can make it easier to load and unload the bike. The Evo 2's adjustable clamps should accommodate your bike's frame style.\n4. **Fender and accessory compatibility**: If your Trek FX 3 has fenders, mudguards, or other accessories like a kickstand or water bottle cages, you'll want to ensure they don't interfere with the Evo 2's clamps or straps. You might need to adjust or remove these accessories to ensure a secure fit.\n\nTo confirm compatibility, I recommend checking the following:\n\n1. **Measure your bike's wheelbase**: Measure the distance between the center of the front wheel and the center of the rear wheel. The Evo 2 can accommodate wheelbases up to 47 inches (119 cm).\n2. **Check Thule's fit guide**: Thule provides a fit guide on their website, which can help you determine compatibility based on your vehicle, bike, and rack configuration.\n3. **Consult with a local bike shop or Thule dealer**: If you're still unsure, visit a local bike shop or Thule dealer and ask them to assess your bike's compatibility with the Evo 2. They can provide personalized guidance and help you with the installation process.\n\nOverall, the Thule Evo 2 is a great choice for hybrid bikes like the Trek FX 3. With its adjustable clamps and versatile design, it should provide a secure and convenient way to transport your bike.",
