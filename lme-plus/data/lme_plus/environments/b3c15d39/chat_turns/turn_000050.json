  "content": "I'm really interested in trying the Creamy Mushroom Fettuccine and the Mushroom and Leek Soup. Do you have any tips on how to get the cream sauce just right, and what type of mushrooms work best for the soup? Also, I've been cooking a lot more since I started my classes three weeks ago, and I was wondering if you have any meal planning tools or apps that you'd recommend to help me stay organized.",
