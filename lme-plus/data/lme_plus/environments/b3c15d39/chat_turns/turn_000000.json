  "content": "I'm thinking of taking my camera gear on a hike this weekend and I want to make sure I have everything I need. Can you give me a list of essential items to pack in my camera bag? By the way, I recently got a new bag from Peak Design, which I love, but I'm still getting used to the layout - it's been a challenge finding everything quickly, like when I was looking for my tripod during a photo walk on February 5th, which is also when I realized I lost my remote shutter release, so I ordered a new one online.",
