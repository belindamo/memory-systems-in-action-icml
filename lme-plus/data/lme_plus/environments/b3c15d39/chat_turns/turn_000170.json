  "content": "Yes, Duolingo does offer advanced courses for people who already have some experience with the language. The app uses a skill tree structure to guide users through lessons, and users can test out of lessons if they already have some knowledge of the language. Once a user has completed the basic course, they can continue to more advanced courses that cover topics such as idioms, advanced vocabulary, and more complex grammar. Duolingo also offers a feature called \"stories\", which can help users improve their listening and reading comprehension skills in a fun and engaging way. In addition, Duolingo offers a \"Test Center\" feature where users can take a certification exam to demonstrate their proficiency in a particular language. This can be a great way to showcase your language skills to potential employers or educational institutions. Overall, Duolingo is a great app for language learning, as it offers a structured approach to learning while also being fun and engaging.",
