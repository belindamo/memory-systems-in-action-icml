This adds a nice layer of depth and community to your message, without making it about you or detracting from the focus on Rachel and Lucas.\n\nYour revised message is perfect:\n\n\"Dear Rachel,\n\n Congratulations on the arrival of baby Lucas! I'm thrilled to welcome him to the world. This blanket is a small token of my love and best wishes for his future. May it keep him cozy and warm as he grows and explores the world around him. I've been thinking about you and your family a lot lately, especially with all the new babies in our lives - it's such an exciting time!\n\nLove, [Your Name]\"\n\nYou've struck the right balance between personal connection and focus on the recipient. Rachel will likely appreciate the thought and warmth behind your message.\n\nWell done, and I'm sure Rachel will love the blanket and the heartfelt note that comes with it!",
