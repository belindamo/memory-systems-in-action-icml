This blanket is a small token of my love and best wishes for his future. May it keep him cozy and warm as he grows and explores the world around him. I've been thinking about you and your family a lot lately, especially with all the new babies in our lives - it's such an exciting time!\n\nLove, [Your Name]\"\n\nThis way, I'm still keeping the focus on Rachel and Lucas, but I'm also mentioning the broader context of new babies in our lives, which includes Karen's twins. It's a gentle nod to our shared experience without making the message about me.",
