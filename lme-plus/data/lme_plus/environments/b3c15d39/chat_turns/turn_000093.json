  "content": "That night: everyone is asleep. Jacob wakes up to get some water and hears voices coming from his late father's old room, where Shiva and Kali are staying. They're wide awake. His curiosity gets the better of him and he tries to listen to their conversation. They've found an old tablet passed down in Jacob's family - it's a picture of two guardian spirits - and are chuckling about \"how we used to dress\". Let's write that whole scene with details and dialogue.",
