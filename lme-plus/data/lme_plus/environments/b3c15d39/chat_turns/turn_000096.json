  "content": "Jacob stood up from the table, collecting the empty bowls. \"I'm going to try another offering today,\" he said, determination in his voice. \"Maybe if we do it bigger and better, Lorelei will finally show herself and banish Eri and Racita.\"\n\nKali's eyes followed Jacob's movements, a sad look in her eyes. \"Who do you think Eri and Racita are, Jacob?\" she asked softly.\n\nJacob frowned, looking between Shiva and Kali. \"They're the ones who are hiding from Lorelei,\" he said, confused. \"Why do you look so worried?\"\n\nShiva and Kali exchanged a horrified look. \"We'll talk about it later,\" Shiva said, his voice quiet and somber.\n\nJacob nodded, not pushing further. He had work to do and he wanted to try this offering as soon as possible. He left the room, thinking about how he could make the offering even more impressive this time.",
