  "content": "A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that is divisible by only 1 and itself. For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be divided evenly by 1 and 5. The number 6, on the other hand, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6. Prime numbers play an important role in number theory and have many applications in mathematics and computer science.",
