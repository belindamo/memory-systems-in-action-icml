  "content": "What are the key findings of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study on the effects of wind turbine upsizing on community sound levels and power and energy density?\n\nThe study, published in Applied Energy, found that future wind turbines will be more powerful and efficient but also operate with higher sound emissions than those installed in the last decade. Due to their taller heights, larger rotors, and higher sound power levels, future wind turbines will require larger setbacks from homes and greater inter-turbine spacing, resulting in fewer turbines deployed for a given land area. However, despite fewer turbines, projects using future turbines result in higher installed capacities and annual energy output for a given land area. Additionally, community sound levels at homes are expected to be significantly lower in the future, despite overall louder turbines. Finally, the study finds consistent decreases in average estimated receptor sound pressure levels surrounding the projects in all periods.",
