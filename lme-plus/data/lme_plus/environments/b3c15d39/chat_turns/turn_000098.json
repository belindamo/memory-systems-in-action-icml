  "content": "The scene begins as Shiva and Jacob are carrying the items for the offering.\n\nShiva: \"Jacob, how long has your village been worshipping Lorelei?\"\n\nJacob: \"For generations. The legend has it that a meteor hit the mountain hundreds of years ago, and the villagers saw it as a sign from the gods. Lorelei performed miracles for us ever since, until a few years ago, when Eri and Racita started causing trouble.\"\n\nShiva: \"What kind of trouble?\"\n\nJacob: \"Crops failing, sickness spreading, strange occurrences... That's why we did the large offering, hoping to please Lorelei and stop Eri and Racita.\"\n\nShiva's face turns sad and angry. \"Jacob, be careful with this kind of worship. It's not always what it seems.\"\n\nJacob: \"What do you mean?\"\n\nShiva: \"Just... be careful.\"\n\nThey finish carrying the items and place them at the foot of the mountain. As they stand back to admire their work, Jacob can't help but feel a sense of unease and uncertainty, especially with Shiva's warning ringing in his ears.",
