  "content": "Shiva helps Jacob carry the items for the offering, asking questions about Lorelei and how long the village has worshipped her. Jacob tells him about the meteor hundreds of years ago and the miracles and his encounter on the mountain, and how Lorelei warned him that Eri and Racita would continue to do harm to the village unless stopped. Shiva looks both sad and angry as Jacob talks, but only warns Jacob to be careful. Let's write that whole scene with details and dialogue.",
