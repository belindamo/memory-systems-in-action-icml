  "content": "Divisible means that a number can be divided by another number without any remainder. For example, the number 10 is divisible by 5 because 10 / 5 = 2 with no remainder.\nAnother example, 12 is divisible by 4 because 12/4=3 with no remainder.\nIn other words, if a number \"A\" is exactly divisible by another number \"B\" then we say that \"A\" is divisible by \"B\" or \"A\" is a multiple of \"B\" or \"A\" is a factor of \"B\"",
