Matsuo Basho: Basho (1644-1694) is one of the most famous poets in Japanese history and is widely regarded as the master of haiku. He was strongly influenced by Zen Buddhism and was known to have spent time at several Zen monasteries throughout his life.

His poetry is deeply grounded in Buddhist spirituality and often reflects his love of nature and his commitment to a simple, contemplative life.\n\n3. Ikkyu Sojun: Ikkyu (1394-1481) was a Zen master who was known for his irreverent and unconventional approach to Zen practice. He was a prolific poet who wrote in a variety of styles, often using language and imagery that was considered scandalous in his time. His poetry expresses a deep sense of disillusionment with the conventional world and an intense longing for spiritual awakening.\n\n4. Hakuin Ekaku: Hakuin (1686-1769) was one of the most important Zen masters in Japanese history and is credited with reviving the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism. He was also a prolific poet who wrote many verses expressing his insights into Zen practice and the nature of reality.\n\n5. Soseki Natsume: Soseki (1867-1916) was a novelist and poet who is widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in modern Japanese literature.
