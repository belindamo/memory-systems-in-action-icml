  "content": "The next day: the four of them eat a meager breakfast. Kali notices Jacob collecting more food - what little is left - and asks what he's doing. Jacob sighs and says he wants to try another large offering today - the last one didn't please Lorelei and didn't draw Eri and Racita out of hiding, but this one might. Shiva and Kali exchange a horrified look and Shiva asks who he thinks Eri and Racita are. Jacob answers, confused. Shiva and Kali both look sad and worried, but don't say another word. Let's write that whole scene with details and dialogue.",
