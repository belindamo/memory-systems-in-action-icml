This can help you plan and budget for future trips.\n\n**Average Trip Cost:** ($1400-1560 + $1340-1500) / 2 = $1370-1530\n\nThis average cost range can serve as a rough estimate for your future trips. Of course, actual costs may vary depending on the destination, accommodations, and other factors.\n\nHow does this look? Is there anything else you'd like to track or add to the template?\n\nAlso, have you thought about setting a budget for your upcoming Chicago trip? With the flight costs and accommodation costs still unknown, we can try to estimate those expenses based on your past experiences.",
