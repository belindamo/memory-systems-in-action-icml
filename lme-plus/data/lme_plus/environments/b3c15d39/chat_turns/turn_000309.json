Here is an example of how the schedule for a round-robin tournament with 9 teams playing 3-on-3 basketball might look if you are playing 2 games per day for 15 minutes each on Saturdays from 8:15pm to 9pm starting on January 21, 2023:\n\n| Date | Team 1 | Team 2 | Team 3 | Team 4 | Team 5 | Team 6 | Team 7 | Team 8 | Team 9 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1/21 8:15pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1/21 8:30pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1/28 8:15pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1/28 8:30pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2/4 8:15pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2/4 8:30pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2/11 8:15pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2/11 8:30pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2/18 8:15pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2/18 8:30pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2/25 8:15pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2/25 8:30pm |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nTo fill in the match-ups, you can use a random draw or you can try to evenly distribute the stronger teams throughout the schedule. It's up to you how you want to do it.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
