While it is true that modern Japanese poetry has moved away from its traditional roots in some ways, it is not necessarily a bad thing. Poetry, like all forms of art, is constantly evolving and changing in response to cultural and social developments.\n\nWhile it is certainly true that Zen Buddhism has had a profound impact on Japanese poetry and has given rise to some of its most beautiful and insightful works, it is important to remember that poetry is not static. It reflects the changing times and concerns of the society it comes from.\n\nMoreover, some modern Japanese poets continue to be influenced by Zen Buddhism and incorporate it into their work. Others draw inspiration from other sources, such as nature, personal experiences, and social issues. These poets are creating new forms of expression that reflect the complexities of modern life.\n\nIn summary, while some may lament the loss of traditional poetic forms, it is important to remember that Japanese poetry is a living tradition that continues to evolve and adapt to the changing times.",
