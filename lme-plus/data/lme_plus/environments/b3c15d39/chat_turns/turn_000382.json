  "content": "\"Lucas, born January 15th\" is a beautiful way to make the blanket a unique and meaningful keepsake.\n\nIncluding a gift note or card with the blanket is a wonderful idea! It's a thoughtful touch that adds a personal message and makes the gift even more special. Here's why:\n\n* **Personal touch**: A handwritten note or card shows you've taken the time to think about Rachel and Lucas, and that you're not just sending a generic gift.\n* **Emotional connection**: A heartfelt message can create an emotional connection between the giver (you) and the receiver (Rachel and Lucas), making the gift even more meaningful.\n* **Keepsake**: The note or card can become a keepsake in itself, something Rachel can treasure alongside the blanket as Lucas grows up.\n\nWhat to write in the note or card? Here are some ideas:\n\n* A heartfelt congratulatory message to Rachel and her family\n* A sweet message to Lucas, welcoming him to the world\n* A personal anecdote or memory about Rachel or Lucas\n* A wish or blessing for Lucas's future\n\nKeep it short, sincere, and heartfelt. You could write something like:\n\n\"Dear Rachel and family,\n\n Congratulations on the arrival of baby Lucas! I'm thrilled to welcome him to the world. This blanket is a small token of my love and best wishes for his future. May it keep him cozy and warm as he grows and explores the world around him.\n\nLove, [Your Name]\"\n\nA gift note or card is not too much; it's a lovely way to show you care. If you're concerned about it being too much, you could opt for a simple, elegant card with a brief message.\n\nRemember to check with the Etsy seller if they offer gift wrapping or gift notes, as some may have specific options or requirements.",
