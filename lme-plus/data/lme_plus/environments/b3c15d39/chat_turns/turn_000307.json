  "content": "To create a schedule for a round-robin tournament with 9 teams playing 3-on-3 basketball, with 2 games per day for 15 minutes each on Saturdays from 8:15pm to 9pm starting on January 21, 2023, you can use a spreadsheet or a piece of paper to make a table with the dates down the left side and the team match-ups across the top.\n\nYour schedule might look something like this:\n\n| Date | Team 1 | Team 2 | Team 3 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1/21 8:15pm |  |  |  |\n| 1/21 8:30pm |  |  |  |\n| 1/28 8:15pm |  |  |  |\n| 1/28 8:30pm |  |  |  |\n| 2/4 8:15pm |  |  |  |\n| 2/4 8:30pm |  |  |  |\n| 2/11 8:15pm |  |  |  |\n| 2/11 8:30pm |  |  |  |\n| 2/18 8:15pm |  |  |  |\n| 2/18 8:30pm |  |  |  |\n| 2/25 8:15pm |  |  |  |\n| 2/25 8:30pm |  |  |  |\n\nYou would then fill in the match-ups for each date and time slot, making sure that each team plays every other team once.\n\nKeep in mind that this schedule assumes that there are 9 teams and that each team has 3 players. If you have a different number of teams or players per team, you may need to adjust the schedule accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
