  "content": "Adding a column to track the property type is a great idea. Here's an updated template for the Property List sheet:\n\n**Sheet 1: Property List**\n\n| Property ID | Property Address | Location | Acquisition Date | Purchase Price | Current Value | Property Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 123 Main St | City, State | 01/01/2020 | $100,000 | $120,000 | Residential |\n| 2 | 456 Elm St | City, State | 06/01/2018 | $50,000 | $60,000 | Commercial |\n| 3 | 789 Oak St | City, State | 03/01/2015 | $200,000 | $250,000 | Vacant Land |\n\nYou can add a new column with the header \"Property Type\" and populate it with the corresponding property type for each property. You can use the following categories or create your own:\n\n* Residential\n* Commercial\n* Vacant Land\n* Industrial\n* Agricultural\n* Mixed-Use\n* Other ( specify in notes)\n\nThis column will help you quickly identify the type of property and make informed decisions about management, investment, or development.\n\nTips for using this column:\n\n* Use a drop-down menu or data validation to restrict the input to a pre-defined list of property types.\n* Consider adding a separate column for \"Property Sub-Type\" if you need to further categorize properties (e.g., Residential -> Single-Family Home, Apartment, Condo).\n* Use filters or pivot tables to analyze your property portfolio by property type, allowing you to identify trends, opportunities, or areas for improvement.\n\nRemember to update the Property ID column to reference the correct property type in the Permits and Licenses sheet, if applicable.",
