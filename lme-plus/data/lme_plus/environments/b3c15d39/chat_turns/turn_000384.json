  "content": "A simple card with a brief message is a great way to add a personal touch to your gift.\n\nRegarding mentioning your help with Karen's twins, I'd say it's best to keep the message focused on Rachel and Lucas. While it's nice that you're helping out your neighbor, it might not be directly relevant to Rachel and Lucas, and you want the card to be about them, not about you.\n\nKeep the message concise, sweet, and centered around Rachel, Lucas, and the gift. You can always share your experiences with Karen's twins with Rachel in person or via a separate conversation.\n\nHere's an example of a brief, focused message:\n\n\"Dear Rachel,\n\n Congratulations on the arrival of baby Lucas! I'm thrilled to welcome him to the world. This blanket is a small token of my love and best wishes for his future. May it keep him cozy and warm as he grows and explores the world around him.\n\nLove, [Your Name]\"\n\nRemember, the goal is to express your joy and well-wishes for Rachel and Lucas, not to share unrelated stories. Keep it simple, sincere, and celebratory!",
