  "content": "As they sat down to eat, Jacob told the man and woman about the offering he made to Lorelei. He told them how he had gone to the mountain and met the spirit of the mountain, who asked for a large sacrifice. He explained how the village had come together to make the offering and how they had waited for a response from Lorelei but nothing had happened.\n\n\"It's a shame,\" the man said, \"that your offering didn't bring the results you hoped for.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Jacob agreed, \"I don't know what we did wrong. We followed Lorelei's instructions to the best of our ability.\"\n\n\"And your village,\" the woman said, \"What's the condition of your crops and livestock?\"\n\n\"The crops are failing,\" Jacob said, \"And our livestock is thin. We're on the brink of starvation.\"\n\nThe man and woman exchanged a look and then the man said, \"We might be able to help. We're on a mission to banish Eri and Racita, the two spirits who have been causing harm to the people and places Lorelei protects.\"\n\nJacob's eyes widened in surprise, \"You know about them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the woman said, \"And we have a plan to defeat them once and for all. But we need your help.\"\n\n\"Anything,\" Jacob said, \"I'll do anything to save my village and my fiancee.\"\n\n\"Good,\" the man said, \"We'll need you to gather as many able-bodied men as you can and meet us at the foot of the mountain tomorrow morning. Together, we'll face Eri and Racita and banish them forever.\"",
