      "content": "1. Parties call witnesses to testify in a way that helps their case.\n2. Some parties are ethically obliged to call certain witnesses.\n3. Witnesses may end up being unhelpful or even helpful to the other side.\n4. Uniform evidence legislation allows a court to free a party from restraints on examination in chief.\n5. Section 38(1) sets out three conditions for questioning a witness: unfavourable evidence, witness motivations, and prior inconsistent statements.\n6. A witness\u2019s evidence can be unfavourable even if they are genuinely trying to recall the evidence and haven\u2019t said anything different in the past.\n7. The other two conditions do not require that the witness\u2019s evidence detract from the party\u2019s case.\n8. Evidence may be unfavourable if the witness is not making a genuine attempt to recall or if they said something different in the past.\n9. The term \u201cunfavourable\u201d is not defined in section 38(1)(a).\n10. Evidence is unfavourable if it is inconsistent with the case that the party is seeking to prove.\n11. Inconsistency or contradictory nature of the evidence may arise because the witness asserts a fact or fails to give evidence of a fact in circumstances that permit the conclusion that their evidence is unfavourable.\n12. Evidence may be unfavourable even if it does not actually detract from the case of the party calling the witness.\n13. Being permitted to \u201ccross-examine\u201d a witness means asking questions that suggest an answer, avoiding the rules on leading questions.\n14. Leave can only be granted to ask about the three matters listed in section 38(1) if any of the conditions are satisfied.\n15. Leave can also be granted to ask questions about matters going only to credibility with a view to shaking the witness\u2019s credibility on the section 38(1) subjects.\n16. Usually, only the opposing party can ask questions that are solely about a witness\u2019s credibility.\n17. The judge can permit such questions in the case of a party\u2019s own witness, but section 38(3) specifies that this requires a further grant of leave.\n18. Odisho v The Queen is an example of where the prosecution was granted leave to cross-examine the victim after relying on all three wings of section 38(1).\n19. In Odisho v The Queen, the prosecution asked the victim if he was lying, suggested that he was scared of the accused because of threats he received, and put that he was angry at the police for a variety of reasons.\n20. The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal split three ways on whether these questions required leave under section 38(3).\n21. The questions cannot go beyond the scope of the leave granted by the trial judge.\n22. In Asling, the judge permitted only a very limited series of questions.\n23. In Meyer v The Queen, the Court held that a prosecutor could not question a witness about her meetings with defense lawyers.\n24. Meetings with defense lawyers were not relevant to why the witness testified in ways that were inconsistent with her earlier statement to the police.\n25. The importance of a victim\u2019s credibility means that the trial judge would have given leave under section 38(3) anyway."

      "content": "Convert the following text passage into 10 dot points, keeping in statutes and cases\n\n2.2.2 Cross-examination\n\nBelief in the ability of any party to expose the truth by questioning another party\u2019s witness is one of the foundations of the common law trial. Indeed, Wigmore claimed that cross-examination \u2018is beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth\u2019.76 This is mainly because cross-examination provides the parties with a means of probing and testing the evidence against them, and so exposing the flaws and weaknesses in the evidence to the tribunal of fact. One of the most important aims of cross-examination, then, is to damage the credibility of the witness so as to increase the likelihood that the witness\u2019s testimony will be rejected by the tribunal of fact. An equally important aim, however, is for the cross-examiner to elicit material from his or her opponent\u2019s witness that is favourable to his or her own case.\n\nThe tactical value of cross-examination can make it hard to reconcile with the rules that require judges to control what evidence comes before the court. In 1990, the High Court commented:\n\nThe limits of cross-examination are not susceptible of precise definition, for a connection between a fact elicited by cross-examination and a fact in issue may appear, if at all, only after other pieces of evidence are forthcoming. Nor is there any general test of relevance that a trial judge is able to apply in deciding, at the start of a cross-examination, whether a particular question should be allowed. Some of the most effective cross-examinations have begun by securing a witness\u2019s assent to a proposition of seeming irrelevance. Although it is important in the interests of the administration of justice that cross-examination be contained within reasonable limits, a judge should allow counsel some leeway in cross-examination in order that counsel may perform the duty, where counsel\u2019s instructions warrant it, of testing the evidence given by an opposing witness.77\n\nIn that case, the Court held that a trial judge acted prematurely in barring a defendant to a heroin possession charge from asking a police officer the cause of death of a fellow officer, who had died the morning after the accused was arrested. It later turned out that the officer had died of a heroin overdose, something that the Court observed may have been relevant to the accused\u2019s claim that the deceased officer had planted heroin in his shoe and also to the reliability of the investigation."
