By the way, my cousin's wife who taught me how to make that delicious dish is actually from India, and she mentioned that her mom used to make it with a special type of tomato puree. Do you know where I can find that or what's a good substitute?"

      "content": "That's great that you have a direct connection to Indian cuisine through your cousin's wife! The special type of tomato puree she mentioned might be a common ingredient in Indian cooking, and I'd be happy to help you identify it.\n\n**Possible Options:**\n\n1. **Deshi Tomato Puree**: This is a popular tomato puree brand in India, known for its rich, intense flavor. You might find it in Indian grocery stores or online. If you can't find Deshi, look for other Indian brands like Haldiram's or Deep.\n2. **Indian-style Tomato Puree**: Some online retailers like Amazon or specialty food stores might carry Indian-style tomato puree or \"desi tomato puree\" in their international or Indian food sections.\n3. **Canned Crushed Tomatoes**: If you can't find a specific Indian tomato puree, you can try using canned crushed tomatoes as a substitute.

Simply core and quarter 2-3 tomatoes, toss with olive oil, salt, and your choice of spices, and roast at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 20-30 minutes. Blend the roasted tomatoes to create a puree.\n2. **Homemade Tomato Puree**: You can make your own tomato puree by blending cooked, peeled, and chopped tomatoes with a little water or oil. This might not have the same intensity as a store-bought puree, but it's a good alternative.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Check the ingredient list**: When shopping for tomato puree, make sure to check the ingredient list for added spices, salt, or preservatives. You want a puree that allows you to control the flavor.\n2. **Adjust to taste**: If you're using a substitute or homemade puree, be prepared to adjust the seasoning and spices to taste. Indian cuisine is all about balance and harmony of flavors, so don't be afraid to experiment.\n\nI hope this helps you track down the special tomato puree or find a suitable substitute!
