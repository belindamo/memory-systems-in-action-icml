It consists of five questions that ask about an individual's mood, energy level, and overall sense of well-being. The questions ask about the individual's current level of happiness, their level of interest in things, their level of energy, their level of calmness, and their overall level of contentment. Each question is rated on a scale from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a higher level of well-being. The WHO-5 is a quick and easy way to assess an individual's well-being and can be used to monitor changes in well-being over time."

      "content": "Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is a measure of employee satisfaction and loyalty. It is typically calculated by asking employees a single question: \"On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work to a friend or colleague?\" The responses are then grouped into three categories:\n\n* Promoters (9-10): These employees are likely to recommend the company to others.\n* Passives (7-8): These employees are neutral about the company and are not particularly likely to recommend it to others.\n* Detractors (0-6): These employees are unlikely to recommend the company to others.\n\nThe eNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. A high eNPS score indicates a high level of employee satisfaction and loyalty, while a low eNPS score indicates a need for improvement.\n\nIn addition to the eNPS question, some companies also ask additional questions to gather more detailed feedback from employees. These questions might include:\n\n* What do you like most about working for this company?\n* What could the company improve upon to better support your work?\n* How do you feel about the opportunities for growth and development at this company?\n* How do you feel about the company's leadership and management?\n* Do you feel valued and supported by your colleagues and supervisors?\n\nThese types of questions can provide valuable insights into the experiences and perceptions of employees, and can help identify areas of strength and areas for improvement within the company."
