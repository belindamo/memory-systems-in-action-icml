It'll make the moment even more special and personalized for your sister.\n\nIf you decide to add a birthday-themed song, you could choose a classic like \"Happy Birthday to You\" or something more modern like \"Birthday\" by Katy Perry. If you prefer a personalized message, you could record a short audio clip with a heartfelt message or a funny joke to make your sister laugh.\n\nRemember to balance it with the rest of the playlist to keep the party going. You could add the special song or message during the cake-cutting ceremony or when you're presenting the birthday gift.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards adding a birthday-themed song or a personalized message to the playlist?",
