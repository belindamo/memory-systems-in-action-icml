In a large pot, combine the roasted pork bones, Kombu seaweed (if using), Katsuobushi, onion, garlic, ginger, star anise, and cloves.\n4. Pour in the water and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for at least 4 hours, or overnight.\n5. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot, discarding the solids.\n6. Add the sake, soy sauce, and salt to the broth and simmer for another 30 minutes.\n\n**Step 2: Prepare the Tare**\n\n1. In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar.\n2.

Divide the noodles among four bowls.\n2. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles.\n3. Add slices of pork, boiled egg, green onions, and other desired toppings.\n4. Drizzle the Tare over the top and serve immediately.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* For a richer broth, you can add 1-2 tablespoons of pork fat or vegetable oil to the pot during the last 30 minutes of simmering.\n* If you prefer a clearer broth, you can chill it in the refrigerator overnight and skim off the fat that solidifies at the top.\n* You can customize your Ramen with other toppings, such as grilled chicken,",
