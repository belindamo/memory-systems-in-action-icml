Use this time to stretch, grab a snack, or chat with colleagues.\n6. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries with colleagues and family members to protect your worktime and focus.\n7. **Use technology to your advantage**: Utilize tools like calendars, to-do lists, and project management software to stay organized and on track.\n8. **Learn to say no**: Be mindful of taking on too much and learn to say no to non-essential tasks that can derail your focus.\n\nRemember, time management is a skill that takes practice, so be patient and flexible.
