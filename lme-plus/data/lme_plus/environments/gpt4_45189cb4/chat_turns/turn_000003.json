Since you're looking for something compact and lightweight, I'll suggest some options that fit your criteria:\n\n1. **Anker PowerCore Fusion**: This power bank has a capacity of 40,800mAh and weighs only 1.1 pounds. It's compact, has two USB-A ports, and a USB-C port that supports Power Delivery (PD) charging up to 30W. This means you can charge your laptop quickly, and it's also compatible with most modern laptops.\n2. **Mophie Powerstation XXL**: This power bank has a capacity of 44,400mAh and weighs 1.3 pounds. It's slim and compact, with two USB-A ports and a USB-C port that supports PD charging up to 30W. Mophie is known for its high-quality products, and this power bank is no exception.\n3. **Jackery Titan S**: This power bank has a capacity of 42,500mAh and weighs 1.2 pounds. It's compact and has two USB-A ports, a USB-C port, and a DC output port. The Titan S also supports PD charging up to 30W and has a rugged design.\n\nAll of these options should give you an extra full charge for your laptop, and they're compact enough to fit in your new Targus laptop bag.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider the following:\n\n* Check the power bank's compatibility with your laptop's charging port and wattage requirements.\n* Look for a power bank with a high-quality battery cell, such as those from LG or Samsung, to ensure reliability and safety.\n* Check the warranty and customer support offered by the manufacturer.\n* Read reviews from other customers to get a sense of the power bank's real-world performance.\n\nCalibrating your laptop battery or replacing it altogether might be a good idea if you're experiencing issues with battery health. However, a power bank can be a convenient solution to extend your battery life in the short term. If you do decide to calibrate or replace your battery, a power bank can still be a useful accessory to have.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
