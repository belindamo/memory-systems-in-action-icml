  "content": "You're absolutely right about the importance of using a combination of all-purpose flour and semolina flour when making homemade pasta! The combination of these two flours provides the perfect balance of texture and flavor.\n\nAll-purpose flour, which is often made from a blend of hard and soft wheat, provides a tender and delicate texture to the pasta. It's a good all-around flour for general baking and cooking, but it can be a bit lacking in terms of flavor and texture when used alone for making pasta.\n\nSemolina flour, on the other hand, is made from durum wheat and has a coarser, yellower texture than all-purpose flour. It's high in protein and has a nutty, slightly sweet flavor that's perfect for pasta. Semolina flour is often used in traditional Italian pasta-making because it produces a more al dente texture and a deeper flavor.\n\nWhen you combine all-purpose flour and semolina flour, you get the best of both worlds: a tender, delicate texture from the all-purpose flour and a rich, nutty flavor and al dente texture from the semolina flour. This combination is essential for creating a high-quality, homemade pasta that rivals store-bought varieties.\n\nNow, back to the Tonkotsu Ramen recipe! I hope you enjoy making and devouring it. Remember to take your time and be patient when simmering the broth, as it's essential to extract all the rich, savory flavors from the pork bones. And don't hesitate to experiment with different toppings and flavor combinations to make the dish your own. Happy cooking!",
