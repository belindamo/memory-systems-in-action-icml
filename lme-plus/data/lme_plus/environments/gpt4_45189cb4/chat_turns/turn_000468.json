Top with fresh fruit or nuts before serving.\n\n2. Chia Seed Energy Balls - Mix 1/2 cup of chia seeds with 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 1/4 cup of honey or maple syrup, and 1 cup of rolled oats in a food processor until well combined. Roll into balls and store in the fridge for up to one week.\n\n3. Chia Seed Smoothies - Add 1-2 tbsp of chia seeds to your favorite smoothie recipe for added nutrition and texture. The chia seeds will absorb liquid and create a thicker, creamier smoothie.\n\n4. Chia Seed Crackers - Mix 1 cup of chia seeds with 1/4 cup of water and a pinch of salt. Spread the mixture on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 20-30 minutes at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C), until crispy. Break into pieces and serve with hummus or your favorite dip.\n\n5. Chia Seed Fruit Salad - Top your favorite fruit salad with a sprinkle of chia seeds for added nutrition and texture.
