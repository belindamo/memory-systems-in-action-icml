LA Live and the surrounding area have plenty of vibrant street art and murals that would be perfect for this challenge.\n\n**Potential Locations for Lakers-themed Murals or Graffiti:**\n\n1. **LA Live Wall:** The LA Live complex has a large, exterior wall facing Chick Hearn Court (outside the Staples Center) that features a rotating selection of street art and murals. You might find a Lakers-themed mural or graffiti on this wall.\n2. **Staples Center Exterior:** The exterior walls of the Staples Center itself might feature Lakers-themed murals or graffiti. Keep an eye out for these as you walk around the perimeter of the building.\n3. **South Park Neighborhood:** The South Park neighborhood, just south of LA Live, has a high concentration of street art and murals. You might find Lakers-themed graffiti or murals on buildings, walls, or alleyways in this area.\n4. **Olympic Boulevard:** Olympic Boulevard, which runs east-west through the LA Live complex, has a few murals and graffiti scattered along its length. You might spot a Lakers-themed piece along this route.\n\n**Tips for the Photo Challenge:**\n\n1. **Be Specific:** Provide clear instructions on what teams need to do to complete the challenge. For example, \"Take a team photo in front of a Lakers-themed mural on the LA Live Wall\" or \"Find a Lakers-themed graffiti on Olympic Boulevard and recreate a funny pose with the entire team.\"\n2. **Encourage Creativity:** Allow teams to get creative with their poses, props, and facial expressions to make the photo challenge more engaging and entertaining.\n3. **Designate a Hashtag:** Create a unique hashtag for teams to use when sharing their photos on social media. This will help you track the submissions and encourage teams to share their experiences.\n4. **Set a Time Limit:** Establish a time limit for teams to complete the photo challenge to keep the scavenger hunt moving and prevent teams from getting too caught up in taking the perfect photo.\n\nBy incorporating this photo challenge, you'll add a fun, interactive element to your scavenger hunt that will have teams exploring the LA Live complex and surrounding area while showcasing their creativity and teamwork. Good luck, and I hope you have a blast planning!",
