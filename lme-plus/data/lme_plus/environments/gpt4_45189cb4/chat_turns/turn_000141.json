The grading company examines the card's centering, corners, edges, and surface to determine its condition. The card is then assigned a grade on a scale, usually from 1 to 10, with 10 being mint condition.\n\n**Slabbing Pok\u00e9mon Cards:**\nSlabbing, also known as encapsulation, is the process of sealing the graded card in a tamper-evident plastic slab to protect it from further damage. The slab is typically made of a rigid plastic material and features a label with the card's details, including its grade.\n\n**Benefits of Grading and Slabbing:**\n\n1. **Authentication:** Grading and slabbing provide a third-party verification of the card's authenticity, which can increase its value and credibility.\n2. **Preservation:** The slab protects the card from damage, such as scratches, creases, and fading, preserving its condition for years to come.\n3. **Value:** Graded and slabbed cards can increase in value due to their authenticity and condition.\n4. **Organization:** Slabbed cards are easily stored and displayed, making it simple to organize and showcase your collection.\n\n**Popular Grading Companies:**\n\n1. **Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA):** One of the most well-known and respected grading companies in the industry.\n2. **Beckett Grading Services (BGS):** Another prominent grading company that offers a wide range of services, including slabbing.\n3. ** Sportscard Guaranty (SGC):** A leading grading company that specializes in sports cards, including Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n**Cost and Process:**\n\n1. **Cost:** The cost of grading and slabbing varies depending on the company, the type of service, and the value of the card. Expect to pay anywhere from $5 to $100 or more per card.\n2. **Process:** Submit your card to the grading company, either online or through a local dealer. The company will evaluate the card, assign a grade, and slab it. You'll receive the slabbed card, along with a certificate of authenticity.\n\n**Tips for Grading and Slabbing Pok\u00e9mon Cards:**\n\n1. **Research:** Choose a reputable grading company and understand their fees, processes, and grading scales.\n2. **Condition:** Only submit cards in good condition, as poor condition can negatively impact the grade.\n3. **Rarity:** Focus on grading rare or high-value cards, as they will benefit most from the process.\n4. **Storage:** Store your slabbed cards in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, to preserve the slab and the card.\n\nBy grading and slabbing your rare Pok\u00e9mon cards, you'll not only preserve their condition but also increase their value and authenticity.
