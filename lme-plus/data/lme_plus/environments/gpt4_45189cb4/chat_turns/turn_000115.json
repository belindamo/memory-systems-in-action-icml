Stay alert and avoid areas where snakes are known to be found, such as rocky outcrops, tall grassy areas, and bushes.\n\n2. Wear pants, high boots or sturdy footwear, and long-sleeved shirts to cover your skin as much as possible.\n\n3. Make noise as you walk or hike, which can alert the snakes and lizards that you are around, and give them plenty of time to move away.\n\n4. Do not approach or provoke snakes and lizards, or attempt to handle them, even if they seem harmless. Some snakes and lizards can still be dangerous, and it can be difficult to tell which ones are.\n\n5. Carry a flashlight or headlamp and use it to scan areas where snakes and lizards might hide, such as rocks and logs.\n\nBy following these tips, you can reduce the chances of encountering snakes and lizards while you are out enjoying nature.",
