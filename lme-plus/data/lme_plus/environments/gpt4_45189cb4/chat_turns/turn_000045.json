(e.g., buffalo, BBQ, honey mustard, etc.)\n3. Do you have a preferred delivery platform or would you like me to suggest some popular options?\n4. How many people are you ordering for?\n\nOnce I have this info, I can give you some personalized recommendations for great wing spots that deliver in your area!",
