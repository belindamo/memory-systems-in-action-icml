Indeed, Wigmore claimed that cross-examination \u2018is beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth\u2019.76 This is mainly because cross-examination provides the parties with a means of probing and testing the evidence against them, and so exposing the flaws and weaknesses in the evidence to the tribunal of fact. One of the most important aims of cross-examination, then, is to damage the credibility of the witness so as to increase the likelihood that the witness\u2019s testimony will be rejected by the tribunal of fact. An equally important aim, however, is for the cross-examiner to elicit material from his or her opponent\u2019s witness that is favourable to his or her own case.\n\nThe tactical value of cross-examination can make it hard to reconcile with the rules that require judges to control what evidence comes before the court. In 1990, the High Court commented:\n\nThe limits of cross-examination are not susceptible of precise definition, for a connection between a fact elicited by cross-examination and a fact in issue may appear, if at all, only after other pieces of evidence are forthcoming. Nor is there any general test of relevance that a trial judge is able to apply in deciding, at the start of a cross-examination, whether a particular question should be allowed. Some of the most effective cross-examinations have begun by securing a witness\u2019s assent to a proposition of seeming irrelevance. Although it is important in the interests of the administration of justice that cross-examination be contained within reasonable limits, a judge should allow counsel some leeway in cross-examination in order that counsel may perform the duty, where counsel\u2019s instructions warrant it, of testing the evidence given by an opposing witness.77\n\nIn that case, the Court held that a trial judge acted prematurely in barring a defendant to a heroin possession charge from asking a police officer the cause of death of a fellow officer, who had died the morning after the accused was arrested. It later turned out that the officer had died of a heroin overdose, something that the Court observed may have been relevant to the accused\u2019s claim that the deceased officer had planted heroin in his shoe and also to the reliability of the investigation.",
