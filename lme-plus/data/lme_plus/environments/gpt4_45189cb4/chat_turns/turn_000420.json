  "content": "That's a great strategy! Focusing on soaps and candles is a wonderful way to start, and you can always expand your product line later as your business grows. Body scrubs are a great addition to consider for the future, but it's smart to prioritize and manage your products wisely, especially with the night market coming up.\n\nSoaps and candles are perfect for a summer festival, and they're easy to display and transport. You can create a visually appealing display with your colorful soaps and candles, and customers will be drawn to the vibrant colors and enticing scents.\n\nFor the night market, you might consider creating some special edition products or bundles that are unique to the event. This could be a limited-edition scent, a special packaging, or a bundle deal that's only available during the night market. This can help create buzz and drive sales during the event.\n\nSince you're participating in the night market, you might also want to consider the ambiance and atmosphere of your booth. You could add some decorative elements that fit your brand's aesthetic, such as twinkling lights, tropical flowers, or beachy decor. This will help create an immersive experience for customers and make your booth stand out in the evening setting.\n\nHow do you plan to package and price your soaps and candles for the summer festival and night market? Are you planning to offer any special deals or discounts?",
