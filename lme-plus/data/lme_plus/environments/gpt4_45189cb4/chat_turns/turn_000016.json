  "content": "I like the idea of a sports-themed scavenger hunt, and the example clues and challenges you provided are great. I'm thinking of having the scavenger hunt take place around the Staples Center in LA, since I just went to a NBA game there with my coworkers today and it was a lot of fun. We watched the Lakers take on the Chicago Bulls and had a blast. Do you think that would be a good location for the scavenger hunt, and do you have any suggestions for clues or challenges that would be specific to that area?",
