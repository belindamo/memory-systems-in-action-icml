  "content": "There are a few potential ways to monetize an uncopyable QR code:\n\n1. Charge a fee for the use of the specialised reader: Companies could pay a fee to use the reader, which could be based on the number of scans, the volume of goods being authenticated, or some other metric.\n2. Charge a fee for the API access: Companies could pay a fee to access the API that is triggered by the scan of the QR code. This fee could be based on the number of API requests, the volume of goods being authenticated, or some other metric.\n3. Sell the QR codes themselves: Depending on the value of the goods being authenticated, it may be possible to sell the QR codes themselves as a way to monetize the system. For example, if the QR codes are being used to authenticate high-value luxury items like Birkin bags, it may be possible to sell the QR codes at a premium price.\n4. Use the QR codes as part of a subscription service: Another option could be to offer a subscription service that includes access to the specialised reader and API. Companies could pay a monthly or annual fee to use the service and scan the QR codes as needed.\n5. Sell the data collected through the API: If the API is collecting data about the goods being authenticated (e.g. location, time of scan, etc.), this data could potentially be sold to interested parties.\n6. Use the QR codes in conjunction with NFTs: If the QR codes are being used to authenticate goods that are also represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it may be possible to sell the NFTs as a way to monetize the system.",
