The Modern Art Museum focuses on modern and contemporary art, while the Natural History Museum typically features exhibits on natural history, science, and the natural world.\n\nIf you're planning to visit a Natural History Museum, I'd be happy to try and help you with information about their dinosaur exhibit. However, I would need to know which specific Natural History Museum you're planning to visit, as each museum has its own unique exhibits and collections.\n\nCould you please tell me which Natural History Museum you're interested in visiting? Is it the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, or perhaps a different one? Once I know that, I'd be happy to try and provide you with more information about their dinosaur exhibit!",
