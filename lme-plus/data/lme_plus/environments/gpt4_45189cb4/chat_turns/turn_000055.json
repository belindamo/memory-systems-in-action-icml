  "content": "The Blazin' BBQ pizza is a great choice to pair with your buffalo wings!\n\nAnd yes, you can definitely add an order of potato wedges to your combo. In fact, you can customize your combo with a variety of sides, including potato wedges, celery sticks, carrots, or French fries.\n\nWhen you're ordering online, simply add the Pizza and Wings Combo to your cart, and then click on \"Customize\" next to the combo. From there, you can choose your pizza style (Blazin' BBQ), select your wing type and sauce, and add a side to your combo.\n\nFor the side, select \"Potato Wedges\" and choose the quantity you'd like (you can get 6 or 12 pieces). You can also upgrade to a larger size or add a dipping sauce for an extra charge.\n\nOnce you've customized your combo, review your order summary to make sure everything looks good, and then proceed to checkout.\n\nBy the way, the potato wedges at Buffalo Wild Wings are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and they're perfect for dipping in your favorite sauce. Enjoy!",
