  "content": "I think your pricing strategy sounds great! The discounts for multiple items will encourage customers to buy more, and the Summer Bundle is a wonderful way to offer a value-added product that will appeal to customers who want to try a little bit of everything.\n\nThe pricing for individual soaps and candles seems competitive and reasonable, and the discounts will give customers an incentive to make a larger purchase. The Summer Bundle is a fantastic idea, as it offers a nice combination of products at a discounted price. The bath salts add a nice touch, and it's a great way to introduce customers to another product line.\n\nThe limited-edition \"Midsummer Night\" scent for the night market is a fantastic idea! The glow-in-the-dark label is a great touch, it will definitely make your product stand out in the evening setting. You could also consider offering a special deal or discount for customers who share a photo of your booth or products on social media using a specific hashtag. This will help create buzz and drive engagement around your brand.\n\nOne thing to consider is how you'll display your products at the night market. Since it's an evening event, you might want to add some extra lighting to highlight your products. You could also consider adding some decorative elements that fit your brand's aesthetic, such as twinkling lights, lanterns, or a festive tablecloth.\n\nOverall, I think you have a solid plan in place. You're offering a great selection of products, competitive pricing, and some fun and unique elements that will set you apart from other vendors. Good luck with the summer festival and night market!",
