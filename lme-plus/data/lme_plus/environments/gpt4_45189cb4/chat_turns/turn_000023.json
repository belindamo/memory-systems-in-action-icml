A challenge that requires teams to find a specific sports-themed store or restaurant in the LA Live complex and complete a task or question related to that location is an excellent way to get teams exploring the complex, interacting with local businesses, and showcasing their knowledge of the Lakers or NBA.\n\n**Benefits of this Challenge:**\n\n1. **Encourages Exploration:** This challenge encourages teams to explore the LA Live complex, which can help them discover new areas, stores, and restaurants they might not have noticed otherwise.\n2. **Tests Knowledge:** The task or question related to the location requires teams to demonstrate their knowledge of the Lakers or NBA, which can spark interesting discussions and debates among team members.\n3. **Promotes Interaction:** By requiring teams to interact with a specific store or restaurant, you're encouraging them to engage with local businesses and potentially learn more about the LA Live complex.\n4. **Fun and Engaging:** The challenge is fun, engaging, and entertaining, which can help create a lighthearted and playful atmosphere during the scavenger hunt.\n\n**Tips for Implementing this Challenge:**\n\n1. **Clear Instructions:** Make sure to provide clear instructions on what teams need to do to complete the challenge, including the location of the store or restaurant and the required task or question.\n2. **Store or Restaurant Selection:** Choose a store or restaurant that is easily accessible and relevant to the Lakers or NBA theme.
