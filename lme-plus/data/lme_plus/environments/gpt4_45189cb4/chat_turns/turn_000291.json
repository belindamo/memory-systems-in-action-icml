I also have a project deadline on Friday, so I need to allocate some time to work on that. As for tasks, I need to finish a report, prepare a presentation, and make some phone calls. I'd like to allocate at least two hours every evening to spend with my family, and I'd like to meet my friends for brunch on Saturday.",
