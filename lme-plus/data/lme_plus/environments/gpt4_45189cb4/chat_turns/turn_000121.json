  "content": "As adults, Komodo dragons have few natural predators except for humans, and most of the time, they are at the top of the food chain in their habitats. However, younger Komodo dragons, like many young animals, are more vulnerable to predators. Young Komodo dragons can be preyed on by birds of prey, snakes, and other large reptilian predators, including adult Komodo dragons. Adult Komodo dragons have been known to prey on smaller, juvenile dragons. However, overall, adult Komodo dragons have few natural predators due to their size, strength, and toxicity.",
