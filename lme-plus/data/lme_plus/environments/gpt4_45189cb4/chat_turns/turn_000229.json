It was a revolutionary movement that rejected traditional representational art forms and emphasized the process of creating art rather than the final product. The key artists associated with abstract expressionism include:\n\n1. **Jackson Pollock**: Known for his drip paintings, Pollock's work is characterized by intricate webs of lines and colors that seem to pulse with energy.\n2. **Willem de Kooning**: A Dutch-American artist, de Kooning's work often features bold, gestural brushstrokes and vibrant colors, blurring the line between abstraction and representation.\n3. **Mark Rothko**: Rothko's paintings are characterized by large, rectangular fields of color that seem to hover and vibrate on the canvas, evoking emotions and contemplation.\n4. **Barnett Newman**: Newman's work often features bold, geometric forms and vibrant colors, exploring the relationship between the individual and the universe.\n5. **Clyfford Still**: A pioneer of abstract expressionism, Still's paintings are marked by bold, gestural brushstrokes and a focus on the emotional and expressive qualities of color.\n6. **Ad Reinhardt**: Known for his \"black paintings,\" Reinhardt's work explores the nuances of color and the relationship between the artist, the viewer, and the artwork.\n7. **Franz Kline**: Kline's paintings are characterized by bold, expressive brushstrokes and a focus on the physical act of painting, often using large canvases and vibrant colors.\n8. **Robert Motherwell**: A prolific artist and writer, Motherwell's work often features bold, geometric forms and a focus on the relationship between the individual and the collective unconscious.\n9. **Helen Frankenthaler**: A pioneering female abstract expressionist, Frankenthaler's work often features bold, lyrical brushstrokes and a focus on color and gesture.\n10. **Adolph Gottlieb**: Gottlieb's paintings often feature bold, abstract forms and a focus on the emotional and expressive qualities of color.\n\nThese artists, along with others, formed the core of the abstract expressionist movement, which had a profound impact on modern and contemporary art.\n\nIt's great that you got to attend a lecture on abstract expressionism!
