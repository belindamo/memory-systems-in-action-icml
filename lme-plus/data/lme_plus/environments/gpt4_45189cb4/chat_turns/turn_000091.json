Here's why:\n\n**Practicing with a Partner:**\n\n* A partner can provide immediate feedback on your serve, including the speed, spin, and direction of the ball.\n* They can help you identify areas for improvement, such as your toss, contact point, or follow-through.\n* You can practice serving with a partner who can return your serves, allowing you to work on your second serve and volleys.\n* It's more engaging and motivating to practice with a partner, as you can challenge and encourage each other.\n\n**Practicing with a Wall:**\n\n* A wall can provide a consistent and predictable target for your serves, allowing you to focus on your technique and accuracy.\n* You can practice your serve without worrying about a partner's return, allowing you to focus on your own technique.\n* A wall can help you develop your consistency and control, as you can see the ball bounce back and adjust your serve accordingly.\n* Practicing with a wall can be a great way to warm up or cool down, as it's a low-impact activity that can help you maintain your serving motion.\n\n**Tips for Practicing with a Partner or Wall:**\n\n* When practicing with a partner, make sure to communicate with each other about your goals and what you're working on. This will help you get the most out of your practice session.\n* When practicing with a wall, start with a slower pace and gradually increase your speed and spin as you become more comfortable.\n* Use visualization techniques to imagine yourself serving in a real match, and focus on your target and technique.\n* Take breaks and video record yourself serving to analyze your technique and make adjustments as needed.\n\nIn your case, practicing with a partner or wall on your own practice days (Saturdays or Mondays) can be a great way to supplement your group lessons and accelerate your improvement. You can alternate between practicing with a partner and a wall to get a more well-rounded practice session.\n\nRemember to stay focused, patient, and persistent, and you'll see improvements in your serve over time!",
