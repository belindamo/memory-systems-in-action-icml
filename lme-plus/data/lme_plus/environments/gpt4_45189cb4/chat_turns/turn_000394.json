That's a great way to fine-tune your car's performance and find the optimal setup for the San Bernardino County Fairgrounds course.\n\nWhen it comes to adjusting tire pressures, it's generally recommended to start with small changes and work your way up. Here's why:\n\n1. **Small changes are more predictable**: Making small adjustments (1-2 psi) allows you to isolate the effects of the change and understand how it affects your car's behavior. This makes it easier to dial in the optimal pressure.\n2. **Less risk of over-correction**: If you make a large change (5-10 psi), you may over-correct and end up with a setup that's worse than where you started. Small changes reduce the risk of over-correction and allow you to make more precise adjustments.\n3. **Easier to identify trends**: By making small changes, you can identify trends in how the car responds to different tire pressures. This helps you understand the relationship between pressure and performance.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking to make more aggressive changes, you can try 3-5 psi increments. However, be prepared to make more significant adjustments to your driving style and potentially compensate for the changes with other suspension settings.\n\nHere are some general guidelines to keep in mind:\n\n* **Lower pressures (1-2 psi below recommended)**: Can improve grip and handling, but may increase tire wear and reduce stability at high speeds.\n* **Higher pressures (1-2 psi above recommended)**: Can improve stability and reduce tire wear, but may reduce grip and handling.\n\nRemember to always check the tire pressures when the tires are cold, as pressure changes significantly when the tires heat up. It's also essential to monitor your tire temperatures and adjust your pressures accordingly.\n\nBefore making any changes, take note of your current tire pressures, and make sure you have a baseline lap time to compare against. Then, start with small adjustments and work your way up, taking note of how the car responds and making adjustments accordingly.\n\nKeep in mind that tire pressure is just one variable that affects your lap times. Make sure to also focus on your driving skills, braking points, and cornering techniques to get the most out of your car.\n\nHave fun experimenting, and I hope you find the optimal tire pressure for your setup!",
