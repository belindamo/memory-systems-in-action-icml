  "content": "Yes! Once the spicy roasted nuts are fully cooled, you should store them in an airtight container to maintain their freshness and avoid moisture buildup. A cool and dark place like a pantry cupboard is the best place to store them. Here are a few more tips:\n\n1. Avoid storing the nuts in a humid or warm place, such as near the stove, oven or window.\n\n2. Be sure to label your nuts with the date that you made them, so you can keep track of their freshness.\n\n3. Do not mix different types of nuts and seeds together before storing, as they may have different moisture levels, and that can cause spoilage.\n\n4. Always use a clean, dry container when storing nuts. Check for any signs of moisture or mold before putting the nuts in the container.\n\n5. If stored properly, the spicy roasted nuts can last up to 2-3 weeks. Enjoy!",
