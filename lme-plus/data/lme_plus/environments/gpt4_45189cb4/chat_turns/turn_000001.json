Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Anker PowerCore**: Anker is a well-known brand in the power bank market, and their PowerCore series is highly rated. They offer a range of capacities, from 20,000mAh to 50,000mAh, and some models have multiple USB ports and high-speed charging capabilities.\n2. **Mophie Powerstation**: Mophie is another popular brand that offers a range of power banks with sleek designs and high-capacity batteries. Their Powerstation series is known for its compact size and fast charging capabilities.\n3. **EcoFlow River**: EcoFlow is a newer brand that's gained popularity for its high-capacity power banks with advanced features like fast charging, USB-C, and even solar panel charging.

It has a high capacity, multiple USB ports, and a durable design.\n\nWhen choosing a power bank, consider the following factors:\n\n* Capacity: How much power do you need to extend your laptop's battery life? A higher capacity means more charges, but also a larger and heavier power bank.\n* Ports: Do you need multiple USB ports to charge multiple devices at once? Do you need a USB-C port for faster charging?\n* Size and weight: How portable do you need the power bank to be?\n* Brand reputation: Look for brands with good customer reviews and a reputation for producing high-quality products.\n\nAs for your new Targus laptop bag, that's great to hear! Having a well-organized bag with extra padding and multiple compartments can really make a difference in protecting your laptop and accessories.\n\nBefore making a final decision on a power bank, I'd love to know a bit more about your specific needs. What's your laptop's battery life like currently, and how often do you need to charge it on the go? Do you have any specific features or requirements in mind for your power bank?",
