  "content": "The song \"Alone\" by Marshmello is widely interpreted as an anthem for individuality and the pain of feeling isolated or disconnected from others.\n\nThe opening lines reveal that the singer feels like they are on their own and struggling to break free, perhaps from a toxic relationship or a suffocating situation. The chorus repeats the words \"I'm so alone\" several times, emphasizing the feeling of isolation and the need for connection or support.\n\nThe song also hints at the idea of wearing a mask or hiding one's true self. Marshmello himself is known for wearing a mask in public, which has inspired some fans to interpret the song as a commentary on the pressure to conform or hide one's identity in order to fit in.\n\nOverall, \"Alone\" is a song about the challenges of being true to oneself and finding a sense of belonging in a world that can feel overwhelming and isolating.",
