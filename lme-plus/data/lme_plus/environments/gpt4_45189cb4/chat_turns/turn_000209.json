Here are some tips to help you structure your playlist:\n\n1. **Create a flow:** Divide the playlist into sections or \"acts\" to create a flow. You can have:\n\t* An \"intro\" section with slower, upbeat tracks to get the party started.\n\t* A \"peak\" section with the most energetic and popular tracks to keep the party going.\n\t* A \"cooldown\" section with slower tracks to wrap up the party.\n2. **Group similar tracks together:** Place songs with similar tempos, genres, or moods together. This will help maintain a consistent energy level and keep the partygoers engaged.\n3. **Alternate fast and slow tracks:** Vary the pace by alternating between fast and slow tracks. This will give guests a chance to catch their breath and then get back to dancing.\n4. **Consider the party's progression:** Think about the party's progression and plan the playlist accordingly. For example, you might want to save the most popular tracks for the peak hour (usually around 2-3 hours into the party).\n5. **Keep it balanced:** Make sure the playlist has a good balance of old and new tracks, fast and slow tracks, and different genres to cater to various tastes.\n6. **Keep it concise:** Aim for a playlist that's around 2-3 hours long. This will give you enough time to play a good mix of tracks without overwhelming the guests.\n7. **Add a personal touch:** Consider adding a special song or two that hold meaning for your sister, such as a favorite childhood song or a song that's significant to your relationship.\n\nHere's a rough outline to get you started:\n\n**Intro (15-20 minutes)**\n\n* 3-4 slower, upbeat tracks to get the party started (e.g., Taylor Swift's \"Shake It Off\" or Katy Perry's \"Roar\")\n\n**Peak (40-50 minutes)**\n\n* 8-10 energetic tracks to keep the party going (e.g., Ariana Grande's \"Thank U, Next\" or Justin Bieber's \"Sorry\")\n\n**Middle (20-30 minutes)**\n\n* 4-6 tracks with a slightly slower pace to give guests a break (e.g., Selena Gomez's \"Good for You\" or Shawn Mendes' \"Stitches\")\n\n**Peak (40-50 minutes)**\n\n* 8-10 more energetic tracks to keep the party going (e.g., The Chainsmokers' \"Closer\" or Dua Lipa's \"Don't Start Now\")\n\n**Cooldown (15-20 minutes)**\n\n* 3-4 slower tracks to wrap up the party (e.g., Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" or Katy Perry's \"Firework\")\n\nRemember, this is just a rough outline, and you can adjust it to fit your sister's tastes and the party's progression. You can also add or remove tracks as needed to keep the party going.\n\nHow does this sound? Do you have any specific tracks in mind that you'd like to add to the playlist?",
