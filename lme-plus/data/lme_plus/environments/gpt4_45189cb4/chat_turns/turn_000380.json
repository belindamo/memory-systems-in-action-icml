However, here are some tips to help you make more informed decisions:\n\n1. Look for eco-labels: Look for recognized eco-labels, such as Energy Star or the Forest Stewardship Council, on product packaging or websites because such labels certify an environmentally friendly feature of a product or company.\n\n2. Investigate claims: Investigate manufacturers' claims and practices related to sustainability. You can visit the company's website, read their sustainability report, check out third-party reviews, or contact them directly to ask for more information.\n\n3. Research certification programs: Research certification programs, such as B Corp, which evaluates the environmental and social practices of companies to identify those that are environmentally responsible and sustainable.\n\n4. Use sustainable product directories and apps: Use sustainable product directories such as The Good Trade or Sustainable Jungle, which list eco-friendly brands and products.\n\n5. Check product materials: When buying products, check for materials such as recycled plastic strands or biodegradable components, which help to determine the impact of the product to the environment.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can make more informed decisions when buying products, and ultimately support eco-friendly companies that prioritize sustainability.",
