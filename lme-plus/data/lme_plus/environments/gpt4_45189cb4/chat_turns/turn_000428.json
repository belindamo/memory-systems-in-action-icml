There may be multiple Robotics Summits in Chicago, and I don't have access to real-time information about specific events.\n\nCould you please provide more context or details about the Robotics Summit you're referring to? Here are some questions to help me narrow down the search:\n\n1. Is it a specific conference or trade show?\n2. Is it organized by a particular company or organization?\n3. Do you know the approximate dates or month when the event is supposed to take place?\n4. Have you received any notifications or invitations about the event?\n\nOnce I have more information, I can try to help you find the dates for the Robotics Summit in Chicago.",
