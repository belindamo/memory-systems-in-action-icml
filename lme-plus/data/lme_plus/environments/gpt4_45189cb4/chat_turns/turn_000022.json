  "content": "I think I've got another idea for a challenge. How about a challenge that requires teams to find a specific sports-themed store or restaurant in the LA Live complex and complete a task or question related to that location? For example, \"Find the NBA Store on the upper level of LA Live and take a photo of your team holding up a Lakers jersey with a specific player's name on it.\" This would require teams to navigate the complex, find the store, and complete a task that shows their knowledge of the Lakers or NBA. What do you think?",
