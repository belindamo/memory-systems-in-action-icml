  "content": "Exactly!\n\nThat's a great plan! Checking the website first is a good idea, as many credit card companies have made it easy to update personal information online. If that's not an option, calling customer service will get you the information you need to update your name.\n\nRemember to have your court order and new identification ready, as well as your credit card account information, so you can provide the necessary details to the customer service representative.\n\nIf you have multiple credit cards, you may want to consider updating them all at once to avoid having to go through the process multiple times.\n\nGood luck, and I hope it's a smooth process for you! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
