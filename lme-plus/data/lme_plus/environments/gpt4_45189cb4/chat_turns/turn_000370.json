They're indeed essential ingredients in Japanese cuisine, and using them correctly can make a big difference in the flavor and texture of your Tonkotsu Ramen.\n\nRegarding the Korean BBQ place, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or physical presence, so I haven't heard about the new Korean BBQ place downtown. However, I'm happy to chat with you about Korean cuisine!\n\nKimchi stew, also known as Kimchi Jjigae, is a popular Korean dish that's both spicy and flavorful. It's great that you're interested in trying out different variations of it. Korean BBQ places often have their own secret recipes and techniques, so it's always exciting to explore and compare different versions.\n\nIf you do end up trying out the new Korean BBQ place, I'd love to hear about your experience! What's your favorite type of Korean dish, and what do you think makes a great kimchi stew?",
