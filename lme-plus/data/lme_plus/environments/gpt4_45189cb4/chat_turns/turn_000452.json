  "content": "The WHO-5 Well-Being Index is a tool used to assess an individual's current level of well-being. It consists of five questions that ask about an individual's mood, energy level, and overall sense of well-being. The questions ask about the individual's current level of happiness, their level of interest in things, their level of energy, their level of calmness, and their overall level of contentment. Each question is rated on a scale from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a higher level of well-being. The WHO-5 is a quick and easy way to assess an individual's well-being and can be used to monitor changes in well-being over time.",
