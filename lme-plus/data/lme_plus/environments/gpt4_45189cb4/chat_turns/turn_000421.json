  "content": "I was thinking of pricing my soaps at $8 each and candles at $15 each. I want to offer a discount for customers who buy multiple items, like 10% off for two items and 15% off for three or more items. I'll also have a special \"Summer Bundle\" that includes a soap, candle, and a small bag of bath salts for $30. For the night market, I might offer a limited-edition \"Midsummer Night\" scent and a special packaging with a glow-in-the-dark label. What do you think?",
