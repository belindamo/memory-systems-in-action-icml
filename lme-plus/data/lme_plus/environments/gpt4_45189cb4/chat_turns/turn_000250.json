  "content": "1. Parties call witnesses to testify in a way that helps their case.\n2. Some parties are ethically obliged to call certain witnesses.\n3. Witnesses may end up being unhelpful or even helpful to the other side.\n4. Uniform evidence legislation allows a court to free a party from restraints on examination in chief.\n5. Section 38(1) sets out three conditions for questioning a witness: unfavourable evidence, witness motivations, and prior inconsistent statements.\n6. A witness\u2019s evidence can be unfavourable even if they are genuinely trying to recall the evidence and haven\u2019t said anything different in the past.\n7. The other two conditions do not require that the witness\u2019s evidence detract from the party\u2019s case.\n8. Evidence may be unfavourable if the witness is not making a genuine attempt to recall or if they said something different in the past.\n9. The term \u201cunfavourable\u201d is not defined in section 38(1)(a).\n10. Evidence is unfavourable if it is inconsistent with the case that the party is seeking to prove.\n11. Inconsistency or contradictory nature of the evidence may arise because the witness asserts a fact or fails to give evidence of a fact in circumstances that permit the conclusion that their evidence is unfavourable.\n12. Evidence may be unfavourable even if it does not actually detract from the case of the party calling the witness.\n13. Being permitted to \u201ccross-examine\u201d a witness means asking questions that suggest an answer, avoiding the rules on leading questions.\n14. Leave can only be granted to ask about the three matters listed in section 38(1) if any of the conditions are satisfied.\n15. Leave can also be granted to ask questions about matters going only to credibility with a view to shaking the witness\u2019s credibility on the section 38(1) subjects.\n16. Usually, only the opposing party can ask questions that are solely about a witness\u2019s credibility.\n17. The judge can permit such questions in the case of a party\u2019s own witness, but section 38(3) specifies that this requires a further grant of leave.\n18. Odisho v The Queen is an example of where the prosecution was granted leave to cross-examine the victim after relying on all three wings of section 38(1).\n19. In Odisho v The Queen, the prosecution asked the victim if he was lying, suggested that he was scared of the accused because of threats he received, and put that he was angry at the police for a variety of reasons.\n20. The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal split three ways on whether these questions required leave under section 38(3).\n21. The questions cannot go beyond the scope of the leave granted by the trial judge.\n22. In Asling, the judge permitted only a very limited series of questions.\n23. In Meyer v The Queen, the Court held that a prosecutor could not question a witness about her meetings with defense lawyers.\n24. Meetings with defense lawyers were not relevant to why the witness testified in ways that were inconsistent with her earlier statement to the police.\n25. The importance of a victim\u2019s credibility means that the trial judge would have given leave under section 38(3) anyway.",
