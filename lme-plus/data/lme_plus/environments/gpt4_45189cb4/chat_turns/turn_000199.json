They might:\n\n1. **Have a distinct flavor profile**: Custom blends can have a unique flavor profile that's tailored to the family's taste preferences.\n2. **Use specific spice ratios**: The proportions of each spice in a custom blend might be adjusted to suit the family's taste buds.\n3. **Include unique ingredients**: Custom blends might incorporate ingredients that are not typically found in commercial blends, such as specific types of chilies, herbs, or spices.\n4. **Be made with love and care**: Custom blends are often made with love and care, which can imbue the spices with a special energy and flavor.\n\n**What to Ask Your Cousin's Wife:**\n\nWhen you ask your cousin's wife about the spice blend, try to get as much information as possible. Here are some questions you could ask:\n\n1. **What does the blend look like?** Is it a powder, a mixture of whole spices, or a paste?\n2. **What's the flavor profile?** Is it spicy, sweet, tangy, or umami?\n3. **Are there any distinctive ingredients?** Does the blend contain any unusual spices, herbs, or other ingredients?\n4. **How is it used?** Is the blend used for a specific type of dish, or is it a general-purpose blend?\n5. **Does she remember any specific recipes?** Does she recall any recipes that her mom used to make with the blend?\n\nBy asking these questions, you might be able to get a better sense of what the custom blend is like and how it's used. Who knows, you might even be able to recreate it yourself!",
