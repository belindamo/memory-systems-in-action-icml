  "content": "Yes, there are several other techniques that modern-day shepherds use in remote or rugged environments. Some of these techniques include:\n\n1. Electric fencing: Electric fencing is a modern technique that is used by shepherds to protect the flock from predators. This is a more reliable and efficient method than traditional fencing, and it can be easily installed and maintained.\n\n2. GPS tracking: GPS tracking is a modern technology that is increasingly being used by shepherds to monitor the location and movement of their flocks. This technology helps herders keep track of the flock and quickly locate them if they stray too far.\n\n3. Mobile shearing: Modern-day shepherds use mobile shearing as a technique to harvest wool from the flock. This saves time and money because there is no need to transport the flock to a central location.\n\n4. Veterinary care: Modern-day shepherds use modern veterinary care to keep their flocks healthy. This includes vaccinations, regular check-ups, and treatment of sick or injured animals.\n\n5. Drones: Drones are increasingly being used by shepherds to monitor the flock and the surrounding environment. Drones can provide valuable data on the flock's location, health, and well-being. \n\nThese techniques, along with traditional techniques, contribute to the sustainable management of the flock and the promotion of animal welfare.",
