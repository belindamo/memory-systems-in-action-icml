I just...I can't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Mark pressed. \"It's your dad, Tommy. He has a right to know.\"\n\nTommy shook his head, his eyes brimming with tears. \"I know, but it's not that simple. What if we mess up the timeline or something? What if telling him changes everything and we don't exist in the future anymore? And what if he doesn't believe us?\"\n\nMark frowned. \"But what about you? Don't you want to know what your dad was like when he was our age?\"\n\nTommy hesitated, thinking back to all the stories his dad had told him about growing up. He had always been curious, but he had never expected to actually meet him in the past. \"Of course I do,\" he said softly. \"But I don't know if I'm ready for this. It's too much to handle.\"\n\nMark reached out and placed a hand on Tommy's shoulder. \"We'll figure it out together,\" he said reassuringly. \"We'll make sure everything goes smoothly.\"\n\nTommy nodded, feeling a little more hopeful. \"Okay,\" he said. \"We'll do it tomorrow. But we have to be careful. We can't mess this up.\"\n\nThe two boys stayed up for most of the night, talking quietly about their plan and their concerns. Tommy couldn't shake the feeling of apprehension that clung to him, but he also felt a sense of excitement and wonder. He was about to meet his dad as a teenager, and he couldn't wait to see what he was like.\n\nThe next morning, they woke up early and walked to the diner where Davey worked. Tommy's heart was pounding as they entered the diner, scanning the room for any sign of his dad.\n\nThere he was, behind the counter, looking tired but determined as he took orders and served coffee. Tommy watched him with a sense of awe, feeling like he was seeing him for the first time.\n\nThey sat down at a booth and ordered breakfast, trying to act casual as they waited for Davey to come over. When he finally did, Tommy felt his heart skip a beat.\n\n\"Hey, boys,\" Davey said with a smile. \"What can I get for you?\"\n\nTommy took a deep breath, feeling his nerves getting the best of him. \"Um, could we talk to you for a minute?\" he asked hesitantly.\n\nDavey looked at him curiously. \"Sure, what's up?\"\n\nTommy hesitated, unsure of how to begin. \"I...um, I just wanted to say that...you're a really great guy, Davey. And I...I just wanted to thank you for talking to us yesterday.\"\n\nDavey smiled. \"No problem, kiddo. It's always good to help out a couple of kids in need.\"\n\nTommy felt his throat tighten. He had to tell him. He had to know. \"Davey,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Do you ever feel like...like you don't fit in? Like people don't understand you?\"\n\nDavey looked at him quizzically. \"Sure, I guess. But that's just part of growing up, you know? You learn to find your place in the world.\"\n\nTommy took a deep breath. \"I know,\" he said. \"But sometimes it's really hard. And sometimes it feels like...like you're all alone.\"\n\nDavey's expression softened. \"I understand,\" he said. \"Believe me, I do. But you",
