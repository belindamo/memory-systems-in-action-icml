  "content": "A full electric circuit includes a power source (such as a battery or generator), a conductor (such as a wire), and a device that uses electricity (such as a light bulb or motor). The power source provides a flow of electrical energy, which flows through the conductor and into the device. The device then converts the electrical energy into a useful form, such as light or motion. In a complete circuit, the electrical energy flows from the power source, through the device, and back to the power source, creating a continuous loop. The key components of a full electric circuit are a power source, conductors, and a load.",
