  "content": "I have a mix of furniture, decorative arts, and jewelry. The age range is pretty broad, from the 1800s to the 1970s. I've got wood, metal, porcelain, and fabric items. I do know some of the makers or manufacturers, but not all. Last weekend, I inherited my aunt's grandmother's old oak dresser from the 1920s, which I'm planning to refinish.",
