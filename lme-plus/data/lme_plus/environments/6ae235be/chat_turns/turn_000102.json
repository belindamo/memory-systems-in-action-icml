  "content": "The brooch is a silver filigree piece with a large citrine stone in the center. It's about 3 inches in diameter and has a pinback closure. I don't see any markings or signatures on the back, but the filigree work is very intricate and ornate. I wore it to my cousin's wedding last Saturday, and I received many compliments.",
