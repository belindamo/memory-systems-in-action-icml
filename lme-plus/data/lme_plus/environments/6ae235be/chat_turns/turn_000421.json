Here's a recommended cleaning solution and method to help you keep your Funko Pops in great condition:\n\n**Recommended cleaning solution:**\n\n1. **Mild soap and water**: Mix a small amount of mild soap, such as dish soap or hand soap, with warm water. A 1:10 ratio of soap to water is a good starting point. You can adjust the ratio based on how dirty your Funko Pops are.\n2. **White vinegar and water**: Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. This solution is gentle and effective at removing dirt and grime without leaving residue.\n3. **Funko's recommended cleaning solution**: Funko suggests using a solution of 50% water and 50% white vinegar, applied with a soft-bristled toothbrush.\n\n**Cleaning method:**\n\n1. **Dust removal**: Gently brush off any loose dust or debris from the Funko Pop using a soft-bristled brush or a dry, soft cloth.\n2. **Dampen a cloth**: Dip a soft, lint-free cloth into the cleaning solution, and wring it out so that it's damp, not soaking wet.\n3. **Gently wipe the Funko Pop**: Wipe the Funko Pop with the damp cloth, starting from the top and working your way down. Avoid applying too much pressure, which can damage the paint or vinyl.\n4. **Clean crevices**: Use a soft-bristled toothbrush or a small, soft-bristled paintbrush to gently clean crevices, corners, and small details.\n5. **Dry the Funko Pop**: Use a dry, soft cloth to wipe away any excess moisture and prevent water spots.\n6. **Inspect and repeat**: Inspect your Funko Pop to ensure it's clean. If some areas still need attention, repeat the cleaning process as needed.\n\n**Important tips:**\n\n* Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, or hot water, as they can damage the paint, vinyl, or other materials.\n* Never submerge your Funko Pop in water or expose it to excessive moisture.\n* Don't use compressed air or blow dryers to dry your Funko Pops, as they can create static electricity that attracts dust.\n* For particularly stubborn stains or grime buildup, you can let the cleaning solution sit on the affected area for a few minutes before wiping it clean.\n\nBy following these steps and using the recommended cleaning solutions, you should be able to keep your Funko Pops clean and in great condition. Happy cleaning!",
