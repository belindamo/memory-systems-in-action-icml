I will ask you to write each passage/questions combination in two prompts. First I will ask you to write the passage, then I will ask you to write the questions that go with that particular prompt. I will be requesting multiple passage/question combinations. Each question should have A, B, C, D answer options or fill in the blank options. There should be more A,B,C,D options than fill in the blank. Make sure to use all types of questions and standards that I uploaded. Each passage should have a variety of type of questions, and each passage should have 5-10 questions that goes with each passage. \nDo you have any questions?",
