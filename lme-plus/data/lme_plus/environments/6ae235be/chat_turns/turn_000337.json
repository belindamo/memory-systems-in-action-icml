That's about a 7-10 minute walk, depending on your pace. The hotel is also connected to the convention center via a pedestrian walkway, making it a very convenient location for attendees of the West Coast Rack Fest.\n\nAdditionally, the hotel offers a shuttle service within a 3-mile radius, which includes the convention center, so you can also take advantage of that if you prefer not to walk.\n\nSo, it seems like the Hyatt Regency Long Beach is a great choice for your stay during the West Coast Rack Fest!",
