  "content": "The music played during musical therapy sessions at the Dead Sea usually consists of healing frequencies that are believed to have therapeutic effects on the body and mind. These frequencies are based on the concept of sound healing, which suggests that different sound frequencies can be used to promote healing and balance in the body.\n\nSome examples of the types of music played during musical therapy sessions include:\n\n1. Binaural beats: These are a type of sound wave that is created by two different frequencies played at the same time. Binaural beats have been shown to have a calming effect on the brain, which can be helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\n\n2. Solfeggio frequencies: These are a set of ancient musical frequencies that are believed to have healing properties. Each frequency is associated with a different type of healing or transformation.\n\n3.

These sounds can help create a calming and relaxing environment for the patient.\n\nThe exact type of music played during musical therapy sessions may vary depending on the spa or resort offering the therapy.",
