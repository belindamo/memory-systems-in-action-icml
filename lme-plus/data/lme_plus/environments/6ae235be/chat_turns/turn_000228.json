Configure any additional media streaming settings, such as transcoding or quality settings, according to your preferences.\n\n**Step 6: Connect your devices to your NAS device**\n\n1. On your devices (e.g., smart TV, streaming device, or computer), search for available network shares or media servers.\n2. Select your NAS device's share or media server from the list of available devices.\n3. Enter the username and password for your NAS device's share or media server, if prompted.\n\n**Step 7: Enjoy media streaming!**\n\n1. You should now be able to access your media files on your NAS device from your devices.\n2. Use your devices to stream media content from your NAS device to your TV, computer, or mobile devices.\n\nThat's it! You've successfully set up your NAS device for media streaming.
