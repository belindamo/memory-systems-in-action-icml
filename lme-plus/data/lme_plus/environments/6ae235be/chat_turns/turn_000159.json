  "content": "It sounds like you're in a tough spot. Have you explained to your partner how important it is for you to respect your boundaries and how it's affecting the relationship? If you haven't, then it's worth communicating this to your partner in a calm and non-confrontational way. \n\nIf you've already tried communicating with your partner and they're still not respecting your boundaries, it may be helpful to seek out the help of a relationship therapist. A professional can help facilitate communication, provide tools and strategies for setting and enforcing boundaries, and help you work through any other issues that may be affecting the relationship.\n\nIt's important to remember that you're not responsible for your partner's behavior. If your partner continues to disrespect your boundaries despite your efforts to communicate and seek help, then you may need to reevaluate the relationship and consider if it's a healthy and loving relationship for you to be in. You deserve to be in a relationship that respects your boundaries and values your needs.",
