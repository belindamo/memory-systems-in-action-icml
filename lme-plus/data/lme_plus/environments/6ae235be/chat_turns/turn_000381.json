Start on all fours, lift your right arm and left leg off the ground, and hold for a few seconds. Repeat on the other side.\n4. **Leg Raises**: Targets lower abs. Lie on your back with arms extended overhead, raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling, and lower them back down without touching the floor.\n5. **Woodchoppers**: Works obliques and improves rotational strength. Hold a weight or medicine ball, twist your torso from side to side, keeping your arms straight.\n\n**Flexibility and Mobility Exercises:**\n\n1. **Leg Swings**: Improves hip flexibility and mobility. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, swing one leg forward and backward, then switch to the other leg.\n2. **Hip Circles**: Targets hip flexors and glutes.

Stand with one hand against a wall, bend one knee, and lean forward, stretching the front of your leg.\n5. **Lunges**: Improves flexibility and strength in hips, knees, and ankles. Perform walking lunges, stationary lunges, or side lunges to target different muscle groups.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Incorporate exercises that challenge your balance**: Single-leg squats, single-arm rows, or BOSU ball exercises can help improve your overall stability.\n2. **Focus on functional movements**: Exercises that mimic daily activities, like squats, lunges, and step-ups, can help improve your flexibility and mobility.\n3. **Make sure to stretch after exercise**: Take 5-10 minutes to stretch your major muscle groups, including your core, legs, and hips.\n4. **Listen to your body**: If you're new to these exercises, start slow and gradually increase the intensity and difficulty as you build strength and flexibility.\n\nRemember to always warm up before exercising, and cool down afterwards to prevent injuries. It's also essential to focus on proper form and technique to get the most out of these exercises and avoid injuries.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your journey to improve your core strength, stability, and flexibility!",
