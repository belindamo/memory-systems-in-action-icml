  "content": "It's understandable that you're feeling tired and frustrated about having to constantly communicate your boundaries to your partner. It can be challenging and exhausting to continuously reiterate your needs, especially if your partner continues to ignore them. \n\nIn situations like these, it's important to remember that you have agency over your own boundaries and what you're willing to tolerate in a relationship. If you feel that therapy is not the right choice for you at the moment, then it's important to take the time to check in with yourself and assess how you feel about continuing the relationship. \n\nUltimately, the decision to stay in a relationship or not is up to you. Remember that you deserve to be in a relationship where your boundaries are respected and your needs are valued. If your partner is not willing or able to meet your needs, it may be time to reassess the relationship and consider ending things.",
