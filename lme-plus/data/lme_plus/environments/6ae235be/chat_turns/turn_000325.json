He had always known his dad as a grown-up, but to see him as a kid, struggling with the same issues that Tommy faced in the present, was eye-opening.\n\nMark sat across from him, staring wide-eyed at his friend.\n\n\"This is crazy, man. I can't believe Davey is your dad,\" Mark said, shaking his head in disbelief.\n\n\"I know, it's surreal,\" Tommy said, rubbing his temples. \"But it makes sense, you know? I always felt like there was something missing between me and my dad, like we didn't quite connect. But seeing him as a kid, going through the same struggles, it's like I understand him better now.\"\n\nMark nodded, still processing the information. \"So what do we do now?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tommy said, sighing heavily. \"I can't just go up to him and tell him, 'Hey, I'm your son from the future.' That's crazy.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but we have to do something,\" Mark said, sitting up straighter in his chair. \"We can't just leave him here, knowing what we know.\"\n\nTommy thought for a moment, then had an idea. \"What if we try to help him with the bullying? You heard what he said, he's been dealing with it for a while. Maybe we can do something to make it better for him.\"\n\nMark nodded, excited at the prospect of doing something proactive. \"Yeah, that's a good idea. What do you have in mind?\"\n\nTommy leaned forward, his eyes alight with enthusiasm. \"What if we stand up for him? Show him that he's not alone, that there are people who care about him and will have his back.\"\n\nMark nodded, catching Tommy's excitement. \"Yeah, let's do it. But how do we do that without giving away that we're from the future?\"\n\nTommy thought for a moment, then grinned. \"We'll just have to be creative.\"\n\nThe next day, the boys headed to school with a newfound sense of purpose. They kept a close eye on Davey, watching for any signs of trouble.\n\nSure enough, as they were walking to class, they saw a group of boys blocking Davey's path. Tommy's heart clenched in his chest as he recognized the same boys who had beaten him up the day before.\n\nWithout hesitation, Tommy and Mark stepped in front of Davey, facing down the bullies.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" Tommy demanded, his voice full of authority.\n\nThe bullies sneered at him, but Tommy stood his ground. Mark stood behind him, a look of determination on his face.\n\n\"We don't want any trouble,\" Tommy said, holding up his hands in a gesture of peace. \"We just want to get to class.\"\n\nThe bullies glared at them for a moment longer, then stepped aside, allowing the boys to pass.\n\nTommy and Mark walked with Davey to class, their heads held high. Davey looked at them in amazement, clearly grateful for their help.\n\n\"Thanks, guys,\" he said, smiling shyly.\n\nTommy grinned at him. \"Anytime, Davey. We've got your back.\"\n\nAs the day went on, Tommy and Mark kept a watchful eye on Davey, making sure he was okay. They even managed to make a few new friends, kids who had seen them stand up to the bullies and admired their bravery.\n\nBut as the final bell rang and they headed home, Tommy's mind was still whirling with the revelation of who Davey really was. He couldn't wait to tell Mark, to share this incredible secret with his best friend.\n\nThe two",
