  "content": "The most challenging part of packing for me has been trying to fit everything I think I might need into my suitcase. I tend to overpack and then end up not using half of what I bring. But I've been working on improving my packing skills by planning out my outfits in advance and making a list of essentials to avoid overpacking.\n\nAs for my next trip, I'm actually planning to visit some friends in California in a few weeks. I'm thinking of taking a carry-on bag only to make packing and traveling easier. Do you have any tips on how to pack light for a 5-day trip?",
