  "content": "Here's a command you can use to install Ubuntu using QEMU, a CD-ROM, and VNC while forwarding ports 22 and 844:\n```\nqemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom /path/to/ubuntu.iso -boot d -m 2048 -vnc :1 -redir tcp:2222::22 -redir tcp:844::844\n```\nThis command assumes that the ISO file for Ubuntu is located at \"/path/to/ubuntu.iso\" on your system. The \"-cdrom\" flag tells QEMU to use this ISO as the CD-ROM for the virtual machine. The \"-boot d\" flag tells QEMU to boot from the CD-ROM. The \"-m 2048\" flag sets the amount of memory for the virtual machine to 2048 MB. The \"-vnc :1\" flag tells QEMU to use VNC and listen on display :1. The \"-redir\" flag forwards the ports 22 and 844 from the host to the guest machine.\n\nYou will have to connect to the vnc server by running the command \"vncviewer :1\", then you will be able to see the installation process, and finish the installation using standard ubuntu installation process.\n\nPlease note that this command is just a starting point, you may need to adjust the parameters to suit your needs.",
