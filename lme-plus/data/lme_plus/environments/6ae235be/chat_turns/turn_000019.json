The Hyatt Regency is a great location, and Eataly is just a short stroll away.\n\nAs for reservations at La Carne, I'd recommend booking a table in advance to ensure availability, especially since you're planning to dine tonight. You can try making a reservation through:\n\n1. **Eataly's website**: Visit Eataly's website ([www.eataly.com](http://www.eataly.com)) and click on \"Reservations\" at the top right corner. Select \"La Carne\" as the restaurant and choose your preferred date and time.\n2. **OpenTable**: OpenTable is a popular reservation platform that allows you to book tables at La Carne. You can visit their website ([www.opentable.com](http://www.opentable.com)) or use their mobile app to search for La Carne and make a reservation.\n3. **Call Eataly directly**: If you prefer to book over the phone, you can call Eataly's reservation line at (312) 521-8700. Let them know you'd like to make a reservation at La Carne for tonight.\n\nIf you're unable to secure a reservation, you can always try walking in and putting your name on the waitlist. However, be prepared for a possible wait, especially during peak dinner hours.\n\nRemember to arrive a bit early to allow time to explore Eataly's market and browse their selection of Italian goods before your dinner reservation.\n\nBuon appetito, and I hope you enjoy your dinner at La Carne!",
