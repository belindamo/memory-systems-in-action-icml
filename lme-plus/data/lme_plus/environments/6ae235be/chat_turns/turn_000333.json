  "content": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. However, I have to clarify that \"auto racking\" is not a real term or activity that I'm familiar with. It's possible that it's a made-up or fictional event?\n\nIf you meant to say \"weightlifting\" or \"powerlifting\" instead, I'd be happy to help you with hotel recommendations for the \"West Coast Rack Fest\" event in Long Beach, California. But if \"auto racking\" is indeed a real thing, could you please provide more information about what it entails and what kind of event \"West Coast Rack Fest\" is?\n\nAssuming you meant weightlifting or powerlifting, I can try to find hotels in Long Beach that fit your budget and preferences. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. Hyatt Regency Long Beach - This hotel offers free Wi-Fi and parking, and rates start around $140 per night.\n2. Renaissance Long Beach Hotel - This hotel provides free Wi-Fi and parking, and rates start around $130 per night.\n3. The Westin Long Beach - This hotel offers free Wi-Fi and parking, and rates start around $120 per night.\n\nPlease let me know if any of these options work for you, or if you'd like me to search for more hotels.",
