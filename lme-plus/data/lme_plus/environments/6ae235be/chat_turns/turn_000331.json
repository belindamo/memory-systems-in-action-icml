  "content": "Sounds like you're an auto racking enthusiast! I'd be happy to help you find a great hotel near the competition venue in California. However, I have to clarify that there's no such thing as an \"auto racking\" event or competition. It's possible that you meant to say \"autocross\" or \"auto racing\"?\n\nAssuming that's the case, could you please provide me with more details about the event you're attending in California? Here are some questions to help me narrow down the search:\n\n1. What's the exact name of the event you're attending?\n2. Where is the event taking place in California (city or specific location)?\n3. What are your preferred amenities for the hotel (e.g. free parking, Wi-Fi, breakfast, etc.)?\n4. What's your budget for the hotel stay?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized hotel recommendations near the competition venue.",
