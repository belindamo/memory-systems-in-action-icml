  "content": "1. Use of dogs: The use of dogs is still a common practice by modern-day shepherds. The dogs are trained to help the herders in managing the flock and keeping the predators away from them. Dogs are specially trained to manage the livestock in remote or rugged environments. They can help herd the flock and protect them from predators.\n\n2. Transhumance: This traditional herding technique involves moving the flock from one place to another depending on the availability of pasture, water, and climate conditions. Transhumance is still used by modern-day shepherds in many parts of the world.\n\n3. Use of bells: Another traditional herding technique that is still used by modern-day shepherds in remote or rugged environments is the use of bells. Bells are tied to the neck of the lead animal, and as they move, the bells create a distinct sound that helps the herder locate the flock.\n\n4. Grazing rotations: Modern-day shepherds still use the traditional technique of grazing rotations where the flock is moved from one pasture to another, allowing the previous pasture to replenish. This technique ensures that the flock has access to fresh pasture, and it also helps in land conservation.\n\n5. Night-time corralling: In remote or rugged environments, herders still practice the traditional technique of night-time corralling. This involves gathering the flock in a protected area at night to protect them from predators.",
