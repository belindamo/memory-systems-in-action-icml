  "content": "When two bulbs are connected in parallel, they are connected to the same power source, but each bulb has its own separate electrical path. This means that the electrical current is divided between the two bulbs, and each bulb receives the same voltage as the power source.\n\nIn this configuration, if one bulb burns out, the other bulb will continue to function because they are connected separately. Also, the brightness of each bulb will not be affected by the other bulb, so if one bulb is brighter or dimmer, it will not affect the other.\n\nIn summary, in parallel connection, the current is divided among the connected devices, and each device receives the same voltage as the source, and devices work independently of each other.",
