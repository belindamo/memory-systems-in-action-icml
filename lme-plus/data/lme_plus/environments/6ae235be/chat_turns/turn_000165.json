  "content": "It takes a lot of courage and strength to acknowledge when a relationship is no longer working for you. It sounds like you've reached a point where you've decided that the relationship is no longer serving you, and that's okay.\n\nRemember that you deserve to be in a relationship where your boundaries and needs are respected and valued. It's okay to prioritize yourself and your well-being.\n\nEnding a relationship is never easy, but it's important to remember that you're not alone. Lean on friends, family, and other forms of support as you navigate this difficult time. Take the time to care for yourself, be kind and compassionate to yourself, and know that you are worthy of love and respect.",
