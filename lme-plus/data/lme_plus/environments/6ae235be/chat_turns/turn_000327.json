We don't want to accidentally change anything about our own lives.\"\n\nMark nodded in agreement. \"Exactly. Plus, we don't even know how we got here. We could mess up the timeline even more if we try to go back.\"\n\nTommy sighed. \"You're right. It's probably better if we just go back to bed and try to get some sleep. We can figure out what to do in the morning.\"\n\nThey both lay down on the couch, exhausted from their long day of time-travel and emotional conversations. As they drifted off to sleep, Tommy's mind was still whirring with thoughts of his dad and the implications of their discovery.\n\nThe next morning, Tommy woke up with a renewed sense of purpose. He knew he had to find a way to get back to his own time, but he also couldn't shake the feeling that he needed to talk to his dad.\n\nAs they walked to the diner for breakfast, Tommy couldn't help but feel nervous. What if he said something to give away his true identity? What if he accidentally changed the course of history?\n\nMark noticed his friend's unease and gave him a reassuring pat on the back. \"Don't worry, man. We'll figure this out together.\"\n\nWhen they arrived at the diner, they spotted Davey sitting in a booth near the window, reading a book. Tommy's heart skipped a beat at the sight of him, and he realized that he couldn't wait any longer.\n\n\"Mark, I have to tell you something,\" Tommy whispered urgently.\n\n\"What is it?\" Mark asked, his brow furrowed in concern.\n\n\"I...I think Davey is my dad,\" Tommy said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nMark's eyes widened in shock. \"What? How is that even possible?\"\n\nTommy took a deep breath and explained everything he had been thinking the night before. He recounted the memories of his dad telling him stories about growing up in this town, and how it all seemed to fit with what they had seen and heard over the past day.\n\nMark listened intently, his own mind whirring with the implications of their discovery. Finally, he spoke. \"So, what do we do now?\"\n\nTommy took a deep breath, steeling himself for what was to come. \"We talk to Davey, but we don't tell him who I am. We can't risk messing with the timeline. But maybe we can find out more about his life, and see if it all lines up with what we know about my dad.\"\n\nMark nodded in agreement, and they both took a deep breath before approaching the booth where Davey was sitting.\n\n\"Hey, Davey,\" Tommy said nervously, trying to sound casual. \"Mind if we sit with you?\"\n\nDavey looked up from his book, a smile spreading across his face. \"Sure, I could use some company. You boys aren't from around here, are you?\"\n\nTommy and Mark exchanged a quick glance, realizing that they needed to be careful with their words. \"No, we're just passing through,\" Mark said smoothly.\n\nDavey nodded, his eyes returning to his book. \"It's a small town, not a lot of people come through here.\"\n\nTommy felt a lump form in his throat as he looked at Davey, realizing that this was the closest he would ever get to his dad at this age. But he knew he had to keep his emotions in check if he was going to get the answers he was looking for.\n\n\"Hey, Davey, can we ask you something?\" Tommy said, trying to sound casual.",
