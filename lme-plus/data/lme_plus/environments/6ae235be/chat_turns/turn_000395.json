My goal was to discover what materials would make the best insulation.\n3. I gathered materials like Styrofoam, cotton, and bubble wrap.\n4. I also got some containers to use as the walls of my insulation chamber.\n5. I then filled each container with ice, and put the different materials around the outside.\n6. I used a thermometer to measure the temperature inside each container every 10 minutes.\n7. After 4 hours, I recorded the results.\n8. The Styrofoam had the lowest temperature, so I knew that it was the best insulator.\n9. I also learned that cotton was a good insulator too, but not as good as Styrofoam.\n10. I presented my results to the class, and everyone was impressed.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Which material was the best insulator according to the experiment results?\nA. Ice\nB. Bubble wrap\nC. Styrofoam\nD. Cotton\n2. What was the goal of the science project?\nA. To find the best container to use as insulation\nB. To test the temperature inside each container every 10 minutes\nC. To discover what materials would make the best insulation\nD. To present the results to the class\n3. What was used to measure the temperature inside each container?\nA. Styrofoam\nB. Cotton\nC. A thermometer\nD. Bubble wrap\n4. How long did the experiment last for?\nA. 1 hour\nB. 4 hours\nC. 10 minutes\nD. 2 hours\n5. What was the reaction of the class to the experiment results?\nA. They were uninterested\nB. They were not impressed\nC. They were impressed\nD. They were confused\n6. Choose the best way to revise the sentence: \"I used a thermometer to measure the temperature inside each container every 10 minutes.\"\nA. I measured the temperature inside each container with a thermometer every 10 minutes.\nB. I used a thermometer for every 10 minutes to measure the temperature inside each container.\nC. I measured the temperature inside each container every 10 minutes using a thermometer.\nD. I used a thermometer to measure the temperature of each container inside every 10 minutes.\n7. Which sentence can BEST replace sentence 5 to improve the description of the experiment setup?\nA. I then filled each container with ice, and put different materials around the outside of it.\nB. I then put different materials around the outside of each container that I filled with ice.\nC. I filled each container with ice, and placed the different materials around the outside of it.\nD. I put the different materials around the outside of each container, then filled it with ice.\n8. What is the MOST effective way to revise sentence 9?\nA. I also found that cotton was a good insulation material, but not as good as Styrofoam.\nB. I also discovered that cotton was a good insulation, but it wasn't as good as Styrofoam.\nC. I also learned that cotton made a good insulator, but not as good as Styrofoam.\nD. I also knew that cotton was a good insulation, but not as well as Styrofoam.",
