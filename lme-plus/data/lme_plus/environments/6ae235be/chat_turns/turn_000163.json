  "content": "It's important to prioritize your own well-being in a relationship. It sounds like you've reached a point where you're no longer willing to sacrifice your own needs and boundaries for the sake of the relationship. That's a big step and a sign of strength and resilience.\n\nIt's okay to take time to reflect on what you want and need in a relationship. Setting boundaries and asserting your needs is not always easy, but it's important for your own happiness and contentment. You deserve a relationship where your boundaries are respected, and your needs are valued.\n\nIf you feel that you've reached a point where the relationship is no longer working, then it may be time to consider ending things. Remember that you don't owe anyone a relationship, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being and happiness. Take the time to reflect on what you want and need, and be kind and compassionate to yourself.",
