Here are some recommendations for packing warm layers that won't take up too much space in your carry-on:\n\n**1. Pack a lightweight fleece jacket**: Fleece jackets are warm, lightweight, and compact, making them perfect for layering. Look for one that's water-resistant and breathable.\n\n**2. Bring a thermal top or leggings**: Thermal tops and leggings are great for layering under your clothes and can add warmth without taking up too much space.\n\n**3. Consider a packable down jacket**: Packable down jackets are incredibly lightweight and compact, making them perfect for travel. They're also very warm and can be easily stowed away in your carry-on.\n\n**4. Look for clothing with built-in warmth**: Some clothing, like merino wool or thermoregulating fabrics, have built-in warmth without adding bulk. These can be great options for packing light.\n\n**5. Roll your layers**: When packing your layers, roll them up tightly to save space in your carry-on. This will also help reduce wrinkles.\n\n**6. Wear your warmest layer**: If you have a particularly warm layer, consider wearing it on the plane to save space in your carry-on.\n\nSome great brands for packing light and warm layers include:\n\n* Uniqlo (for affordable and compact thermals)\n* Patagonia (for sustainable and packable down jackets)\n* Smartwool (for merino wool clothing with built-in warmth)\n* The North Face (for high-quality, packable fleeces and jackets)\n\nRemember to check the weather forecast before your trip to ensure you're prepared for any conditions. Enjoy your time in California, and I hope you stay warm and cozy!",
