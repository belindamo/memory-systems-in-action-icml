  "content": "I think I'll start by searching online for jewelry historians or appraisers in my area, and then reach out to a few local antique dealers for recommendations. I'll also look into the National Association of Jewelry Appraisers and American Society of Appraisers to find certified appraisers in my area.\n\nAs for my grandmother's Omega watch, I'll start by gathering all the information I can about the watch, including any documentation and family history. Then, I'll research the market to understand its value range and consult with a reputable watch appraiser who specializes in Omega watches.\n\nBy the way, I almost forgot to mention that I inherited my aunt's grandmother's old oak dresser from the 1920s last weekend when I helped my aunt move into her new condo. I'm planning to refinish it and use it in my guest bedroom.",
