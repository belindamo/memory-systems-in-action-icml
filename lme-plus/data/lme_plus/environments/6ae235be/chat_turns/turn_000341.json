  "content": "I think there might be some confusion again... As I mentioned earlier, I'm not familiar with \"auto racking\" as a real sport or activity. It's possible that it's a made-up or fictional term?\n\nIf you meant to ask about weightlifting or powerlifting gear, I'd be happy to try and help you with that. There are several sports equipment stores and gyms in the Long Beach area that might carry weightlifting or powerlifting gear. However, I'd need more information on what specific gear you're looking for.\n\nIf you could provide more context or clarify what you mean by \"auto racking gear or equipment,\" I'll do my best to assist you.",
