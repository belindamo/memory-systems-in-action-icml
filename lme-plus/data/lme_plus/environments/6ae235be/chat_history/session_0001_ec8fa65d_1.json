      "content": "La Carne is a fantastic choice! While it's true that La Carne is a meat-centric restaurant, they do offer some vegetarian options to cater to diverse tastes. However, please note that the menu is largely focused on meats, so options might be limited.\n\n**Vegetarian options at La Carne:**\n\n1. **Vegetable Antipasti**: A selection of roasted or grilled vegetables, such as eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes, served with bread or crostini.\n2. **Insalata di Verdure**: A mixed green salad with roasted vegetables, goat cheese, and a light vinaigrette.\n3. **Risotto alla Primavera**: A seasonal vegetable risotto made with spring vegetables, such as asparagus, peas, and carrots, in a light broth.\n4. **Contorni**: Sides dishes like saut\u00e9ed spinach, grilled or roasted vegetables, or polenta, which can be ordered \u00e0 la carte.\n\n**Important note:** These options might not be explicitly listed on the menu, so it's best to inform your server about your dietary preferences or restrictions. They'll be happy to guide you through the options or suggest something that can be adapted to your needs.\n\n**Meat-based dishes that can be adapted:**\n\nIf you're a vegetarian who consumes dairy or eggs, you might be able to modify some meat-based dishes by substituting the protein with a vegetarian alternative. For example:\n\n1. **Pappardelle alla Bolognese**: Ask to replace the ground beef with a vegetarian bolognese made with mushrooms or eggplant.\n2. **Pollo alla Cacciatora**: Request to substitute the chicken with portobello mushrooms or eggplant in this hunter-style dish.\n\nKeep in mind that these modifications might not be possible with all dishes, and the kitchen will do their best to accommodate your requests.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Inform your server about your dietary preferences or restrictions when you're seated.\n* Be flexible and open to suggestions from the server or chef.\n* If you're unsure about the menu, consider dining during off-peak hours when the kitchen might be more accommodating.\n\nEnjoy your meal at La Carne, and buon appetito!"
