For example, if they find a stapler, they have to come up with a creative way to use it, like stapling a bunch of papers together to create a mini sculpture. This will encourage them to think outside the box and have more fun with the game."

Do you think it would be a good idea to have a judging panel composed of senior leaders or managers from different departments, and have them provide feedback and scores for each team's submissions? This way, teams would get constructive feedback on their creative uses, and the judging panel would get to see the creative talent within the company."
