He had always known his dad as a grown-up, but to see him as a kid, struggling with the same issues that Tommy faced in the present, was eye-opening.\n\nMark sat across from him, staring wide-eyed at his friend.\n\n\"This is crazy, man. I can't believe Davey is your dad,\" Mark said, shaking his head in disbelief.\n\n\"I know, it's surreal,\" Tommy said, rubbing his temples. \"But it makes sense, you know? I always felt like there was something missing between me and my dad, like we didn't quite connect. But seeing him as a kid, going through the same struggles, it's like I understand him better now.\"\n\nMark nodded, still processing the information. \"So what do we do now?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tommy said, sighing heavily. \"I can't just go up to him and tell him, 'Hey, I'm your son from the future.' That's crazy.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but we have to do something,\" Mark said, sitting up straighter in his chair. \"We can't just leave him here, knowing what we know.\"\n\nTommy thought for a moment, then had an idea. \"What if we try to help him with the bullying? You heard what he said, he's been dealing with it for a while. Maybe we can do something to make it better for him.\"\n\nMark nodded, excited at the prospect of doing something proactive. \"Yeah, that's a good idea. What do you have in mind?\"\n\nTommy leaned forward, his eyes alight with enthusiasm. \"What if we stand up for him? Show him that he's not alone, that there are people who care about him and will have his back.\"\n\nMark nodded, catching Tommy's excitement. \"Yeah, let's do it. But how do we do that without giving away that we're from the future?\"\n\nTommy thought for a moment, then grinned. \"We'll just have to be creative.\"\n\nThe next day, the boys headed to school with a newfound sense of purpose. They kept a close eye on Davey, watching for any signs of trouble.\n\nSure enough, as they were walking to class, they saw a group of boys blocking Davey's path. Tommy's heart clenched in his chest as he recognized the same boys who had beaten him up the day before.\n\nWithout hesitation, Tommy and Mark stepped in front of Davey, facing down the bullies.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" Tommy demanded, his voice full of authority.\n\nThe bullies sneered at him, but Tommy stood his ground. Mark stood behind him, a look of determination on his face.\n\n\"We don't want any trouble,\" Tommy said, holding up his hands in a gesture of peace. \"We just want to get to class.\"\n\nThe bullies glared at them for a moment longer, then stepped aside, allowing the boys to pass.\n\nTommy and Mark walked with Davey to class, their heads held high. Davey looked at them in amazement, clearly grateful for their help.\n\n\"Thanks, guys,\" he said, smiling shyly.\n\nTommy grinned at him. \"Anytime, Davey. We've got your back.\"\n\nAs the day went on, Tommy and Mark kept a watchful eye on Davey, making sure he was okay. They even managed to make a few new friends, kids who had seen them stand up to the bullies and admired their bravery.\n\nBut as the final bell rang and they headed home, Tommy's mind was still whirling with the revelation of who Davey really was. He couldn't wait to tell Mark, to share this incredible secret with his best friend.\n\nThe two"

      "content": "Tommy nodded, his mind racing with all the possibilities. \"Yeah, that's a good point. Maybe it's better if we don't mess with anything. We don't want to accidentally change anything about our own lives.\"\n\nMark nodded in agreement. \"Exactly. Plus, we don't even know how we got here. We could mess up the timeline even more if we try to go back.\"\n\nTommy sighed. \"You're right. It's probably better if we just go back to bed and try to get some sleep. We can figure out what to do in the morning.\"\n\nThey both lay down on the couch, exhausted from their long day of time-travel and emotional conversations. As they drifted off to sleep, Tommy's mind was still whirring with thoughts of his dad and the implications of their discovery.\n\nThe next morning, Tommy woke up with a renewed sense of purpose. He knew he had to find a way to get back to his own time, but he also couldn't shake the feeling that he needed to talk to his dad.\n\nAs they walked to the diner for breakfast, Tommy couldn't help but feel nervous. What if he said something to give away his true identity? What if he accidentally changed the course of history?\n\nMark noticed his friend's unease and gave him a reassuring pat on the back. \"Don't worry, man. We'll figure this out together.\"\n\nWhen they arrived at the diner, they spotted Davey sitting in a booth near the window, reading a book. Tommy's heart skipped a beat at the sight of him, and he realized that he couldn't wait any longer.\n\n\"Mark, I have to tell you something,\" Tommy whispered urgently.\n\n\"What is it?\" Mark asked, his brow furrowed in concern.\n\n\"I...I think Davey is my dad,\" Tommy said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nMark's eyes widened in shock. \"What? How is that even possible?\"\n\nTommy took a deep breath and explained everything he had been thinking the night before. He recounted the memories of his dad telling him stories about growing up in this town, and how it all seemed to fit with what they had seen and heard over the past day.\n\nMark listened intently, his own mind whirring with the implications of their discovery. Finally, he spoke. \"So, what do we do now?\"\n\nTommy took a deep breath, steeling himself for what was to come. \"We talk to Davey, but we don't tell him who I am. We can't risk messing with the timeline. But maybe we can find out more about his life, and see if it all lines up with what we know about my dad.\"\n\nMark nodded in agreement, and they both took a deep breath before approaching the booth where Davey was sitting.\n\n\"Hey, Davey,\" Tommy said nervously, trying to sound casual. \"Mind if we sit with you?\"\n\nDavey looked up from his book, a smile spreading across his face. \"Sure, I could use some company. You boys aren't from around here, are you?\"\n\nTommy and Mark exchanged a quick glance, realizing that they needed to be careful with their words. \"No, we're just passing through,\" Mark said smoothly.\n\nDavey nodded, his eyes returning to his book. \"It's a small town, not a lot of people come through here.\"\n\nTommy felt a lump form in his throat as he looked at Davey, realizing that this was the closest he would ever get to his dad at this age. But he knew he had to keep his emotions in check if he was going to get the answers he was looking for.\n\n\"Hey, Davey, can we ask you something?\" Tommy said, trying to sound casual."

I just...I can't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Mark pressed. \"It's your dad, Tommy. He has a right to know.\"\n\nTommy shook his head, his eyes brimming with tears. \"I know, but it's not that simple. What if we mess up the timeline or something? What if telling him changes everything and we don't exist in the future anymore? And what if he doesn't believe us?\"\n\nMark frowned. \"But what about you? Don't you want to know what your dad was like when he was our age?\"\n\nTommy hesitated, thinking back to all the stories his dad had told him about growing up. He had always been curious, but he had never expected to actually meet him in the past. \"Of course I do,\" he said softly. \"But I don't know if I'm ready for this. It's too much to handle.\"\n\nMark reached out and placed a hand on Tommy's shoulder. \"We'll figure it out together,\" he said reassuringly. \"We'll make sure everything goes smoothly.\"\n\nTommy nodded, feeling a little more hopeful. \"Okay,\" he said. \"We'll do it tomorrow. But we have to be careful. We can't mess this up.\"\n\nThe two boys stayed up for most of the night, talking quietly about their plan and their concerns. Tommy couldn't shake the feeling of apprehension that clung to him, but he also felt a sense of excitement and wonder. He was about to meet his dad as a teenager, and he couldn't wait to see what he was like.\n\nThe next morning, they woke up early and walked to the diner where Davey worked. Tommy's heart was pounding as they entered the diner, scanning the room for any sign of his dad.\n\nThere he was, behind the counter, looking tired but determined as he took orders and served coffee. Tommy watched him with a sense of awe, feeling like he was seeing him for the first time.\n\nThey sat down at a booth and ordered breakfast, trying to act casual as they waited for Davey to come over. When he finally did, Tommy felt his heart skip a beat.\n\n\"Hey, boys,\" Davey said with a smile. \"What can I get for you?\"\n\nTommy took a deep breath, feeling his nerves getting the best of him. \"Um, could we talk to you for a minute?\" he asked hesitantly.\n\nDavey looked at him curiously. \"Sure, what's up?\"\n\nTommy hesitated, unsure of how to begin. \"I...um, I just wanted to say that...you're a really great guy, Davey. And I...I just wanted to thank you for talking to us yesterday.\"\n\nDavey smiled. \"No problem, kiddo. It's always good to help out a couple of kids in need.\"\n\nTommy felt his throat tighten. He had to tell him. He had to know. \"Davey,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Do you ever feel like...like you don't fit in? Like people don't understand you?\"\n\nDavey looked at him quizzically. \"Sure, I guess. But that's just part of growing up, you know? You learn to find your place in the world.\"\n\nTommy took a deep breath. \"I know,\" he said. \"But sometimes it's really hard. And sometimes it feels like...like you're all alone.\"\n\nDavey's expression softened. \"I understand,\" he said. \"Believe me, I do. But you"
