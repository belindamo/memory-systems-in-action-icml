However, I have to clarify that there's no such thing as an \"auto racking\" event or competition. It's possible that you meant to say \"autocross\" or \"auto racing\"?\n\nAssuming that's the case, could you please provide me with more details about the event you're attending in California? Here are some questions to help me narrow down the search:\n\n1. What's the exact name of the event you're attending?\n2. Where is the event taking place in California (city or specific location)?\n3. What are your preferred amenities for the hotel (e.g. free parking, Wi-Fi, breakfast, etc.)?\n4. What's your budget for the hotel stay?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized hotel recommendations near the competition venue."

I'd like a hotel with free parking and Wi-Fi, and my budget is around $150 per night."

But if \"auto racking\" is indeed a real thing, could you please provide more information about what it entails and what kind of event \"West Coast Rack Fest\" is?\n\nAssuming you meant weightlifting or powerlifting, I can try to find hotels in Long Beach that fit your budget and preferences. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. Hyatt Regency Long Beach - This hotel offers free Wi-Fi and parking, and rates start around $140 per night.\n2.
