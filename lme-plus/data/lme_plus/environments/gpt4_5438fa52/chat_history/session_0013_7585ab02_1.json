      "content": "Chicago in the summer is lovely! The weather in Chicago during the summer months (June to August) is usually warm and humid, with average high temperatures ranging from 84\u00b0F (29\u00b0C) to 87\u00b0F (31\u00b0C) during the day. However, it's not uncommon to experience sudden temperature drops in the evening, especially near Lake Michigan, so it's a good idea to pack layers.\n\nAs for your dresses, three is a great number for a 4-day trip, and it's awesome that it worked out well for your NYC trip! For Chicago, you might want to consider packing dresses made of lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton, linen, or rayon, which will help keep you cool in the summer heat. You may also want to bring a light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings.\n\nSome other tips for packing for Chicago in the summer:\n\n* Don't forget to pack sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses for outdoor exploration.\n* Comfortable shoes are a must, as you'll likely be doing a lot of walking.\n* A lightweight rain jacket or poncho is always a good idea, as summer storms can pop up quickly in Chicago.\n\nEnjoy your trip to Chicago!"
