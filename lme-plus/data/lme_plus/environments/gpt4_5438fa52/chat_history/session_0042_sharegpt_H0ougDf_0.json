      "content": "Advice:\n\n1. Consider both TFT and OLED technologies and weigh the pros and cons of each technology. Make a decision based on factors such as cost, availability, and consumer preferences.\n2. Ensure that the displays meet the functional needs and safety requirements, such as the ASIL-B rating and landscape/portrait orientation.\n3. Consider the user experience and provide a detailed graphical user interface definition for the displays.\n4. Consider offering additional touch displays for the passengers, particularly in higher specification vehicles.\n5. Explore the possibility of integrating portable devices for the rear occupants in higher specification vehicles.\n6. Consider the integration of the different display systems and ensure that they work seamlessly with each other and with the rest of the vehicle."
