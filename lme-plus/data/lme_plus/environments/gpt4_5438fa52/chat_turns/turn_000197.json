REX ORANGE COUNTY is a fantastic act, and I'm sure they brought a lot of energy to the stage.\n\nAs for Lollapalooza and Outside Lands, both festivals have announced their lineups for this year. Here's a brief rundown:\n\n**Lollapalooza Chicago (August 3-6, 2023)**\n\nThe headliners for Lollapalooza this year are:\n\n* Thursday: Billie Eilish, The 1975, and Lil Baby\n* Friday: Paul McCartney, Tame Impala, and Aesop Rock\n* Saturday: Kendrick Lamar, The Lumineers, and ODESZA\n* Sunday: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lana Del Rey, and Flume\n\nOther notable acts include:\n\n* 21 Savage, Arlo Parks, Charli XCX, J. Cole, Kacey Musgraves, and Wallows, among many others.\n\n**Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival (August 11-13, 2023)**\n\nThe headliners for Outside Lands this year are:\n\n* Friday: Kendrick Lamar, The 1975, and Tame Impala\n* Saturday: Foo Fighters, Lana Del Rey, and J. Cole\n* Sunday: The Lumineers, Zedd, and Kacey Musgraves\n\nOther notable acts include:\n\n* 21 Savage, Arlo Parks, Charli XCX, Lil Uzi Vert, Maggie Rogers, and Tove Lo, among many others.\n\nBoth lineups look incredible, but they do share some similarities. If you're a fan of Kendrick Lamar, you'll be happy to know that he's headlining both festivals. However, if you're interested in seeing Paul McCartney or Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lollapalooza might be the way to go. On the other hand, if you'd rather see Foo Fighters, Outside Lands might be the better choice.\n\nConsider factors like the overall vibe you're looking for, the location, and the additional activities and attractions each festival offers. Lollapalooza is known for its lively atmosphere and iconic Grant Park location, while Outside Lands is famous for its scenic Golden Gate Park setting and diverse food and art offerings.\n\nWhich one are you leaning towards, or would you like more information to help make your decision?",
