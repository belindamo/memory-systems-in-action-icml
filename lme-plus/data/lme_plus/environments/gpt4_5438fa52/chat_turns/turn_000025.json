Throughout the story, Edgar and Rachel's bubbly behavior and weird affection towards Indy (who they subconsciously view as another chance to be \"parents\") can make Chris and Anna feel increasingly uneasy. There can be one final moment that convinces them that they need to leave with Indy. When they try to flee, Edgar and Rachel can freak out and go to extreme lengths to keep their guests at the bed and breakfast. This climax can lead to Edgar and Rachel's eventual change at the end.",
