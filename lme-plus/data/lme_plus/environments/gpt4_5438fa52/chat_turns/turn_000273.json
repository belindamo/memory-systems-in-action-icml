Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions and take necessary safety precautions.\n\n**Additional Guidelines:**\n\n1. **Use a stove or lantern with a shut-off valve** to prevent accidental fires.\n2. **Keep a fire extinguisher or water nearby** when cooking or using a lantern.\n3. **Fully extinguish** your stove or lantern when not in use.\n4. **Respect any additional fire restrictions** that may be in place due to high fire danger or other environmental conditions.\n\nBefore your trip, check the park's website or contact the park's visitor center for the most up-to-date information on campfire restrictions and guidelines.\n\nRemember to always practice responsible and safe camping habits to protect Sequoia National Park's natural beauty and resources.",
