  "content": "I'm looking forward to trying out the Vinyasa Flow class at YogaWorks on Tuesday. Since I usually do a quick 15-minute yoga practice following meditation, I'm wondering if I should arrive earlier to get settled and centered before the class starts. Would you recommend arriving 20-30 minutes before the class to get settled and do a quick meditation or stretching before the class begins?",
