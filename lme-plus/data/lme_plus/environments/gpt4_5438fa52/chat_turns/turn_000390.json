Choose the \"Time\" trigger and set the specific time you want the weather forecast to be announced (e.g., 7:00 AM).\n4. Select the \"Say a phrase\" action for your connected smart speaker.\n5. Configure the action by selecting the \"Weather\" option and choosing the type of forecast you want to hear (e.g., current weather, daily forecast, or weekly forecast).\n6. Optional: You can also customize the phrase to be announced by adding a prefix or suffix, such as \"Good morning, the current weather is...\".\n7. Save the applet and give it a name, like \"Daily Weather Update\".\n\n**News Updates:**\n\n1. Connect your smart speaker with a voice assistant (e.g., Amazon Echo, Google Home) to IFTTT.\n2.
