  "content": "That's quite a list! I think I'll prioritize the Willis Tower and Millennium Park on Day 1. For Day 2, I'll visit the Art Institute of Chicago and take a stroll along the Magnificent Mile. On Day 3, I'll check out Wrigley Field and the Lincoln Park Zoo. On my last day, I'll head to the Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium. How's the public transportation in Chicago? Is it easy to get around the city without a car? By the way, I'm planning to pack comfortable walking shoes, just like I did for my NYC trip.",
