If you're planning a separate trip to Yosemite, I'd be happy to help you with that as well!\n\nRegarding the portable camping stove, that's a great idea! A good camping stove can make a huge difference in your outdoor cooking experience. When choosing a stove, consider factors like fuel type, weight, compactness, and simmer control. Some popular options include canister stoves, liquid fuel stoves, and wood-burning stoves.\n\nIf you're looking for recommendations, I can suggest some popular models or brands. However, it would be helpful to know more about your specific needs and preferences. For example:\n\n* What type of fuel do you prefer?\n* How many people will you be cooking for?\n* Do you need a stove with a lot of simmer control?\n* Are you looking for a lightweight and compact option?\n\nLet me know, and I'll do my best to help you find the perfect portable camping stove for your needs!",
