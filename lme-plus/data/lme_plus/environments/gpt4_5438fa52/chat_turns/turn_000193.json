The impact of the crowd on the players is an important factor in the championship, and it will be interesting to see how players adapt to the new circumstances. Without the energy and excitement of a large crowd, the players may need to rely more on their inner motivation, discipline, and focus to perform at their best. Moreover, the PGA might need to ensure the proper COVID-19 protocols and guidelines are followed to prevent the spread of the virus among the players and other individuals present at the event. Overall, the pandemic will certainly affect the championship and create a different experience both for the players and the spectators.",
