Connect your smart speaker with a voice assistant (e.g., Amazon Echo, Google Home) to IFTTT.\n2. Connect your music service (e.g., Spotify, Amazon Music) to IFTTT.\n3. Create a new applet by clicking on the \"New\" button on the IFTTT dashboard.\n4. Choose the \"Time\" trigger and set the specific time you want the music to start playing (e.g., 7:00 AM).\n5. Select the \"Play music\" action for your connected music service.\n6. Configure the action by selecting the specific playlist you want to play (e.g., \"Morning Motivation\" or \"Favorite Tracks\").\n7. Optional: You can also set the volume level, playback mode (e.g., shuffle or repeat), and other settings to your preference.\n8. Save the applet and give it a name, like \"Daily Morning Playlist\".\n\n**Play a Radio Station:**\n\n1.
