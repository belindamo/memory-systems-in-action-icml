  "content": "The treatment and prognosis of lung cancer depend on the stage of cancer when it is diagnosed. Stage I and II lung cancers are more likely to be treated successfully with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, and the patient may have a better chance of recovery. However, stage III and IV lung cancers are more challenging to treat and have a lower likelihood of being cured. Treatment options for advanced-stage lung cancer may include a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and palliative care to help alleviate the symptoms and improve the quality of life of the patient. In some cases, the goal of treatment may be to slow the growth of the cancer and relieve the symptoms to prolong the patient's life. The success of treatment and the prognosis of lung cancer depend on several factors, including the type of cancer, the stage at diagnosis, the patient's overall health, and their response to the treatment.",
