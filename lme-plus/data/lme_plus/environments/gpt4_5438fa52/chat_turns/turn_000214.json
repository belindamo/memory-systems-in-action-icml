I think I'll suggest the \"Prayer Wall\" idea to the outreach committee, as it's a meaningful way for attendees to participate and show their support for the community. I'll also ask them to bring some visual displays and informational materials to showcase their projects. Do you have any tips on how to promote the non-profit section and the outreach committee's exhibit through social media and local advertising?",
