Focus on keeping your core engaged and your shoulders down and away from your ears.\n2. **Incline Push-ups** (3 sets of 10-12 reps): Place your hands on a chair, bench, or stairs to reduce the angle and make the exercise easier.\n3. **Dumbbell Chest Press** (3 sets of 10-12 reps): Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and press upwards, extending your arms fully.\n4. **Lateral Raises** (3 sets of 10-12 reps): Hold dumbbells at your sides and lift them out to the sides until they're at shoulder height.\n\n**Day 2: Core and Back**\n\n1. **Plank** (3 sets, holding for 30-60 seconds): Focus on engaging your core and keeping your body in a straight line from head to heels.\n2. **Bent-Over Row** (3 sets of 10-12 reps): Hold dumbbells and bend over at the waist, keeping your back straight. Lift the dumbbells to your sides until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.\n3. **Superman** (3 sets of 10-12 reps): Lie on your stomach with your arms extended in front of you. Lift your arms, shoulders, and legs off the ground, keeping your core engaged.\n\n**Day 3: Rest day**\n\n**Day 4: Upper Body**\n\n1. **Tricep Dips (using a chair or bench)** (3 sets of 10-12 reps): Place your hands on the edge of a chair or bench and lower your body by bending your elbows until your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle.\n2. **Bicep Curls** (3 sets of 10-12 reps): Hold dumbbells with your palms facing forward and curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders.\n3. **Shoulder Rotations** (3 sets of 10-12 reps): Hold a dumbbell in each hand and rotate your shoulders in a circular motion, first clockwise and then counterclockwise.\n\n**Day 5: Rest day**\n\n**Day 6: Chest and Shoulders**\n\nRepeat the same exercises as Day 1.\n\n**Day 7: Rest day**\n\nTips to help you progress:\n\n* Start with lower reps and sets and gradually increase as you build strength.\n* Focus on proper form and technique throughout each exercise.\n* Engage your core and keep your shoulders down and away from your ears during exercises.\n* Increase the intensity by adding more weight or reps as you get stronger.\n* Practice push-ups regularly, even if it's just a few a day, to build up your endurance.\n\nRemember, consistency and patience are key",
