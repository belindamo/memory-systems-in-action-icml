  "content": "Yes, the atmosphere and energy of the crowd can certainly impact the players in the PGA Championship. Some golfers tend to thrive under pressure and may feed off the energy of the crowd, while others may find it distracting. The sound of applause and cheers can also affect the accuracy of a player's shot, and the pressure of playing in front of a large crowd can add an additional element of stress. \n\nHowever, due to the pandemic, there might be fewer crowds present in the upcoming PGA Championship or no crowds at all. This might affect the performance of some players differently, as some players may enjoy playing in quieter conditions while others may struggle without the cheering and excitement of the spectators. \n\nRegardless, it will be interesting to see how each player reacts to the crowd's presence or absence, and how they modify their strategies and performance accordingly.",
