Here's my revised social media post:\n\n\"Exciting news! Our outreach committee will be at the flea market on [Date] with an interactive exhibit featuring our latest projects. Take a moment to write a prayer or message of hope on our \"Prayer Wall\" and be a part of something special.\n\nLearn more about the outreach committee's projects and how you can get involved!
