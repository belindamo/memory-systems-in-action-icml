Here's what you need to know:\n\n**What is proof of onward travel?**\n\nProof of onward travel is a document or confirmation that shows you have a planned departure from the UK or Ireland within the allowed stay period (in your case, 5 days in the UK and 5 days in Ireland). This is required to ensure you don't overstay your welcome and to demonstrate your intention to leave the country.\n\n**What documents are accepted as proof of onward travel?**\n\nYou can provide one or more of the following documents as proof of onward travel:\n\n1. **Return ticket**: A confirmed return ticket to the US or another destination outside the UK/Ireland.\n2. **Onward ticket**: A confirmed ticket to another destination, such as a flight from the UK to Ireland or from Ireland to another European country.\n3. **Travel itinerary**: A printed or digital copy of your travel plans, including flight bookings, train tickets, or bus reservations, that show your departure from the UK/Ireland.\n4. **Travel agency confirmation**: A letter or document from a travel agency or tour operator confirming your travel plans and onward travel arrangements.\n5. **Cruise ticket**: If you're taking a cruise that departs from the UK/Ireland, your cruise ticket can serve as proof of onward travel.\n\n**How to provide proof of onward travel?**\n\nWhen arriving in the UK or Ireland, you might be asked to present your proof of onward travel to immigration officers. Make sure to have the documents easily accessible, either in print or digital form. If you're traveling with a mobile device, ensure it's fully charged and accessible.\n\n**Tips and considerations:**\n\n* Book your onward travel in advance to avoid any issues.\n* Keep a digital copy of your proof of onward travel documents, in case you need to show them again during your trip.\n* If you're planning to travel by land or sea, ensure you have the necessary documentation, such as a ferry ticket or a bus reservation.\n* If you're unsure about your onward travel plans, consider booking a refundable or flexible ticket to avoid any issues.\n\nIn your case, since you're planning to travel from the UK to Ireland, you can use your flight itinerary or booking confirmation as proof of onward travel for both countries.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be prepared and have the necessary documents ready to avoid any potential issues during your trip.",
