  "content": "That could be an exciting and dramatic twist to the story, and it would add an element of danger and survival to the climax. The idea of the conflict between the two couples attracting a hoard of zombies is a great way to escalate the situation and to create a sense of urgency.\n\nThe zombies attacking the house would force Edgar and Rachel to make a quick decision, and it would put them in a life-threatening situation. This could be a major step in their ability to continue on with their lives as it would force them to let go of the past and to focus on the present.\n\nIt would also be interesting to see how the main characters react to the threat of the zombies, and how they work together with Chris, Anna, and Indy to survive. The zombies could also serve as a metaphor for the apocalypse that is happening in the main characters' lives and how they are finally forced to face it and accept it.\n\nIt would also be interesting to see how the main characters react to the fact that they have to flee their home, and how they cope with the fact that they can no longer hold on to the past. This event can be a turning point for the main characters as they finally learn to let go and move on with their lives, and it could be the end of their arc.",
