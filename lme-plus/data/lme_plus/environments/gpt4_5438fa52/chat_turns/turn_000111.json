  "content": "Navy Pier is a great addition to your Day 2 itinerary! It's a beautiful spot to enjoy the city views, and it's relatively close to the Art Institute of Chicago. You can take a short taxi ride or a 10-15 minute walk from the museum to the pier.\n\nNavy Pier offers stunning views of the Chicago skyline, especially during sunset. You can take a leisurely stroll along the pier, grab a bite to eat at one of the many restaurants, or enjoy some entertainment options like the Chicago Shakespeare Theater or the Navy Pier Ferris wheel.\n\nAfter visiting the Art Institute of Chicago, Navy Pier is a great way to unwind and enjoy the city's atmosphere. Just keep in mind that Navy Pier can get crowded, especially during peak season, so be prepared for some crowds and long lines for popular attractions.\n\nAnd, yay, for packing the perfect dresses for your NYC trip! Three dresses were a great choice, and I'm sure you looked fabulous in them. For your Chicago trip, don't forget to pack comfortable shoes, as you'll be doing some walking between attractions.\n\nSo, to recap, your Day 2 itinerary looks like this:\n\n* Morning: Art Institute of Chicago\n* Afternoon: Navy Pier\n* Evening: Enjoy dinner and explore the Magnificent Mile\n\nSounds like a fantastic plan to me!",
