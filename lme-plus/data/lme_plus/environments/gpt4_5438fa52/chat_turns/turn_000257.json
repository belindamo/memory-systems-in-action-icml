  "content": "Immunotherapy and targeted therapy are considered safer alternatives to traditional chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but they still have the potential to cause side effects. Below are some of the possible side effects of these therapies and how they can be managed:\n\n1. Immunotherapy side effects: The most common side effects of immunotherapy include fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, rashes, and flu-like symptoms. In some cases, immunotherapy may cause inflammation in the lungs, liver, colon, kidneys or endocrine organs like thyroid or adrenal glands, resulting in severe side effects like pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis or hypophysitis.\n\n2. Targeted therapy side effects: Targeted therapy side effects depend on the type of therapy and the molecular target specific to the therapy. Some common side effects of targeted therapy include skin rash, diarrhea, constipation, elevated liver enzymes, hypertension, fatigue, weight gain, and anemia. \n\n3. Managing side effects: To manage side effects, healthcare providers may use supportive medications or steroids to alleviate symptoms, reduce inflammation and dampen the immune system response. In some cases, the oncologist may need to adjust the dose of medication or stop treatment temporarily to allow the patient's body to recover. Other than this, eating healthy foods, drinking plenty of fluids, getting ample rest and gentle regular exercises prescribed by the oncologist or physiotherapist can also help with symptoms management. It is important to inform your healthcare provider about any changes in symptoms, no matter how minor.\n\nIn summary, side effects related to either medication can occur in a range of severity from mild to severe, and they entirely depend on every individual's reaction to the treatment. With careful monitoring and prompt symptom management, side effects from these treatments are generally manageable. It is essential to talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you may have about side effects before, during, and after treatment.",
