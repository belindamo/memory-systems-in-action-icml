This program is likely designed to help government employees build the skills they need to work with data and analytics and support data-driven decision making. The curriculum may cover topics such as data science fundamentals, data visualization, machine learning, big data analytics, and more. The exact curriculum would depend on the needs and goals of the individual government agencies and the employees being trained, as well as the resources and expertise available to support the training program.",
