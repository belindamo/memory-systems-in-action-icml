  "content": "You can definitely use IFTTT applets to automate the brightness of your smart bulbs, in addition to the color temperature. IFTTT provides a range of actions for controlling smart bulbs, including:\n\n1. **Turn on/off**: Turn the bulb on or off.\n2. **Adjust brightness**: Set the bulb's brightness to a specific percentage (e.g., 50%, 75%, 100%).\n3. **Adjust brightness by**: Increase or decrease the bulb's brightness by a specific percentage (e.g., +20%, -30%).\n4. **Dim**: Gradually dim the bulb's brightness over a set period (e.g., 10 minutes).\n5. **Fade**: Gradually fade the bulb's brightness to a specific level over a set period (e.g., fade to 20% over 30 minutes).\n\nYou can combine these actions with various triggers to create customized automation recipes. Here are some examples of IFTTT applets that automate the brightness of smart bulbs:\n\n* \"If it's 8:00 AM, then set my kitchen bulb to 75% brightness to start the day.\"\n* \"If I enter my living room, then turn on the floor lamp and set it to 50% brightness.\"\n* \"If the sun sets, then dim my outdoor string lights by 20% over 30 minutes to conserve energy.\"\n* \"If I'm watching a movie, then fade my living room bulbs to 20% brightness over 10 minutes to create a cozy atmosphere.\"\n* \"If I leave my home, then turn off all bulbs to save energy.\"\n\nTo create an IFTTT applet that automates the brightness of your smart bulbs, follow these steps:\n\n1. Connect your smart bulb account to IFTTT, if you haven't already.\n2. Create a new applet by clicking on the \"New\" button on the IFTTT dashboard.\n3. Choose a trigger that will activate the applet (e.g., time of day, location, weather, etc.).\n4. Select the \"Adjust brightness\" or \"Adjust brightness by\" action for your connected smart bulb.\n5. Configure the action by setting the desired brightness level or adjustment amount.\n6. Save the applet and give it a name, like \"Morning Brightness\" or \"Movie Mode.\"\n\nBy automating the brightness of your smart bulbs with IFTTT, you can create a more comfortable and energy-efficient home, while also enjoying the convenience of hands-free control.",
