Sephora: Sephora has an app called Virtual Artist that uses AR to help customers try on makeup virtually. Customers can use their smartphone camera to apply different shades of lipstick, eyeshadow, and other cosmetics, and see how they look in real-time.\n\n2. Converse: Converse has a feature on their website called The Sampler, which uses AR to allow customers to try on different styles of shoes virtually. Customers can use their smartphone camera to see how a pair of shoes would look on their feet, without having to go to a physical store.\n\n3. Wayfair: Wayfair has an app called Wayfair Spaces, which uses AR to help customers visualize how furniture and home decor items would look in their home. Customers can use their smartphone camera to place 3D models of Wayfair's products in their space, and see how they fit in real-time.\n\n4. L'Oreal: L'Oreal has developed an AR makeup app called Makeup Genius, which uses facial recognition technology to allow customers to see what makeup looks like on their face. Customers can try on different shades of lipstick, eyeshadow, and other cosmetics, and the app will track their movements in real-time.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how retailers are using AR in unique and innovative ways to enhance the customer experience.
