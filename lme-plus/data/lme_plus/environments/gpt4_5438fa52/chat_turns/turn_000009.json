  "content": "Late arrivals can be stressful, and it's great that you're thinking ahead.\n\nYogaWorks' policy on late arrivals varies by studio, but generally, they allow students to join the class up to 5-10 minutes after the start time. However, it's always best to check with the studio directly or call ahead to confirm their policy.\n\nHere's what you can expect:\n\n* **Within 5 minutes:** If you arrive within 5 minutes of the start time, you'll likely be able to join the class without disrupting the other students. Just quietly make your way to an available spot, set up your mat, and join in.\n* **5-10 minutes late:** If you arrive 5-10 minutes after the start time, you might still be able to join the class, but you might miss the initial centering and warm-up sequence. The instructor might ask you to wait for a few minutes before joining in, or they might give you a quick briefing on what you've missed.\n* **More than 10 minutes late:** If you're running more than 10 minutes behind, it's generally best to wait for the next class. You'll likely miss a significant portion of the practice, and joining in late can disrupt the flow of the class for other students.\n\nRemember to be respectful of the other students and the instructor's time. If you do arrive late, try to enter the room quietly, avoid distracting others, and be mindful of your surroundings.\n\nIf you're unsure about the studio's policy or your own schedule, you can always call the studio ahead of time to ask about their late arrival policy or to reschedule for a later class.\n\nBetter safe than sorry, and it's always a good idea to plan to arrive a bit early to account for any unexpected delays!",
