  "content": "NGOs, or non-governmental organizations, can play a role in the government's digital nation policy by partnering with the government to deliver services, advocate for the needs of vulnerable populations, and promote digital literacy and education. For example, an NGO might partner with the government to provide digital skills training to low-income or disadvantaged communities, or to advocate for the needs of these communities in the development of digital services and infrastructure.\n\nIn Singapore, the government has a strong track record of partnering with NGOs and other organizations to deliver services and support the growth of the digital economy. By working together, the government and NGOs can leverage each other's strengths and resources to achieve common goals and support the development of a more digitally enabled society. This can include initiatives to promote digital literacy, to support education and training programs, and to provide access to digital services and infrastructure to those who need it most.",
