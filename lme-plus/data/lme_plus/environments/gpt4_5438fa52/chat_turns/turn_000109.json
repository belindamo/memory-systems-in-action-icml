The 'L' Train has eight different lines that cover most areas of interest.\n2. **Bus**: The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) operates an extensive network of buses that cover the entire city.\n3. **Water Taxi**: A fun way to travel along the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. Water taxis operate during the summer months.\n4. **Ride-hailing**: Uber and Lyft are widely available in Chicago.\n5. **Divvy Bike**: A bike-sharing system with stations throughout the city. You can rent a bike for a day or by the hour.\n\nYou can use the Ventra app or the CTA website to plan your route and track your journey. A single ride on the 'L' Train or bus costs $3, but you can also purchase a Visitor Pass for unlimited rides over 1-7 days.\n\nComfortable walking shoes are a must in Chicago, just like in NYC!
