The whole system shall be rated as ASIL-B (TBD) compliant.\nThe Camera Monitoring System Displays will be placed on the sides near the DID, and will share the same packaging under same curved optically bonded glass. Also the CMS system shall be rated as ASIL-B (TBD) compliant.\nThe same 3x Displays packages shall integrate in its package behind the glass also the Driver Monitoring System, including Camera and infrared LEDs.\n\nThe Center and Co-Driver Displays will reserve on their touch surface area also HVAC and other Infotainment and Vehicle controls.\nDetailed Graphical User Interface definition and functions will follow parallel to the HW development activities.\nPartially the CSD shall be capable of complying with Functional Safety requirements, allowing ASIL-B rated functions to be used through the defined GUI (TBD).\n\nThe Co-Driver should be able to experience a higher level of User Interaction in higher specification vehicles, by adding 2 additional displays adjacent to the CDD, mirroring the displays physical package of the driver (TBD).\n\nAs standard the rear occupants shall be provided minimum interface possibilities with the vehicle \u2013 e.g. (rear) HVAC controls \u2013 through a center mounted touch display.\n\nAs optional in higher specification cars, the rear occupant would be able to bring portable aftermarket screened devices (i.e. tablets) and dock them into the backrests of front row seats.\u000bThrough special connection and developed application they could connect to the IVI system and the rest of the vehicle.",
