Click on the \"Axis\" tool from the \"3D Model\" tab of the toolbar or from the \"Create\" dropdown menu.\n3. Click on the face or edge where you want to create the axis.\n4. Define the orientation and location of the axis by specifying two points or using other options like \"Parallel\" or \"Perpendicular\" to existing geometry.\n5. Click \"OK\" to create the axis.\n\nTo use program utilities in Inventor, you can access a variety of tools that help you to work more efficiently with your models. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. \"Measure\" tool: Use this tool to measure distances, angles, and other properties of your geometry. You can access it from the \"Inspect\" dropdown menu or by using the shortcut key \"M\".\n2. \"Pattern\" tool: Use this tool to create patterns of features or components, such as a linear or circular pattern. You can access it from the \"Pattern\" dropdown menu or by using the shortcut key \"P\".\n3. \"Mirror\" tool: Use this tool to create a mirrored copy of a feature or component. You can access it from the \"Pattern\" dropdown menu or by using the shortcut key \"M\".\n4. \"Extrude\" tool: Use this tool to create a 3D solid from a 2D sketch. You can access it from the \"3D Model\" tab or by using the shortcut key \"E\".\n5. \"Fillet\" tool: Use this tool to add a rounded edge to a sharp corner. You can access it from the \"3D Model\" tab or by using the shortcut key \"F\".\n\nBy using these and other program utilities in Autodesk Inventor, you can create and modify 3D models more efficiently and accurately."

      "content": "Designing a gearbox in Autodesk Inventor requires a series of steps. Here's a detailed description of the process, including the use of sketches, extrude, revolve, and other basic design tools:\n\n1. Start by creating a new part file in Autodesk Inventor.\n2. Begin by creating a sketch on the X-Y plane to define the overall shape of the gearbox. You can use lines, arcs, circles, and other sketching tools to create the profile of the gearbox. The sketch should include features such as mounting points and holes for bolts or screws.\n3. Once you have created the sketch, you can use the \"Extrude\" tool to create a 3D solid from the 2D sketch. Choose the appropriate thickness and direction of the extrusion to define the outer shell of the gearbox.\n4. Next, create a new sketch on a plane perpendicular to the outer shell of the gearbox. Sketch the profile of the first gear using circles, arcs, and lines. Use the \"Revolve\" tool to create a 3D solid from the 2D sketch, defining the first gear.\n5. Repeat step 4 to create additional gears as needed. Each gear should be designed in its own sketch and revolved to create a 3D solid.\n6. Create a new sketch on the top surface of the gearbox to define the location and shape of the gear teeth. Use lines and arcs to create the tooth profile, and then use the \"Extrude\" tool to create the teeth as a 3D solid.\n7. Create a new sketch to define any other internal components of the gearbox, such as bearings or shafts. Use the appropriate sketching and extrusion tools to create these components as 3D solids.\n8. Use the \"Combine\" tool to combine all of the 3D solids into a single assembly. This will allow you to view and manipulate the complete gearbox as a single unit.\n9. Finally, use the \"Material\" tool to assign appropriate materials to each component of the gearbox. This will allow you to analyze the performance of the gearbox under various loads and conditions.\n\nThroughout the design process, you can use various tools in Autodesk Inventor, such as the \"Measure\" tool to check dimensions and the \"Pattern\" tool to create copies of features or components. With practice and experience, you can use these and other tools to create complex, detailed parts like a gearbox in Inventor."

      "content": "Certainly, here is an example code in CadQuery to create a simple gearbox:\n```python\nimport cadquery as cq\n\n# Define parameters for the gearbox\ngear_pitch = 20  # The pitch of the gear teeth in mm\ngear_ratio = 2:1  # The ratio of the number of teeth on the first gear to the second gear\ngear_thickness = 10  # The thickness of each gear in mm\nbox_width = 100  # The width of the gearbox in mm\nbox_height = 50  # The height of the gearbox in mm\nbox_depth = 80  # The depth of the gearbox in mm\n\n# Create the first gear\ngear1_radius = (gear_ratio / (gear_ratio + 1)) * (box_height / 2)\ngear1 = cq.Workplane(\"XY\").circle(gear1_radius).extrude(gear_thickness)\n\n# Create the second gear\ngear2_radius = gear1_radius * gear_ratio\ngear2 = cq.Workplane(\"XY\").circle(gear2_radius).extrude(gear_thickness)\n\n# Create the gear teeth\ntooth_width = 2 * cq.math.tan(cq.math.pi / (gear_pitch * 2))\ngear1_teeth = gear1.faces(\">Z\").workplane().rect(box_width - gear_thickness, gear_thickness).vertices().rect(tooth_width, gear_thickness - tooth_width, forConstruction=True).cutBlind(-gear_thickness)\ngear2_teeth = gear2.faces(\">Z\").workplane().rect(box_width - gear_thickness, gear_thickness).vertices().rect(tooth_width, gear_thickness - tooth_width, forConstruction=True).cutBlind(-gear_thickness)\n\n# Create the gearbox shell\nbox = cq.Workplane(\"XY\").box(box_width, box_depth, box_height)\n\n# Combine all the parts into a single object\ngearbox = box.cut(gear1).cut(gear2).cut(gear1_teeth).cut(gear2_teeth)\n\n# Export the object as an STL file\ncq.exporters.export(gearbox, \"gearbox.stl\")\n```\nThis code uses the CadQuery library to create two gears with specified dimensions, extrude them to a certain thickness, and add teeth to the gears. The code then creates a gearbox shell with specified dimensions and cuts out the gears and teeth to fit inside the shell. Finally, the object is exported as an STL file. Note that this is just an example code and may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of a particular gearbox design."
