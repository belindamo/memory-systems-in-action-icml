While I don't have access to your personal account information, I can provide general information about United Airlines' loyalty program, MileagePlus, and its benefits.\n\nUnited Airlines has a tier-based loyalty program, with Premier status levels ranging from Silver to 1K. The benefits and perks you're eligible for depend on your status level, which is determined by the number of Premier Qualifying Miles (PQMs) or Premier Qualifying Segments (PQSs) you earn within a calendar year.\n\nSince you've accumulated around 20,000 miles in the past three months, you might be on your way to achieving a higher status level. Here are some general benefits and perks you might be interested in:\n\n* **Silver status** (25,000 PQMs or 30 PQSs): Enjoy benefits like priority check-in, security screening, and boarding, as well as one free checked bag.\n* **Gold status** (50,000 PQMs or 60 PQSs): In addition to Silver benefits, Gold members get two free checked bags, priority baggage handling, and access to Economy Plus seating at check-in.\n* **Platinum status** (75,000 PQMs or 90 PQSs): Platinum members receive all Gold benefits, plus access to United Polaris business class lounges, Star Alliance Gold status, and higher upgrade priority.\n* **1K status** (100,000 PQMs or 120 PQSs): 1K members enjoy all Platinum benefits, plus perks like personalized service, dedicated check-in and security lines, and highest upgrade priority.\n\nAssuming you're not yet a Premier member, you might not have access to these benefits just yet. However, as you continue to accumulate miles, you'll be closer to achieving a higher status level.\n\nIn the meantime, as a MileagePlus member, you can still enjoy some benefits, such as:\n\n* Earning miles on flights and redeeming them for award travel, upgrades, or other rewards\n* Access to United's online check-in and mobile check-in\n* Priority boarding (based on your group assignment)\n* Opportunities to purchase upgrades or Economy Plus seating\n\nKeep in mind that benefits and perks are subject to change, and United Airlines may offer additional promotions or limited-time offers. I recommend logging into your MileagePlus account or contacting United Airlines' customer service to get the most up-to-date information on your benefits and status.\n\nLastly, since you mentioned being impressed with United's in-flight entertainment system, you might be interested in exploring their premium cabins, like Polaris business class or Premium Plus, on your next long-haul flight. These cabins offer enhanced comfort, amenities, and service, which might be worth considering for your next trip.",
