Here's a breakdown of the walking distance from each hotel to Central Park:\n\n1. **The Langham, New York, Fifth Avenue**: 5-7 minute walk to the park's southeast corner (Fifth Avenue and 59th Street)\n2. **The Edition Hotel New York Midtown**: 10-12 minute walk to the park's southeast corner (Fifth Avenue and 59th Street)\n3. **Hyatt Centric Times Square New York**: 12-15 minute walk to the park's southwest corner (Sixth Avenue and 59th Street)\n4. **The NoMad Hotel**: 15-18 minute walk to the park's southeast corner (Fifth Avenue and 59th Street)\n5. **Kimpton Hotel Eventi**: 18-20 minute walk to the park's southwest corner (Sixth Avenue and 59th Street)\n\nIf you prioritize being close to Central Park, The Langham or The Edition would be excellent choices. You can easily walk to the park from either of these hotels and enjoy a stroll through the scenic paths, visit the Loeb Boathouse, or rent a bike and ride through the park.\n\nIf you're looking for an even closer option, consider the following hotels:\n\n1. **The Plaza Hotel**: An iconic hotel located directly across from Central Park, with luxurious rooms and a prime location.\n2. **The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park**: A 5-star hotel with elegant rooms, a fitness center, and a location overlooking Central Park.\n\nKeep in mind that these hotels might be more expensive than the others, but they offer unparalleled access to Central Park.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more hotel recommendations!",
