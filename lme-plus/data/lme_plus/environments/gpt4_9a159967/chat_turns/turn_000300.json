Here are a few themes and ideas to get you started:\n\n**Spring Florals**\n\n* Use a pastel color palette with soft pinks, peaches, and whites to reflect the gentle hues of spring flowers.\n* Incorporate seasonal blooms like tulips, daffodils, and hyacinths into bouquets, centerpieces, and garlands.\n* Consider a \"living\" wedding arch or wall with real flowers, greenery, and vines for a whimsical touch.\n\n**Garden Whimsy**\n\n* Bring the outdoors in by incorporating natural elements like potted plants, terrariums, and moss into your decor.\n* Hang paper lanterns in soft pastel shades or flower-shaped balloons to add a playful touch.\n* Use vintage garden benches, wooden crates, or distressed doors as unique seating or decorative elements.\n\n**Spring Fruits and Florals**\n\n* Combine fresh fruits like lemons, strawberries, and grapes with flowers in centerpieces or as a decorative accent.\n* Create a stunning fruit and flower wall or garland to adorn the wedding arch or reception area.\n* Use edible flowers or flower-shaped cookies as a sweet and delicate decoration.\n\n**Vintage Spring**\n\n* Incorporate vintage garden tools, watering cans, and flower pots as decorative elements.\n* Use lace, burlap, and ribbons in soft pastel hues to add a rustic, vintage charm.\n* Hang old windows, doors, or mirrors with floral arrangements or greenery to create a charming backdrop.\n\n**Light and Airy**\n\n* Use sheer fabrics, tulle, or organza to create a light, ethereal atmosphere.\n* Incorporate candles, lanterns, or string lights in soft pastel shades to add warmth and ambiance.\n* Create a stunning focal point with a dramatic flower or greenery installation suspended from the ceiling or a gazebo.\n\n**Spring Colors**\n\n* Incorporate soft, calming colors like pale yellow, mint green, and blush pink into your decor.\n* Use these colors in table runners, napkins, and ribbons to add a pop of color to your tablescape.\n* Consider a monochromatic scheme with different shades of a single color for a cohesive look.\n\nRemember to consider Michael's personal style and preferences when choosing a theme or decor. You can also mix and match these ideas to create a unique look that reflects his special day. Good luck, and I hope these ideas inspire you to create a beautiful spring-themed wedding!",
