  "content": "Syntax-directed translation techniques build on the foundations of context-free grammars by associating attributes with grammar symbols, which allows for the definition of semantic actions to be performed during parsing. In other words, instead of simply recognizing the structure of a sentence, syntax-directed translation techniques use attributes to calculate and store additional information about the sentence\u2019s meaning. \n\nAttribute grammars are a kind of syntax-directed translation technique that enable more complex parsing tasks by specifying both the syntax and semantics of a language using a single formalism. Attribute grammars can be used to specify semantic analyses of programming languages, and are particularly powerful in situations where context-sensitive information is required. Attribute grammars allow the use of inherited attributes, which can be propagated up a parse tree from parent nodes to child nodes, and synthesized attributes, which can be calculated at each node in the tree from the inherited attributes and local information. \n\nThe combination of context-free grammars and attribute grammars allows for the specification of complex grammars that produce both syntactic and semantic information. This results in a more powerful parsing technique that can handle a wider range of input and provide more detailed information about the parsed output.",
