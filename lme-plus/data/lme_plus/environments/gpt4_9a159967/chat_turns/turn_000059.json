  "content": "I was impressed with United's in-flight entertainment system on my recent trip. In March, I took a business trip to Chicago with United Airlines, flying from my hometown to Chicago on the 10th and returning on the 12th, with two flights each way. So I'm hoping to stick with them for my next long-haul flight. Do you know if they offer any special perks or benefits for frequent flyers like myself, especially since I've accumulated around 20,000 miles with them over the past three months?",
