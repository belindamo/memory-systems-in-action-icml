The breakfast features a buffet-style spread with a variety of breakfast items, including pastries, fruit, and hot entrees.\n\nThe character lineup typically includes:\n\n1. Lilo\n2. Stitch\n3. Pluto\n4. Mickey Mouse (occasionally)\n\nThe character interactions are more low-key compared to 'Ohana's Best Friends Breakfast, but it's still a great opportunity to meet the characters and take photos.\n\n**Details:**\n\n* Reservations: No reservations are required, as it's a quick-service restaurant. Just show up during operating hours and grab a table.\n* Hours: Captain Cook's Character Breakfast is usually available from 7:30 AM to 11:00 AM, but hours may vary depending on the day and season.\n* Cost: The breakfast buffet is priced around $15-$20 per adult and $10-$15 per child (ages 3-9) plus tax.\n* Dress code: Casual attire is perfectly fine for this quick-service breakfast.\n\nWhile 'Ohana's Best Friends Breakfast is a more immersive character dining experience, Captain Cook's Character Breakfast at Kona Cafe offers a more relaxed, quick-service option with character appearances. Both are great choices, depending on your preferences and schedule!",
