Here's a breakdown of the walking distance from each hotel to The Met:\n\n1. **The NoMad Hotel**: 20-25 minute walk (about 1.2 miles)\n2. **The Edition Hotel New York Midtown**: 25-30 minute walk (about 1.5 miles)\n3. **The Langham, New York, Fifth Avenue**: 25-30 minute walk (about 1.5 miles)\n4. **Hyatt Centric Times Square New York**: 30-35 minute walk (about 1.7 miles)\n5. **Kimpton Hotel Eventi**: 30-35 minute walk (about 1.7 miles)\n\nIf you're not keen on walking, you can always take a taxi or ride-hail service, which would take around 10-15 minutes depending on traffic.\n\nIf you prioritize being close to The Met, you might consider staying at a hotel on the Upper East Side. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **The Mark Hotel**: A luxurious hotel located just a block away from The Met, with stylish rooms and a great location.\n2. **The Surrey**: A boutique hotel with elegant rooms, a rooftop bar, and a location just a few blocks from The Met.\n3. **Loews Regency New York Hotel**: A modern hotel with comfortable rooms, a fitness center, and a location about a 10-minute walk from The Met.\n\nKeep in mind that these hotels might be a bit farther from Carbone, but you can always take a taxi or subway to get there.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more hotel recommendations!",
