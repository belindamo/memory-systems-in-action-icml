  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to current pricing information for Borland's products. However, historically, Borland's product pricing varied depending on the product and licensing model. Borland offered different pricing tiers depending on the size of the development team, the number of licenses needed, and the desired support level. \n\nIn the past, Borland's products were available through a range of licensing options including perpetual licensing, subscription-based licensing, and team-based licensing. These options allowed customers to choose a pricing model that was flexible and affordable for their business needs.\n\nTo determine whether Borland's products are affordable for small businesses or startups, it is recommended to reach out to Borland directly or a reseller to discuss specific licensing needs and pricing options. Alternatively, small businesses and startups may consider using similar open-source IDEs or development tools that can also offer similar features and benefits at no cost or with lower fees.",
