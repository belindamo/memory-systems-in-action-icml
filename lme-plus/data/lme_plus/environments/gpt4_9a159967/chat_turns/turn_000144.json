  "content": "A gift journal is a wonderful way to keep a physical record of your gifts, and it can become a treasured keepsake over time.\n\nIncluding the cost of each gift in the journal is entirely up to you. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros of including the cost:**\n\n1. **Budgeting**: Recording the cost of each gift can help you track your spending and stay within your budget.\n2. **Comparison**: You can compare the costs of gifts over time and see how your spending habits change.\n3. **Gift ideas**: Knowing the cost of previous gifts can help you come up with ideas for future gifts within a similar price range.\n\n**Cons of including the cost:**\n\n1. **Focus on the thought, not the price**: Gifts are about the thought and love behind them, not just the price tag. Focusing too much on the cost might detract from the sentimental value.\n2. **Personal preference**: You might not want to associate gifts with a specific price, as it can make the gift feel less special.\n3. **Privacy**: If you plan to share your gift journal with others, you might not want to include the cost of gifts for privacy reasons.\n\nUltimately, whether or not to include the cost of each gift in your journal is a personal decision. If you do decide to include the cost, you could add a column or section for it, or even use a symbol or code to represent different price ranges (e.g., for under $10, for $10-$20, etc.).\n\nRemember, the primary purpose of a gift journal is to record your thoughts, feelings, and memories associated with each gift. Focus on capturing the sentiment and story behind each gift, and the cost can be a secondary detail.",
