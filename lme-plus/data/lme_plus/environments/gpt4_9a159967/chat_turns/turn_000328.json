  "content": "You are correct in stating that Sulla was a power-hungry leader, only interested in his own gain. The citizens of Rome allowed him to get away with his policies due to a combination of fear and admiration.\n\nMany Romans admired Sulla for his military prowess and saw him as a strong leader who could restore stability to a city in crisis. They saw his policies as necessary to maintain order and prevent the collapse of Roman society. Sulla also had a substantial following among the senatorial class, who saw him as a defender of their interests and as a way to preserve their privileged position.\n\nFear also played a significant role in Sulla's rise to power. Sulla displayed a ruthless and violent streak throughout his career, and many citizens feared him and his supporters. His use of violence as a tool of political control created a climate of fear that made it difficult for any opposition to arise.\n\nFinally, there was a lack of effective opposition to Sulla's policies. The traditional institutions of the Roman Republic, such as the popular assemblies and the tribunes, were weakened, and the citizens had little power to resist his policies. The senate, which was dominated by Sulla's supporters, also failed to check his excesses, further consolidating his power.\n\nIn conclusion, Sulla was able to get away with his policies due to a combination of admiration, fear, and the lack of effective opposition. However, his policies ultimately contributed to the decline of the Roman Republic and showed the dangers of unchecked political power.",
