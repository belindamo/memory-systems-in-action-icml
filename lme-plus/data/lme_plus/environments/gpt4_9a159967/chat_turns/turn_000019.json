A kitchen torch can add a nice caramelized crust to various dishes, and I've got some recipe ideas that'll help you get started:\n\n1. **Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e**: The classic dessert that's synonymous with kitchen torches! Caramelize sugar on top of creamy custard base for a rich, indulgent treat.\n2. **Seared Scallops**: Add a nice sear to scallops before serving. Simply season, torch, and serve with your favorite sides.\n3. **Torch-Roasted Vegetables**: Add a smoky flavor to roasted vegetables like Brussels sprouts, asparagus, or bell peppers. Simply toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then torch before roasting.\n4. **Caramelized Banana Bread**: Torch bananas before adding them to your favorite banana bread recipe. The caramelized bananas will add a deep, sweet flavor.\n5. **Torch-Glazed Donuts**: Add a sticky, caramelized glaze to homemade donuts. Simply mix powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla, then torch until golden brown.\n6. **Cr\u00e8me Caramel**: Similar to cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but with a caramel sauce base instead of sugar. Torch the caramel sauce to create a crispy, caramelized crust.\n7. **Torch-Toasted Meringues**: Add a crispy, caramelized exterior to homemade meringues. Simply torch until golden brown and serve as a sweet snack or dessert topping.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started.
