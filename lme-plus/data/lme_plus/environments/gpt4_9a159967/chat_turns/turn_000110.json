However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have any information about Emma or the necklace you got for her. Could you please provide more context or details about the necklace, such as its style, design, or occasion? That way, I can offer more tailored suggestions for a complementary silver accessory.\n\nIf you're looking for general ideas, here are a few popular silver accessory options that often pair well with necklaces:\n\n1. **Silver earrings**: A simple stud or drop earring can complement a necklace nicely.\n2. **Silver bracelet**: A delicate chain or charm bracelet can add a touch of elegance.\n3. **Silver cuff**: A slender cuff can add a stylish accent to Emma's outfit.\n4. **Silver charm**: A small charm, such as a heart, star, or initial, can be a thoughtful addition to the necklace.\n\nPlease provide more information about the necklace, and I'll do my best to suggest a silver accessory that would complement it nicely.",
