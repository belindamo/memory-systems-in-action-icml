Summer travel can be challenging, but being flexible can help.\n\nRegarding Norwegian Air's financial issues, it's a valid concern. Norwegian has faced financial challenges in recent years, including a significant debt burden and increased competition. While they've taken steps to reduce costs and improve efficiency, it's essential to consider how their financial situation might impact their operations and service quality.\n\nHere are some potential implications:\n\n1. **Route network and frequency**: Norwegian might reduce or adjust their route network to focus on more profitable routes. This could lead to fewer flight options or reduced frequencies, which might affect your travel plans.\n2. **Service quality**: To cut costs, Norwegian might reduce their onboard amenities, such as food and drink options, or introduce additional fees for services like checked bags or seat selection.\n3. **Crew and staff morale**: Financial struggles can affect employee morale, which might impact the overall service quality and passenger experience.\n4. **Punctuality and reliability**: If Norwegian is forced to reduce their fleet or adjust their operations, it could lead to more delays or cancellations.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that Norwegian Air has taken steps to address their financial challenges, including:\n\n1. **Cost-cutting measures**: They've implemented various cost-saving initiatives, such as reducing staff, renegotiating contracts, and optimizing their route network.\n2. **Refurbishing and upgrading their fleet**: Norwegian has been updating their aircraft, which should improve the overall passenger experience.\n3. **Focus on profitable routes**: By concentrating on popular routes, they can optimize their operations and improve yields.\n\nTo mitigate any potential risks, consider the following:\n\n1. **Check for updates**: Keep an eye on Norwegian's website and social media for updates on their operations, route network, and service changes.\n2. **Read reviews and feedback**: Research recent passenger reviews and feedback to get a sense of their current service quality and any potential issues.\n3. **Be prepared for changes**: Be flexible and prepared for potential changes to your flight schedule or service offerings.\n4. **Consider travel insurance**: If you're concerned about potential disruptions, consider purchasing travel insurance that covers flight cancellations or changes.\n\nUltimately, Norwegian Air's financial issues shouldn't necessarily deter you from considering them as an option. However, it's crucial to be aware of the potential implications and take steps to mitigate any risks.\n\nDo you have any other concerns or questions about Norwegian Air or your travel plans?",
