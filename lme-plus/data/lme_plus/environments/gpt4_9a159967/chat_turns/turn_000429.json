Wil Wheaton's narration is indeed excellent, and his enthusiasm for the story is infectious.\n\nI'm also thrilled to hear that you've found a way to make reading a part of your daily routine. Reading before bed is a great way to wind down and relax, and it's wonderful that you've noticed an improvement in your sleep.\n\nFitting more reading into a busy schedule can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are a few tips that might be useful:\n\n1. **Audiobooks on-the-go**: As you've already discovered, audiobooks are a great way to fit more reading into your daily routine, especially during commutes, workouts, or chores.\n2. **Break it down**: If you have a busy schedule, try breaking your reading down into smaller chunks. Even 10-15 minutes of reading a day can be beneficial and help you make progress on your current book.\n3. **Make it a habit**: Try to make reading a regular part of your daily routine, just like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. Choose a specific time and place to read each day, and try to stick to it.\n4. **Take advantage of waiting time**: Whether you're waiting in line, waiting for a coffee, or waiting for someone, use that time to squeeze in a few pages of reading.\n5. **E-books and apps**: Consider using e-books or reading apps that allow you to read on your phone or tablet. This can make it easier to fit in a few pages of reading during short breaks throughout the day.\n6. **Prioritize**: Remember that reading is important for your mental and emotional well-being. Try to prioritize reading time over other activities, like social media or TV, when possible.\n7. **Get creative**: If you have a long drive or a lengthy commute, consider listening to audiobooks or podcasts that explore topics related to your favorite books or genres. This can help you stay engaged and inspired even when you're not actively reading.\n\nRemember, every little bit counts, and even small amounts of reading can have a positive impact on your mental and emotional well-being.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any other challenges you face when trying to fit more reading into your schedule?",
