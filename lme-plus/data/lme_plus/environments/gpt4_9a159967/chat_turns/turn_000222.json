This can help you identify the most affordable options for your travel dates.\n2. **Use fare comparison tools**: Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak allow you to compare prices across multiple airlines, including Southwest. You can set up price alerts to notify you when prices drop.\n3. **Consider flying into Oakland (OAK) instead**: If you're open to flying into Oakland International Airport instead of SFO, you might find cheaper flights. Oakland is about 30 miles from San Francisco, and you can take a shuttle or Uber to get to the city.\n4. **Look for Southwest Airlines sales**: Keep an eye on Southwest's website and social media for sales or promotions. They often offer discounts or special deals, especially during off-peak travel seasons.\n5. **Book in advance**: The earlier you book your flight, the better your chances of getting a good deal. Southwest Airlines typically increases prices as the flight approaches, so it's a good idea to book at least 2-3 weeks in advance.\n\nSince you mentioned you took a direct flight with Southwest from your hometown to Las Vegas, I'm assuming you know your hometown airport. If you're willing to share that information, I can provide more specific flight options and prices for your San Francisco trip.\n\nRemember to also factor in any additional costs, such as baggage fees, seat selection, or rental cars, when comparing prices.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
