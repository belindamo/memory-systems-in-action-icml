I'm glad you remembered a new wine shop nearby.\n\nFor a birthday card to go with the gift, I'd be happy to suggest some ideas:\n\n1. **Wine-themed puns**: \"Wishing you a grape birthday!\" or \"You're a-maize-ing!\"\n2. **Personalized message**: Write a heartfelt message expressing your appreciation for your neighbor's friendship and the joy they bring to your life.\n3. **Humorous quote**: \"I'm not saying you're old, but I heard wine improves with age...\" or \"Birthdays are like wine, they get better with time!\"\n4. **Simple yet sincere**: \"Happy birthday to an amazing neighbor and an even better friend!\" or \"Wishing you a birthday as special as you are!\"\n5. **Wine and friendship**: \"Here's to another year of sharing laughs, memories, and great wine together! \"\n\nYou could also consider adding a playful touch by including a wine-related illustration or a funny wine-themed cartoon on the card.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be genuine and sincere in your message. Your neighbor will appreciate the thought and effort you put into selecting a nice gift and card.\n\nHave fun shopping for the gift, and I hope your neighbor enjoys their special day!",
