I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't have any prior knowledge about your past activities or events you've attended.\n\nIf you're trying to recall when you last attended a marketing conference, you might want to check your calendar, email records, or social media posts to jog your memory. You can also try searching for conference websites or event pages to see if they have archives or records of past attendees.\n\nIf you need help with anything else, feel free to ask!",
