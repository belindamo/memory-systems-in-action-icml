  "content": "I recently attended the \"Art and Technology\" lecture series at the Science Museum on April 12th, which explored the intersection of art and tech. The speaker, Dr. Rachel Ross, discussed her latest project using AI-generated art to raise awareness about climate change. I found it fascinating and took some notes for a potential future project. Do you know of any online resources or upcoming events that might help me learn more about AI-generated art and its applications?",
