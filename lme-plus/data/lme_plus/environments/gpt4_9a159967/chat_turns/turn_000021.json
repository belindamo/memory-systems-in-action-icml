  "content": "Moroccan chicken tagine is a fantastic choice for dinner! The rich, aromatic flavors of the dish cry out for some delicious sides to complement them. Here are some traditional and tasty side dish ideas that would pair perfectly with your Moroccan chicken tagine:\n\n1. **Couscous**: This is a classic Moroccan side dish made from semolina flour. It's light, fluffy, and absorbs the flavorful broth of the tagine beautifully. You can add some saut\u00e9ed onions, garlic, and herbs to give it extra flavor.\n2. **Roasted Vegetables**: Roasted carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, and eggplant are all common vegetables used in Moroccan cuisine. Simply toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven until tender and caramelized.\n3. **Preserved Lemon and Olive Salad**: A simple salad made with preserved lemon, Kalamata olives, chopped parsley, and a drizzle of olive oil adds a nice brightness to the rich tagine.\n4. **Harissa Roasted Sweet Potatoes**: Sweet potatoes are a popular side dish in Morocco. Simply slice them, toss with olive oil, harissa, and salt, and roast in the oven until crispy.\n5. **Grilled Pita Bread**: Grilled pita bread is a great way to mop up the flavorful sauce of the tagine. Simply brush with olive oil and grill until crispy.\n6. **Chermoula Rice**: Chermoula is a Moroccan herb mixture that adds a lot of flavor to rice. Mix cooked rice with chermoula, olive oil, and lemon juice for a delicious and aromatic side dish.\n7. **Steamed Green Beans with Lemon and Garlic**: Quickly steaming green beans with some lemon juice, garlic, and salt adds a nice pop of color and freshness to the dish.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started. You can choose one or two sides to serve with your Moroccan chicken tagine, depending on your preferences and dietary needs.\n\nEnjoy your delicious and flavorful Moroccan-inspired dinner!",
