  "content": "Both \"The Royal We\" and \"The Last Romantics\" are indeed epic novels that will keep you engaged for hours. Here's some information on their page count and average reading time to help you plan:\n\n**The Royal We**\n\n* Page count: 432 pages (hardcover edition)\n* Average reading time: 12-15 hours\n\nThis novel is a sweeping romance that spans several years, so it's not a quick read. However, the writing is engaging, and the story is well-paced, making it easy to devour in a few sittings. You can expect to spend around 2-3 hours per day reading to finish it in a week.\n\n**The Last Romantics**\n\n* Page count: 352 pages (hardcover edition)\n* Average reading time: 9-12 hours\n\nWhile slightly shorter than \"The Royal We\", \"The Last Romantics\" is still a substantial novel that explores the lives of four siblings across multiple timelines. The writing is lyrical and immersive, making it easy to get lost in the story. You can expect to spend around 1.5-2 hours per day reading to finish it in 5-7 days.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and your reading speed may vary. However, both novels are engaging and well-written, making it easy to dedicate time to them.\n\nIf you're looking for a more leisurely reading experience, you could aim to read 50-75 pages per day, which would give you a comfortable 2-3 weeks to complete each novel. Alternatively, if you're like me and get sucked into epic stories, you might find yourself reading for hours on end, devouring the entire book in a few sittings!\n\nI hope this helps you plan your reading schedule!",
