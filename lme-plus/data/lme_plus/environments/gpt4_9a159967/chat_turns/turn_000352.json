  "content": "What a fantastic plan! The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are iconic NYC attractions, and taking a ferry to get there is a great way to see the city from a different perspective.\n\nTo get to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island ferry terminal from Central Park, you have a few options:\n\n**Subway:**\n\n* From Central Park, take the B or C subway train from 81st Street and Central Park West (about a 5-minute walk from the park).\n* Take the train downtown to the World Trade Center (WTC) stop.\n* From the WTC stop, follow signs to the Liberty State Park Ferry Terminal, which is a short walk away.\n\nThe subway ride should take around 20-25 minutes, and the total travel time, including walking, would be around 35-40 minutes.\n\n**Taxi:**\n\n* From Central Park, hail a taxi on the street or book one in advance.\n* The taxi ride to the Liberty State Park Ferry Terminal should take around 20-25 minutes, depending on traffic.\n* The fare will be around $25-$35, depending on traffic and tolls.\n\nConsidering the distance and traffic, I'd recommend taking the subway. It's a more affordable option, and you'll get to experience the NYC subway system, which is a quintessential part of the city's culture.\n\nHowever, if you prefer a more direct and hassle-free option, a taxi ride might be a better fit for you. Just be prepared for potential traffic delays and higher costs.\n\nRemember to plan your day according to the ferry schedule and allow enough time to get to the terminal before your departure. You can check the Statue Cruises website for ferry schedules and to book your tickets in advance.\n\nHave a great time visiting the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island!",
