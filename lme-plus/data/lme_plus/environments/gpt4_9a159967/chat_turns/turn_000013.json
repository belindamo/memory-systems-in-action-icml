The idea behind this is that companies will be incentivized to pay their employees fairly to avoid any legal penalties or financial consequences.\n\nSome countries already have laws in place that impose penalties or fines on businesses that engage in gender-based wage discrimination. For instance, in the United States, the Equal Pay Act allows for punitive damages for employers who have been found to violate the law.\n\nWhile penalties and fines can be effective in deterring businesses from engaging in gender-based wage discrimination, it is essential to note that penalties are merely a reactive response. To address this issue proactively, businesses should be encouraged to commit to fair pay practices voluntarily. These companies should develop equal pay policies, conduct regular pay audits, and establish transparency regarding pay practices, making it easier to identify when and where wage discrimination is happening. By doing so, a culture of fairness and equality can be created, which is essential to creating lasting change.",
