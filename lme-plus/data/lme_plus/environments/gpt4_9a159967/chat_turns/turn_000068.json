I'd be happy to help you navigate the rules and fees associated with traveling with a surfboard.\n\n**Surfboard Policy:**\n\nUnited Airlines considers surfboards as special items and has specific guidelines for their transportation:\n\n* **Size and weight:** Surfboards must be wrapped and packed in a protective case, and their combined weight and size must not exceed 115 inches (292 cm) and 70 pounds (32 kg).\n* **Fees:** The fee for transporting a surfboard is $200 per board, each way, plus any applicable oversized/overweight fees. This fee is in addition to any regular checked baggage fees.\n* **Handling:** Surfboards are considered fragile items and may require special handling. United Airlines might not accept liability for damage or loss, so make sure to purchase additional insurance coverage if you're concerned.\n\n**Additional Requirements:**\n\n* **Case and packing:** You'll need to provide a suitable case or wrap your surfboard in a protective material to prevent damage during transit.\n* **Declaration:** You must declare your surfboard at check-in and obtain a special handling tag.\n* **Space availability:** United Airlines may limit the number of surfboards on a flight due to space constraints, so it's essential to check with them in advance.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* **Check with United:** Confirm United Airlines' surfboard policy and fees before booking your ticket.\n* **Pack carefully:** Ensure your surfboard is properly packed and protected to minimize the risk of damage.\n* **Plan ahead:** Consider shipping your surfboard to your destination instead of checking it, as this might be a more cost-effective and convenient option.\n\nBefore bringing your surfboard on your next trip to Las Vegas, I recommend verifying United Airlines' policy and fees directly with them. You can contact their customer service or check their website for the most up-to-date information.\n\nRemember to also check with your hotel or accommodation provider to ensure they can accommodate your surfboard and any specific storage requirements.\n\nI hope this helps you prepare for your trip! If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",
