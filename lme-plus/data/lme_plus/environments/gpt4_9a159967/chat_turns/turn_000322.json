Both are great music videos that showcase the artists' unique styles.\n\n\"When the Party's Over\" is a hauntingly beautiful video that features Billie Eilish's signature dark, moody aesthetic. The song's themes of heartbreak and longing are perfectly captured in the video's eerie, slow-motion visuals.\n\n\"Blank Space\", on the other hand, is a tongue-in-cheek, darkly comedic video that pokes fun at Taylor Swift's public persona and the media's portrayal of her. The video's over-the-top, satirical take on the \"crazy girlfriend\" trope is both humorous and thought-provoking.\n\nBoth videos are excellent examples of how music videos can enhance the listening experience and provide an additional layer of storytelling.\n\nDo you have a favorite music video from Billie Eilish or Taylor Swift?",
