I recently attended the \"Women in Art\" exhibition at the Contemporary Art Museum on March 15th, which featured an impressive collection of works by female artists from around the world. The installation piece by Ana Mendieta really stuck with me. Do you have any suggestions for art books or online resources that focus on female artists or femininity in art?",
