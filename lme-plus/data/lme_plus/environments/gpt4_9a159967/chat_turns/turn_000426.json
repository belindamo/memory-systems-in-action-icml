  "content": "I'm really enjoying the audiobook so far. I like how the story is unfolding and the characters are pretty interesting. I'm about 6 hours in, and I'm excited to see how the plot develops. I'm actually surprised by how much I'm enjoying the sci-fi elements, since it's not typically a genre I read. But the way Ernest Cline weaves together the virtual reality world of OASIS with the dystopian reality of 2044 is really engaging.",
