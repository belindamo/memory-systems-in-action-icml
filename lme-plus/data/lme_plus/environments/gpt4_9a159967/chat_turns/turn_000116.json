Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation and I don't have any prior knowledge or context.\n\nSo, I'm a bit confused when you mention buying a birthday card from an accessories store on Main Street last Saturday, as I don't have any information about that store or your previous interactions.\n\nHowever, if you're saying that you already have a birthday card for Emma, that's great! You can focus on finding a nice silver accessory to go with the necklace. If you have any other questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask!",
