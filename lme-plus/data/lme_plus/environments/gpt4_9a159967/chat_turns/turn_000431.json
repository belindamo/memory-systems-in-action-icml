As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I've heard from many readers that they tend to stick with a book if they're hooked from the start. It's like there's a magic threshold around 50-100 pages where readers decide whether to commit to the story or not.\n\nIn fact, many authors and publishing professionals agree that the opening chapters of a book are crucial in grabbing the reader's attention. It's like a contract between the author and the reader, where the author promises an engaging story and the reader agrees to invest their time.\n\nIf the characters, plot, and writing style resonate with readers from the start, they're more likely to become invested in the story and care about what happens next. On the other hand, if the beginning of the book feels slow, confusing, or unengaging, readers might lose interest and move on to something else.\n\nWhat do you think makes a book hook you from the start? Is it a relatable protagonist, an intriguing plot twist, or something else entirely?\n\n(By the way, I'm curious - have you ever finished a book that didn't grab you from the start, but still ended up enjoying it in the end?)",
