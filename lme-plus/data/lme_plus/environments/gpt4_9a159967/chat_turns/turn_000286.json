  "content": "Booking a room with a theme park view at the Polynesian Village Resort sounds like a fantastic idea! Yes, the rooms with a theme park view are located in specific buildings and areas of the resort.\n\nThe Polynesian Village Resort is divided into several longhouse buildings, each with its own unique theme and charm. The rooms with a theme park view are typically located in the longhouses that face the Magic Kingdom, offering stunning views of the park, especially during the nighttime spectaculars.\n\nHere are the longhouses that typically offer theme park views:\n\n1. **Tokelau**: This longhouse is located near the resort's main lobby and offers rooms with views of the Magic Kingdom.\n2. **Rarotonga**: This longhouse is adjacent to Tokelau and also offers rooms with theme park views.\n3. **Aotearoa**: This longhouse is located near the Volcano Pool and offers rooms with views of the Magic Kingdom, as well as the resort's lush tropical gardens.\n\nWhen booking your room, you can request a theme park view by selecting the \"Theme Park View\" room category. Keep in mind that room views are subject to availability and cannot be guaranteed.\n\nHere are some tips to increase your chances of getting a room with a theme park view:\n\n* Book a room on a higher floor (4th floor or above) for better views of the Magic Kingdom.\n* Consider booking a room in Tokelau or Rarotonga, as these longhouses tend to have more rooms with theme park views.\n* If you're booking a club-level room, you may have a better chance of getting a room with a theme park view, as these rooms are often located in the most desirable areas of the resort.\n\nRemember to check the Disney website or contact Disney directly to book your room and request a theme park view.",
