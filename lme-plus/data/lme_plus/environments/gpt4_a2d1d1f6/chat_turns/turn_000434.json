  "content": "Yes, there are plans to develop electric ferries in the United States. In 2021, the Biden administration announced a $4.5 billion investment in electric vehicle infrastructure, which includes funding for electric ferries. \n\nSeveral states are already working on projects to develop electric ferries. In Washington state, the Washington State Ferries system is exploring the possibility of converting some of its existing ferries to electric power. The state of California is also investing in electric ferries as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nThere are also private companies working on developing electric ferries for use in the United States. For example, the company Golden Gate Zero Emission Marine is developing a fleet of electric ferries for use in the San Francisco Bay area, and the company All American Marine is building electric ferries for use in several states, including Washington.\n\nOverall, the trend towards developing electric ferries is growing in the United States, as part of a broader push towards sustainable transportation and reducing carbon emissions.",
