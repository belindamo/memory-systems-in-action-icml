That was the number one question we got over the past two years is should we fundraise right now? Does our cause matter as much? Will it appear tone deaf? And we said yes, and for sure it matters. But you can do that in such a way that it won\u2019t appear tone deaf. Like maybe saying, hey, we want to be around because we want to be able to provide. People need entertainment, people need art, right? What more important time is there to have art in your life than these truly difficult times? So that case is there. And that\u2019s where I think that contextualization is what made those appeals successful, rather than just saying, hey, it\u2019s a pandemic you should give to our orchestra. It\u2019s like, wait, why, do you mean? Go that level deeper and really tug on those heartstrings and unlock what it is those people have always kind of cared about you. But yeah, I can\u2019t think of another cause that matters more in darker times than those performing arts folks. So my heart goes out to them. And I hope that so many of them will be able to stick around because we need you.\n\n[00:15:19.980] \u2013 Boris\nAbsolutely. I\u2019m a fan, of course, of the arts. But on Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, the arts might not be at the bottom, but they\u2019re on there. They\u2019re self actualization and they are education. They are force for good. I don\u2019t have to sell people, especially those folks in the arts. But I found it honestly a little disheartening how a lot of arts organizations felt about themselves and their work.\n\n[00:15:47.790] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nThat\u2019s the thing.\n\n[00:15:49.150] \u2013 Boris\nThey didn\u2019t know how to speak to their existing base and to try to grow their base during this time of upheaval.\n\n[00:15:58.530] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nThat\u2019s the heartbreaking thing for me. You mentioned the webinar series. We were doing a webinar, probably March or April 2020. One of the attendees chatted in like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re just a library foundation. We\u2019re not saving lives.\u201d And I kind of grabbed the microphone from my guest and I said, \u201cNo, my gosh, people need the arts.\u201d They need books, right? I told the story of my kids. We love to go to the library every Saturday morning. It\u2019s one of their favorite activities. We want that to be there when we can finally get back out of the house in a safe way. That\u2019s the situation we find ourselves back in. So that to me is, don\u2019t sell yourself short, right? Because there will be another crisis, like you said, Boris, and you will not only matter, but you may even be more critical, especially to the people that already care and hold that cause near and dear to your heart. So I hope people find this encouraging. That\u2019s kind of how I think you mean it, too. And I definitely mean it because there will be something else that happens.\n\n[00:17:00.710] \u2013 Boris\nSo we teased since the beginning of the episode, we teased that we\u2019ve got data that we\u2019ve got data on what\u2019s going on, what was working, what wasn\u2019t working. And I personally want to hear it because I haven\u2019t gotten it yet. And I\u2019ve read some of the reports out there. But talk to me, Steven. What happened during the pandemic, what\u2019s going on now and what\u2019s not working?\n\n[00:17:24.940] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nWell, aside from asking and not putting ourselves on the sidelines, that was definitely a big one. But we also looked at those folks that were doing well and maybe even doing better than in past years. A couple of things stood out. The prevalence of phone calls. So we\u2019re a donor database so we can see what kind of interactions people are making with their donors and in what format. And we saw phone calls not only shoot up, probably because we couldn\u2019t do events and maybe even direct mail was harder, but not only were more phone calls being made to supporters, but we could really see that they were moving the needle on things like revenue and donor retention and things like that.\n\n[00:18:09.700] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAnd I think it\u2019s because especially in 2020, we were isolated. We were social distanced. That phone call from a nonprofit to a supporter, that may have been one of the only few personal interactions that they encountered and probably the only one from a brand, right? From someone who wasn\u2019t a friend or a family member or a co-worker. That not only made a big difference in 2020, but again, it continued to have efficacy through 2021. And I think for all the reasons I just said, but also because it\u2019s so surprising to get a phone call that\u2019s a pure thank you or is showing curiosity about why you support. And I sound kind of cynical and I hate to be surprised, but that\u2019s kind of rare, right? I can count on maybe one hand how many times that\u2019s happened to me from a nonprofit or anything that I\u2019ve supported.\n\n[00:19:04.490] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nPersonal emails, same thing. So there\u2019s mass emails where you set up an email blast to all the people in your database, all 2000 of them or whatever. We also saw people reaching out individually, you know, me literally opening up Gmail, writing an email to Boris, like, \u201cHey, Boris, thanks for having me on the show. You\u2019re awesome. Let\u2019s stay in touch.\u201d The same thing not only increased, but also did have an effect on that year over year kind of revenue increases. So the last two years were this kind of re-emergence, at least from our view, of truly personal outreach. And again, what better time? And maybe that\u2019s what spurred it on, because we couldn\u2019t do things like events or in-person interactions or things like that. So that was the only alternative. But I think it opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes to like, wow, maybe we should make this a normal thing that we do during any kind of climate or crisis, if there is one, because people give to people, right? And fundraising is very relationship driven, you know, this.\n\n[00:20:10.550] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nBut I feel like because of all this technology available to us, maybe those kind of analog or one to one or old school formats or mediums have kind of gone by the wayside but did come back because of pure necessity, right? Because that\u2019s all there was out there. And I hope that that sticks around because there\u2019s always been evidence that those things are impactful. But we really saw those things be even more impactful over the last two years. So another thing that I\u2019ve been shouting from the rooftop: reach out to people, because it is very personal.\n\n[00:20:45.410] \u2013 Boris\nSo there was a lot of great stuff in there that I want to touch on and really highlight. And I\u2019m really glad that you said people give to people because earlier you had said nonprofits reaching out to individuals. It\u2019s not nonprofits that are on the phone. You\u2019re a person at your nonprofit. And you said how many brands do that. I don\u2019t remember any time. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m wearing a Banana Republic sweater; Banana Republic has never called me and asked, \u201cHey, Boris, how are you doing with this pandemic or with this crisis in Ukraine?\n\n[00:21:19.560] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nRight. It would be weird.\n\n[00:21:21.260] \u2013 Boris\nYeah, exactly. It would be weird. It might be interesting, but they don\u2019t care. They care. \u201cHey, Boris, here\u2019s a coupon, maybe come back and spend some more money.\u201d\n\n[00:21:30.560] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nGet the matching tie.\n\n[00:21:31.940] \u2013 Boris\nYeah, exactly.\n\n[00:21:33.240] \u2013 Boris\nWhereas a nonprofit does care, hopefully does care about its constituents, about its supporters, certainly about its clients, has things to say and has questions to ask. You\u2019ve got to ask, you\u2019ve got to be curious. Not just, \u201cHey, why do you support us,\u201d but also \u201chow are you doing?\u201d Reinforce that connection.\n\n[00:21:53.100] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAnd I would imagine that was the question behind a lot of that outreach, either by phone or by email. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, Boris, you\u2019re a monthly donor. We want to say thanks, but also wanted to say, are you okay? This is a tough time. We just want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d And you\u2019re right. Like buying a shirt is not personal, but donating to a cancer charity because your grandmother passed away from that form of cancer, that\u2019s very personal. So to be able to reach back out, acknowledge it, yeah, but learn that information. I love the word you used, showing curiosity. I think that\u2019s something that we definitely suffer from as a fundraising sector is, why do these people support us? And there is most often than not a story behind that, maybe not as much as during times of crisis where you\u2019re kind of driven by that urgent need and not necessarily care about that cause. And I know you and Tim talked about that, and that kind of giving definitely does happen. But a lot of the gifts, there\u2019s probably a very personal reason behind it. If that can be the conversation starter, that\u2019s a pretty darn powerful conversation.\n\n[00:23:02.030] \u2013 Boris\nSo I do want to ask, though, you mentioned in your CRM you might have 2000 folks on your list. I don\u2019t know which organization has the bandwidth to personally call 2000 people. How do you navigate that? It seems almost cold to prioritize certain people over others. Is there a strategy that you recommend that you\u2019ve seen work or think is a good way to go?\n\n[00:23:28.410] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nYeah, I\u2019m glad you asked, because it\u2019s hard. And there\u2019s tons of people like me who are saying, like, you\u2019re not doing enough, and here are 20 things you should be doing. And I get it. It\u2019s hard. And if you\u2019ve got that big data set, I think there are a couple of low hanging fruit. I mentioned first-time donors. That\u2019s one where we have the data and we\u2019ll share and we can link it in the show notes, I suppose. But the phone calls really work. They really do seem to have an effect on not just retention rates, but the speed in which you received a second gift. That window really shortens if they\u2019ve been called and they tend to give more. And I think it comes down again to curiosity, right? So you call them. \u201cHey, Boris, thanks so much for your first gift. Happy to have you join our community of donors. By the way, why did you give? What spurred that gift today?\u201d And if you can learn or get that story, that will help you subsequently communicate to them, right? And sort of contextualize that reason for giving.\n\n[00:24:30.620] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nSo I love first-time donors as a priority. If you get a phone number, and you\u2019re not always going to have a phone number and I don\u2019t recommend you go out and try to find their phone number, like call their employer, that would be a little weird. But if you got a first-time gift and they gave you a phone number, if maybe it was not required on the form or they offered it up somehow, that\u2019s almost an invitation. So that\u2019s probably going to take that list of 2000 down to under ten because it may not happen very often. And maybe that\u2019s doable in an hour or so on a Friday afternoon, call those people, say thanks, welcome them, maybe find out a little bit about that motivation. Monthly donors, that\u2019s one that maybe flies a little under the radar because it\u2019s happening automatically. Maybe the dollar amounts are small; $5 a month doesn\u2019t seem like that much. Although over the lifetime, that\u2019s a pretty significant lifetime value. \u201cHey, Boris, thanks for being a monthly donor. You\u2019re keeping the lights on. Just want to say thanks, check in with you, make sure you\u2019re doing okay. How\u2019s the family?\u201d Whatever it is, that kind of outreach.\n\n[00:25:37.550] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nWhat are those segments? Get out the whiteboard and write down like, who are those people? First-time donors, monthly donors, lapsed donors. People who have been giving for a long time. Everybody will probably have those. But depending on your cause type, volunteers, alumni, former service recipients, people who have adopted animals from us, who are those types of people? And then you can kind of decide, okay, what do we want to say to these people? Can we automate some of these things? Should we ask for different things from these people? Go through that exercise and identify it.",
