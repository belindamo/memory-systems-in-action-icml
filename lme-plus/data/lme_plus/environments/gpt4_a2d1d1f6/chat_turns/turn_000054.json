  "content": "Disputes often arise in commercial contracts, and they can be costly and time-consuming. Some common issues include breaches of contract, disagreements over scope of work, and disputes over payments. These disputes can be avoided by having a well-drafted commercial contract that clearly outlines the obligations of each party, the scope of work, and the payment terms. It is essential to seek the advice of a commercial contract lawyer who can ensure that the contract is legally binding and enforceable, and can help resolve disputes should they arise.",
