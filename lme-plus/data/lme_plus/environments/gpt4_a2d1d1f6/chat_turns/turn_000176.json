  "content": "Based on the additional requirement of having a cabin tall enough for passengers to stand up, we can increase the height of the cabin. Let's assume a cabin height of 1.5 meters. This would give us the following dimensions:\n\n* Length: 8.5 meters\n* Wingspan: 12 meters\n* Height: 3.5 meters\n\nUsing the same formulas and assumptions as before, the estimated MTOW for Pig with the updated dimensions and requirements is:\n\n* Empty weight: 850 kg\n* Payload weight: 570 kg (5 passengers + baggage)\n* Fuel weight (with reserves): 205 kg\n* Battery weight: 120 kg\n* Fuel cell weight: 100 kg\n* Structure weight: 680 kg\n* Systems weight: 290 kg\n* Avionics weight: 80 kg\n* Other equipment weight: 75 kg\n* MTOW: 2970 kg\n\nNote that the updated cabin height requirement and increased dimensions have added weight to the structure and increased the overall MTOW.",
