  "content": "The stream I'm planning to fish at is called Oak Creek, and it's about an hour's drive from my location. The weather's been pretty dry lately due to the drought, so I'm not sure about the water flow. I've fished for trout before, but not at Oak Creek specifically. I'm mainly looking for some general advice on where to start and what types of lures or flies to use.",
