Remember to be patient and keep an eye out for sales, as they can pop up unexpectedly. Signing up for newsletters is a great way to stay informed, and you might even get exclusive access to early sales or promotions.\n\nIf you're looking for bundle deals, you might want to check out online retailers that offer bundles specifically for Gloomhaven and Pandemic Legacy. Some retailers might offer a discount when you buy both games together, or they might throw in some extras like expansions or accessories.\n\nAlso, don't forget to check out the official websites of the game publishers, Cephalofair Games (Gloomhaven) and Z-Man Games (Pandemic Legacy), as they might have their own sales or promotions going on.\n\nGood luck in your search, and I hope you find an amazing deal on one or both of these games!",
