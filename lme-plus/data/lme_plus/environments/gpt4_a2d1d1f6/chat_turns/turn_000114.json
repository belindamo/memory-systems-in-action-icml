Watch TV or movies: If your treadmill is equipped with a tablet holder, put it to use and watch your favorite show or movie. This can help pass the time and keep you entertained.\n\n2. Listen to audiobooks or podcasts: Download your favorite audiobook or podcast and listen to it during your treadmill workout. This is a great way to pass the time and learn something new.\n\n3. Play games: Challenge yourself by creating games while on the treadmill. For example, try to run a certain distance and then walk for a minute, and repeat.\n\n4. Use visualization techniques: Visualize running in your favorite place or location. A beach, a forest or a city, this will keep your mind engaged and entertained.\n\n5. Take breaks: Give yourself short breaks during your long treadmill runs, allowing yourself to recover and build motivation for the next segment of the workout.\n\n6. Alternating Routes: If it\u2019s possible, switch up your route on the treadmill to create a welcome break and reduce monotony.\n\nRemember, the key is to find an activity that engages your mind and keeps you entertained, while still paying attention to your form and movements.",
