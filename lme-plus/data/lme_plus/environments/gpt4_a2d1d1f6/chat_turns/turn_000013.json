  "content": "Sure, I can help you design a UX flow for your website with these features. Here's one possible way to approach it:\n\n1. Landing page: The landing page should have an overview of the programs available, including a brief description of each program and its benefits. Each program should have a \"Learn More\" button that takes the user to the program landing page.\n2. Program landing page: The program landing page should have more detailed information about the program, including its duration, schedule, and pricing. The user should be able to apply for the program by clicking on a \"Apply Now\" button. If the user is not a paid subscriber, they should be prompted to subscribe before applying.\n3. Application form: The application form should capture basic information about the user, such as name, email address, and phone number. The user should also be asked to provide some background information, such as their level of experience with trading and investing. The user should be able to submit the application form once they have filled in all the required fields.\n4. Program progress page: Once the user has been accepted into the program, they should be redirected to a program progress page. This page should display their progress in the program, including the topics covered and the assignments completed. The user should be able to see their progress in real-time, and also be able to download any materials they need.\n5. Recorded content: The program progress page should also have links to the recorded content for each class. The user should be able to access the recordings from the program progress page, and should also be able to download them for offline viewing.\n6. Live class: If the user is attending a live class, they should be able to join the class from the program progress page. The user should be able to see the class schedule, and should also be able to set reminders for upcoming classes.\n7. Cohort leaderboard: The program progress page should also have a cohort leaderboard that displays the rankings of all the participants in the program. The leaderboard should be updated in real-time, and should show the user's current ranking. The leaderboard should also show the rankings of the top performers, and should highlight any achievements or milestones they have reached.\n\nI hope this UX flow helps you design a successful website for your trading and investing programs.
