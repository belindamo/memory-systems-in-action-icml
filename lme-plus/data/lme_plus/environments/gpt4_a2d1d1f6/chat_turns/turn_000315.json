  "content": "It seems there is some confusion here. If you have 20 assets and 3 scenarios (portfolios), you will not have 60 calculations. Instead, you will have a total of 20 weights for each portfolio, resulting in a total of 3 x 20 = 60 weights.\n\nHowever, if you are referring to the number of calculations required to find the optimal weights for each portfolio, the number of calculations will depend on the method or optimization technique used. The process of finding the optimal weights for a portfolio can be quite complex, particularly when dealing with a large number of assets, and may involve using optimization algorithms, risk metrics, and historical data.",
