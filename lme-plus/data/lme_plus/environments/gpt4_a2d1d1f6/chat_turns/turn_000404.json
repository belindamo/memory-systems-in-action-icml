The Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 is a great choice for street photography.\n\nNow, let's dive into some tips for editing your street photography shots in Lightroom:\n\n1. **Start with the basics**: Begin by adjusting the exposure, contrast, and white balance to get a good foundation for your edit. Street photography often involves capturing high-contrast scenes, so be prepared to make adjustments to balance the tones.\n2. **Tone down the highlights**: Street photography often involves capturing harsh, mid-day light. To recover blown-out highlights, use the \"Highlights\" slider in the Develop module to bring back detail in the brightest areas.\n3. **Add grit and texture**: Street photography is all about capturing the raw, unpolished essence of urban life. Add a bit of grain or texture to your image to give it a more authentic feel. You can use the \"Grain\" tool in the Effects panel or experiment with third-party presets.\n4. **Local adjustments are key**: Street scenes often feature a mix of bright and dark areas. Use the Adjustment Brush or Gradient Filter to make local adjustments to exposure, contrast, and color to draw attention to specific parts of the image.\n5. **Color grading**: Street photography often benefits from a gritty, muted color palette. Experiment with different color grading techniques, such as desaturating certain colors or adding a warm tone to create a sense of nostalgia.\n6. **Play with contrast**: Contrast is crucial in street photography. Use the \"Contrast\" slider to add depth and dimensionality to your image. You can also use the \"Tone Curve\" to create a more nuanced contrast curve.\n7. **Crop and straighten**: Street photography often involves capturing scenes in a hurry. Don't be afraid to crop your image to remove distractions or straighten the horizon to create a more dynamic composition.\n8. **Preserve the moment**: Street photography is all about capturing the decisive moment. Avoid over-editing, as this can detract from the authenticity of the image. Instead, focus on enhancing the mood and atmosphere of the scene.\n9. **Experiment with black and white**: Street photography often looks great in black and white. Try converting your image to monochrome using the \"Black & White\" panel or experimenting with different tone curves to create a unique look.\n10. **Take breaks and revisit**: Editing can be a iterative process. Take breaks from your image and revisit it later with fresh eyes to ensure you're not over-editing or missing important details.\n\nRemember, the key to great street photography editing is to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the scene without over-processing the image. Keep it real, keep it gritty, and keep it authentic!\n\nI hope these tips help you edit your street photography shots in Lightroom. Happy editing!",
