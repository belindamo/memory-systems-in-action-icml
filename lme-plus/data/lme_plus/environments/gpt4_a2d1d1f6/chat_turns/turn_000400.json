  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future of architectural design or the preferences of individuals. However, I can provide some insight based on current trends and historical patterns. \n\nClassic styles, such as Italian Renaissance architecture, have been popular for centuries and have endured to this day. They represent a timeless elegance and sophistication that many people find appealing. However, as society and technology continue to evolve, there has been a growing interest in more minimalistic and functional designs, such as the Aria Resort.\n\nIt is possible that classic styles will continue to be popular in certain contexts, such as luxury hotels, high-end retail stores, and historic landmarks, while more avant-garde designs will become more prevalent in other settings, such as commercial buildings, apartment complexes, and public spaces.\n\nUltimately, individual taste and personal preferences will continue to drive architectural design trends, and there will likely always be a place for both classic and modern styles depending on the needs and desires of the architectural clients and the communities they serve.",
