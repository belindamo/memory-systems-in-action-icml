However, I can provide you the titles of some of the most popular tracks from The Used's latest album, \"Heartwork,\" based on their critical and commercial success. \n\n- \"Blow Me\" \n- \"Bloody Nose\" \n- \"Wow, I Hate This Song\" \n- \"The Lighthouse\" \n- \"Obvious Blas\u00e9\" \n\nBut these are just a few tracks from the album, and I can't determine which one is the best. It's best to listen to the entire album and decide which track resonates with you the most.",
