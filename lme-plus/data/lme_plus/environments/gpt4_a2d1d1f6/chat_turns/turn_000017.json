Here are some tables that could be included:\n\n1. User table: This table would store information about each user who creates an account on the website. It could include fields like name, email address, password hash, and subscription status. Each user would be assigned a unique ID to facilitate data retrieval and association with other tables.\n2. Program table: This table would store information about each program offered on the website, including its title, description, duration, and price. Each program would be assigned a unique ID to facilitate data retrieval and association with other tables.\n3. Enrollment table: This table would store information about each user's enrollment in a program, including the program ID, the user ID, the enrollment date, and the enrollment status (e.g., enrolled, completed, dropped). This table would allow the website to keep track of which users are enrolled in which programs and when.\n4. Progress table: This table would store information about each user's progress in a program, including the program ID, the user ID, the class ID, and the progress status (e.g., completed, in progress, not started). This table would allow the website to keep track of which classes each user has completed and how far along they are in the program.\n5. Class table: This table would store information about each class in a program, including the class title, description, date and time, and recorded content. Each class would be assigned a unique ID to facilitate data retrieval and association with other tables.\n6. Assignment table: This table would store information about each assignment in a program, including the assignment title, description, due date, and submission status. Each assignment would be assigned a unique ID to facilitate data retrieval and association with other tables.\n7. Cohort leaderboard table: This table would store information about each user's performance in a program, including their total points, rank, and badges earned. Each user's performance data would be associated with the program ID and the user ID.\n\nThese tables could be connected using foreign keys to establish relationships between the tables. For example, the enrollment table would have foreign keys to the user and program tables to associate each enrollment with a specific user and program. Similarly, the progress table would have foreign keys to the user, program, and class tables to associate each user's progress with a specific program and class.\n\nThe specific database architecture and schema would depend on the website's specific requirements and technology stack. However, these tables should provide a starting point for building a database for a website that offers cohort-based programs on trading and investing.",
