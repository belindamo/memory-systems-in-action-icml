Here are some suggestions:\n\n**What to Wear:**\n\n1. **Comfortable Clothing**: Wear loose, comfortable clothing that allows for a full range of motion. Avoid anything too tight or constricting.\n2. **Yoga Pants or Leggings**: Yoga pants or leggings are popular choices for yoga class. Look for ones with a four-way stretch for maximum flexibility.\n3. **Moisture-Wicking Tops**: Choose tops that are breathable, moisture-wicking, and quick-drying. Avoid cotton as it can become heavy and uncomfortable when sweaty.\n4. **Layer Up**: Wear layers that can be easily removed as you warm up. A lightweight tank top or t-shirt is a great option.\n5. **No Shoes**: Yoga is typically practiced barefoot, so leave your shoes at the door.\n\n**What to Bring:**\n\n1. **Yoga Mat**: Invest in a good-quality yoga mat that provides grip and support.
