  "content": "Based on our previous conversation, can you help me write the content for section 6 about Services Offered by a Commercial Contract Lawyer\nOverview of the services provided by a commercial contract lawyer\nExplanation of how these services can benefit you\n\nFor your reference, here is the old content to rewrite:\nHow can a Construction Lawyer help with Commercial Contracts?\n1. Legal Advice\nYour building lawyer knows every aspect of a commercial contract that can either make or break your building project. Getting a lawyer involved earlier can guarantee you a seamless execution of the agreements in the contract. It will also less likely get you in a legal dispute.\n2. Contract Drafting\nSome disputes root from vague and badly written contracts. So it is important that everything written in your commercial contracts is clear. With the help of your building lawyer, any detail that needs to be removed, revised or added can easily be pointed out by your lawyer.\n3. Contract Review\nThere are a lot of things to look out for when reviewing a contract. Especially if it is a building contract. A building and construction lawyer can review your contract and point out any information that may seem vague or statements that can get you in trouble.\n\nAside from vague statements and details, it is also important to note that contract review includes checking if the contract is in written form, if all details are correct, if it includes dispute resolutions, and other important agreements to make sure the building process flows smoothly.\n\nPlease adjust the word count to 100 words. I intend to give you the next section so do not give a summary or conclusion yet.\nPlease respond to me in Australian English.",
