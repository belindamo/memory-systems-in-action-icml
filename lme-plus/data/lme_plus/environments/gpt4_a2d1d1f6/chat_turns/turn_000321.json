Here are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. **Turn off the water supply**: Locate the shut-off valves under the sink and turn them clockwise to shut off the water supply to the faucet.\n2. **Disassemble the faucet**: You'll need to remove the handle or knob on top of the faucet. This will expose the stem and O-ring or gasket.\n3. **Identify the source of the leak**: Look for signs of moisture or water droplets to determine where the leak is coming from. Common areas include the O-ring, gasket, or worn-out valve seats.\n4. **Replace the worn-out parts**: Once you've identified the source of the leak, replace the worn-out parts with new ones. You can find replacement parts at a hardware store or home improvement store.\n5. **Reassemble the faucet**: Put everything back together in the reverse order that you disassembled it. Make sure to tighten all parts securely.\n6. **Turn on the water supply**: Turn the shut-off valves counterclockwise to restore water supply to the faucet.\n7. **Test the faucet**: Turn on the faucet and check if the leak is fixed.\n\n**Tips and precautions:**\n\n* Take your time and be patient when fixing the faucet.
