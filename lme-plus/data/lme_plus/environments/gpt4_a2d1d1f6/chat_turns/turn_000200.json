  "content": "Roasted Asparagus with Parmesan is a fantastic side dish that will complement your Spaghetti Carbonara perfectly. And I love your choice of using avocado oil! The nutty flavor of avocado oil will indeed pair beautifully with the earthy flavor of the asparagus, creating a harmonious balance of flavors.\n\nThe Parmesan cheese will add a nice salty kick, as you mentioned, and its creamy texture will also help to balance out the dish. The combination of the crispy, caramelized asparagus, the nutty avocado oil, and the salty Parmesan cheese will create a delightful flavor profile that will cut through the richness of the creamy pasta.\n\nAvocado oil is a great choice for roasting vegetables because of its high smoke point, which means it can handle high heat without breaking down or becoming bitter. This will help to bring out the natural sweetness of the asparagus and add a depth of flavor to the dish.\n\nRemember to toss the asparagus with the avocado oil, salt, and pepper before roasting to ensure they're evenly coated. You can also add some minced garlic or lemon zest to the asparagus for extra flavor. And don't forget to sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the asparagus as soon as it comes out of the oven, so it can melt slightly and add that creamy, salty element to the dish.\n\nI think you've made an excellent choice, and I'm confident that your Roasted Asparagus with Parmesan will be a delicious and well-balanced side dish to serve alongside your Spaghetti Carbonara. Buon appetito!",
