      "content": "With a standard drywall ceiling, you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to recessed lighting options. Given your desire for a combination of task and ambient lighting, I'll suggest some solutions that can help you achieve that.\n\n**Recessed Lighting Options:**\n\n1. **Halo RL460**: A popular, affordable option with a wide range of trim styles and finishes. You can use the adjustable trim to direct the light where you need it, making it suitable for task lighting. For ambient lighting, you can use a lower wattage bulb or install multiple fixtures to create a more even distribution of light.\n2. **Eaton Halo RL560**: A mid-range option with a sleek design and adjustable trim. This fixture is similar to the RL460 but has a more modern aesthetic. It's a great choice if you want a more contemporary look.\n3. **Juniper BR30**: A high-end option with a focus on design and performance. These fixtures have a sleek, minimalist design and are available in various trim styles. They're ideal for creating a more dramatic, layered lighting effect.\n\n**Dimmer Switches:**\n\nFor dimmer switches, I recommend considering smart dimmers that can be controlled wirelessly or through an app. This will give you more flexibility and convenience. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Lutron Caseta**: A high-end smart dimmer switch with advanced features like wireless control, scheduling, and smart home integration. It's a great choice if you want to integrate your lighting with other smart devices.\n2. **Leviton Decora Smart**: A mid-range smart dimmer switch with Wi-Fi connectivity and app control. It's a more affordable option with a wide range of features, including scheduling and voice control through Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.\n3. **Belkin WeMo Dimmer**: An affordable smart dimmer switch with Wi-Fi connectivity and app control. It's a great option if you want a simple, easy-to-use smart dimmer without breaking the bank.\n\n**Layout and Installation:**\n\nTo achieve a combination of task and ambient lighting, consider the following layout:\n\n* Install 2-3 recessed fixtures in a triangular pattern, about 3-4 feet off the walls, to create a general ambient lighting effect.\n* Add 1-2 fixtures above seating areas or task zones (e.g., a reading nook or a desk) to provide focused task lighting.\n* Use a dimmer switch to control the fixtures, allowing you to adjust the brightness to your liking.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Use bulbs with a color temperature around 2700K-3000K for a warm, cozy ambiance.\n* Consider using LED bulbs, which are energy-efficient and last longer than traditional incandescent bulbs.\n* Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation, and consider hiring a licensed electrician if you're not comfortable with the installation process.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your recessed lighting project! If you have any further questions or need more specific guidance, feel free to ask."
