Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Use Eco-Friendly Display Materials**: Opt for display materials that are sustainable, recycled, or biodegradable. Consider using reclaimed wood, bamboo, or recycled paper products for your shelves, risers, or signage.\n2. **Highlight Sustainable Ingredients**: Emphasize the eco-friendly ingredients used in your candles, such as soy wax, beeswax, or essential oils. Create a sign or label that lists the sustainable ingredients and their benefits.\n3. **Showcase the Zero-Waste Process**: If you have a zero-waste policy or minimize waste in your production process, showcase this in your display. You could have a small area dedicated to demonstrating your waste-reduction methods or display a \"waste-not\" jar filled with recycled materials.\n4. **Incorporate Natural Elements**: Bring the outdoors in by incorporating natural elements like potted plants, branches, or stones into your display. This will help create a connection between your eco-friendly candles and the natural world.\n5. **Use Reusable or Biodegradable Packaging**: Display your candles in reusable or biodegradable packaging, such as cloth bags, paper wraps, or recycled glass containers. This will show customers that you're committed to sustainability beyond just the candle itself.\n6. **Create a \"Green\" Backdrop**: Design a backdrop for your display using recycled materials like old pallets, cardboard, or fabric scraps. You could also use a living wall or a green screen with plants to create a natural, earthy feel.\n7. **Educational Signage**: Provide educational signs or flyers that explain the environmental benefits of your candles, such as reducing carbon footprint, using renewable resources, or promoting sustainable practices.\n8. **Partner with Local Eco-Friendly Businesses**: Collaborate with other local businesses that share your eco-friendly values. You could co-promote each other's products or services, creating a mini-ecosystem of sustainable vendors at the festival.\n9. **Offer a \"Refill and Reuse\" Program**: Consider offering a refill program for your candles, where customers can bring back their empty containers and exchange them for a discounted refill. This promotes reuse and reduces waste.\n10. **Incorporate Earthy Colors and Textures**: Use earthy colors, textures, and patterns in your display to evoke a sense of naturalness and connection to the environment. Think earthy tones, natural fibers, and organic shapes.\n\nBy incorporating these eco-friendly elements into your display, you'll not only align with the Earth Day Festival's theme but also appeal to customers who value sustainability and environmentally responsible practices. Good luck with your event!"
