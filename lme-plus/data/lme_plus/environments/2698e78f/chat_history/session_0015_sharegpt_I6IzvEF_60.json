It is fortunately true that after an extremely violent first half of the 20th century, the second half has seen a steady decrease in war violence (https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace). Tragically, however, even today war is raging in several parts of the world very much including in Europe since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \n\nEven after a war has ended it continues to make victims. Most of the victims are due to the extra mortality caused by diseases and reduced life expectancy from economic hardship and the destruction of infrastructure. However, a particularly nasty heritage of war is the large number of mines and unexploded ordonnance. They can continue to make victims long after the war has finished. E.g. more than a century after WOI the enormous amount of unexploded ordonnance (including grenades with chemical weapons) in the \u201cred zone\u201d of the western front, continues to make victims, as farmers continue to plow up rusty grenades. People, often playing children, are often maimed for life if they hit on a hidden mine. Therefore, the risk posed by unexploded mines can make large land areas off limits. In addition to the terrible human tragedies and the burden on usually already overburdened medical infrastructure, the denial of land that could be used for habitation, agriculture, or industry has large economic consequences. Thus, despite the risk and the high cost involved, mine and explosive disposal is one of the first priorities after a war. \n\nA particularly difficult problem in demining and explosive disposal is finding explosives that have buried themselves underground. This can easily happen due to the shock of impact in soft soil, other explosives piling dirt or debris on top, or simply bomb craters being filled with soil to repair damage to the land after the conflict. Randomly digging for ordonnance in the deep soil is both destructive and prohibitively expensive. Moreover, even when digging is already necessary e.g. for the constructions of roads or buildings, or in deep plowing, accidentally finding ordonnance is not only risky, but also expensive as all activities have to be stopped to investigate, and dispose of the ordonnance. Thus, there is a considerable incentive to find bombs in the subsurface without digging. \n\nThe assignment is based on data of a drone equipped with a magnetic field sensor to detect ordonnance in the deep subsurface. Magnetic sensors measure static or oscillating magnetic fields in units of fractions of a Tesla (T) . The magnetic field, traditionally denoted B is a vector quantity. However, one often only measures only one component, (including for the datasets provided) i.e. a size and a sign. \n\nThe simplest magnetic sensors work by measuring the change in the local magnetic field of the earth caused by a substantial amount of ferro-magnetic material such as the steel housing of a grenade. Since the earth magnetic field is much stronger (about 5\u00b5T) than the one produced by the material but essentially constant on the scale of a kilometer (but not on the scale of the earth!), one measures, in fact, a difference signal between two magnetometers separated by a meter or so. Since the magnetic field difference scales linearly with the distance (to first order), one is effectively measuring the gradient of the magnetic field. Alternatively, the sensor is connected to a probe that produces a changing magnetic field itself, oscillating with a frequency of the order of 10kHz. This is the method used by handheld metal detectors. A changing magnetic field will induce oscillating currents in metallic (i.e. conducting) objects which in turn create an oscillating magnetic field which can be easily separated from the earth magnetic field and can be measured. This is the method used with handheld metal detectors. The advantage of this method is that it picks up other metals than iron. It is also more sensitive to the depth of the material. This allows for a better estimate of the depth of the material (especially if one also has information on the conductivity of the soil), but it can also mean that one misses objects that are buried too deep underground. \n\nThe data for the assignment has magnetic field measurements at different locations from a drone flying over a field following a scanning pattern. There is also data were bombs were actually dug out of the ground after drone data suggested there was something there. \n\n\u2003\nAssignment Part 1.\n \nFor this part of the assignment we only need the magnetic field data of field 9641-20220308-F1. \nThe data consists of an x coordinate (from west to east) and a y coordinate (from south to north) in meter, and a magnetic field component in nano-Tesla on a roughly 4 sided field.\n\nX [m] Y [m] Wert [nT]\n-0.463 22.455 -31.270\n-0.463 22.523 -32.160\n-0.462 22.591 -31.510\n-0.461 22.658 -29.810\n-0.460 22.726 -21.040\n-0.459 22.794

      "content": "The given text explains the use of magnetic field sensors on a drone to detect unexploded ordnance buried in the deep subsurface.\n\nPros of using magnetic field sensors:\n\n1. Non-destructive method: Using magnetic field sensors on a drone to detect ordnance buried underground is a non-destructive method, which means it does not cause any damage to the surrounding area, unlike digging or excavating.\n2. Efficient: The use of magnetic field sensors on a drone is an efficient method of detecting ordnance in the subsurface. It covers a larger area in a shorter amount of time as compared to manual methods.\n3. Detects multiple metals: The handheld metal detectors which use changing magnetic fields can detect multiple metals, which is an added advantage.\n4. Better estimate of depth: The handheld metal detectors are more sensitive to the depth of the material, which allows for a better estimate of the depth of the material, especially if one also has information on the conductivity of the soil.\n\nCons of using magnetic field sensors:\n\n1. May miss deeply buried objects: The handheld metal detectors are more sensitive to the depth of the material, but it can also mean that one misses objects that are buried too deep underground.\n2. Cost: The use of magnetic field sensors on a drone may involve high initial costs, including the cost of the drone, the sensors, and the software required to process the data collected.\n3. Interference: Magnetic field sensors may be subject to interference from other magnetic sources in the vicinity, which can reduce the accuracy of the readings obtained.\n4. Limited to detecting magnetic materials: The simplest magnetic sensors work by measuring the change in the local magnetic field of the earth caused by a substantial amount of ferro-magnetic material such as the steel housing of a grenade. Thus, they are limited to detecting magnetic materials and may miss other types of ordnance."
