Are there any deadlines or tasks that are causing you the most stress or anxiety?\n\nLastly, what did you learn from your session with Dr. Smith about setting healthy boundaries?

      "content": "I completely understand. A structured schedule might not be the best fit for everyone. Let's focus on creating a more flexible plan to help you prioritize your tasks and set boundaries.\n\n**Prioritization Framework:**\n\n1. **Must-Dos:** Identify your top 3-5 tasks that need to be done daily or weekly. These are non-negotiable tasks that impact your work, relationships, or well-being. Examples: meeting deadlines, responding to urgent emails, exercising, or spending quality time with loved ones.\n2. **Should-Dos:** List tasks that are important but can be flexible. These might include tasks that bring you joy, help you grow, or maintain relationships. Examples: reading, learning a new skill, or socializing with friends.\n3. **Nice-To-Dos:** Identify tasks that are not essential but can be done if time allows. These might include tasks that bring you relaxation or entertainment. Examples: watching TV, playing video games, or browsing social media.\n\n**Boundary-Setting Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use your Must-Dos as a filter:** When someone requests your time or energy, ask yourself if it aligns with your Must-Dos. If not, consider saying no or negotiating the request.\n2. **Schedule buffer time:** Leave some buffer time between tasks or commitments to account for unexpected events or self-care activities.\n3. **Communicate your priorities:** Share your priorities with colleagues, friends, and family to set clear expectations and avoid overcommitting.\n4. **Practice self-care:** Make time for activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul. This will help you recharge and maintain your energy levels.\n\n**Flexibility Tips:**\n\n1. **Batch similar tasks:** Group similar tasks together to optimize your time and energy. For example, dedicate specific times for checking emails, making phone calls, or doing chores.\n2. **Leave room for spontaneity:** Allow for flexibility in your day to accommodate unexpected events or opportunities.\n3. **Review and adjust:** Regularly review your priorities and tasks to ensure they align with your goals and values. Make adjustments as needed.\n\n**Dr. Smith's Guidance:**\n\nIt's great that you're working with Dr. Smith to set healthy boundaries and prioritize your well-being. Be sure to share your progress and challenges with her, and ask for guidance on implementing these strategies in your daily life.\n\nHow do these suggestions resonate with you?
