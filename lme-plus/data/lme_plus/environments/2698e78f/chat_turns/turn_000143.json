  "content": "It's amazing to see how mental health conversations have evolved over time. I remember when it was seen as such a taboo subject, and people would shy away from even acknowledging that it was a real issue. Now, we're seeing more and more awareness campaigns and advocacy efforts, and it's really heartening to see the progress that's been made. Kudos to Keanu Reeves and others like him for paving the way.",
