Numbness or tingling: People with circulation problems often experience a tingling sensation or numbness in their feet. This is because blood flow to the feet decreases when circulation is poor.\n\n2. Swelling: Poor circulation can cause fluid to accumulate in the feet, leading to swelling.\n\n3. Cold feet: When blood flow to the feet is reduced, the feet may become cold or cooler than the rest of the body.\n\n4. Sores or ulcers: Poor circulation can lead to wounds on the feet, which can be challenging to heal.\n\n5. Discolored skin: The feet may appear blue, purple, or pale due to a lack of blood flow.\n\n6.
