  "content": "That's a fantastic deal! 20 tea bags for $5 is a great value, especially considering the quality of the Earl Grey tea you mentioned earlier.\n\nAs we calculated earlier, each tea bag costs around $0.25, which is a very reasonable price for a good-quality tea bag. You're getting a great cup of tea for a quarter of the price of a coffee!\n\nEnjoy your tea, and don't hesitate to explore more flavors and brands. You never know, you might discover a new favorite!",
