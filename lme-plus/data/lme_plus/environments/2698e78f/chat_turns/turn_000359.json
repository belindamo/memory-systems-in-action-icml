However, it's possible that there might be some additional activities or elements to the event.\n\nHere are a few possibilities:\n\n* **Social dance night:** A regular social dance event where dancers can come and dance with each other, practice their skills, and socialize.\n* **Theme night:** The event might have a specific theme, such as a Halloween-themed night, a Latin-themed night, or a decade-specific theme (e.g., 80s or 90s). This could influence your outfit choice and the music played.\n* **Performance or showcase:** There might be a performance or showcase by advanced dancers, instructors, or special guests. This could be a great opportunity to watch and learn from others.\n* **Mini-workshop or lesson:** The event might include a short workshop or lesson, focusing on a specific style, technique, or move. This could be a great way to learn something new and improve your skills.\n* **DJ or live music:** The event might feature a DJ or live music, which could affect the atmosphere and energy of the event.\n\nTo confirm the plan, you can:\n\n* Check the studio's website, social media, or email newsletters for event details.\n* Ask a fellow dancer or instructor about the event plan.\n* Reach out to the studio directly and ask about the event schedule and activities.\n\nKnowing what to expect can help you prepare, both in terms of what to wear and how to make the most of your time at the event.",
