They're often quiet, easy to clean, and can be adjusted to different mist settings.\n2. **Nebulizing diffusers**: These diffusers use a jet of compressed air to create a fine mist that disperses the essential oils into the air. They're often more powerful than ultrasonic diffusers and can be more effective at dispersing oils.\n3. **Heat diffusers**: These diffusers use heat to warm the essential oils, which can help release their properties into the air.
