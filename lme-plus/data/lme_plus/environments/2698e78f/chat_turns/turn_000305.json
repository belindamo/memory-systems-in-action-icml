Can you please provide me with a bit more information to narrow down some options?\n\nHere are a few questions to get started:\n\n1. What city are you in or planning to visit?\n2. What type of cuisine are you in the mood for (e.g. eggs, pancakes, sandwiches, international, etc.)?\n3. Are you looking for a casual, quick bite or a more upscale experience?\n4. Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)?\n5. How many people will be dining with you?\n6. Do you have a specific neighborhood or area in mind?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your preferences, I can provide you with some personalized brunch recommendations!",
