When your partner is speaking, focus on what they're saying and try to understand their perspective. Show that you're listening by asking follow-up questions and repeating back what you've heard to ensure that you understand them correctly.\n\n2. Use \"I\" statements. When expressing yourself, use \"I\" statements to convey how you feel without placing blame or making accusations. For example, instead of saying \"You always do this,\" say \"I feel upset when this happens.\"\n\n3. Avoid defensiveness. Try not to get defensive if your partner criticizes or disagrees with you. Instead, take a step back and try to see things from their perspective. Respond calmly and respectfully rather than reacting emotionally.\n\n4. Be specific. When discussing issues or problems, be specific about what you're concerned about and what you'd like to see happen. Avoid generalizations and focus on actionable steps that you and your partner can take to address the issue.\n\n5. Practice empathy. Try to understand your partner's emotions and point of view. By doing this, you will better understand their feelings and can respond in an empathetic manner.\n\n6. Take a break if needed. If emotions are running hot, take a break to cool down and collect your thoughts. \n\nRemember that communication takes effort and practice. But, with effort, it is possible to create a healthy, open and fulfilling communication landscape with your partner.",
