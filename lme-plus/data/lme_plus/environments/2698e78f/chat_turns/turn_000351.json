Since you've attended the studio's Friday night social dance events before, you have a good idea of the vibe. Here are some suggestions to help you dress to impress while still feeling comfortable:\n\n**Dress Code:** Casual-chic with a touch of flair\n\n**Top:**\n\n* A breathable, moisture-wicking top is a must. Look for lightweight fabrics like cotton, polyester blends, or bamboo.\n* A fitted tank top, t-shirt, or a blouse with a bit of stretch is perfect for dancing.\n* Consider a top with some movement and flow, like a flowy blouse or a peplum top.\n\n**Bottom:**\n\n* Wear comfortable, stretchy pants or leggings that allow for a full range of motion. You'll be moving your hips, so make sure they're not too tight!\n* Jeans are okay, but they might be a bit restrictive. If you do wear jeans, opt for a stretchy pair.\n* A flowy skirt or a dance skirt is a great option, too! Just ensure it's not too long or you might trip over it.\n\n**Shoes:**\n\n* Wear shoes with a smooth sole, as they'll allow you to spin and move smoothly on the dance floor. Avoid shoes with a lot of grip, like sneakers.\n* Salsa shoes or dance shoes with a low heel (1-2 inches) are ideal, but not necessary. If you don't have dance shoes, a pair of dress shoes or sandals with a smooth sole will work.\n* Make sure your shoes are comfortable and won't slip off your feet while dancing.\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* Keep jewelry to a minimum, as you don't want anything to distract you or your partner while dancing. A simple necklace or earrings are fine.\n* A lightweight scarf or a bandana can add a pop of color and style to your outfit.\n* If you have long hair, consider pulling it back in a ponytail or bun to keep it out of your face while dancing.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Dress according to the venue's temperature. If it's a hot summer evening, opt for lighter colors and breathable fabrics. If it's cooler, you can add a light jacket or sweater.\n* Consider the overall style of the event. If it's a themed event, dress accordingly. For a regular social dance event, stick to a classic, versatile outfit.\n* Most importantly, wear what makes you feel confident and comfortable. You'll be more likely to have fun and enjoy the event!\n\nRemember, the key is to look polished while still prioritizing comfort and mobility. You want to be able to move freely and focus on your dancing, not worry about your outfit. Have fun and enjoy the event!",
