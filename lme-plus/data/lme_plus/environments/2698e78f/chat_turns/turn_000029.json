  "content": "What a wonderful coincidence! Congratulations to Rachel on her special day!\n\nUnfortunately, it's unlikely that you'll find Caymus wines at the vineyard's wine shop, as Caymus is a separate winery with its own vineyards and tasting rooms. The vineyard where you're celebrating Rachel's wedding likely produces its own wines, and their wine shop will feature their own label.\n\nHowever, you might be in for a treat! Since you're already at a beautiful vineyard in Napa Valley, take some time to explore their wine offerings. You might discover a new favorite wine or learn more about the vineyard's unique terroir and winemaking style.\n\nBe sure to ask the wine shop staff or your host about the vineyard's flagship wines, limited releases, or special wedding-day releases. They might have some exclusive wines available for tasting or purchase.\n\nWho knows, you might find a new wine to fall in love with, and it will make the celebration even more memorable!",
