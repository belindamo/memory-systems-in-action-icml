  "content": "It sounds like you had a great conversation with the guy, and he recommended a coffee shop that's likely to be a hidden gem.\n\nUnfortunately, without more specific details, it's difficult for me to pinpoint the exact coffee shop he recommended. However, I can suggest a few options to help you try to figure out which one it might be:\n\n1. **Ask the guy**: If you're still in touch with the guy, you could reach out to him and ask for the name of the coffee shop he recommended.\n2. **Think back to the conversation**: Try to remember any details from your conversation that might give you a clue about the coffee shop. Did he mention a specific neighborhood, a unique feature of the shop, or a particular type of coffee they serve?\n3. **Check online reviews**: Look up coffee shops in the neighborhood where you met the guy and read reviews to see if any of them mention productivity-friendly features or a great atmosphere for remote work.\n\nIf you're still stuck, feel free to provide more details about your conversation with the guy, and I can try to help you brainstorm ways to figure out which coffee shop he recommended!",
