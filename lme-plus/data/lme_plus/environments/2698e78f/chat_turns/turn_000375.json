Garlic and Ginger Stir-Fry:  Cook up your favorite vegetables (such as snow peas, carrots, and bell peppers) and protein (such as chicken or tofu) in a stir-fry sauce made with garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and honey.\n\n2. Turmeric and Cayenne Roasted Sweet Potatoes: Dice up sweet potatoes and toss them in a mixture of olive oil, turmeric, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Roast the sweet potatoes in the oven until they're tender and crispy.\n\n3. Omega-3 Rich Baked Salmon: Drizzle fresh salmon fillets with olive oil and sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and dried thyme. Bake the salmon in the oven until it's cooked through and flaky.\n\n4. Spinach Salad with Avocado and Walnuts: Combine fresh baby spinach leaves with diced avocado, walnuts, and dried cranberries. Drizzle the salad with a dressing made with olive oil, lemon juice, honey, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.\n\n5. Ginkgo Biloba Green Tea: Brew a cup of green tea and add in a few drops of liquid ginkgo biloba extract. Sweeten the tea with honey or stevia, and serve it hot or chilled.\n\nI hope these recipe suggestions are helpful.
