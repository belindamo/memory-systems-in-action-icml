  "content": "Sure, \"Gross National Happiness\" (GNH) is a development philosophy that was first proposed in the Kingdom of Bhutan by the fourth king Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1972. It aims to measure the country's progress in terms of its citizens' well-being, rather than just economic growth. The focus of GNH is on achieving a balance between economic development, environmental protection, cultural preservation, and good governance. It is rooted in the Buddhist principles of interdependence, compassion, and non-materialism.\n\nThe four pillars of GNH are sustainable and equitable socioeconomic development, environmental conservation, preservation and promotion of culture, and good governance. Bhutan has been implementing policies aimed at achieving these goals, such as a ban on plastic bags and a commitment to retaining at least 60% forest cover in the country. The government also uses a GNH index to measure the country's progress in these areas.\n\nGNH differs significantly from the focus on economic growth in other countries, which tends to prioritize GDP growth and material prosperity. In contrast, GNH emphasizes the importance of holistic well-being, such as health, education, and community vitality. Many proponents of GNH argue that a balanced approach to well-being is essential for sustainable and equitable development, rather than just economic growth.",
