  "content": "The automotive sector in Malaysia is an important industry, both in terms of its economic impact and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Malaysian Automotive Association, the industry contributed RM 40 billion ($10 billion USD) to the country's GDP in 2020 and employed over 700,000 people.\n\nThe Malaysian government has been actively promoting sustainable development in the automotive sector through various initiatives. In 2019, the government launched the National Automotive Policy 2020 (NAP2020), which includes a number of measures to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and other sustainable automotive technologies. For example, the policy includes incentives for EV manufacturers and buyers, as well as measures to promote the development of a domestic EV supply chain.\n\nAs of 2021, there are several publicly listed companies in Malaysia's automotive sector, including:\n\n1. DRB-HICOM Berhad: This company is involved in a range of automotive-related businesses, including vehicle distribution, assembly, and manufacturing. Its subsidiaries include Proton Holdings Berhad, which produces Proton-branded vehicles.\n2. Tan Chong Motor Holdings Berhad: This company is involved in vehicle distribution, assembly, and manufacturing, and is the official distributor of Nissan vehicles in Malaysia.\n3. UMW Holdings Berhad: This company is involved in a range of businesses, including vehicle distribution, assembly, and manufacturing. It has partnerships with several major automotive companies, including Toyota and Perodua.\n4. Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd (Perodua): This company is a joint venture between Malaysian and Japanese partners, and produces Perodua-branded vehicles.\n\nIn terms of specific efforts towards a green and sustainable economy, there have been several recent developments in the Malaysian automotive sector. For example, in October 2020, Malaysian utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) announced plans to set up 100 EV charging stations across the country by the end of 2021. This initiative is part of TNB's efforts to support the government's target of having 100,000 EVs on the road by 2030.\n\nAdditionally, in November 2020, the Malaysian government announced plans to increase the country's renewable energy target to 31% of its electricity generation mix by 2025. This could have implications for the automotive sector, as companies may be encouraged to adopt renewable energy sources for their operations.\n\nOverall, it is clear that the Malaysian government and automotive sector are making efforts towards a green and sustainable economy in the post-pandemic new normal. However, it remains to be seen how successful these efforts will be in terms of reducing the industry's environmental impact and promoting sustainable development. It will be important to track the progress of these initiatives and evaluate their impact over time.",
