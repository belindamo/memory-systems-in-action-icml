  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot say for sure whether HR involvement is warranted in your specific situation, as each workplace has its own policies and protocols. \n\nHowever, involving HR may be necessary if your coworker's behavior is impacting your work and/or creating a toxic work environment. HR can provide support and guidance on how to manage a difficult coworker and ensure that you are safe and respected at work. \n\nKeep in mind that escalating to HR should be a last resort, and you should try to address the situation with your coworker and/or your supervisor first. If you do decide to involve HR, make sure to document the incidents, specific dates, and any conversations you've had. Be prepared to provide specific examples of how your coworker's behavior has impacted your work.\n\nOverall, be patient, stay professional, and seek support from the appropriate resources as you work towards resolving the situation.",
