You can try bodyweight exercises, such as squats, push-ups, lunges, and planks. Resistance bands can also be used for strength training, as they provide resistance without the need for weights. Yoga and Pilates are also good options that offer many strength-building benefits. A qualified fitness professional can help you design a strength training program that fits your goals and preferences. You can also search for beginner strength training workouts on YouTube that you can do at home.",
