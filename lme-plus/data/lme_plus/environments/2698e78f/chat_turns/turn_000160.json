  "content": "The given text explains the use of magnetic field sensors on a drone to detect unexploded ordnance buried in the deep subsurface.\n\nPros of using magnetic field sensors:\n\n1. Non-destructive method: Using magnetic field sensors on a drone to detect ordnance buried underground is a non-destructive method, which means it does not cause any damage to the surrounding area, unlike digging or excavating.\n2. Efficient: The use of magnetic field sensors on a drone is an efficient method of detecting ordnance in the subsurface. It covers a larger area in a shorter amount of time as compared to manual methods.\n3. Detects multiple metals: The handheld metal detectors which use changing magnetic fields can detect multiple metals, which is an added advantage.\n4. Better estimate of depth: The handheld metal detectors are more sensitive to the depth of the material, which allows for a better estimate of the depth of the material, especially if one also has information on the conductivity of the soil.\n\nCons of using magnetic field sensors:\n\n1. May miss deeply buried objects: The handheld metal detectors are more sensitive to the depth of the material, but it can also mean that one misses objects that are buried too deep underground.\n2. Cost: The use of magnetic field sensors on a drone may involve high initial costs, including the cost of the drone, the sensors, and the software required to process the data collected.\n3. Interference: Magnetic field sensors may be subject to interference from other magnetic sources in the vicinity, which can reduce the accuracy of the readings obtained.\n4. Limited to detecting magnetic materials: The simplest magnetic sensors work by measuring the change in the local magnetic field of the earth caused by a substantial amount of ferro-magnetic material such as the steel housing of a grenade. Thus, they are limited to detecting magnetic materials and may miss other types of ordnance.",
