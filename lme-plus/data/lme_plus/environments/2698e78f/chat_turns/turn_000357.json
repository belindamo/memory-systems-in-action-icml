  "content": "Since you've attended the studio's Friday night social dance events before, you have a good sense of the dress code vibe. If you've noticed people dressing casually but still looking great, it's likely that a casual-chic style will be perfectly fine.\n\nIn that case, you can stick with the guidelines I provided earlier, focusing on comfortable, breathable clothing that allows for freedom of movement. Add some stylish touches, like a fun top or a statement accessory, to elevate your look without going overboard.\n\nRemember, the goal is to feel confident and comfortable, so you can focus on enjoying the music, dancing, and socializing with fellow dancers. If you're still unsure, a quick confirmation with the studio will put your mind at ease.\n\nHave fun getting ready, and I hope you have an amazing time at the social event!",
