It's great that you're taking steps to set healthy boundaries, and we can work together to make that a reality.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your current schedule and commitments? For example:\n\n* What are your work hours and responsibilities?\n* What social commitments do you have (e.g., regular meetups, events, family obligations)?\n* Do you have any recurring tasks or activities that you need to fit into your schedule (e.g., exercise, hobbies, self-care)?\n\nAlso, what are your top priorities right now? Are there any deadlines or tasks that are causing you the most stress or anxiety?\n\nLastly, what did you learn from your session with Dr. Smith about setting healthy boundaries? Are there any specific areas where you're struggling to set boundaries or feeling overwhelmed?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your schedule, commitments, and priorities, I can help you:\n\n* Identify areas where you can set healthy boundaries\n* Prioritize your tasks and responsibilities\n* Create a schedule that works for you, not against you\n* Develop strategies to manage your time and energy more effectively\n\nLet's get started!",
