      "content": "I do not have access to the most current information on whether there are any plans to expand or upgrade athletic facilities at usask in the near future. it is best to check with the university of saskatchewan directly or with their facilities management division for the most up-to-date information on possible renovations or expansions of the athletic facilities. however, it is not uncommon for universities to update or expand their athletic facilities to meet the needs of their students, so it is possible that usask is considering such improvements."
