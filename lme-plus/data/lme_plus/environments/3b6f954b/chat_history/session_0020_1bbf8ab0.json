Here are some popular alternatives and their characteristics:\n\n1. **Peychaud's Bitters**: Originating from New Orleans, Peychaud's has a sweeter, more anise-forward flavor compared to Angostura. It pairs well with rye whiskey and adds a subtle licorice note to the Old Fashioned.\n2. **Orange Bitters**: As the name suggests, orange bitters have a citrusy flavor profile, which can enhance the brightness and balance out the sweetness in an Old Fashioned.

Boker's pairs well with bourbon and adds depth to the Old Fashioned.\n4. **Fernet-Branca**: If you like a more intense, mentholated flavor, Fernet-Branca might be the way to go. This Italian amaro is often used in small quantities due to its bold character. It pairs well with bourbon or rye whiskey.\n5. **Cardamom Bitters**: For a more exotic twist, try using cardamom bitters, which add a warm, spicy, and herbal flavor to the Old Fashioned. They work well with bourbon or rye whiskey.\n6. **Chocolate Mole Bitters**: If you want to add a rich, chocolatey flavor to your Old Fashioned, chocolate mole bitters are a great option. They pair well with bourbon and add a unique twist to the classic recipe.\n7. **Smoked Bitters**: Smoked bitters can add a fascinating smoky dimension to the Old Fashioned. They work well with bourbon or rye whiskey and are perfect for those who enjoy a smoky flavor profile.\n\nWhen experimenting with new bitters, start with a small amount (e.g., 2-3 dashes) and adjust to taste. Remember that bitters are a matter of personal preference, so don't be afraid to try different combinations to find the perfect flavor for your Old Fashioned.\n\nSome popular brands to explore:\n\n* Fee Brothers\n* The Bitter Truth\n* Scrappy's Bitters\n* Bittercube\n* Brooklyn Hemispherical Bitters\n\nFeel free to experiment and find the perfect bitter to elevate your Old Fashioned game!"
