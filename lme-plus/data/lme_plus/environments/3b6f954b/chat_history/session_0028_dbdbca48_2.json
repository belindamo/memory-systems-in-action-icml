What is the current month (e.g., January, February, etc.)?\n2. What movies have you watched so far this month? Try to recall as many as you can, and I'll help you organize them.\n\nYou can share the titles, and I'll add them to a list for you. If you remember any additional details like the date you watched the movie, the genre, or your rating (e.g., 1-5 stars), feel free to include those as well.\n\nLet's get started!"

Let's not limit ourselves to just June; we can go back in time and add movies from May (or any other month) that you remember watching.\n\nTo get started, I'll create a separate section for each month. We can add movies to each section as you remember them. Here's the updated format:\n\n**Movie Log**\n\n**June**\n\n1. **The Matrix** (June 4th)\n2. **Inception** (June 4th)\n3. **Everything Everywhere All at Once** (June 4th)\n\n**May**\n\n[Add movies from May here]\n\n**[Other months]**\n\n[We can add more sections for other months as needed]\n\nNow, take your time to think back to May. What movies do you remember watching that month? You can add titles, and I'll help you organize them."

This way, you can keep track of when and how you watched each movie.\n\nNow, take your time to think back to May again. Are there any other movies you remember watching that month? You can add more titles, and I'll help you organize them.\n\nAlso, feel free to add any other details you'd like to remember about each movie, such as your rating, thoughts, or favorite scenes.
