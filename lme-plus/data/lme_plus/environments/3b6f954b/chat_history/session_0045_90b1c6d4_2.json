      "content": "Sharing tips on how to stay motivated and productive can be a great way to engage with your audience and provide value beyond just promoting your products. It's a fantastic way to showcase your expertise and build a connection with your audience on a more personal level.\n\nSince you've already done a Twitter chat on entrepreneurship, you know that your audience is interested in learning from your experiences and insights. Sharing productivity and motivation tips can help position you as a thought leader in your industry and build trust with your audience.\n\nIn fact, many people struggle with staying motivated and productive, especially when it comes to achieving their goals. By sharing your own strategies and tips, you can help your audience overcome these challenges and achieve their own success.\n\nThat being said, it's also important to keep your product-related content in mind. You can try to find ways to tie your productivity and motivation tips back to your products or services. For example, you could share how your products help people stay organized and focused, or how they can help entrepreneurs overcome specific challenges.\n\nHere's an idea: you could create a series of tweets that share your top productivity tips, and then tie each tip back to how your products can help implement that tip. This way, you're providing value to your audience while also showcasing your products in a non-salesy way.\n\nUltimately, the key is to find a balance between sharing valuable content and promoting your products. By doing so, you'll create a loyal audience that trusts your expertise and is more likely to engage with your brand.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there a specific angle or theme you're thinking of exploring for your productivity and motivation tips?"
