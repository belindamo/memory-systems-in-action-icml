I created content for about 5% of A1 level but what took more time was thinking about the SOP to work around the content limitations of the AI. If good, i can experiment on making it more efficient and start using Luisa's course structure (her K1) to create as much content before the end of the day.\nK3: I made a graphic explaining how I structured my workflow with the AI. Currently the AI has a hard limit of 300~400 characters for replies per chat (SEO team has the same problem). The solution is to first make the AI create the outline and create content in blocks and when relevant as it to \"continue previous message\" to get more."
