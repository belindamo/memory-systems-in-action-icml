  "content": "Yes, students from other faculties who are not involved in varsity sports can use the athletic facilities at USask. There is a fee for non-varsity athletes to access the facilities, which is typically included in their student fees. However, students who are not enrolled in courses during the summer may be required to pay an additional fee, as summer access to facilities is not automatically included in the regular student fees.\n\nAdditionally, USask offers a range of recreational programs and services available to all students, including fitness classes and intramural sports. These programs are geared towards non-varsity athletes and offer an opportunity for students to participate in sports and activities without being a part of a varsity team. \n\nOverall, USask's athletic facilities and programs are designed to serve both varsity and non-varsity athletes, as well as the broader student population.",
