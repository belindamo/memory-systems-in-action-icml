  "content": "While it is understandable that some readers may not want politics to be a prominent aspect of their reading experience, it is important to recognize that Margaret Atwood's use of political themes and commentary is not uncommon in literature. In fact, many authors use their work to examine social and political issues and invite readers to consider different perspectives in their own lives. Additionally, Atwood's work is not solely focused on politics but incorporates multifaceted characters and plot developments that add depth and complexity to her stories. While readers are entitled to their own preferences and opinions, it is important to recognize that authors may use their platforms to address issues they find important or relevant.",
