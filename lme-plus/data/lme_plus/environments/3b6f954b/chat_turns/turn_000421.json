Need to take into account different uses of AT, such as students learning from multiple teachers, exam preparation students, and non-language learners.\n* K2: Goals and strong ideas for the SOP need review. Created content for about 5% of A1 level, but more time was spent thinking about the SOP to work around AI content limitations. Can experiment on making it more efficient and start using Luisa's course structure (her K1) to create more content.\n* K3: Created a graphic explaining my workflow with the AI. Currently the AI has a hard character limit for replies per chat, but the solution is to make the AI create an outline and create content in blocks, and use \"continue previous message\" where relevant.",
