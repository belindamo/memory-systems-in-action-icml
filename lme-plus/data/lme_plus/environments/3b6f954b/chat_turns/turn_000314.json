Air pollution is a major environmental problem in developing southeast Asian nations, especially\nMalaysia, whose goal is to be an industrialized country soon (Juneng\net al., 2009). According to Kamarul Zaman et al. (2017), Malaysia is\nranked 117th among 180 countries with the worst air quality. In addition, the spatial location of Malaysia along the emitted pollutants\u2019\npathway has contributed severely to air pollution (Reid et al., 2013),\nespecially emission from a forest fire and transboundary pollution\n(Usmani et al., 2020).\nMalaysia\u2019s Air Pollution Index (API) is calculated using the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3),\nsulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM) with a diameter finer\nthan 10 \u03bcm and Particulate Matter <2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) (APIMS 2019).\nDespite the present utilization of PM2.5 to denote the API level in\nMalaysia (APIMS 2020), PM10 sourced from vehicles\u2019 soot, biomass\nburning, and industrial emission remain a threat to health (Khan et al.,\n2016). This is due to its small aerodynamic particulate diameter, which\ncan easily penetrate the lungs and respiratory system, resulting in\nadverse health effects (Tella and Balogun, 2021).\nThe impact of exposure to PM10 has long be discussed in several\nliterature to have caused cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases,\nasthma, birth defects, cerebrovascular health problem, global warming,\nrise in hospitalization, absenteeism in school, mortality, morbidity and\nits potentiality of being carcinogenic (Bergstrom \u00a8 et al., 2017; Wang\net al., 2018; Feng et al., 2019). Further, particulate matter is a causative\nfactor of haze in Malaysia which affects the socio-economic developments, tourism sector, school activities, and cardiovascular\nsystem of both young and old (Song et al., 2019).\nThere has been a rise in the concentration of PM10 in Malaysia\u2019s\natmosphere due to frequent vehicular emission, industrial emission, and\nurbanization (Althuwaynee et al., 2020). Thus, the high concentration of\nambient PM10 has been a major environmental concern that requires\nquick intervention. One of the requirements of effective air quality\nmanagement is the capability to accurately delineate potential hotspots\nof the PM10 concentration for preemptive monitoring and timely control measures. Reliable estimation of the PM10 hazard level will aid\nmitigation strategy by offering timely information to stakeholders,\ndecision-makers, and governments to curtail the impacts of air pollution\n(Fortelli et al., 2016). Considering that poor air quality is projected to\nincrease due to unplanned population growth and socio-economic activities (She et al., 2017), studies that aim to advance ongoing initiatives\nto accurately predict future PM10 concentration leveraging advancements in geospatial technology and digitalization are imperative.\nNotably, some studies have been carried out towards reducing the\nimpact of PM10 in Malaysia. However, according to the review of\nstudies that carried out PM10 modelling in Malaysia by (Shaziayani\net al., 2020), it was established that 72% of these studies used linear\nregression methods, while only 12% used non-linear machine learning\ntechniques. For instance, Juneng et al. (2009) examined the\nspatio-temporal variation of PM10 in Malaysia using principal component analysis (PCA) to understand the variability of PM10 concentration. The authors integrated the principal component with spatial tools\nto produce the principal component spatial loadings in determining the\nspatial and temporal variability of PM10 concentration. However,\nrecent studies that considered predicting PM10 concentration used a\nlinear regression model (Abdullah et al. 2017, 2020; Fong et al., 2018).\nBesides, the majority of these studies considered using meteorological\nvariables as predictors. For example, Alifa et al. (2020) used stepwise\nmultiple linear regression and meteorological data for predicting PM10\nconcentration in Malaysia. Although, linear regression has a better\nperformance and can determine the nexus between climatic variables\nand PM10 (Tella et al., 2021). However, it is attributed to the\nnon-linearity problem and restricted by the complex relationship between spatial and temporal predictors and PM10 (Chen et al., 2018).\nFurther, this model fails to integrate heterogeneous variables such as\nroad density, buildings, and other spatial data are affecting air pollution\n(Wen et al., 2019). Also, there is a linear supposition between the predictors and response opposing real-life non-linear problems, therefore,\naffecting prediction accuracy (Ma et al., 2020).\nOne of the effective methods to overcome these limitations is machine learning techniques which are not restricted by the non-linear\nproblem and the complexity of the relationship between the predictors\nand PM10 (Hu et al., 2017). Although limited studies use machine\nlearning to predict PM10 in Malaysia, this approach has been widely\nutilized with high performance and accuracy in other countries. For\ninstance, Chen et al. (2018) used the random forest to accurately predict\nthe PM10 concentration, with the model explaining 82% variability of\nthe air pollutant in China. Furthermore, Suleiman et al. (2020) developed models based on random forest, deep learning, and extreme\nlearning machine to model roadside PM10 and PM2.5 in London. The R2\nvalues of the models is above 0.80, confirming the performance of machine learning models. Stafoggia et al. (2019) also employed RF trained\non land use and meteorological data of 7 years to predict PM2.5 and\nPM10 concentration in Italy. Assessment of model performance gives a\ngood CV fitting with R2 of 0.75 for PM10 and 0.8 for PM2.5. Fan et al.\n(2018) trained the K-NN model and kernel models on the daily median\nof hourly PM2.5 concentration data to predict air pollution density in\nBeijing. The study showed that the KNN model has better performance\nwith a smooth fit that reflects the data distribution than the kernel\ndensity model.\nHaving confirmed the remarkable performance of machine learning\ntechniques, integrating them with spatial technology will help\nstakeholders determine locations that are most susceptible to air\npollution. Thus, this study developed three different machine learning\nmodels: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Naive\nBayes (NB) to predict PM10 spatial hazard hotspots. To the best of the\nauthors knowledge, these three models have not been used to predict air\npollution comparatively, making it the first of its kind in Malaysia.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of spatial modelling enhances the approach\nadopted in this study. Therefore, the objectives of this study are (i)\nspatial prediction of PM10 hazard hotspot (ii) determination of variable\nimportance of the predictors (iii) comparison of the models in the prediction of PM10 hotspot.",
