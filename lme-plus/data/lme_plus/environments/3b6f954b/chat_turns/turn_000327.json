It is true that there is still more that can be done to address the negative impact of commercial shipping on the environment. While NOAA's efforts have been significant, there are still many challenges to address. For example, effective regulation and compliance can be difficult to achieve, especially in international waters where coordination and cooperation can be complex. Moreover, maritime activities have many different impacts on the environment, including pollution, habitat disturbance, and species depletion. Therefore, it is important to continue to innovate and develop new strategies for mitigating the impacts of these activities. This might include the use of new technologies, the development of new regulations or policies, and stronger partnerships between different actors in the maritime sector to promote best practices and cooperation. Ultimately, it will take a multifaceted and sustained effort to address the environmental impacts of commercial shipping and other maritime activities.",
