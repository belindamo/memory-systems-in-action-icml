You can find excellent kaiseki restaurants in Osaka, but I'll also suggest some alternative options that offer similar experiences.\n\n**Kaiseki restaurants in Osaka:**\n\n1. **Kani Doraku** (3-Michelin stars): A renowned kaiseki restaurant with a focus on seasonal ingredients and beautiful presentation.\n2. **Sakamoto** (2-Michelin stars): Offers a refined kaiseki experience with a focus on local Osaka ingredients and traditional techniques.\n3. ** Hajime** (2-Michelin stars): A modern take on kaiseki, with a focus on creative, artistic dishes using seasonal ingredients.\n\n**Alternative options:**\n\n1. **Edomae-style sushi**: While not traditional kaiseki, Edomae-style sushi restaurants offer a similar omakase (chef's selection) experience, with a focus on fresh, seasonal fish.
