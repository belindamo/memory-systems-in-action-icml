Here's a breakdown of the time needed:\n\n**Preparation time:** 5-7 minutes\n\n* Rinse the asparagus spears and pat them dry with a paper towel\n* Trim the ends of the asparagus (if needed)\n* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat\n* Place the asparagus spears on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer\n\n**Cooking time:** 12-15 minutes\n\n* Roast the asparagus in a preheated oven at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C)\n* Toss the asparagus halfway through the cooking time to ensure even roasting\n\n**Total time:** 17-22 minutes\n\nYou can adjust the cooking time based on your personal preference for asparagus doneness. Some people like their asparagus more tender, while others prefer it slightly crunchy.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use fresh asparagus for the best flavor and texture.\n* If using thicker asparagus spears, you may need to add 2-3 minutes to the cooking time.\n* You can season the asparagus with salt, pepper, and olive oil before roasting, or add other seasonings like garlic powder, paprika, or grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.\n\nWhile the asparagus is roasting, you can focus on preparing the Quinoa Stuffed Bell Peppers. Simply cook the quinoa, prepare the filling, and assemble the peppers. By the time the asparagus is done, your peppers will be ready to go into the oven!\n\nDo you have any other questions or are you ready to get started with your recipe?",
