  "content": "I'd be happy to help you track your movie watching habits from previous months as well!\n\nI can help you create a movie log that spans multiple months, so you can keep track of all the movies you've watched over time. Let's not limit ourselves to just June; we can go back in time and add movies from May (or any other month) that you remember watching.\n\nTo get started, I'll create a separate section for each month. We can add movies to each section as you remember them. Here's the updated format:\n\n**Movie Log**\n\n**June**\n\n1. **The Matrix** (June 4th)\n2. **Inception** (June 4th)\n3. **Everything Everywhere All at Once** (June 4th)\n\n**May**\n\n[Add movies from May here]\n\n**[Other months]**\n\n[We can add more sections for other months as needed]\n\nNow, take your time to think back to May. What movies do you remember watching that month? You can add titles, and I'll help you organize them.",
