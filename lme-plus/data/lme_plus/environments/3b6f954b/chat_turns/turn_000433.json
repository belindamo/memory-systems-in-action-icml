Instagram is a visually-driven platform, and behind-the-scenes content can help give your audience a sense of exclusivity and intimacy with your brand.\n\nSharing sneak peeks of new products or features can create buzz and anticipation, and Instagram stories are a great way to do that. Since Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours, it's a low-risk way to test the waters and see how your audience responds to new content.\n\nBy sharing behind-the-scenes content on Instagram, you can:\n\n1. Drive engagement: Instagram stories allow you to ask questions, poll your audience, and encourage them to share their thoughts and feedback.\n2. Build anticipation: Share sneak peeks of new products or features to create excitement and anticipation among your audience.\n3. Humanize your brand: Instagram stories can help showcase the people behind the brand, making your audience feel more connected to your business.\n4. Drive traffic: You can use Instagram stories to drive traffic to your Twitter account, website, or other social media platforms.\n\nSince you're already planning to share behind-the-scenes content on Twitter, you can use Instagram stories to supplement that content and provide a different perspective. You can share more visual, behind-the-scenes content on Instagram, and use Twitter to share more in-depth, text-based content.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n* Share behind-the-scenes content on Twitter, focusing on the \"day in the life\" type of content we discussed earlier.\n* Use Instagram stories to share more visual, sneak-peek type content, such as:\n\t+ Sneak peeks of new products or features\n\t+ Behind-the-scenes shots of your design process\n\t+ Quick tutorials or tips related to your products\n\t+ Q&A sessions or polls to engage with your audience\n\nBy using both Twitter and Instagram, you can create a cohesive brand story across multiple platforms and engage with your audience in different ways.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you ready to give Instagram stories a try?",
