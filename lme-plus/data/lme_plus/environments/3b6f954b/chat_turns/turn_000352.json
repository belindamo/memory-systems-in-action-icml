Since I'm posting about vegan Christmas cookies, I might ask questions like \"What's your favorite holiday cookie flavor?\" or \"Do you prefer soft and chewy or crispy cookies?\" I'll also create polls to gather opinions on topics like \"Which holiday cookie shape do you prefer: snowflake, tree, or star?\" or \"What's the most important ingredient in your holiday cookies?\" By doing so, I can encourage my followers to engage with my content and share their thoughts and opinions.",
