  "content": "Kibana's Alerting feature supports a variety of notification channels, including email, Slack, PagerDuty, and webhooks. However, it doesn't support sending SMS notifications directly. To send SMS notifications, you can use a third-party service that integrates with Kibana's Alerting feature, such as Twilio or Nexmo.\n\nIn terms of the types of alerts and notifications that Kibana's Alerting feature can do, it's quite flexible and customizable. Some examples of alerts and notifications that you can set up using Kibana's Alerting feature include:\n\n* Threshold alerts: Trigger an alert when a specific metric exceeds or falls below a certain threshold.\n* Anomaly detection alerts: Trigger an alert when Kibana's machine learning feature detects an anomalous pattern in your data.\n* Watcher alerts: Monitor Elasticsearch data for certain conditions or patterns, and trigger an alert when those conditions are met.\n* Scheduled alerts: Trigger an alert at a specific time or on a regular schedule.\n* Heartbeat alerts: Monitor the availability of services and systems, and trigger an alert when a service goes down or becomes unavailable.\n\nOverall, Kibana's Alerting feature provides a powerful way to monitor and respond to changes in your data and infrastructure, and can be customized to fit a wide range of use cases.",
