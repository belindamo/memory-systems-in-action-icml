  "content": "For the Quinoa Stuffed Bell Peppers recipe, I recommend cooking about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of quinoa. This will yield enough cooked quinoa to fill four bell peppers generously.\n\nHere's a general guideline for cooking quinoa:\n\n* 1 cup of uncooked quinoa yields about 3 cups of cooked quinoa\n* 1 1/2 cups of uncooked quinoa yields about 4 1/2 cups of cooked quinoa\n* 2 cups of uncooked quinoa yields about 6 cups of cooked quinoa\n\nTo cook the quinoa, follow these steps:\n\n1. Rinse the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water, and drain well.\n2. In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water or vegetable broth to a boil.\n3. Add 1 1/2 to 2 cups of quinoa to the saucepan.\n4. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is tender.\n5. Fluff the cooked quinoa with a fork and let it cool slightly.\n\nOnce the quinoa is cooked, you can prepare the filling by mixing it with black beans, diced tomatoes, chopped onions, and your choice of spices and seasonings.\n\nRemember to adjust the amount of quinoa according to your personal preference and the size of your bell peppers. If you prefer more filling, cook a bit more quinoa. If you prefer less filling, cook a bit less quinoa.\n\nDo you have any other questions about cooking quinoa or preparing the filling?",
