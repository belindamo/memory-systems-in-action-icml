  "content": "The increase in urbanization, industrialization, transportation, population, and fossil fuel emissions in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia has greatly affected the air quality in the area (Bozdag et al., 2020). Air pollution is a significant environmental problem in developing countries, particularly in Addis Ababa, whose goal is to become industrialized soon (Juneng et al., 2009). According to research, Addis Ababa is ranked among the countries with the worst air quality (Kamarul Zaman et al., 2017). The spatial location of Addis Ababa along the emitted pollutants' pathway has also contributed to air pollution (Reid et al., 2013), specifically from forest fires and transboundary pollution (Usmani et al., 2020).\n\nIn Addis Ababa, the Air Pollution Index (API) is calculated using the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM) with a diameter finer than 10 \u03bcm and PM2.5 (APIMS 2019). Despite the current use of PM2.5 to indicate the API level in Addis Ababa (APIMS 2020), PM10 sourced from vehicles' soot, biomass burning, and industrial emissions remains a threat to health (Khan et al., 2016) due to its small aerodynamic particulate diameter which can easily penetrate the lungs and respiratory system, resulting in adverse health effects (Tella and Balogun, 2021).\n\nThe impact of exposure to PM10 has been discussed in several literature, causing cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, asthma, birth defects, cerebrovascular health problems, global warming, rise in hospitalization, absenteeism in school, mortality, morbidity, and potential carcinogenicity (Bergstrom et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2019). Additionally, particulate matter is a causative factor of haze in Addis Ababa, affecting the socio-economic developments, tourism sector, school activities, and cardiovascular system of both young and old (Song et al., 2019).\n\nThere has been a rise in the concentration of PM10 in Addis Ababa's atmosphere due to frequent vehicular emission, industrial emission, and urbanization (Althuwaynee et al., 2020). Thus, the high concentration of ambient PM10 has been a major environmental concern that requires quick intervention. An essential aspect of effective air quality management is the ability to accurately identify potential hotspots of PM10 concentration for preemptive monitoring and timely control measures. Reliable estimation of the PM10 hazard level will aid mitigation strategies by providing timely information to stakeholders, decision-makers, and government to curb the impacts of air pollution (Fortelli et al., 2016). Considering that poor air quality is projected to increase due to unplanned population growth and socio-economic activities (She et al., 2017), studies that aim to advance ongoing initiatives to accurately predict future PM10 concentration leveraging advancements in geospatial technology and digitalization are essential.\n\nNotably, some studies have been carried out towards reducing the impact of PM10 in Addis Ababa. However, according to a review of studies that carried out PM10 modeling in Addis Ababa by (Shaziayani et al., 2020), it was established that 72% of these studies used linear regression methods, while only 12% used non-linear machine learning techniques. For instance, Juneng et al. (2009) examined the spatiotemporal variation of PM10 in Addis Ababa using principal component analysis (PCA) to understand the variability of PM10 concentration. The authors integrated the principal component with spatial tools to produce the principal component spatial loadings in determining the spatial and",
