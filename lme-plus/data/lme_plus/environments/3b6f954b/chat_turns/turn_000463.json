I'm happy to help you with that!\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Peak Design Everyday Sling 5L:** A great choice! The Peak Design Everyday Sling is a popular and stylish option. It's compact, versatile, and well-made. The 5L version is perfect for carrying a mirrorless camera, lenses, and some accessories.\n2. **Peak Design Everyday Backpack 20L:** If you prefer a backpack over a sling, the Everyday Backpack 20L is an excellent option. It's spacious, comfortable, and has a sleek design.\n3. **Wandrd PRVKE 21L:** Another great option for a backpack-style camera bag. The Wandrd PRVKE 21L is durable, weather-resistant, and has a stylish design.\n4. **Think Tank Photo Urban Disguise 40L:** If you prefer a more traditional camera bag look, the Think Tank Photo Urban Disguise 40L is a great choice. It's spacious, comfortable, and has a discreet design.\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n1. **Size:** Think about the gear you need to carry and the size of the bag you're comfortable with.\n2. **Style:** Do you prefer a sleek and modern design or a more traditional camera bag look?\n3. **Durability:** Look for bags with durable materials, sturdy zippers, and weather-resistant coatings.\n4. **Comfort:** Consider the shoulder straps, back panel, and overall comfort of the bag.\n5. **Features:** Think about the features you need, such as laptop compartments, phone pockets, and accessory storage.\n\n**Upgrading from the Lowepro ProTactic 450 AW:**\n\nThe Lowepro ProTactic 450 AW is a great bag, but if you're looking for something more stylish and compact, the Peak Design Everyday Sling 5L is a good choice. It's smaller and more versatile, making it perfect for daily carry or travel.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I recommend checking out reviews, watching YouTube videos, and trying out bags in person (if possible) to find the best fit for your needs.\n\nDo you have any other questions about camera bags or photography gear?",
