I created content for about 5% of A1 level but what took more time was thinking about the SOP to work around the content limitations of the AI. If good, i can experiment on making it more efficient and start using Luisa's course structure (her K1) to create as much content before the end of the day.\nK3: I made a graphic explaining how I structured my workflow with the AI. Currently the AI has a hard limit of 300~400 characters for replies per chat (SEO team has the same problem).
