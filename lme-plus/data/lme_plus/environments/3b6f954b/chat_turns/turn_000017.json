  "content": "Coleslaw and baked beans are a classic BBQ combo. I'm glad to hear Mike's BBQ inspired you to try making your own coleslaw!\n\nHere's a simple recipe for baked beans that you can try:\n\n**Easy Baked Beans Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 pound dried navy beans, soaked overnight and drained\n* 1 pound smoked bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces\n* 1 onion, chopped\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 cup ketchup\n* 1 cup beef broth\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 1 teaspoon ground mustard\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C).\n2. In a large Dutch oven or oven-safe pot, cook the bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon from the pot, leaving the drippings behind.\n3. Add the chopped onion to the pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.\n4. Add the soaked and drained navy beans, ketchup, beef broth, brown sugar, mustard, salt, and pepper to the pot. Stir to combine.\n5. Cover the pot and bake for 6-8 hours, or until the beans are tender and the liquid has thickened into a rich, saucy consistency.\n6. Add the cooked bacon back into the pot and stir to combine.\n7. Serve the baked beans hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley or chives, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can use canned navy beans or pork and beans as a shortcut, but cooking dried beans from scratch will give you a richer flavor.\n* If you prefer a sweeter baked bean, you can add an additional 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar.\n* You can also add other ingredients to customize the recipe, such as diced bell peppers, chopped jalape\u00f1os, or a splash of apple cider vinegar.\n\nThis recipe makes about 6-8 servings, so feel free to adjust the ingredient quantities as needed for your 4th of July BBQ. Enjoy!",
