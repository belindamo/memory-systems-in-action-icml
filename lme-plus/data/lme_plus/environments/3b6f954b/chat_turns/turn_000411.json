Congratulations on being an avid eBirder and being ranked 10th in your county! \n\nReaching the top 5 by the end of the summer is definitely an achievable goal, but it'll require consistent effort and dedication. Here are some tips to help you improve your chances:\n\n1. **Maintain your daily walks**: Keep up your regular birding routine, and try to visit different areas of your local park or explore new locations to increase your chances of spotting new species.\n2. **Improve your identification skills**: Continue to study and learn about the bird species found in your region. Focus on the more challenging species or those you're less familiar with. You can use resources like eBird's species accounts, online forums, and field guides to improve your identification skills.\n3. **Target specific species**: Identify the species that are commonly seen in your county during the summer months but are missing from your life list. Make a target list and focus on finding those birds.\n4. **Pay attention to habitat and behavior**: Learn about the preferred habitats, behaviors, and migration patterns of the species you're targeting. This will increase your chances of spotting them.\n5. **Stay up-to-date with local birding reports**: Follow local birding groups, Facebook pages, or online forums to stay informed about recent sightings and rare bird alerts in your area.\n6. **Join forces with other birders**: Consider joining a local birding group or partnering with other eBirders in your county. You can learn from each other's experiences and get tips on where to find specific species.\n7. **Be persistent and patient**: Reaching the top 5 will require a combination of skill, knowledge, and luck. Don't get discouraged if you don't see new species every day. Keep at it, and eventually, you'll start to see the results.\n\nRemember, the most important aspect of birding is to have fun and enjoy the experience. Good luck, and I hope you reach your goal!\n\nPlease keep me updated on your progress, and feel free to ask for any advice or tips along the way!",
