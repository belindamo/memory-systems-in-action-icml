I think I'll ask \"What's your favorite holiday cookie memory?\" to encourage my followers to share a personal story or memory related to holiday cookies. Since I mentioned my post about a type of chocolate cake got a record number of likes and comments, I'll also mention it briefly in the caption to remind my followers of my previous success. Here's my caption: \"Winter wonderland vibes only! Get ready for a sweet treat to brighten up your holiday season! My post about vegan chocolate cake from last Saturday got a record 120 likes and 20 comments, and I'm hoping to replicate that success with my new vegan Christmas cookie recipe coming soon! In the meantime, I want to know... What's your favorite holiday cookie memory? Share with me in the comments below! #veganchristmascookies #holidaycookies #winterwonderland\"",
