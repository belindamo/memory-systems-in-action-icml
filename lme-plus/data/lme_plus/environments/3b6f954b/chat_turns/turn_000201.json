  "content": "Quinoa Stuffed Bell Peppers are a nutritious and flavorful option. For a side dish, I'd recommend something light and refreshing to balance out the richness of the peppers. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Roasted Asparagus**: Asparagus is a natural pairing with bell peppers, and roasting brings out its natural sweetness. Simply toss asparagus spears with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 12-15 minutes, or until tender.\n2. **Garlic and Lemon Green Beans**: Blanch green beans in boiling water until tender, then toss with minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. This side dish is quick, easy, and adds a burst of citrus flavor to your meal.\n3. **Simple Mixed Greens Salad**: A light mixed greens salad with a vinaigrette dressing helps cut the richness of the peppers. Add some cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, or sliced avocado for extra flavor and texture.\n4. **Roasted Carrot and Zucchini Medley**: Toss sliced carrots and zucchinis with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and lightly caramelized.\n5. **Citrus and Herb Quinoa**: Cook quinoa according to package instructions, then toss with chopped fresh herbs like parsley, basil, or cilantro, and a squeeze of lemon or lime juice. This side dish complements the quinoa in the stuffed peppers and adds a fresh flavor dimension.\n\nChoose one or more of these options to serve alongside your Quinoa Stuffed Bell Peppers. You can't go wrong with these light and refreshing side dishes!\n\nDo you have any questions about these options or would you like more ideas?",
