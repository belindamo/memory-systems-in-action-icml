  "content": "Sure, here's an example Ansible playbook to update the `k8s-master` and `k8s-node1` servers:\n```yaml\n---\n- name: Update servers\n  hosts: \n    - k8s-master\n    - k8s-node1\n  become: true\n\n  tasks:\n    - name: Update packages\n      apt:\n        upgrade: yes\n        update_cache: yes\n      when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'\n\n    - name: Update packages\n      yum:\n        name: '*'\n        state: latest\n      when: ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `hosts`: specifies the servers to be updated, in this case `k8s-master` and `k8s-node1`.\n* `become`: runs the tasks with elevated privileges (sudo).\n* `tasks`: contains the actual update tasks.\n* `apt`: updates packages for Debian-based distributions.\n* `yum`: updates packages for RedHat-based distributions.\n\nNote: This is just an example playbook and may not work for your specific use case. Please modify it as needed to suit your requirements. Additionally, you will need to have Ansible installed and have SSH access to the servers.",
