What is the current month (e.g., January, February, etc.)?\n2. What movies have you watched so far this month? Try to recall as many as you can, and I'll help you organize them.\n\nYou can share the titles, and I'll add them to a list for you. If you remember any additional details like the date you watched the movie, the genre, or your rating (e.g., 1-5 stars), feel free to include those as well.\n\nLet's get started!",
