Some of the more notable ones include the Osprey, which can be seen nesting in the area, as well as the Golden Eagle, which is a rare and elusive bird that can occasionally be sighted in the Cairngorms National Park.\n\nIn addition, the Red Kite is another striking bird of prey that can be seen near Inverness, and the Great Northern Diver is a large, graceful bird that can be seen swimming in Loch Ness. These are just a few examples of the many unique bird species that can be observed in the area.",
