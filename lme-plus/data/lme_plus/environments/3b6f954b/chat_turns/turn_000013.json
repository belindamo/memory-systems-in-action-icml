  "content": "A 4th of July BBQ sounds like a blast! And ribs are an excellent choice for the occasion. I'd be happy to help you with some recipes and tips for smoking ribs.\n\n**Recipe: Classic Smoked Ribs**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 racks of pork ribs (St. Louis-style or baby back ribs work well)\n* 1 cup of your favorite dry rub (see below for a simple recipe)\n* 1 cup of wood chips (hickory, apple, or cherry work well for ribs)\n* 1 cup of barbecue sauce (optional)\n\n**Dry Rub Recipe:**\n\n* 1/2 cup brown sugar\n* 1/2 cup smoked paprika\n* 2 tablespoons chili powder\n* 2 tablespoons garlic powder\n* 1 tablespoon onion powder\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\n**Smoking Ribs Tips:**\n\n1. **Choose the right wood:** Hickory, apple, and cherry woods are popular for smoking ribs because they add a sweet, fruity flavor. You can use wood chips or chunks, depending on your smoker setup.\n2. **Prep the ribs:** Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs (this will help the rub penetrate the meat). Trim any excess fat, and season the ribs with the dry rub, making sure to coat them evenly.\n3. **Set up your smoker:** Preheat your smoker to 225\u00b0F (110\u00b0C). You can use a charcoal or gas smoker, or even a pellet grill with a smoke setting.\n4. **Smoke the ribs:** Place the ribs in the smoker, bone-side down. Close the lid and smoke for 4-5 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C).\n5. **Finish with BBQ sauce (optional):** During the last 10-15 minutes of smoking, brush the ribs with BBQ sauce. This will add a sweet, caramelized glaze.\n6. **Rest and serve:** Once the ribs are done, remove them from the smoker and let them rest for 10-15 minutes. Cut them into individual portions, and serve with your favorite sides, such as coleslaw, baked beans, or grilled vegetables.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to keep the ribs moist by spraying them with water or apple cider vinegar every hour or so.\n* If you're new to smoking, it's better to err on the side of undercooking than overcooking. You can always cook them a bit longer if needed.\n* Consider using a meat thermometer to ensure the ribs reach a safe internal temperature.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm glad to hear you've been grilling non-stop since Mike's BBQ! Have a fantastic 4th of July celebration!",
