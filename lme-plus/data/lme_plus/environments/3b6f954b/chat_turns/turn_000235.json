The university has a main athletic complex that includes a hockey rink, basketball court, volleyball court, and fitness center. These facilities are used by both varsity teams and recreational users.\n\nOne unique feature of USask's athletic facilities is the Griffiths Stadium, which is the home of the Huskies' football team. The stadium can seat up to 6,171 spectators and features a natural grass playing surface, which is relatively rare in Canadian football.\n\nAnother distinctive aspect of USask's athletic facilities is the Physical Activity Complex (PAC), which includes a rock climbing wall and a high-performance training center.
