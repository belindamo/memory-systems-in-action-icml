  "content": "Unlike Spartan men, Spartan women did not receive military training or participate in physical activities such as running or wrestling. However, Spartan women did receive an education in reading, writing, and music, which was quite unusual for women in ancient Greece.\n\nAdditionally, Spartan women enjoyed more freedom and social status than women in other Greek city-states. They were encouraged to exercise and maintain physical fitness, as it was believed that healthy women would produce healthy babies. Spartan women also had greater property rights than women from other city-states, and were able to own land and inherit wealth.\n\nWhile Spartan women did not receive the same military training as men, they were still trained to be strong, resilient, and independent. It was understood that they had an important role to play in ensuring the success of the Spartan state.",
