  "content": "While Spartan men and women did not fight together on the battlefield, there are some instances in ancient Greek history where Spartan women played an important role in supporting the men during times of war.\n\nFor example, during the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BCE), Spartan women were known to have cheered on their husbands and sons as they went off to battle. In one famous instance, Spartan women presented their men with shields and told them to \"come back with them or on them,\" meaning that they should return victorious or die trying.\n\nSpartan women were also expected to be strong and disciplined in times of crisis. There are stories of Spartan women taking up arms and defending their homes against invaders when the men were away at war. While these accounts are often romanticized, they do suggest that women played a role in maintaining the military ethos of Sparta.\n\nOverall, while Spartan men and women did not fight together on the battlefield, they were both expected to display the same values of courage, discipline, and loyalty to the state.",
