However, I can provide some examples of innovative approaches taken by BBC2 in the past.\n\nOne recent trend is the use of interactive online experiences to engage with viewers. For example, BBC2's \"The Twinstitute\" launched an online quiz that lets viewers see how they compare to twins who have undergone scientific tests to determine which lifestyle choices are best.\n\nAnother trend is the use of social media features like Instagram Stories and Facebook Live to provide behind-the-scenes glimpses into the production process. For instance, BBC2's \"The Great British Bake Off\" Instagram account shares behind-the-scenes video content and photos to create excitement around the show.\n\nBBC2 has also been experimenting with user-generated content campaigns, such as its \"BBC Museum of Memories\" campaign, which encouraged viewers to share their memories of BBC programming on social media using the hashtag #BBCTVmemory.\n\nAdditionally, BBC2 has been using social media platforms to engage with global audiences. For example, BBC2's \"Blue Planet II\" Snapchat Discover campaign targeted younger audiences and featured exclusive content that viewers could engage with on the platform.\n\nOverall, BBC2 is always exploring new and innovative ways to engage with its viewers on social media, and it is likely that we will see more creative approaches from them in the future.",
