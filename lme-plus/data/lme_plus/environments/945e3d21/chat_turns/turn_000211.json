I'd be happy to help you find a great coffee shop near your place to help you shake off that jet lag.\n\nTo find the perfect coffee spot, I'll need to know a bit more information from you. Could you please tell me:\n\n1. What city or zip code are you in?\n2. What time are you looking to grab your coffee? Are you looking for a place that opens at 6 am, 7 am, or a bit later?\n3. Do you have a preferred type of coffee or atmosphere in mind (e.g., specialty coffee, cozy, outdoor seating, etc.)?\n\nOnce I have these details, I can provide you with some personalized recommendations to get your caffeine fix and help you adjust to your new time zone!",
