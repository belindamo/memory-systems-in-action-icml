I love the process of creating something from scratch, and the sense of accomplishment when a piece comes together. As for what I hope to express or convey, I'm not sure I have a specific message or theme in mind. I think I'm more interested in evoking a feeling or mood through my art, rather than trying to convey a specific idea or message.",
