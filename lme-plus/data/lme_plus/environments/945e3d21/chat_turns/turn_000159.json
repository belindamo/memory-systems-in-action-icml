You can place the ribs away from the heat source or use a heat deflector.\n3. **Wood chips or chunks:** Add wood chips or chunks to your grill to infuse a smoky flavor into the ribs. Popular options include hickory, oak, and apple wood.\n4. **Resting:** Once the ribs are cooked, remove them from the grill and let them rest for 10-15 minutes. This allows the meat to redistribute the juices and relax, making it more tender and easier to slice.\n5. **Don't overcook:** BBQ ribs are best when they're cooked until they're tender and slightly charred. Avoid overcooking, as it can make the meat tough and dry.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged",
