The tour is a **train ride**, not a walking tour. You'll board a comfortable, open-air train that will take you on a scenic journey through the plantation.\n\n**What to Expect:**\n\nDuring the tour, you'll learn about the history of pineapple farming in Hawaii, the cultivation process, and the different varieties of pineapples grown on the plantation. The train will stop at various points along the way, and your knowledgeable guide will share interesting facts and anecdotes about the plantation.\n\n**Pineapple Fields:**\n\nYou'll get to see the pineapple fields up close and personal, with rows upon rows of pineapple plants stretching as far as the eye can see. You might even get to see pineapple harvesting in action, depending on the time of year and the harvest schedule.\n\n**Scenic Views:**\n\nThe train ride offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside, with the majestic Waianae Mountains serving as a backdrop. You'll also see other crops grown on the plantation, such as papayas, bananas, and coffee trees.\n\n**Ticket Information:**\n\nThe Pineapple Express Tour is a separate attraction from the self-guided tour of the plantation, and tickets are required. You can purchase tickets online in advance or at the Dole Plantation ticket counter. The cost is $12.50 per person, and children under 4 years old are free.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* Wear comfortable clothing and shoes, as you'll be sitting on the train for about 20 minutes.\n* Bring sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses, as the sun can be strong in Hawaii.\n* Don't forget your camera to capture the scenic views and pineapple fields!\n* If you have any mobility issues, please note that the train is not wheelchair accessible.\n\nThe Pineapple Express Tour is a fun and educational experience that's suitable for all ages.
