  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to current data, however, the growth of social media has had both positive and negative impacts on the viewership of BBC2. On the positive side, social media has allowed for greater interaction and engagement with viewers, which can increase interest in BBC2 programming. Additionally, social media can generate buzz around popular shows or events, leading to more people tuning in. \n\nOn the negative side, social media has also provided more competition for traditional television networks like BBC2. Many viewers now turn to social media platforms for their entertainment, news, and information needs, rather than watching TV. This shift in viewing habits can lead to a decline in viewership for BBC2 and other traditional television networks.",
