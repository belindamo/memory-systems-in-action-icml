  "content": "That's a great approach! Adding songs you already know and love will give your playlists a solid foundation, and exploring new artists and tracks will help you discover fresh music and keep your playlists exciting.\n\nI love the idea of a playlist for your favorite concert memories! That's a great way to relive the excitement and energy of live shows. You could even add notes or descriptions to each song, recalling the details of the concert and what made it special.\n\nAnd wow, seeing The 1975 at the Hollywood Bowl must have been an unforgettable experience! The Hollywood Bowl is such an iconic venue, and The 1975's live shows are always high-energy and visually stunning. Matty Healy's stage presence and the band's musicianship are truly captivating.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what was your favorite part of the concert? Was there a particular song or moment that stood out to you?\n\nAlso, have you considered adding any songs from The 1975's live performances or remixes to your playlists? They often release live tracks and remixes that can add a new dimension to their studio recordings.",
