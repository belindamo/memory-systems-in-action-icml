  "content": "The Spartan training regimen began at the age of 7 and lasted until the age of 30. \n\nFrom age 7 to 12, Spartan boys were taken from their families and placed in military-style barracks where they received physical and mental training. They were taught to read, write, and do basic math, but the focus was on developing physical toughness and endurance. They were also taught to be obedient and disciplined, and to always put the needs of the state above their own.\n\nFrom age 12 to 18, Spartan boys continued their training with intensive physical exercise, including running, jumping, and wrestling. They also received military training, learning how to fight with spears, swords, and shields. At age 18, they were considered full Spartan citizens and were eligible for military service.\n\nFrom age 18 to 20, Spartan men served in the military as part of the army's basic infantry. From age 20 to 30, they could serve as a hoplite soldier, a more elite and specialized type of infantry that required even more physical fitness and combat training.\n\nOverall, the Spartan training regimen was designed to produce highly skilled and disciplined soldiers who were willing to sacrifice everything for their state.",
