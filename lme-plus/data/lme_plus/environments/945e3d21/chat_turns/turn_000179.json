  "content": "Yes, there are several anime series that challenge traditional gender roles. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Revolutionary Girl Utena - This series features a female protagonist who challenges gender norms by dressing in masculine clothing and rejecting traditional gender roles.\n\n2. Wandering Son - This anime deals with gender identity and follows two transgender protagonists as they navigate their feelings and struggles.\n\n3. No. 6 - This series features a male protagonist who is not portrayed as overly masculine or dominant, and the relationship between the two male protagonists defies traditional gender stereotypes.\n\n4. Princess Jellyfish - This anime features a cast of female characters who are all unique and complex, breaking away from the traditional portrayal of women in anime.\n\n5. Ouran High School Host Club - This anime subverts traditional gender roles by featuring a female protagonist who disguises herself as a boy to join a male-hosting club.\n\nI hope these recommendations are helpful!",
