However, there have been some societies throughout history that have been compared to ancient Sparta due to their emphasis on military training, discipline, and sacrifice.\n\nOne example is the Prussian state, which emerged in the 17th century in what is now modern-day Germany. The Prussian military was known for its strict discipline and emphasis on sacrifice for the greater good of the state. This included a strong emphasis on physical fitness and martial discipline, as well as a willingness to sacrifice one's personal needs for the needs of the state.\n\nAnother example is modern North Korea, which is often compared to Sparta due to its highly regimented society and focus on obedience and sacrifice for the state. North Koreans are required to undergo military training and are expected to be willing to give their lives for the nation. Critics of the North Korean regime have pointed out the similarities between its emphasis on strict discipline and sacrifice and that of ancient Sparta.\n\nIt is important to note that while there may be similarities between modern societies and ancient Sparta, they are fundamentally different in terms of their political, social, and economic structures.",
