  "content": "Neutral colors like white or gray are excellent choices for a matte finish bottle, as they'll hide fingerprints and stains well. Plus, they're timeless and versatile, so you can easily match them with any outfit or bag.\n\nWhite and gray are both popular choices for Hydro Flask and S'well bottles, and they're often available in both brands' matte finish options. Here's a brief rundown:\n\n* **Hydro Flask**: Hydro Flask's White matte finish is a clean and crisp option that looks great with any style. Their Graphite (gray) matte finish is a bit darker and has a slightly blue undertone, which gives it a sleek, modern look.\n* **S'well**: S'well's White matte finish is a bright, snowy white that's perfect for those who want a clean and minimalist look. Their Onyx (gray) matte finish is a darker, richer gray that adds a touch of sophistication to their bottles.\n\nBoth brands' neutral colors are great options if you want a bottle that won't draw attention to itself but still looks stylish.",
