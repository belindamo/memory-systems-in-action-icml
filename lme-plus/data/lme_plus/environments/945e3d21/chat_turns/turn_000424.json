Don't worry, I've got you covered with some affordable art storage ideas to help you organize your creative space:\n\n1. **Repurposed Containers**: Think outside the box (or container)! Use old plastic bins, wooden crates, or cardboard boxes to store art supplies. Label them so you can easily find what you need.\n2. **Stackable Drawers**: Invest in a set of stackable plastic drawers or shelves. These are great for storing paints, markers, pencils, and other small items. You can find them at most craft stores or online.\n3. **Pegboard**: A pegboard is a versatile and space-saving way to hang frequently used supplies like brushes, canvases, and tools.
