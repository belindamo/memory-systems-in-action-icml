You can list them out, and I'll help you categorize them based on their urgency and importance.\n\nYou can use the following format to share your tasks:\n\nTask 1: [insert task name]\nDeadline: [insert deadline or timeframe]\nDescription: [briefly describe the task]\n\nTask 2: [insert task name]\nDeadline: [insert deadline or timeframe]\nDescription: [briefly describe the task]\n\n...and so on.\n\nOnce you share your tasks, I'll help you prioritize them using the Eisenhower Matrix, which categorizes tasks into four quadrants:\n\n**Urgent & Important (Do First)**\n**Important but Not Urgent (Schedule)**\n**Urgent but Not Important (Delegate)**\n**Not Urgent or Important (Delete)**\n\nLet's get started!",
