I've been trying to educate myself more about anxiety and depression, and it's helpful to have a list of trusted resources to refer to. By the way, I've been noticing that my yoga practice has been helping me feel more grounded and centered, especially on days when I'm feeling anxious. Do you have any tips on how I can incorporate more mindfulness into my daily routine, even on busy days?",
