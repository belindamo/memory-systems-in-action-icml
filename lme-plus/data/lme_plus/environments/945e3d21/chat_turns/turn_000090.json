You can opt for a solid color or a subtle pattern like a small grid or dot.\n3. **Linens or Natural Fabrics**: Linen, cotton, or other natural fabrics in light colors can bring a sense of warmth and coziness to the space. Look for fabrics with a subtle texture or a natural weave.\n4. **Pastel Shades**: Soft pastel shades like pale pink, baby blue, or mint green can add a touch of whimsy and elegance to the space. These colors will also reflect light and maintain the airy feel.\n5. **White or Cream with a Pattern**: If you want to introduce some visual interest, consider a white or cream fabric with a subtle pattern like a small floral, geometric, or stripe.
