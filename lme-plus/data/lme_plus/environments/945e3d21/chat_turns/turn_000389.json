I've got some tips that might help:\n\n1. **Practice, practice, practice**: Aerials require a lot of timing and spatial awareness. The more you practice, the better you'll get at judging distances and timing your jumps.\n2. **Master your boost management**: Learn to control your boost to get the right amount of speed and height for your aerials. Practice boosting, flipping, and braking to get a feel for how your car handles.\n3. **Watch pro players**: Watch professional Rocket League players' aerials and analyze their techniques. Observe how they position themselves, time their jumps, and adjust their speed.\n4. **Focus on your camera settings**: Adjust your camera settings to give yourself the best view of the ball and the field. This will help you anticipate the ball's trajectory and time your aerials better.\n5. **Start with lower heights**: Begin with lower-height aerials and gradually work your way up as you get more comfortable. This will help you develop your timing and confidence.\n6. **Use the right car**: Experiment with different cars to find one that suits your playstyle. Some cars, like the Octane, are better suited for aerials due to their speed and agility.\n7. **Play with players who are better than you**: Playing with more experienced players can help you improve by forcing you to up your game.

Don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results \u2013 keep practicing, and you'll eventually start to see improvement.\n\nDo you have a favorite Rocket League mode or playlist?
