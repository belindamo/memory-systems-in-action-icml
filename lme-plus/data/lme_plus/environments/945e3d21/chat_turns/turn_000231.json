A higher engagement rate typically indicates that your content is resonating with your audience.\n\nNow, let's find the reach and impressions for your post in Instagram Insights:\n\n1. Open the Instagram app and go to your profile page.\n2. Tap the three horizontal lines () on the top-right corner to access your menu.\n3. Tap \"Insights\" (it might be labeled as \"Insights and Monetization Policies\" on some accounts).\n4. Scroll down to the \"Content\" section.\n5. Find the post you want to analyze (in this case, your Yosemite post) and tap on it.\n6. Swipe up to see the post's performance metrics.\n7. Look for the \"Reach\" and \"Impressions\" metrics.\n\nReach represents the number of unique users who viewed your post, while Impressions represent the total number of times your post was viewed.\n\nNow, about your follower growth rate:\n\n* 10 new followers per week is a decent growth rate, especially considering you're still in the early stages of building your audience.\n* A steady growth rate indicates that your content is attracting new followers, and your account is gaining visibility.\n\nTo put this into perspective, a growth rate of 1-2% per week is considered good, and 5-10% per week is exceptional. Since you're averaging 10 new followers per week, that's around 5% growth per week, which is a strong start!\n\nTo improve your engagement rates and follower growth, here are some additional tips:\n\n1. **Use Instagram Stories**: Share behind-the-scenes content, sneak peeks, or exclusive deals to keep your audience engaged.\n2. **Collaborate with other accounts**: Partner with similar accounts or influencers in your niche to reach new audiences.\n3. **Run a contest or giveaway**: Host a contest or giveaway to encourage engagement and attract new followers.\n4. **Utilize Instagram's features**: Experiment with Instagram's features like IGTV, Reels, and Shopping to diversify your content and attract new followers.\n5. **Optimize your profile**: Make sure your profile is complete, including a profile picture, bio, and contact information, to help new followers find and engage with you.\n\nKeep in mind that Instagram's algorithm favors accounts with high engagement rates, so focus on creating content that resonates with your audience. By doing so, you'll increase your chances of going viral, attracting new followers, and growing your account.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these strategies to improve your engagement rates and follower growth?",
