I'll definitely check out the Hyatt Regency Greenville for my stay. By the way, speaking of graduations, I just attended my college roommate's PhD graduation ceremony today, and it got me thinking about my own goals and aspirations. Do you think Greenville has any resources or opportunities for professional development or certification courses that I could explore during my trip?",
