Use apps like Freedom, Moment, or StayFocused to track and enforce these limits.\n3. **Create screen-free zones**: Designate specific areas or times of the day as screen-free, such as the bedroom, dinner table, or during family time. This will help you associate these spaces with relaxation and social interaction.\n4. **Schedule screen time**: Allocate specific times of the day for phone usage, such as during your lunch break or after completing a task.
