Here are some tips to help you store them effectively:\n\n1. **Airtight container**: Store the freeze-dried chicken strips in an airtight container, such as a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. This will help to keep air, moisture, and other contaminants out.\n2. **Ziplock bag**: You can also store the strips in a ziplock bag, but make sure to squeeze out as much air as possible before sealing the bag. This will help to prevent moisture from entering the bag and affecting the strips.\n3. **Cool, dry place**: Store the container or bag in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. This will help to preserve the strips' flavor and aroma.\n4. **Away from strong-smelling foods**: Keep the freeze-dried chicken strips away from strong-smelling foods, as they can absorb odors easily.\n5. **Use within a reasonable timeframe**: Try to use the freeze-dried chicken strips within 2-3 months of opening. While they can be stored for longer periods, their flavor and aroma may start to degrade.\n6. **Freezer storage**: If you plan to store the strips for an extended period, consider placing them in an airtight container or ziplock bag and storing them in the freezer. This will help to preserve their flavor and aroma for several months.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Always check the strips for any visible signs of spoilage before using them, such as mold, moisture, or an off smell.\n* If you notice any changes in the strips' texture, smell, or appearance, it's best to err on the side of caution and discard them.\n* Consider dividing the strips into smaller portions and storing them in separate containers or bags to maintain freshness and prevent contamination.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you'll be able to keep your freeze-dried chicken strips fresh and aromatic, and Luna will enjoy them even more during your food hunting games!",
