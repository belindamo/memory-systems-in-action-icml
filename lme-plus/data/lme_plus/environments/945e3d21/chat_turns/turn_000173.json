However, you are correct that younger generations tend to be more active on social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat. As such, it is advantageous for BBC2 to be visible on these platforms and to create content that appeals to younger audiences.\n\nBBC2 has launched various campaigns that aim to engage younger audiences. For instance, its latest TV series, \"Glow Up\", which focuses on aspiring make-up artists, has a strong social media presence, including Instagram and Twitter accounts for fans of the show to engage with. Similarly, the BBC's \"Doctor Who\" series has a dedicated TikTok account that often features behind-the-scenes content and fun filters to engage fans of the show.\n\nOverall, while BBC2 has been active on multiple social media platforms, it may be worth increasing their presence on TikTok and Snapchat, in particular, to appeal to younger audiences. These platforms offer a great opportunity for the BBC to target a demographic that may be less likely to engage with traditional television programming.",
