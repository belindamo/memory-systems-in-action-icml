      "content": "What a fantastic experience! Helicopter tours are an amazing way to see the breathtaking beauty of Hawaii from a unique perspective.

      "content": "Some helicopter tour operators in Hawaii may offer snorkeling trips as part of their packages or as an add-on, but it's not a standard inclusion. If snorkeling is a priority for you, it's best to book a separate snorkeling tour with a dedicated operator. Here's why:\n\n1. **Specialization**: Snorkeling tour operators focus on providing a more in-depth snorkeling experience, with expert guides, high-quality equipment, and a more leisurely pace.\n2. **Time allocation**: Helicopter tours typically have a set duration, and snorkeling might not be a significant part of the tour. A dedicated snorkeling tour allows you to spend more time in the water, exploring the underwater world.\n3. **Equipment and expertise**: Snorkeling tour operators often have specialized equipment, such as wetsuits, snorkeling gear, and flotation devices, which might not be provided by helicopter tour operators.\n\nThat being said, some helicopter tour operators do offer snorkeling as an add-on or part of a package. Here are a few examples:\n\n* **Blue Hawaiian Helicopters**: On their Maui and Big Island tours, they offer a \"Helicopter & Snorkel\" package, which includes a helicopter tour followed by a snorkeling experience.\n* **Island Helicopters**: On their Kauai tour, they offer a \"Helicopter & Snorkel\" package that includes a helicopter tour, followed by snorkeling at a secluded beach.\n* **Maverick Helicopters**: They offer a \"Helicopter & Snorkel\" package on their Oahu tour, which includes a helicopter tour followed by snorkeling at a marine sanctuary.\n\nIf you're interested in snorkeling, I recommend booking a separate snorkeling tour with a dedicated operator. This will ensure you get a more comprehensive snorkeling experience with expert guides and the right equipment.\n\nSome popular snorkeling tour operators in Hawaii include:\n\n* **Molokini Snorkel**: Offers snorkeling tours to Molokini Crater, a crescent-shaped volcanic crater and marine sanctuary off the coast of Maui.\n* **Snorkel Hawaii**: Provides snorkeling tours to various locations, including Honolua Bay and Oahu's North Shore.\n* **Kauai Snorkeling**: Offers snorkeling tours to Kauai's best spots, including the Na Pali Coast and Poipu Beach.\n\nRemember to research and book your snorkeling tour separately from your helicopter tour to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience."
