Take breaks, alternate between drinks and water, and avoid drinking on an empty stomach.\n\n**4.

If you're feeling exhausted, consider taking a power nap during the day to recharge.\n\n**5. Stay Active**:\nMake time for some physical activity, like a morning jog or a visit to the hotel gym. This will help you feel more energized and focused throughout the day.\n\n**6. Bring Essentials**:\nPack a small bag with essentials like pain relievers, antacids, and energy bars. You never know when you might need them!\n\n**7. Designate a \"Party Monitor\"**:\nAppoint someone in the group to keep an eye on everyone's drinking and make sure everyone gets back to the hotel safely. This can help prevent accidents and ensure everyone has a good time.\n\n**8. Take Breaks**:\nLas Vegas can be overwhelming, so make sure to take breaks from the party scene. Take a stroll along the Strip, visit a nearby attraction, or relax by the pool.\n\n**9. Be Sun-Smart**:\nIf you plan on spending time outdoors, remember to wear sunscreen with a high SPF, a hat, and sunglasses. The Las Vegas sun can be unforgiving, so be prepared.\n\n**10.
