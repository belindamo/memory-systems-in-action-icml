Staying at a Disney Resort can definitely enhance your overall experience, especially with the Extra Magic Hours and proximity to the parks.\n\nFor families with young kids, I'd recommend the following Disney Resorts:\n\n1. **Disney's Beach Club Resort**: This resort is a great option for families with kids aged 7 and 9. It's located near Epcot, and the theming is inspired by the classic beach resorts of the 1930s. The Beach Club has a more relaxed, laid-back atmosphere, and the pool area, Stormalong Bay, is a kid's paradise with a lazy river, water slides, and a sandy beach area.\n2. **Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge**: If your kids love animals, this resort is a great choice. The theming is inspired by the African savannah, and the resort is home to over 30 species of animals, including zebras, giraffes, and flamingos. The pool area, Uzima Pool, has a waterslide and a nearby children's play area.\n3. **Disney's Wilderness Lodge**: This resort has a rustic, outdoorsy feel, inspired by the great American wilderness. The pool area, Silver Creek Springs Pool, has a hot tub and a nearby children's play area. The resort is also close to Magic Kingdom, making it a convenient option.\n4. **Disney's Coronado Springs Resort**: This resort is a great option for families who want a more moderate-priced option without sacrificing amenities. The theming is inspired by the American Southwest and Spain, and the pool area, Dig Site Pool, has a waterslide and a nearby children's play area.\n\nAll of these resorts offer various amenities, such as:\n\n* Children's activity centers (e.g., Sandcastle Club at Beach Club, Hakuna Matata Falls at Animal Kingdom Lodge)\n* Kid-friendly dining options (e.g., Cape May Cafe at Beach Club, Boma - Flavors of Africa at Animal Kingdom Lodge)\n* Complimentary transportation to and from the parks\n* Extra Magic Hours (early access to the parks or extended evening hours)\n\nConsider factors like distance to the parks, pool areas, and on-site dining options when making your decision.\n\nIf you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, you might consider Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort or Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground. However, keep in mind that these resorts are a bit farther from the parks, and the theming might not be as immersive as some of the other options.\n\nWhich of these resorts resonates with your family's preferences?",
