That helps to narrow it down.\n\nAt this point, it's a good idea to contact Netflix customer support directly. They can help you investigate further and potentially identify the root cause of the issue. Since you've already checked the basics, they might be able to dive deeper into your account settings, device compatibility, or other factors that could be contributing to the problem.\n\nBefore you reach out to Netflix, you might want to gather some additional information to provide to their support team. This can include:\n\n* The exact error messages you've seen (if any)\n* The device(s) you're using to stream Netflix\n* The specific shows or movies that are affected by the poor video quality\n* Any changes you've made to your Netflix account or device settings recently\n\nWith this information, Netflix's support team can provide more targeted assistance.\n\nIf Netflix support is unable to resolve the issue, they might escalate the problem to a more advanced team or suggest that you contact your ISP. However, since you've already checked your internet speed and it's within the recommended range, it's possible that the issue lies with Netflix's service.\n\nGo ahead and reach out to Netflix customer support, and see what they can do to help you resolve the issue. Good luck, and I hope you get back to enjoying your shows soon!",
