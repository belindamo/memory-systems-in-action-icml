  "content": "As the movers wheeled the large, ornate mirror onto the shipping crate, one of them remarked to the other, \"Did you hear the story about this thing? Supposedly, the last owner claimed it could show you an alternate future where a tragedy didn't happen.\"\n\nThe other man snorted, \"Sounds like hogwash to me. Just a fancy mirror if you ask me.\"\n\nFast forward ten years, and the mirror had made its way across the ocean and was now sitting in the back room of a museum in New York City. One of the employees was standing in front of it, admiring its craftsmanship. \"What a beautiful mirror,\" she said to herself.\n\nA coworker overheard her and walked over. \"You talking about that thing? It's not even on display. Just collecting dust back here.\"\n\nThe first employee was surprised. \"Really? But it's so lovely. It should be out for everyone to see.\"\n\nHer coworker shrugged. \"Not everyone thinks so. And besides, it's not like it's a famous work of art or anything. Just some old mirror.\"\n\nAnother employee walked into the room, joining the conversation. \"Did you guys hear about its history, though? It supposedly belonged to some English family for centuries.\"\n\nThe first employee was intrigued. \"What happened to it?\"\n\nThe second employee shook her head. \"I don't know all the details, but the museum acquired it from an estate sale or something. It's been here for a while now, just sitting in the back.\"\n\nAs they talked, none of them realized the strange power the mirror held. The ability to show an alternate reality where the past had been different. The power to draw people in and make them lose touch with their present. But the mirror didn't need to be on display or well-known to hold its sway over those who happened upon it.",
