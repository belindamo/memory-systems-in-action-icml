Reflect on your feelings: Take some time to think about the reasons behind your feelings of guilt or resentment. Are they based on past experiences or current concerns? Knowing the reasons can help you to develop strategies for moving forward.\n\n2. Communicate openly: Talk to your sibling about how you feel. Expressing your feelings can help you to address them and move forward together. Be honest, respectful, and non-judgmental when sharing your emotions.\n\n3. Practice forgiveness: Forgiveness can help you to let go of resentment and restore trust in your relationship. Try to forgive your sibling for past transgressions, and also forgive yourself for any mistakes you've made in the past.\n\n4. Set healthy boundaries: Setting healthy boundaries can help you to protect your emotional well-being while maintaining a relationship with your sibling. Be clear about what behavior you're willing to tolerate and what you're not.\n\n5. Focus on the future: Instead of dwelling on the past, focus on building a positive future with your sibling. Discuss your shared goals, interests, and priorities, and work together to make them happen.\n\n6. Seek support: Working through complex feelings can be challenging, so consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you to navigate these emotions.\n\nRemember that healing and rebuilding relationships take time and effort. It's okay to take things slow and make progress at your own pace. By being patient, communicative, and open to change, you can work to overcome any lingering feelings of guilt or resentment and strengthen your relationship with your sibling.",
