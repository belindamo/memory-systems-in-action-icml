  "content": "Finding recipes based on ingredients you have at home is a great way to reduce food waste and get creative with your cooking. There are several excellent cooking apps that can help you with that. While I haven't personally used Yummi, I can recommend some popular alternatives:\n\n1. **Yummly**: (Not to be confused with Yummi) Yummly is a highly-rated app that allows you to search for recipes based on ingredients, cooking time, and dietary preferences. It has a large recipe database and a user-friendly interface.\n2. **Allrecipes**: Allrecipes is another popular app that allows you to search for recipes based on ingredients, cooking time, and course type. It also has a large community-driven recipe database and a \"Recipe Finder\" feature that suggests recipes based on ingredients you have at home.\n3. **Paprika Recipe Manager**: Paprika is a comprehensive cooking app that not only allows you to search for recipes based on ingredients but also helps you organize your recipes, plan meals, and make grocery lists. It's available on both desktop and mobile devices.\n4. **Kitchen Monki**: Kitchen Monki is a clever app that helps you find recipes based on ingredients you have at home. It also allows you to add your own recipes, plan meals, and generate grocery lists.\n5. **BigOven**: BigOven is a massive recipe database with over 200,000 recipes. You can search for recipes based on ingredients, cooking time, and course type. It also has a \"Use Up Leftovers\" feature that suggests recipes based on ingredients you have at home.\n\nThese apps are all available for both iOS and Android devices, and most of them offer free versions or trials, so you can try them out before committing to a paid subscription.\n\nBefore choosing an app, consider the following factors:\n\n* Recipe database size and quality\n* Search functionality and filters\n* User interface and ease of use\n* Additional features (meal planning, grocery lists, nutritional information, etc.)\n* Cost and subscription model\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect cooking app for your needs!",
