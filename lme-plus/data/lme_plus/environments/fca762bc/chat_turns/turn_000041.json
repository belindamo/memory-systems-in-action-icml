Oatmeal with banana and almond butter: Oatmeal is a great source of soluble fiber, which can help regulate digestion, and banana and almond butter can add flavor and nutrients. 2. Grilled chicken salad: Grilled chicken is a lean protein source that can be paired with leafy greens, cucumbers, and tomatoes for a tasty salad. 3. Vegetable stir-fry: Stir-frying vegetables is a quick and easy way to incorporate a variety of fiber-rich vegetables into your diet. Use low-FODMAP vegetables such as carrots, bell peppers, green beans, and zucchini. 4. Sweet potato and black bean tacos: Sweet potatoes and black beans are both good sources of fiber and can be paired with corn tortillas and low-FODMAP toppings such as salsa and avocado. 5. Baked salmon with quinoa and vegetables: Baked salmon is a lean protein source that can be paired with fiber-rich quinoa and steamed broccoli or carrots. Just remember to avoid trigger foods and portion sizes that are too big. Start with small portions and monitor how your body reacts. As always, it's important to work with a healthcare provider to develop an individualized plan for managing your IBS symptoms.",
