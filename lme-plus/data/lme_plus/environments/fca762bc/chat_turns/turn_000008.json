I've been feeling more energized since the summer started, and I think it's because I've been taking advantage of the longer days to go for morning jogs. My jog route takes me through the local park, and it's been great to see the blooming flowers and enjoy the fresh air. Do you have any recommendations for some refreshing summer drinks that I can make at home to stay hydrated and energized?",
