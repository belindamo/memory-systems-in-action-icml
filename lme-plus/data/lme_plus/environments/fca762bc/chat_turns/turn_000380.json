You can also try flavored rice, like garlic rice or sesame rice, for added depth.\n2. **Stir-Fried Bok Choy:** Quickly saut\u00e9ed with garlic and ginger, bok choy makes a delicious and healthy side dish that pairs well with the sweet and savory teriyaki sauce.\n3. **Roasted Asparagus:** Asparagus is a natural pairing with teriyaki chicken, and roasting brings out its natural sweetness. Simply toss asparagus spears with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven until tender.\n4. **Grilled Shiitake Mushrooms:** Marinate shiitake mushrooms in a mixture of soy sauce, sake, and sugar, then grill them until tender and slightly charred. They add an earthy flavor and meaty texture to the dish.\n5. **Pickled Ginger:** Thinly slice fresh ginger and soak it in a mixture of vinegar, sugar, and salt for a few hours. Pickled ginger adds a tangy, refreshing contrast to the rich teriyaki sauce.\n6. **Edamame:** Boil or steam edamame until tender, then season with salt and serve as a protein-rich side dish. You can also add them to the stir-fry with bok choy for added texture.\n7. **Cucumber Salad:** Thinly slice cucumbers and combine them with thinly sliced red onions, rice vinegar, and a bit of sugar. This refreshing salad helps cut the richness of the teriyaki sauce.\n\n**Other Ideas:**\n\n* Try serving the teriyaki chicken with a side of miso soup for a comforting and filling meal.\n* Add some crunchy texture with toasted sesame seeds or chopped scallions on top of the chicken or rice.\n* For a more substantial side dish, consider grilled or pan-fried tofu or tempeh, marinated in a similar way to the chicken.\n\nRemember, the key is to balance the flavors and textures of the dish. You can't go wrong with a simple steamed vegetable, but feel free to experiment with these ideas to find your favorite combinations!",
