  "content": "\"I've gone\" is the contraction of \"I have gone,\" which is in the present perfect tense. It indicates that the action of going happened at an unspecified time in the past, and it has relevance to the present.\n\nFor example: \"I've gone to the store\" means that you went to the store at some point in the past, and you are now back, or you are referring to the fact that you are not available to go to the store because you already went.\n\n\"I had gone\" is the past perfect tense, which describes an action that was completed before another past action. It is formed by using the auxiliary verb \"had\" plus the past participle of the main verb.\n\nFor example: \"I had gone to the store before it closed\" means that you went to the store and completed your shopping before it closed, and it emphasizes that this action happened before another past action (the store closing).",
