  "content": "I'm excited to explore more about my Indian roots! Thanks for the recommendations. I think I'll start with reading \"The Discovery of India\" by Jawaharlal Nehru and watching \"The Story of India\" documentary series. I've also been wanting to learn more about Indian cuisine, so I'll definitely try out some Indian recipes and cooking classes. By the way, have you heard about the Parsi community in India? I've heard that they have a unique cultural heritage, and I'm curious to learn more about it.",
