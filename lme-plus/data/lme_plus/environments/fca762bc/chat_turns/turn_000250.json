  "content": "Scientology emphasizes the practice of auditing as a means of achieving a higher level of spiritual awareness and understanding rather than traditional forms of prayer or meditation.\n\nAuditing is a form of one-on-one counseling in which a trained Scientology auditor uses a series of questions and techniques to help individuals overcome negative experiences and emotions that may be holding them back. The process aims to help individuals recognize and overcome past traumas, release emotional burdens, and achieve a greater sense of self-awareness and inner peace.\n\nIn addition to auditing, Scientologists may also use other techniques to achieve spiritual awareness and personal growth. These may include study and application of Scientology principles, participation in training courses, and participation in social betterment programs.\n\nWhile Scientology does not have a traditional concept of prayer or meditation, some Scientologists may still incorporate these practices into their personal spiritual practices. However, these practices are not a central part of the Scientology belief system as they are in other religions.",
