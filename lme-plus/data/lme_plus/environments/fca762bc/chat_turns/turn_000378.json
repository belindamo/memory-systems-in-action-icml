In fact, marinating is a common technique in Japanese cooking to add flavor and tenderize ingredients.\n\n**Marinating Time and Amount of Sauce:**\n\nThe marinating time and amount of sauce you use will depend on personal preference, the type of protein, and the intensity of flavor you desire. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* For chicken:\n\t+ Use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of teriyaki sauce per pound of chicken.\n\t+ Marinate for at least 30 minutes to 2 hours in the refrigerator.\n* For salmon:\n\t+ Use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of teriyaki sauce per pound of salmon.\n\t+ Marinate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour in the refrigerator.\n\nYou can adjust the marinating time based on your schedule and the tenderness of the protein. If you're short on time, even 15-20 minutes of marinating can make a difference.\n\n**Tips for Marinating:**\n\n* Make sure to adjust the amount of sauce according to the size and thickness of the protein. You don't want the sauce to overpower the dish.\n* If you're using a stronger-flavored protein like salmon, you may want to reduce the marinating time to avoid overpowering the fish.\n* Always marinate in the refrigerator, not at room temperature, to prevent bacterial growth.\n* Before grilling or pan-frying, remove the protein from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. This helps prevent flare-ups and promotes even cooking.\n\n**Grilling or Pan-Frying:**\n\nAfter marinating, you can grill or pan-fry the protein to your desired level of doneness. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Grill the protein for 5-7 minutes per side, or until cooked through.\n* Pan-frying: Heat a non-stick skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add a small amount of oil, then cook the protein for 3-5 minutes per side, or until cooked through.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* If you're using a sweet protein like salmon, you may want to reduce the amount of sugar in the teriyaki sauce or balance it with a bit of acidity, like lemon juice or vinegar.\n* Experiment with different ingredients in your teriyaki sauce, like grated ginger or garlic, to create unique flavor profiles.\n* Don't be afraid to adjust the amount of sauce or marinating time based on your personal taste preferences.\n\nNow that you have the basics down, feel free to experiment and adapt the recipe to your taste!",
