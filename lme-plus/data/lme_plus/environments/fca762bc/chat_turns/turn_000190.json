They also offer a more detailed view of your ancestry, showing the proportion of your DNA that comes from each region.\n* **Neanderthal Ancestry**: You'll learn about your Neanderthal ancestry, including the percentage of Neanderthal DNA you inherited from your ancestors.\n* **Chromosome Painter**: This tool allows you to visualize your chromosomes and see which segments of DNA you inherited from your ancestors.\n* **Haplogroups**: 23andMe provides information on your mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome haplogroups, which can help you understand your direct maternal and paternal lines.\n* **DNA Relatives**: You'll have access to a list of DNA relatives, which can help you connect with distant cousins and learn more about your ancestry.\n\n**Comparison to AncestryDNA:**\n\n* **Database size**: 23andMe's database is smaller than AncestryDNA's, with around 10 million users.
