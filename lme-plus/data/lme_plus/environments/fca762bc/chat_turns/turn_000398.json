  "content": "With that information, we can make an educated estimate of the original price of the sneakers.\n\nLet's subtract the price of the TV from your total spending:\n\n$500 (total spending) - $350 (TV) = $150\n\nSince you got 30% off the sneakers, that means you paid 70% of the original price. Let's call the original price \"x\". Then, you paid 0.7x.\n\nWe know that 0.7x = $150, so to find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.7:\n\nx = $150 / 0.7\nx = $214.29\n\nSo, the original price of the sneakers was approximately $214.29. And with the 30% discount, you paid $150.\n\nHere's your updated list:\n\n1. **4K TV** from Best Buy - $350\n2. **Pair of sneakers** from Foot Locker - $214.29 (original price), $150 (discounted price)\n\nDo you think that's everything you bought during the Black Friday sale?",
