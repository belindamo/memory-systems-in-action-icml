  "content": "It is important to understand that education and expertise alone do not provide a complete picture of the impacts of climate change on marginalized communities. Those who are most affected by the impacts of climate change often have lived experiences, on-the-ground knowledge and insights that are not taught in academic institutions. Including these voices with academic and policy expertise ensures a more comprehensive understanding of the issues surrounding climate change.\n\nAdditionally, inclusive decision-making is an essential aspect of democracy that upholds the principles of social justice and fairness. All members of society deserve representation and the opportunity to participate in decisions that impact their lives. Listening only to those with higher education and expertise can lead to decision-making that is disconnected from the needs and concerns of the communities most affected by climate change.\n\nFinally, it is important to recognize that marginalized communities are not homogenous and can possess valuable expertise in areas such as traditional ecological knowledge, co-designing locally-appropriate adaptation strategies and local environmental governance. Their lived experiences with environmental degradation and climate change are unparalleled, based on centuries of cultural knowledge, resilience, and adaptability to changing environments.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of the voices of marginalized communities is critical for creating impactful and equitable climate change solutions, regardless of education levels or expertise. Their experiences and insights are valuable and provide context and nuance that cannot be obtained through academic or policy expertise alone.",
