  "content": "Sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with your Netflix account! I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the problem or guide you through the process of contacting their customer support.\n\nBefore we dive into troubleshooting, I just want to clarify that Netflix and Hulu are two separate streaming services, so the issues you're experiencing with Netflix shouldn't be related to your Hulu account.\n\nTo help you troubleshoot the poor video quality and app restart issues, can you please try the following steps:\n\n1. **Check your internet connection**: Ensure that your internet connection is stable and fast enough to support Netflix streaming. A minimum speed of 5 Mbps is recommended for HD quality and 25 Mbps for 4K.\n2. **Restart your device**: Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve the issue. Try restarting your device, whether it's a smart TV, streaming device, or computer.\n3. **Check for Netflix app updates**: Make sure you're running the latest version of the Netflix app. Check your device's app store for updates.\n4. **Check your Netflix plan**: Ensure that your Netflix plan supports the video quality you're trying to stream. If you're on a lower-tier plan, you might not be able to stream in HD or 4K.\n5. **Check for device compatibility**: Ensure that your device is compatible with Netflix. You can check the Netflix website for a list of supported devices.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you can try contacting Netflix customer support. Here's how:\n\n1. **Visit the Netflix Help Center**: Go to the Netflix Help Center website ([www.netflix.com/help](http://www.netflix.com/help)) and click on \"Contact Us\" at the bottom of the page.\n2. **Choose your issue**: Select the issue you're experiencing from the dropdown menu, such as \"Video quality issues\" or \"App issues.\"\n3. **Start a chat or call**: You can choose to start a live chat with a Netflix representative or request a call back. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your issue, including the error messages you've seen (if any).\n\nIf you'd prefer to speak with a human representative, you can also call Netflix customer support directly at 1-866-716-0414 (toll-free in the US).\n\nI hope this helps, and you're able to get your Netflix account back up and running smoothly!",
