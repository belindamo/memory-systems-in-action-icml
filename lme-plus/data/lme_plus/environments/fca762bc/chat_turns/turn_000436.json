  "content": "The 2015 Luxembourg 2-euro coin commemorating the 15th anniversary of the accession to the throne of Grand Duke Henri is a beautiful coin with a unique design.\n\n**Design:**\n\nThe coin features a portrait of Grand Duke Henri on the obverse (front side), surrounded by the inscriptions \"HENRI - Grand-Duc de Luxembourg\" (HENRI - Grand Duke of Luxembourg) in French and \"15e anniversaire de l'accession au tr\u00f4ne\" (15th anniversary of the accession to the throne) in French and Luxembourgish. The Grand Duke's portrait is depicted in a formal, dignified manner, with a subtle smile.\n\nThe reverse side of the coin features the common 2-euro design, which is the same for all EU countries. This design, created by Luc Luycx, shows a map of Europe, symbolizing the European Union.\n\n**Unique features:**\n\nWhat makes this coin stand out is the unique portrait of Grand Duke Henri, which was designed by the Luxembourgish artist, Alain Hoffmann. The coin's design is a departure from the usual Luxembourgish commemorative coins, which often feature more abstract or symbolic designs. The portrait of the Grand Duke adds a personal touch to the coin, making it a special and collectible item.\n\n**Mintage:**\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the mintage of this coin is only 250,000 pieces, making it a relatively rare and sought-after coin among collectors.\n\n**Collectibility:**\n\nThe 2015 Luxembourg 2-euro coin is an excellent addition to any coin collection, especially for those interested in monarchies, European history, or unique designs. The low mintage and commemorative nature of the coin make it a valuable and scarce item.\n\nIf you're interested in expanding your collection to include more coins from smaller EU countries, I'd be happy to provide more information and recommendations!",
