Check for signs like roots growing out of the drainage holes or the plant becoming top-heavy.\n2. **Repot in the spring or summer**: This is the best time to repot succulents, as they're actively growing and can recover quickly from any shock.\n\n**Choosing the right potting mix:**\n\n1. **Use a well-draining potting mix**: A mix specifically designed for cacti and succulents is a good choice. This type of mix will help prevent waterlogged soil and root rot.\n2. **Avoid regular potting soil**: Regular potting soil can retain too much water and cause root rot in succulents.\n3. **Look for a mix with good aeration**: A mix with perlite, vermiculite, or sand will help with drainage and aeration.\n\n**Tips for repotting succulents:**\n\n1. **Choose a pot that's only slightly larger**: Succulents prefer to be slightly root-bound, so don't move them to a pot that's too large.\n2. **Handle the roots with care**: Gently remove the plant from its pot, taking care not to damage the roots. If the roots are circling or tangled, gently tease them apart with your fingers or a blunt instrument.\n3. **Trim old potting mix**: Remove any old potting mix from the roots, taking care not to damage the roots. This will help prevent the spread of any diseases or pests.\n4. **Add fresh potting mix**: Fill the new pot with fresh potting mix, gently firming it around the roots as you go.\n5. **Water sparingly after repotting**: Water your succulent lightly after repotting, as the plant may be stressed from the process.\n\nSome popular potting mixes for succulents include:\n\n* Miracle-Gro Cactus, Palm & Citrus Potting Mix\n* Black Gold Cactus Mix\n* E.B. Stone Organics Cactus & Succulent Mix\n* Superfly Bonsai Succulent Potting Mix\n\nRemember to always read the label and look for a mix that's specifically designed for cacti and succulents.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to give your succulents the best chance to thrive in their new home.\n\nAnd, yay for giving your snake plant some TLC!
