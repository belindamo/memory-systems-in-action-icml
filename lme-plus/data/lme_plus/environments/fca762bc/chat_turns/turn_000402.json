  "content": "Let's break down your Macy's purchase.\n\nYou spent $200 on three items: a coat, gloves, and a scarf, with a 25% discount. To find the original price, we can calculate the discount amount and then add it to the amount you paid.\n\nDiscount amount = 25% of original price\nDiscount amount = 0.25x\n\nYou paid $200, which is the original price minus the discount amount:\n$200 = x - 0.25x\n$200 = 0.75x\n\nTo find the original price, divide both sides by 0.75:\nx = $200 / 0.75\nx = $266.67\n\nSo, the original price of the three items was approximately $266.67. With the 25% discount, you paid $200.\n\nHere's your updated list:\n\n1. **4K TV** from Best Buy - $350\n2. **Pair of sneakers** from Foot Locker - $214.29 (original price), $150 (discounted price)\n3. **Winter clothing** from Macy's:\n\t* Coat\n\t* Gloves\n\t* Scarf\n\t$266.67 (original price), $200 (discounted price)\n\nDo you think that's everything you've got?",
