  "content": "If you've tried reconnecting and still can't seem to find common ground, it's important to be honest with yourself and your sibling about your expectations for the relationship. It's possible that some relationships can't be repaired or that the distance that has developed over the years is too great to overcome. If you've tried everything you can think of without success, it's okay to acknowledge that your relationship with your sibling may never be the same as it once was. However, it's important to remember that this doesn't mean you can't have a healthy and meaningful relationship on your own terms. Focus on building strong relationships with other family members or friends and find fulfillment in other areas of your life. Remember that healing and rebuilding relationships takes effort and time. Sometimes, it takes longer than we anticipate, and that\u2019s okay. If you ever wish to revisit an attempt at reconciliation, you could try reaching out once more after a reasonable period of time to see if there\u2019s any change.",
