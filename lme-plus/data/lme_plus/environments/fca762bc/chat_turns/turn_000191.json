  "content": "I'm intrigued by 23andMe's ancestry service, especially their focus on African ancestry. Since I've been living in a predominantly Asian-American community for the past three years, I've been more aware of my own cultural heritage and wanting to learn more. Speaking of which, I've been meaning to ask, can you recommend any good resources for learning about Indian culture and history? I've been trying to explore my own roots more, and I'd love some suggestions on where to start.",
