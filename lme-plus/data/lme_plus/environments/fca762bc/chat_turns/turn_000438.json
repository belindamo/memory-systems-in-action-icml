  "content": "The Benelux countries have a rich history and culture, and their coins often reflect that.\n\nBelgium has released several commemorative coins in recent years, showcasing its rich history, cultural heritage, and important anniversaries. Here are a few examples:\n\n**2018:**\n\n* 2-euro coin commemorating the 50th anniversary of the May 1968 student and worker protests\n* 2-euro coin honoring the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I\n* 5-euro coin celebrating the 50th anniversary of the European Monetary Cooperation\n\n**2019:**\n\n* 2-euro coin commemorating the 25th anniversary of the European Monetary Institute\n* 5-euro coin honoring the 500th anniversary of the birth of Gerardus Mercator, a famous Flemish cartographer\n* 10-euro coin celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing\n\n**2020:**\n\n* 2-euro coin commemorating the International Year of Plant Health\n* 5-euro coin honoring the 100th anniversary of the Royal Belgian Mint\n* 10-euro coin celebrating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Belgium during World War II\n\nThese coins often feature unique designs, and some have lower mintages, making them more sought after by collectors. The 2018 2-euro coin commemorating the 50th anniversary of the May 1968 student and worker protests, for example, has a mintage of only 300,000 pieces.\n\nBelgium is also known for its beautiful and intricate coin designs, often featuring cultural icons, historical figures, or architectural landmarks. If you're interested in learning more about specific coins or want to explore other Belgian commemorative coins, I'd be happy to help!\n\nThe Netherlands and Luxembourg also have a rich history of issuing commemorative coins, and I'd be happy to provide more information on those as well.",
