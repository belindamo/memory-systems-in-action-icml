  "content": "I understand that continuing to put effort into a relationship that is not reciprocated can be challenging and exhausting, and it's perfectly valid to feel that way. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, relationships don't work out.\n\nIt's essential to remember that what's important is taking care of your own emotional well-being. If putting energy into a relationship that doesn't bring you positivity or joy hampers your mental health, then it is okay to step back.\n\nThere are different ways to step back in a relationship, including reducing communication or taking a break from contact for a while. The idea is to create a safe space for yourself and to focus on other relationships and activities that give you joy and uplift your outlook.\n\nIt's okay to move on and create a positive future for yourself. I encourage you to put your emotional well-being first and take the time to heal and navigate your feelings.",
