I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have the ability to track your purchases or access your personal information.\n\nBut I can help you create a list of items you think you bought during the Black Friday sale. Please provide me with as much information as you can remember, such as:\n\n* The types of items you bought (e.g., electronics, clothing, home goods, etc.)\n* The stores you shopped at (online or in-store)\n* Any specific brands or products you remember purchasing\n* The approximate dates of your purchases\n\nI can then help you create a list of your Black Friday purchases based on your recollection.",
