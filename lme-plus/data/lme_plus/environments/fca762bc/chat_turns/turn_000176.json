Here are some suggestions to help you streamline the process:\n\n1. **Create a \"Morning Tidy\" Checklist**: Write down the tasks you want to accomplish during your daily tidy, such as:\n\t* Picking up clutter and putting away items\n\t* Wiping down surfaces\n\t* Fluffing cushions and pillows\n\t* Straightening up rugs and mats\n\t* Quick vacuum or sweep (if needed)\n2. **Prioritize High-Traffic Areas**: Focus on the areas that need the most attention, such as the entryway, coffee table, or TV stand. These areas tend to accumulate clutter quickly, so tackling them first will make a big impact.\n3. **Break it Down into Tasks**: Divide your tidy routine into smaller, manageable tasks. For example:\n\t* Spend 5 minutes picking up clutter and putting away items\n\t* Spend 5 minutes wiping down surfaces\n\t* Spend 5 minutes fluffing cushions and straightening up rugs\n4. **Use a \"One-Touch Rule\"**: When picking up an item, try to put it away in its designated place immediately. This will save you time in the long run and prevent clutter from building up again.\n5. **Keep Essential Cleaning Tools Handy**: Store a small caddy or bin with essential cleaning tools, such as a microfiber cloth, all-purpose cleaner, and a small vacuum or duster, in an easily accessible location. This will save you time searching for supplies.\n6. **Make it a Habit**: Try to perform your morning tidy at the same time every day, so it becomes a habit. You can even set a timer to keep yourself on track.\n7. **Get the Family Involved**: If you live with others, consider delegating tasks to each person to make it a team effort. This will not only share the responsibility but also instill a sense of accountability and teamwork.\n8. **Review and Adjust**: After a week or two, review your morning tidy routine and adjust as needed. You might find that certain tasks take longer or shorter than expected, or that you need to add new tasks to your checklist.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, you'll be able to make the most of your 15-20 minutes each morning and maintain a tidy living room. Happy tidying!",
