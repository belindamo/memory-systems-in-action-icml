  "content": "Yes, it is true that AncestryDNA's database has historically been biased towards people of European descent. However, they have been actively working to diversify their database and expand their reference panels to include more diverse populations.\n\nAs of 2022, AncestryDNA claims to have a database of over 15 million users, with a growing representation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including:\n\n* 10% of users identifying as African American or Afro-Caribbean\n* 5% of users identifying as Asian or Pacific Islander\n* 4% of users identifying as Hispanic or Latino\n* 1% of users identifying as Native American or Indigenous\n* 1% of users identifying as South Asian (including Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, etc.)\n\nWhile the database is still not perfectly representative of the global population, AncestryDNA has made significant strides in recent years to improve diversity and inclusion.\n\nNow, regarding the impact of this bias on your results as someone of Indian descent:\n\n* **Reference panels**: AncestryDNA uses reference panels to compare your DNA to and determine your ancestral origins. They have developed specific reference panels for South Asian populations, including Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi populations. These panels are smaller than those for European populations, but they are still robust and regularly updated.\n* **Ancestral origins report**: Your ancestral origins report will likely be less detailed than those for users with European ancestry, simply because there are fewer reference samples to compare to. You may see broader regions or categories, such as \"South Asia\" or \"Indian Subcontinent,\" rather than specific regions or tribes.\n* ** Matches and connections**: You may have fewer DNA matches and connections within the AncestryDNA database, as there are fewer users of Indian descent. However, this doesn't mean you won't find any matches; you may still connect with distant relatives or find matches through common ancestral lines.\n* **Chromosome browser**: The chromosome browser tool allows you to visualize your DNA segments and identify shared DNA with matches. This feature can be helpful in identifying common ancestral origins, even if the reference panels are smaller.\n\nTo maximize the accuracy of your results, consider the following:\n\n* **Upload your DNA to other databases**: You can upload your AncestryDNA results to other platforms, like MyHeritage or FamilyTreeDNA, which may have more diverse databases and different reference panels. This can provide additional insights and connections.\n* **Join Indian-specific DNA projects**: Look for DNA projects or groups focused on Indian or South Asian ancestry, where you can connect with others who share your heritage and collaborate on research.\n* **Combine DNA with traditional research**: Use your DNA results as a starting point and supplement them with traditional genealogical research, such as talking to relatives, exploring historical records, and studying cultural traditions.\n\nKeep in mind that AncestryDNA is continually updating their reference panels and algorithms to improve the accuracy and inclusivity of their results. As the database grows and diversifies, the accuracy of results for users of Indian descent will likely improve.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!",
