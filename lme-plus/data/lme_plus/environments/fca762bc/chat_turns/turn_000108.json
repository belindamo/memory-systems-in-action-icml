  "content": "To make the pressure-sensitive valve activation mechanical rather than electronic, you can use a mechanical pressure switch or a spring-loaded valve directly connected to a pressure release valve. Here's an outline of how it could work:\n\n1. Spring-loaded valve and pressure release valve: Replace the electronic pressure sensor and solenoid valve with a spring-loaded valve that is directly connected to a pressure release valve. The spring-loaded valve will act as a mechanical pressure sensor, while the pressure release valve will control the release of excess air.\n2. Calibration: Calibrate the spring-loaded valve to respond to the desired tire pressure set by the user. The user would set the desired tire pressure using a dial or an adjustable spring tension mechanism. The spring-loaded valve should remain closed during the tire inflation process until the desired pressure is reached.\n3. Valve activation: When the tire pressure reaches the desired value, the spring-loaded valve will open due to the increased pressure acting on the valve mechanism. As the spring-loaded valve opens, it will mechanically actuate the connected pressure release valve, which will open to release excess air from the system, preventing further inflation of the tire.\n4. Valve deactivation: The pressure release valve will close when the spring-loaded valve closes as the pressure inside the tire drops slightly below the desired pressure, stopping the release of air. This ensures that the tire remains at the desired pressure after the excess air is released.\n\nBy using a mechanical linkage between the spring-loaded valve and the pressure release valve, you can create a fully mechanical system that activates the pressure-sensitive valve without requiring electronic components.
