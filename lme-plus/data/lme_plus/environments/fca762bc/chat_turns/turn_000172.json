You can also add or subtract ingredients based on what you have available in your fridge.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a variety of greens to add texture and flavor to your salad.\n* Cherry tomatoes are a great addition because they're bite-sized and sweet.\n* Croutons can be store-bought or homemade (try using cubed bread, olive oil, and seasonings, then bake until crispy).\n* Don't overdress the salad; you can always add more dressing, but it's harder to remove excess.\n\nWhich salad option sounds appealing to you, or do you have any other questions about creating a simple green salad?",
