  "content": "While individuals with higher education and expertise might have a deep understanding of the scientific and policy aspects of climate change, they may not necessarily have the same level of understanding of the cultural, social, and economic impacts of these issues on marginalized communities.  \n\nInvolving marginalized communities in the decision-making process related to climate change is important because it recognizes their lived experiences, voices, and perspectives on the issue. This approach may lead to more comprehensive and integrated solutions that are relevant to their needs and concerns.\n\nFurthermore, decision-making should be accessible and inclusive of marginalized communities, including women, indigenous people, and ethnic and racial groups. Providing support for these communities through capacity-building and education programs will ensure that they can make informed decisions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\nTaking a more inclusive and equitable approach to decision-making related to climate change will improve climate governance, policy decisions, and solutions to the impacts of climate change. It will also foster greater sense of ownership and engagement in the decision-making process, ensuring that the solutions developed are appropriate, equitable and effective.",
