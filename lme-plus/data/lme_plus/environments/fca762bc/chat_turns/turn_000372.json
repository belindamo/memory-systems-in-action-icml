  "content": "Making your own teriyaki sauce from scratch is a great way to avoid added preservatives and sugar, and it's actually quite easy to do. Here's a simple recipe for homemade teriyaki sauce that's free from artificial ingredients and refined sugar:\n\n**Homemade Teriyaki Sauce Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1/2 cup soy sauce (use a good-quality, low-sodium soy sauce)\n* 1/4 cup sake (or dry white wine)\n* 1/4 cup mirin (a sweet Japanese cooking wine) or 2 tablespoons honey\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 2 teaspoons grated ginger\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, sake, mirin (or honey), and brown sugar. Whisk until the sugar has dissolved.\n2. Add the rice vinegar, grated ginger, and garlic to the saucepan. Whisk until well combined.\n3. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly.\n4. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until it has thickened slightly and reduced by about half.\n5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the sesame oil.\n6. Let the teriyaki sauce cool to room temperature before using it or storing it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* You can adjust the amount of sugar to your taste, or use a natural sweetener like honey or maple syrup if you prefer.\n* If you can't find mirin, you can substitute it with a mixture of equal parts water and sugar.\n* For a thicker sauce, simmer it for a few more minutes or add a little cornstarch or flour to thicken it.\n* You can also add other ingredients to customize the flavor of your teriyaki sauce, such as green onions, sesame seeds, or grated daikon radish.\n\nNow that you have your homemade teriyaki sauce, you can use it to make the Teriyaki Chicken recipe I mentioned earlier. Simply marinate chicken breasts in the sauce for at least 30 minutes, then grill or pan-fry them until cooked through. Serve with steamed rice and stir-fried vegetables for a delicious and healthy meal!\n\nHow's that? Do you have any questions about the recipe or any variations you'd like to try?",
