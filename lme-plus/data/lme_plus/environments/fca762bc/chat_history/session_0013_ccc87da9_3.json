      "content": "The Mist Trail to Vernal Fall is an iconic hike in Yosemite, and for good reason. Here's what you need to know about trail conditions, water flow, and accessibility in May:\n\n**Trail Conditions:**\n\n* **Trail status**: The Mist Trail is usually open in May, but it's essential to check the park's website for up-to-date trail conditions before you head out.\n* **Terrain**: The trail is steep, rocky, and uneven, with many stone staircases and narrow passages. Be prepared for a strenuous hike.\n* **Elevation gain**: The trail gains approximately 1,000 feet in elevation over 3.5 miles, making it a challenging hike.\n\n**Water Flow:**\n\n* **Waterfall flow**: May is a great time to see Vernal Fall at its peak flow, thanks to the spring snowmelt. The waterfall will be roaring, and the mist will be intense.\n* **River crossings**: You'll need to cross the Merced River twice on the hike, using footbridges or stepping stones. Be prepared to get wet, as the water level can be high in May.\n* **Stream crossings**: There are several smaller stream crossings along the trail, which may require careful footing or wading.\n\n**Accessibility:**\n\n* **Parking and shuttle**: Parking is limited in Yosemite Valley, especially during peak season. Consider using the park's free shuttle service, which runs regularly from various locations in the valley.\n* **Trailhead access**: The trailhead is located at Happy Isles, which is accessible by shuttle or a short walk from the Curry Village parking area.\n* **Restrooms and amenities**: There are restrooms and potable water at the trailhead, but no amenities along the trail.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Permits**: No permit is required for day hiking, but you'll need to obtain a permit for overnight camping.\n* **Safety**: Be extremely cautious on the trail, especially near the waterfall and river crossings. The mist can make the rocks slippery, and the current can be strong.\n* **Hydration and snacks**: Bring plenty of water and snacks, as the hike can be strenuous and exhausting.\n* **Sun protection**: Don't forget sun protection, including sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses.\n\n**Current Conditions:**\n\nBefore your trip, check the park's website for up-to-date information on trail conditions, water flow, and accessibility. You can also call the park's visitor center at (209) 372-0200 for more information.\n\nRemember to be prepared, stay safe, and enjoy the breathtaking views of Vernal Fall!"
