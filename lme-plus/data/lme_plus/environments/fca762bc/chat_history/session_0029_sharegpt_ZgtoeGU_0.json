In colloquial Chinese, \"\u706f\u6ce1\" can also be used to describe a third-wheel, or someone who is an unwanted or unnecessary companion to a couple or group. In English, the equivalent phrase would be a \"third wheel\" or a \"gooseberry.\" So, if someone says \"\u4ed6\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u706f\u6ce1\", the English translation would be \"He's our third wheel\" or \"He's the gooseberry.\""
