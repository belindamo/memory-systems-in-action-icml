    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to hear rumors or spoilers. However, there have been some official announcements about the High Republic era. We know that it takes place 200 years before the events of the Skywalker saga and will introduce new characters, planets, and adventures. It will include books, comics, and other media, and its focus will be on the Jedi Order and the Republic during its golden age."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I wonder if we'll see any familiar faces from the Star Wars universe in the High Republic era? It would be cool to get some easter eggs or callbacks to the films and TV shows."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It's possible that we may see some familiar faces from the Star Wars universe in the High Republic era, as the timeline is still part of the overall Star Wars canon. However, the focus of this new era is on introducing new characters and storylines, so it may not rely heavily on callbacks or Easter eggs. That being said, the creators of the High Republic have mentioned that there may be some connections to the wider Star Wars universe, so there could be some surprises in store for fans."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I'm curious to see how the Jedi Order is portrayed in the High Republic era. Will they be more traditional and conservative or will there be some changes to their practices and beliefs? It would be interesting to see how they evolve over time."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, it will be interesting to see how the Jedi Order is portrayed in the High Republic era. The Jedi during this time are said to be at the height of their power, and it's possible that they may have slightly different beliefs and practices compared to what we see in the Skywalker saga. For example, some early reports have suggested that the Jedi of the High Republic may have a more proactive role in maintaining peace and order in the galaxy. However, until we get more details about the new era, it's hard to say for certain how the Order will be portrayed."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I also wonder if the Sith will play a role in the High Republic era. Will we see any conflicts between the Jedi and the Sith during this time? It could add an interesting dynamic to the storytelling."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "While there are no official announcements yet, it's possible that the Sith could play a role in the High Republic era. This is because the Sith have always been the primary antagonists of the Jedi in the Star Wars universe. However, the time period of the High Republic is before the rise of the Empire that largely destroyed the Jedi Order, so it's also possible that there may be other threats and conflict in the galaxy. Regardless, it will be interesting to see how the storytelling unfolds in this new era."
