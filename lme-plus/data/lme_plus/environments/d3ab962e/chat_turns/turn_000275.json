However, Rasmus Dahlin has shown tremendous potential since he was drafted first overall by the Buffalo Sabres in 2018. He is considered one of the top young defensemen in the league and has been praised for his skating ability, offensive talents, and overall hockey sense. \n\nDahlin had an impressive rookie season, recording 44 points in 82 games and earning a spot on the NHL All-Rookie Team. While his production dipped a bit during his second season, he still displayed flashes of the potential that has many experts believing that he could be a future Norris Trophy winner. \n\nIf Dahlin continues to develop at his current rate, there's no doubt that he has the potential to become one of the top defensemen in the league and a true superstar in the years to come.",
