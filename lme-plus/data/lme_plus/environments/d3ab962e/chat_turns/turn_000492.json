The fort has a restaurant called the Chokelao Mahal Terrace, which serves delicious local cuisine with incredible views of the city. The restaurant is located on the rooftop, and offers both indoor and outdoor seating options. In addition, there is a caf\u00e9 located in the fort that offers snacks and light refreshments, like tea, coffee, and sandwiches. So, you don\u2019t need to bring your own snacks, as there are plenty of food options available within the fort itself. However, if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, it's always best to check with the restaurant in advance to see if they can accommodate your needs.",
