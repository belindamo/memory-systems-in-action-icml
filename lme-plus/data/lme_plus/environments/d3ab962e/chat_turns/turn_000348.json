  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can tell you that media representation of women has evolved over time. While many classic films and TV shows often presented women as static, one-dimensional characters, modern media has made strides in portraying women as complex and nuanced individuals with their own hopes, fears, and desires. In recent years, we have seen a rise in powerful female characters on screen, from Katniss Everdeen in \"The Hunger Games\" to Ruth Bader Ginsberg in \"On the Basis of Sex\" to multiple characters in the hit TV series \"Game of Thrones\". These characters are not only multidimensional but also diverse, representing a range of genders, races, and orientations. While there's still progress to be made, it is clear that modern media is becoming more intentional about portraying women as fully realized human beings, rather than mere supporting characters in a man's story.",
