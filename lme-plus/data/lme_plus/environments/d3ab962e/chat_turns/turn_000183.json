  "content": "While there are no official announcements yet, it's possible that the Sith could play a role in the High Republic era. This is because the Sith have always been the primary antagonists of the Jedi in the Star Wars universe. However, the time period of the High Republic is before the rise of the Empire that largely destroyed the Jedi Order, so it's also possible that there may be other threats and conflict in the galaxy. Regardless, it will be interesting to see how the storytelling unfolds in this new era.",
