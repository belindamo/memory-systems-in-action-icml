  "content": "Wukong's grip tightens around MK's neck as he levels a fierce glare at Macaque. \"Back off, or I'll snap the kid's neck,\" he growls, his eyes locked onto Macaque's.\n\nMacaque hesitates, torn between his desire to help the child and his fear of endangering him further. \"Let him go, Wukong. This isn't necessary,\" he says, his voice low and steady.\n\n\"You should have thought of that before you attacked me,\" Wukong snarls. \"Now I'm going to make sure you regret it.\"\n\nWith a sudden movement, Wukong swings his staff at Macaque, who manages to dodge but not without leaving an opening for Wukong to strike back. The blow lands squarely on Macaque's chest, knocking him back several feet.\n\nMK cries out in pain as he's jostled around in Wukong's grasp. \"Let me go! Why are you doing this?\" he yells, struggling to free himself.\n\nWukong chuckles darkly. \"You really don't know, do you? You're just a pawn in this game, kid. And you happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\nMacaque staggers to his feet, pain coursing through his body. He grits his teeth and readies himself for another attack, but Wukong simply smirks and disappears into the trees, taking MK with him.\n\nMacaque is left alone, his heart racing with fear and anger. He knows he needs to find a way to rescue MK, but he's not sure where to start. All he can do is hope that the child will be safe in the hands of his captor, and that he'll be able to find a way to free him soon.",
