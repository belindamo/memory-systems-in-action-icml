  "content": "Macaque sees an opportunity and lunges at Wukong, trying to grab MK from his grasp. But Wukong is too fast for him, and he dodges the attack effortlessly. In the scuffle, MK gets a little hurt - a cut on his forehead from hitting a rock - and he winces in pain.\n\nWukong uses the moment of distraction to his advantage and leaps into a nearby tree, still holding MK. \"I warned you, Macaque,\" he says. \"One more move and I'll snap this kid's neck.\"\n\nMacaque stands back, watching helplessly as Wukong disappears into the forest with MK. His fists are clenched, and his eyes burn with rage. He has no idea why Wukong would want to hurt a human child, but he knows he can't let it happen.\n\nHe turns and runs back to the city, hoping to find someone who can help him rescue MK from the clutches of the evil Sun Wukong.",
