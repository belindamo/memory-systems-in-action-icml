However, the Buffalo Sabres have missed the playoffs for several consecutive years, and their chances of making the postseason in the upcoming season will depend on several factors.\n\nOn paper, the Sabres have a talented roster with some promising young players, including Dahlin. They also made some notable offseason moves, such as acquiring Eric Staal in a trade with the Minnesota Wild.\n\nHowever, the team will need to improve in several areas, including their special teams, defensive play, and consistency. They'll also face a tough challenge in a highly competitive Atlantic Division that includes talented teams like the Boston Bruins and Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nUltimately, whether or not the Sabres make the playoffs will depend on a variety of factors, including injuries, team chemistry, and a bit of luck. However, with some improvements, the team certainly has the potential to compete for a playoff spot.",
