Here are a few things that regulators can indicate:\n\n1. Agreement or understanding: Nodding or saying \"mm-hmm\" can be a way for a person to signal that they agree with or understand what is being said.\n2. Disagreement or confusion: Shaking the head or saying \"uh-uh\" can be a way for a person to signal that they disagree with or do not understand what is being said.\n3. Desire to speak: Holding up a hand or saying \"excuse me\" can be a way for a person to signal that they would like to speak.\n4. Attention: Making eye contact or leaning in slightly can be a way for a person to signal that they are paying attention to the conversation.\n5.
