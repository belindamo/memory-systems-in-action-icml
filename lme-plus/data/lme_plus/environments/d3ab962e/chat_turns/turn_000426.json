  "content": "As an AI language model, I can only provide speculation based on popular food trends and what Subway's competitors are doing. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in plant-based options, so Subway could potentially add more vegetarian or vegan options to their menu. They could also consider adding new types of bread, such as gluten-free or sourdough, or offering more breakfast options. Some other fast-food chains have expanded into other categories, such as burgers, wings, or pizza. However, it's unclear whether Subway would follow suit or continue to focus on its core menu offerings of sandwiches and salads.",
