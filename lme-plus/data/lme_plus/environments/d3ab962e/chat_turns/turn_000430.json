  "content": "Absolutely! Subway has always marketed itself as a healthier fast food option, so it makes sense for them to continue to emphasize healthy options on their menu. Adding more whole grains and vegetables to their menu items could be a great way to appeal to health-conscious customers. They could also offer more options for customization, such as allowing customers to replace bread with a lettuce wrap or add additional vegetables to their sandwich or salad. Additionally, they could offer more low-calorie options or provide more information about the nutritional content of their menu items to help customers make informed choices about their meals.",
