  "content": "That's a great idea! Incorporating global flavors and fusion dishes into the menu could be a great way for Subway to appeal to a wider range of customers and add some excitement to their offerings. Subway could consider adding international-inspired items like banh mi sandwiches, shawarma wraps, or poke bowls alongside their classic menu items. Additionally, they could offer regional variations on their classic menu items, such as a Philly Cheesesteak inspired sandwich or a New Orleans-style po' boy. Incorporating these types of options could help Subway stand out from competitors and offers customers more diversity in their dining choices.",
