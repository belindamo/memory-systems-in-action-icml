Improving the quality of their ingredients could be a big way for Subway to differentiate themselves from competitors and appeal to customers who are looking for higher-quality, more natural ingredients. Subway could consider sourcing meats and vegetables that are free from artificial additives and preservatives and prioritize locally-sourced, sustainably-raised and grown ingredients. This would not only improve the taste of their products, but it could also help Subway appeal to customers who care about environmental and ethical issues. By focusing on high-quality, natural ingredients, Subway could build a reputation for offering healthier, tastier, and more ethical fast food options.",
