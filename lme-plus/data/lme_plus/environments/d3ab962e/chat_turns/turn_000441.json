  "content": "I'm thinking of trying out their new buffalo wing flavor, the \"Ghost Pepper\" wings. I've heard they're pretty spicy, so I'm a little nervous but also excited to give them a shot. As for traditions, we usually do a pretty standard \"first touchdown\" shot, where whoever's team scores first gets to assign a shot to the rest of the group. It's always a fun way to get the energy up and get everyone involved.",
