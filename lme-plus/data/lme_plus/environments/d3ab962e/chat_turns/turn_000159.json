  "content": "The primary factors that contribute to the formation of tornadoes are warm, moist air colliding with cool, dry air along a cold front or a dry line, and differences in wind speed and direction at varying altitudes. This creates strong updrafts that can form a rotating column of air called a mesocyclone. If this mesocyclone tightens and the rotation speeds up, a tornado can form.\n\nMeteorologists predict tornado behavior by analyzing various weather conditions such as wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. They also use advanced technology including Doppler radar, satellite imagery, and computer models to track and forecast tornadoes. By monitoring these conditions, meteorologists can issue tornado watches and warnings to alert the public and help minimize the potential impact of these destructive storms.",
