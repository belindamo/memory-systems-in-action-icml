However, it is widely recognized among professionals in various artistic fields that video games have become one of the most influential and relevant arts of our time. The massive growth and success of the video game industry have resulted in increased attention on video game design as a creative and technical field. Video games are often discussed in the same breath as music, film, literature, and other traditional art forms, which has led to a greater appreciation of the artistry of game design.\n\nModern video games incorporate many artistic elements, including music, visual design, storylines, and character development, that blur the lines between traditional and digital artistic mediums. Many game designers today have backgrounds in film and animation, and they bring these skills to their work, resulting in visually stunning and complex games that rival any Hollywood production.\n\nAs video games continue to evolve and push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of immersive storytelling and world-building, there is little doubt that they will continue to gain recognition as a legitimate and valuable form of art.",
