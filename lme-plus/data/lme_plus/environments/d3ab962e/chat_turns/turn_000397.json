I can create a poll with a few topic options and ask my audience to vote, but also leave the comment section open for them to suggest other topics or provide feedback on the options I've given them. That way, I can get a sense of what the majority of my audience is interested in, but also consider other ideas that might not have been on my radar. Plus, it'll give me a chance to engage with my audience and respond to their comments in real-time.",
