Phonology: This is the study of the sounds used in a language, including the individual sounds (phonemes) and the ways in which they can be combined to form words and sentences.\n2. Morphology: This is the study of the internal structure of words, including the way in which smaller units of meaning (morphemes) are combined to form words.\n3. Syntax: This is the study of the rules that govern the way words are combined to form phrases and sentences.\n4. Semantics: This is the study of the meaning of words and sentences, including the relationships between words and the ways in which meaning is conveyed through word choice and sentence structure.\n5. Pragmatics: This is the study of the ways in which language is used in context, including the social and cultural factors that influence language use, and the ways in which language is used to achieve specific communicative goals.\n6. Lexicon: A lexicon is a collection of words and phrases that a language has, it can be considered as the vocabulary of a language.\n\nThese components work together to create a complex system that allows people to communicate effectively in a specific language.
