Involving your audience in the decision-making process can be a great way to increase engagement, build a sense of community, and make them feel more invested in your content. By giving them a say in the topic of your next live stream, you're essentially making them a part of the creative process.\n\nHere are a few ways you can implement this idea:\n\n1. **Polling**: Create a poll with 2-3 topic options and ask your audience to vote on which one they'd like to see. You can use platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or YouTube Live's built-in polling feature to make it easy for your audience to participate.\n2. **Comment section suggestions**: Ask your audience to suggest topics in the comment section of your behind-the-scenes live stream. You can then review the comments and choose the most popular or intriguing suggestions.\n3. **Q&A session**: Host a Q&A session during your behind-the-scenes live stream and ask your audience to suggest topics or ask questions related to potential topics.\n\nBy involving your audience in the decision-making process, you can:\n\n1. **Increase engagement**: By giving your audience a say in the topic, you're encouraging them to participate and engage with your content.\n2. **Build anticipation**: By involving your audience in the planning process, you're building anticipation for the upcoming live stream.\n3. **Create a sense of ownership**: When your audience has a say in the topic, they're more likely to feel invested in the content and share it with others.\n4. **Get valuable feedback**: You'll get valuable feedback from your audience on what they're interested in, which can help you refine your content and create more engaging live streams in the future.\n\nRemember to keep the topic options relevant to your niche and audience, and make sure to give them enough time to vote or provide feedback. You can also consider offering a \"wildcard\" option, where you choose a topic based on their suggestions.\n\nHow do you plan to implement this idea? Are you going to use polling, comment section suggestions, or a Q&A session?",
