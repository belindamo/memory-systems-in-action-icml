Keep in mind that it's essential to read and follow the product instructions, and to test a small, inconspicuous area of the trunk before applying any product.\n\n**Wood Conditioners:**\n\n1. **Minwax Wood Conditioner**: A popular, oil-based conditioner that helps to rehydrate dry wood and reduce cracking.\n2. **Wood Revival**: A water-based conditioner that penetrates deep into the wood to restore flexibility and reduce checking.\n3. **Howard's Feed-N-Wax Wood Conditioner**: A blend of oils and waxes that nourishes and protects the wood, while also leaving a subtle sheen.\n\n**Wood Stabilizers:**\n\n1. **Pegu's Wood Stabilizer**: A two-part epoxy-based stabilizer that helps to consolidate and strengthen weakened or cracked wood.\n2. **System 3's Wood Stabilizer**: A water-based stabilizer that helps to prevent further cracking and shrinkage, while also improving the wood's durability.\n3. **Abatron's WoodEpox**: A two-part epoxy-based stabilizer that bonds and reinforces weakened wood fibers, making it an excellent choice for more severe cases of cracking or decay.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n1. **Linseed oil**: A natural, non-toxic oil that can be used to condition and protect wood. However, it may not provide the same level of stabilization as a dedicated wood stabilizer.\n2. **Tung oil**: A plant-based oil that can be used to condition and protect wood, while also providing a subtle sheen.\n\nRemember to always read the product labels, follow the instructions, and take necessary safety precautions when working with any chemicals. It's also a good idea to test a small, inconspicuous area of the trunk before applying any product to ensure the desired results.\n\nI hope this helps you find the right product for your trunk restoration project!",
