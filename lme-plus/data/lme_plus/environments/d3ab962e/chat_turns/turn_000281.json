But based on their roster and past performance, there are some players on the Buffalo Sabres who could surprise fans with standout performances this season. \n\nOne player to watch is Victor Olofsson, who had a strong rookie campaign last season with 20 goals and 22 assists. He has a great shot and can contribute on the power play, and if he continues to develop his game, he could be a key part of the Sabres' offense.\n\nAnother player who could surprise fans is Jeff Skinner. After a 40-goal season two years ago, he struggled to produce last season with only 14 goals in 59 games. However, Skinner is a talented scorer and could bounce back with a strong season if he can get back to his scoring ways.\n\nFinally, goalie Linus Ullmark could surprise fans with his play in net. He has shown flashes of brilliance in his career so far and could take on a bigger role this season as the Sabres' starting goalie. If he can continue to develop his game and find consistency, he could be a key part of the Sabres' success this season.\n\nOverall, there are several players on the Sabres' roster who could surprise fans with standout performances this season.",
