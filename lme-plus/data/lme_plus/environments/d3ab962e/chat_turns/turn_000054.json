  "content": "It seems like a lot of the options I provided are within your budget and fit your criteria. However, I'd like to ask a few more questions to narrow down the options.\n\nSince you mentioned you want a coffee table with storage, how important is it for you to have a lot of storage space? Are you looking for a table with a large shelf or compartment, or would a smaller storage space be sufficient?\n\nAdditionally, what kind of style are you leaning towards? Do you prefer a more industrial look with metal and reclaimed wood, or a sleeker, more modern design with glass and metal?",
