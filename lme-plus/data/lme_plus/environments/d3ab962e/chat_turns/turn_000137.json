  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have individual views or beliefs, so I cannot say whether it's creepy or not. However, social media platforms do collect a lot of user data, including users' online behavior, which might be considered by some people as creepy. Social media platforms use this data to provide a personalized experience for users and also to target advertising more effectively. However, users can take steps to protect their privacy, such as adjusting their social media privacy settings or using tools like ad blockers or VPNs to limit data collection. It is always important to read the privacy policies of social media platforms and understand what data they are collecting and how they are using it.",
