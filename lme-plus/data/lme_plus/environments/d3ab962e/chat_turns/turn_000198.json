  "content": "Saying that a writing system represents a spoken or gestured language is a way of describing the main function of writing systems, which is to transcribe the sounds, words, or concepts of a language into a written form. This is the most common use of writing systems, and it's why most writing systems were developed after the spoken or gestured language already existed.\n\nIt's also important to note that the development of writing systems is closely linked to the cultural and historical context in which they were created. In ancient times, the main goal of writing systems was to record and preserve the languages of the civilization for administrative, religious, or historical purposes. It was only later that writing systems were used to represent the languages in a more comprehensive way and to serve as a means of communication.\n\nThat being said, there are also some cases where writing systems were developed before a spoken or gestured language, but the main function of writing systems is still to represent the language. Sign languages, for example, have their own writing systems, and their main function is still to transcribe the visual-manual language into a written form.\n\nIn summary, saying that a writing system represents a spoken or gestured language is a way of describing the primary function of writing systems, which is to transcribe the sounds, words, or concepts of a language into a written form. The fact that most writing systems were developed after the spoken or gestured language already existed is a historical fact, but it doesn't change the main function of writing systems.",
