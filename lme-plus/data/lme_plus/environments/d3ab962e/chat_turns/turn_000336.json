  "content": "Sun Wukong holds MK close to his chest, his hand clamped tightly over MK's mouth to keep him from screaming.\n\n\"Back off, Macaque,\" Wukong growls. \"Or the kid gets it.\"\n\nMacaque narrows his eyes at the sight of Wukong holding MK captive. \"What do you want, Wukong?\" he demands.\n\nWukong smirks. \"Just a little fun. But I can't have any fun with you getting in the way. So back off.\"\n\nMK tries to struggle free from Wukong's grip, but the monkey's hold on him is too strong. He looks up at Wukong with terrified eyes, wondering why his hero is doing this to him.\n\nMacaque doesn't move, his gaze fixed on Wukong. \"Let him go, Wukong,\" he says, his voice low and menacing.\n\nWukong laughs. \"Not until you leave. This kid's life is in your hands, Macaque. Don't make me hurt him.\"\n\nMK's heart is racing as he looks back and forth between Wukong and Macaque. He has no idea what's going on or why Wukong kidnapped him, but he can tell from the tension in the air that things are about to get very bad.",
