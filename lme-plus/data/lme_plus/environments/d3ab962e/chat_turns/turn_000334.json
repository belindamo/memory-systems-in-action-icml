  "content": "MK slowly creeps closer to the source of the noise, keeping low and trying to stay out of sight. As he approaches, he sees two figures locked in a fierce battle. He recognizes one of them immediately as Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, and can hardly contain his excitement. He's been a fan of the legendary hero for years and has always dreamed of meeting him in person.\n\nAs the fight rages on, MK watches in awe as Sun Wukong and Macaque trade blows. The power being wielded by the two monkeys is immense, and MK can feel the ground trembling beneath his feet. For a moment, he wonders if he's made a terrible mistake by coming here alone.\n\nDespite his fear, MK can't tear his eyes away from the spectacle unfolding before him. He watches as Sun Wukong unleashes a devastating attack on Macaque, knocking him to the ground. But just as it seems the fight is over, Macaque rises to his feet and charges back at Sun Wukong, renewed determination etched on his face.\n\nMK is caught up in the excitement of the fight, but he has the good sense to stay hidden, not wanting to get caught in the crossfire. As he tries to remain as quiet as possible, MK accidentally steps on a twig, causing it to snap loudly. Sun Wukong hears the noise and immediately turns his gaze towards MK's hiding spot. MK freezes in terror as Sun Wukong spots him and leaps towards him. Sun Wukong grabs MK and pulls him close, his grip tight enough to keep MK from escaping. MK is paralyzed with fear as he looks up at Sun Wukong, unsure of what's going to happen next.",
