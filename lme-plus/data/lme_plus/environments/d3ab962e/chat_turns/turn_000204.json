The terminology I used can be confusing.\n\nA more appropriate way to phrase it would be:\nA writing system represents the concepts of a linguistic system in a written form and a spoken language represents the concepts of a linguistic system in an auditory form.\n\nWhere \"linguistic system\" refers to the set of concepts, grammar, and vocabulary that make up a language and \"writing system\" and \"spoken language\" refer to the means of representation, which are either written or spoken.\n\nI apologize for any confusion my previous answers may have caused, and I will make sure to be more precise with my terminology in the future.",
