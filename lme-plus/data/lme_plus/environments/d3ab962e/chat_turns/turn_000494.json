  "content": "Yes, the Chokelao Mahal Terrace is a perfect spot for a romantic dinner, especially in the evening when the fort is beautifully lit up. It's always recommended to make a reservation in advance, as the restaurant can get busy, particularly during peak tourist season. The restaurant serves dinner from 7:00 pm to 10:30 pm, so plan your visit accordingly. As for the dress code, there is no official dress code for the restaurant, but it's always a good idea to dress smart-casual, especially if you're planning to have dinner there in the evening. The atmosphere at the restaurant is unpretentious and relaxed, so you don't need to worry about dressing up too formally.",
