  "content": "I love that approach! By combining polling and comment section suggestions, you're creating a comprehensive and inclusive way to gather feedback from your audience. This will not only give you a clear idea of what the majority of your audience wants to see, but also allow you to consider other valuable suggestions that might not have been on your radar.\n\nBy leaving the comment section open, you're also encouraging a two-way conversation with your audience, which can lead to some fantastic interactions and insights. Responding to comments in real-time will help you build a stronger connection with your audience, and show them that you value their input and care about their opinions.\n\nHere are a few additional tips to make the most of this approach:\n\n1. **Make the poll options clear and concise**: Ensure that the poll options are easy to understand and relevant to your audience's interests.\n2. **Provide context for the poll options**: Give a brief explanation for each poll option, so your audience understands what to expect from each topic.\n3. **Encourage feedback in the comments**: Ask your audience to share their thoughts, suggestions, or questions related to the poll options or other topics they're interested in.\n4. **Respond to comments and engage with your audience**: Take the time to respond to comments, answer questions, and engage with your audience in real-time. This will help build a sense of community and make your audience feel valued.\n5. **Consider creating a \"wildcard\" option**: As I mentioned earlier, consider adding a \"wildcard\" option to your poll, where you choose a topic based on the comments and suggestions from your audience. This can add an element of surprise and excitement to your live stream.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to gather valuable feedback from your audience, create a sense of community, and deliver a live stream that resonates with your viewers.\n\nHow do you plan to promote your behind-the-scenes live stream and poll to your audience? Will you be using social media, email newsletters, or other channels to get the word out?",
