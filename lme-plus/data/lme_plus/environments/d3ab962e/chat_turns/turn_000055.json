  "content": "I'm glad you asked those questions to help narrow down the options.\n\nRegarding storage, I'd say a smaller storage space would be sufficient for me. I'm not looking for a massive shelf or compartment, but rather a convenient spot to stash a few items like remotes, magazines, or small decorative items. A small drawer, shelf, or compartment would be perfect.\n\nAs for the style, I'm leaning towards a sleeker, more modern design with glass and metal. I like the idea of a minimalist, low-profile coffee table that won't visually clutter the room. A metal base with a glass top would be a great combination for me, as it would add a touch of sophistication and elegance to the space.\n\nI'm not opposed to industrial or reclaimed wood options, but I think they might be a bit too rustic for my taste. I'm aiming for a clean, modern look that will complement my neutral-toned living room.\n\nWith these criteria in mind, do you think you could suggest a few more options that might fit the bill?",
