  "content": "Certainly! Another movie that used lighting and camera angles to make inanimate objects seem scary is the 1963 horror film \"The Haunting.\" In this film, the main focus is on the haunted Hill House, which is filled with creepy furniture, statues, and other inanimate objects. \n\nThe filmmakers use lighting to create shadowy, eerie atmospheres that emphasize the haunting nature of the objects. For example, dimly-lit rooms with flickering candles or low-glow light sources create a sense of mystery and unease. The use of long, continuous shots that follow characters through the rooms also creates an increasing sense of dread.\n\nFurthermore, the camera angles are often used to emphasize the size and otherworldly qualities of the inanimate objects. These shots usually use deep focus that keeps both the objects and the background in focus, creating a sense of spatial depth.\n\nOverall, the use of lighting and camera angles in \"The Haunting\" makes the inanimate objects seem menacing and speaks to the movie's reputation as a gothic horror classic.",
