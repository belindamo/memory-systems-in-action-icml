I think you'll find Provenance to be a fascinating exploration of power dynamics and social hierarchy, and I'm excited to hear your thoughts on it.\n\nAs you read, pay attention to how Leckie weaves together the various plot threads and character arcs to create a rich tapestry of power relationships. Notice how the characters navigate the complex web of alliances, rivalries, and obligations that shape their world.\n\nAlso, keep an eye out for the ways in which Leckie uses the science fiction setting to comment on our own world. Provenance is a novel that's deeply concerned with the ways in which power is exercised and maintained, and how individuals and groups can resist or subvert those power structures.\n\nIf you have any questions or thoughts as you're reading, feel free to reach out to me anytime. I'd love to discuss the novel with you and hear your reactions to it.\n\nHappy reading, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on Provenance!",
