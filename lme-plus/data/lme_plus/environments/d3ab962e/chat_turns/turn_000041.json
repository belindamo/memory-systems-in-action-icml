Provenance is an excellent choice, and I think you'll find it to be a fascinating exploration of power dynamics and social hierarchy in a science fiction setting.\n\nOne of the things that struck me about Provenance is how it takes the themes of power and identity that are central to Ancillary Justice and transposes them into a new setting. While Ancillary Justice is more focused on the imperialistic power structures of the Radchaai Empire, Provenance explores the complexities of power and influence in a more subtle and nuanced way.\n\nIn Provenance, power is exercised through a complex web of relationships, alliances, and cultural heritage. The novel shows how power can be wielded through subtle manipulation, strategic alliances, and the control of information and cultural artifacts. It's a more insidious and pervasive form of power, one that is often exercised behind the scenes and through social norms and expectations.\n\nI think this approach to power dynamics will resonate with you, especially given your interest in The Power by Naomi Alderman. Both novels explore the ways in which power can be exercised and maintained, and how individuals and groups can resist or subvert those power structures.\n\nProvenance also explores the theme of identity in a way that's similar to The Power. Ingray's journey is, in part, a quest for self-discovery and a negotiation of her place within the complex web of relationships and alliances that shape her world. Her experiences raise questions about what it means to be a person, and how our sense of self is shaped by our connections to others and our place in the world.\n\nOverall, I think you'll find Provenance to be a thought-provoking and engaging novel that explores similar themes to The Power in a science fiction setting. I'm excited to hear your thoughts on it!",
