That's a great attitude towards upgrading your gear.\n\nHowever, the autofocus issue with your 18-55mm kit lens might impact its resale value. Here's what you should consider:\n\n**Autofocus issues:**\n\n* **Reduced value**: A faulty autofocus can significantly lower the lens's value. Buyers might be hesitant to purchase a lens with known issues, especially if they're looking for a hassle-free shooting experience.\n* **Disclosure is key**: Be transparent about the autofocus problem when selling the lens. Failing to disclose this information can lead to disputes or even scams.\n\n**Pricing:**\n\nConsidering the autofocus issue, you might need to price your lens lower than a similar lens in good condition. Here are some rough estimates:\n\n* If the autofocus issue is minor and the lens is otherwise in good condition, you might get 10% to 20% of the original retail price.\n* If the autofocus issue is more severe or the lens has other problems, you might need to price it even lower, potentially around 5% to 10% of the original retail price.\n\n**Alternative options:**\n\n1. **Repair or maintenance**: If you're comfortable with DIY repairs or can find a reputable repair service, you might be able to fix the autofocus issue and increase the lens's value.\n2. ** Bundle with other gear**: Consider bundling the 18-55mm kit lens with other gear, like a camera body, flash, or accessories, to create a package deal. This might attract buyers who are looking for a starter kit or additional lenses.\n3. **Donate or repurpose**: If the lens is no longer sellable, consider donating it to a local photography school, charity, or repurposing it as a paperweight or decorative item.\n\n**Selling strategy:**\n\n1. **Be upfront about the issue**: Clearly state the autofocus problem in your listing and provide detailed descriptions and photos.\n2. **Set a competitive price**: Research similar lenses with similar issues and price your lens competitively.\n3. **Target the right audience**: Look for buyers who might be willing to take on a project or are looking for a budget-friendly option.\n\nRemember, honesty is the best policy when selling used gear. Disclose the autofocus issue, and you'll attract buyers who are willing to take on the challenge. Good luck with the sale!",
