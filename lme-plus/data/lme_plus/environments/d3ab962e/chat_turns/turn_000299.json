  "content": "Certainly! One example of a movie that used lighting and camera angles to make a doll seem creepy is the 1988 horror film \"Child's Play\". In this film, the main antagonist is a doll named Chucky, who is possessed by the spirit of a serial killer. \n\nIn many scenes featuring Chucky, low-key lighting is used to create a sense of darkness and foreboding. This lighting is often accompanied by deep shadows and harsh highlights, which serve to emphasize the doll's sinister features. Additionally, the use of low-angle shots creates the impression that Chucky is looming over his victims, making him seem larger and more intimidating.\n\nFinally, close-ups of Chucky's face are used to great effect in creating a sense of unease. These shots allow the viewer to see the doll's expression up close, emphasizing the twisted, malevolent nature of his character. \n\nOverall, the combination of lighting and camera angles in \"Child's Play\" is highly effective in making Chucky seem creepy and unsettling to the viewer.",
