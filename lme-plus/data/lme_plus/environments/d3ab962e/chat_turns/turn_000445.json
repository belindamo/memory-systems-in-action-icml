  "content": "I'm looking for advice on restoring an antique wooden trunk. I recently acquired one from my parents' attic and it needs some TLC. The wood is dry and cracked, and the hardware is rusty. Do you have any tips on how to get started with the restoration process? By the way, I've been searching online for a replacement fork handle ever since I got home from the auction, but no luck so far.",
