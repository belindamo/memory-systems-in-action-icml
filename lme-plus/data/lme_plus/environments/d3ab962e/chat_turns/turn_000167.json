  "content": "Yes, protecting windows from shattering during a tornado is important to prevent injuries from broken glass and to help reduce the amount of debris that can enter your home during the storm. Here are some recommendations for protecting windows:\n\n1. Install impact-resistant windows: The best way to protect your windows during a tornado is to install impact-resistant windows. These are specifically designed to withstand high winds and flying debris. 2. Use storm shutters: If impact-resistant windows are not an option, consider installing storm shutters. These can be made of metal or other materials and are designed to protect windows from high winds and debris. 3. Cover windows with plywood: If you don't have access to impact-resistant windows or storm shutters, the next best option is to cover windows with plywood before a tornado. Plywood should be at least 5/8 inch thick and should be cut to fit each window. 4. Don't open windows: Some people believe that opening windows during a tornado can equalize pressure and reduce damage. However, this is a myth, and opening windows can actually increase the risk of injury from flying debris. Remember, protecting your windows is just one aspect of tornado preparedness. Be sure to follow all safety measures and seek shelter in a safe place during a tornado.",
