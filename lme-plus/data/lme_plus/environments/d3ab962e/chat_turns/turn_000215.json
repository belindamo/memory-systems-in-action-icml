I'm glad I could fit in some self-care time, especially after a crazy day like yesterday when I had a doctor's appointment at 9 am, followed by a conference call at 11 am, and then a meeting with a potential client at 2 pm, and still managed to squeeze in a 30-minute walk around the block to clear my head. Thanks for taking that into consideration. For my report, I'd like to break it down into smaller tasks. Can you help me do that?",
