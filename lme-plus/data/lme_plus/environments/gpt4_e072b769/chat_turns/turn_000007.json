  "content": "Using fresh lime juice will definitely elevate the flavor of your kimchi quesadilla.\n\nFor lime juice, I recommend using a high-quality, 100% lime juice that's free of added sugars, preservatives, and artificial flavorings. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Freshly squeezed lime juice:** If you have the time, freshly squeezing lime juice from ripe limes is the best option.

It's available in most supermarkets and online.\n3. **Santa Cruz Organic Lime Juice:** This USDA-certified organic lime juice is made from fresh, ripe limes and has no added preservatives or flavorings.\n4. **Lakewood Organic Lime Juice:** Lakewood is another reputable brand that offers a 100% organic lime juice with no added sugars or preservatives.\n\nWhen choosing a lime juice, make sure to check the ingredient label and avoid any products with added sugars, artificial flavorings, or preservatives.
