They always encouraged me to take risks and pursue my passions, and I feel like I've been holding back lately. I want to start taking small steps towards doing things that scare me and make me come alive.\n\nI also want to continue to support others who are going through tough times, just like my friend was always there for me. I feel like that's a way to keep their spirit of kindness and compassion alive.\n\nLastly, I want to create a memory book or scrapbook with pictures and mementos from our time together. I think that will help me process my emotions and remember the good times we had.\n\nIt's funny, I was thinking about how my friend always used to make me laugh, and I realized that I haven't laughed as much since they've been gone. I want to make a conscious effort to find joy and humor in life again, even in the tough times",
