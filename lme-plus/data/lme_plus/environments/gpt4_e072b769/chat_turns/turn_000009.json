  "content": "That's the way to go! Freshly squeezed lime juice is always the best option, and it's great that you have limes at home. Squeezing them by hand is a simple process, and it's a great way to get the most out of your limes.\n\nUsing freshly squeezed lime juice will definitely make a difference in the flavor of your kimchi quesadilla. The brightness and acidity of the lime juice will help cut through the richness of the cheese and the spiciness of the kimchi, creating a beautiful balance of flavors.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have fun making your kimchi quesadilla and that it turns out delicious!",
