Speaking of reunions, I also attended a colleague's Ph.D. graduation celebration at the office on June 15th, 2022. It was great to see her so happy and relieved after completing her part-time program. Do you have any advice on how to stay in touch with colleagues and friends after a big milestone like a graduation or a job change?",
