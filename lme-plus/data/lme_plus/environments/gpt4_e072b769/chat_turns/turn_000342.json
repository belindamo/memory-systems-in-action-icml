What do you already have planned, and when are those commitments scheduled?\n\nAlso, what are your top priorities for the week? Are there any tasks or projects that you need to focus on, or any deadlines you're working towards?\n\nLastly, what kind of tasks do you find most energizing and enjoyable, and which ones tend to drain your energy? This will help me suggest a schedule that balances your commitments with your energy levels and priorities.",
