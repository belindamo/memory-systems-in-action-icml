Their calls can be given as a slow succession of chirps during flight or as an alarm call\u2014or strung together into a series that rises in intensity and then falls away, similar to the sound of a whistling kettle taken rapidly off a stove. This second type of call is most often given as an unfamiliar Osprey approaches the nest. As the perceived threat increases, the call can build in intensity to a wavering squeal.\n\nOsprey calls: Types and Meaning\nOspreys give a variety of call types that often have specific meanings. Ornithologists Bretagnolle and Thibault (1993) conducted a field study where they recorded osprey voices and interpreted their most likely meaning based on the associated circumstances and behavior. This article is based on their findings. \n\nWhy do Ospreys call, chirp, and whistle?\nOspreys give calls, chirps, and whistles mainly as a means to communicate with a mate, rival ospreys, and to warn them about the presence of threats. \nThe majority of an osprey\u2019s vocalizations are motivated by interactions between the mated male and female. As the young grow older after egg hatching, the parents communicate increasingly with them. \nThroughout the breeding season, certain interactions may be repeated more often while others decrease in frequency or disappear. Consequently, call types associated with such interactions are given with more or less frequency accordingly.\n\nDo male and female Ospreys make the same calls?\nMale and female ospreys give similar calls and screeches, except for a few types of vocalizations that are given by the female only.\nMost Osprey vocalizations are accompanied by a visual body posture or display. Such visual displays are often subtle and difficult to notice from a distance.\n\nOspreys can be rather loud and vocal\nThe reason why folks living near nesting Ospreys think that they are very loud and vocal is that most Ospreys in North America are here to breed and are constantly interacting during the breeding period. \nOspreys have contact, warning, and alarm calls to keep in touch with each other. Typically, the mated pair vocalizes when they meet again after separating for some time, when the male arrives at the nest, when the male is perched in a tree near the nest, when an intruder flies by the nest, just to give a few examples. \nThey are basically talking with each other as they raise a family and protect their nest and nestling from predators.\n\nTypes and meaning of Osprey calls\nOsprey biologists Bretagnolle and Thibault (1993) distinguish 5 types of calls and assign meaning to them as follows: \n\nAlarm Calls\nAlarm Calls consist of short, clear whistles that fall in pitch. These calls are given by the male and female in the nest, while perched near the nest, and also in flight. Alarm calls are often preceded by an alarm posture by the calling bird. \nAlarm calls are given when a potential predator (non-Osprey) or disturbance (boat, human, vehicle) approaches the nest. \nThe frequency and intensity of alarm calls depend on the type and proximity of what Ospreys perceive as potential predators. The closer the potential threat gets to the nest the louder the calls get. These calls can turn into loud screeches.\nThis type of call is more often given by breeding birds. However, Ospreys on migration also give alarm calls when approached by other ospreys while on their perches. \n\nSolicitation calls (food-begging calls) \nThe solicitation calls consist of a series of rapid short call notes given only by the female mostly in the presence of a male. Solicitation calls are the same as food-begging calls, which are one of the types of calls most frequently heard during the breeding season.\nThe presence of a male elicits these calls, which can vary in pace and intensity according to the distance between the male and the female, and whether the male has a fish or not. \nFemales will also make solicitation calls when the male is perched in a nearby tree. Calls in these circumstances may not be intended to beg for food and their purpose and meaning are unclear. \n\nGuard Calls\nGuard calls consist of a series of high pitch calls interspersed with screeches. These calls are given by both males and females in rather specific situations.\nGuard calls are given when an Osprey that is considered an intruder flies near the nest or perches in a nearby tree. Ospreys do not react to known adjacent nesting neighbors but appear to recognize a bird that does now belong in the area.\nMale and female Ospreys give guard calls as an anticipation signal that may lead to a chase of the intruding birds or a direct fight. If given by the male it means the protection of the female and the nest. If given by the female it means the protection of the eggs or young ospreys.\nThe meaning of Osprey guard calls can be confusing at times as both birds also give it apparently just to communicate when no intruder is within sight.\n\nScreaming\nScreaming calls are long screeching whistles given exclusively during the sky-dance courtship displays that male ospreys perform during the initiation of the breeding season.\nOsprey gives screaming calls as it performs the sky-dance display.\n\nExcited Calls\nExcited calls are basically the same calls as Guard calls but vary in pitch and intensity according to the proximity and nature of the threat.\nOspreys share the nesting and foraging habitat with bald eagles but Ospreys consider Bald Eagles potential predators. Upon detecting a bald eagle near the nest, the male and female start giving guard calls that turn into excited calls if the eagles get too close to the nest.\nUnder circumstances of close imminent threat guard, calls can sound like screams.\nSolicitation calls given by the female (sitting on the eggs) as the male approaches the nest with a fish. Notice how her calls change and become almost a continuous screech as the male is about to land on the nest.\n\nWhy do Ospreys circle in the sky as they make screeching calls?\nOsprey circling in the sky making screeching calls are performing a courtship display known as sky-dance. This display consists of a male performing and undulating, U-shaped flight pattern at al altitude of approximately 900 feet. The bird often carries a fish or a piece of nesting material in its dangling legs as it screeches persistently often for long periods of time. \nBecause most breeding males perform the sky-dance display at the beginning of the breeding season and less frequently during the entire length of the breeding season, this call type attracts the attention of many observers who notice the screaming calls and see the osprey performing a flight that looks different to most observers.\n\nFinal Remarks\nThe reason why ospreys are loud and vocal during the breeding season is that they are involved in activities that demand continuous communication between members of the breeding pair. They have a short window in which to fit building a nest, laying eggs, and raising the young.\n\nCall types can normally be assigned a type. However, calls can overlap in quality and intensity according to the circumstances in which calls are given. For instance, normal guard calls can turn into screeches if the threat is imminent.\nCertain call types are repeated more often than others. The screaming calls given during the sky-dance and solicitation calls are the most frequently heard osprey call types.",
