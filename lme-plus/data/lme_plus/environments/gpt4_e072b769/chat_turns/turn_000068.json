  "content": "For the food, I was thinking of serving a variety of dishes that are both sweet and savory, to cater to different tastes and dietary needs. Since it's a brunch, I'd recommend a mix of breakfast-inspired dishes, sandwiches, salads, and some sweet treats.\n\nFor the format, a buffet-style spread would be a great way to go, as it allows guests to graze and sample different dishes at their own pace. You could set up stations or tables with different categories of food, such as:\n\n1. **Breakfast station**: Offer a selection of quiches, eggs Benedict, breakfast burritos, and pastries.\n2. **Sandwich board**: Include a variety of sandwiches, wraps, and flatbreads, such as cucumber and cream cheese, turkey, ham, or veggie options.\n3. **Salad bar**: Set up a build-your-own salad station with mixed greens, toppings, and dressings.\n4. **Sweet treats**: Offer a selection of muffins, scones, fruit salad, and desserts like brownies or cookies.\n5. **Fruit and cheese table**: Provide a variety of fresh fruits, cheeses, and crackers for a light and refreshing snack.\n\nAs for dietary restrictions, it's essential to consider the needs of your guests. Here are some tips to help you accommodate different dietary preferences:\n\n1. **Vegetarian and vegan options**: Include plenty of plant-based dishes, such as veggie quiches, salads, and sandwiches.\n2. **Gluten-free options**: Offer gluten-free bread, pastries, and snacks to cater to guests with gluten intolerance.\n3. **Dairy-free options**: Provide non-dairy milk alternatives, such as almond or soy milk, and dairy-free yogurt or cheese substitutes.\n4. **Sugar-free and low-carb options**: Include sugar-free desserts and low-carb alternatives, like sugar-free muffins or cauliflower toast.\n5. **Labeling and signage**: Clearly label each dish with ingredients used, so guests with specific dietary needs can make informed choices.\n\nSome specific dish ideas to consider:\n\n* Quiche Lorraine with a gluten-free crust\n* Veggie breakfast burritos with scrambled eggs and avocado\n* Grilled chicken or tofu sandwiches with gluten-free bread\n* Fruit salad with coconut cream or dairy-free yogurt\n* Gluten-free muffins or scones with sugar-free jam or honey\n\nRemember to communicate with your guests about the menu and dietary options in advance, so they can plan accordingly. You could also consider asking guests to RSVP with any dietary restrictions or preferences, so you can accommodate them accordingly.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this help you get started on planning the menu and format for your parents' anniversary brunch?",
