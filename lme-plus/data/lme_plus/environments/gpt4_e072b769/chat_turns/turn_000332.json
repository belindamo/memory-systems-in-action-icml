  "content": "I'm glad you're acknowledging the struggle with grief. It's a complex and non-linear process, and it's normal for it to feel like it's not enough to focus on good memories alone.\n\nRegarding your questions about the existence of a higher power, it's a common phenomenon for people to grapple with existential questions and spiritual doubts after experiencing a significant loss. It's as if the rug has been pulled from under your feet, and you're forced to re-examine your beliefs and values.\n\nHere are some resources and thoughts that might help you explore this topic:\n\n1. **Spiritual and existential crisis**: It's essential to recognize that your questions and doubts are valid. You're not alone in this struggle. Many people have faced similar questions and have come out the other side with a deeper understanding of themselves and their beliefs.\n2. **Faith and spirituality**: You might find it helpful to explore different spiritual traditions, philosophies, or religious beliefs. You could read books, attend seminars, or talk to people from various backgrounds to gain a deeper understanding of their perspectives. This might help you find answers or, at the very least, spark new questions that can guide your search.\n3. **Agnosticism and atheism**: It's also important to consider the possibility that you might not find evidence for a higher power or that you might not believe in one. That's okay too. You can still find meaning and purpose in life without a belief in a higher power.\n4. **Meaning-making**: Instead of focusing on the existence of a higher power, you might explore ways to find meaning and purpose in your life. This could involve reflecting on your values, passions, and goals. What gives your life significance, and how can you cultivate more of that in your daily life?\n5. **Grief and spiritual struggle**: It's crucial to acknowledge that your grief and spiritual struggle are interconnected. Your questions about a higher power might be, in part, a response to the pain and sense of injustice you feel due to your friend's passing. It's essential to address both your grief and spiritual doubts simultaneously.\n\nSome recommended resources to explore:\n\n* **Books**:\n\t+ \"A Grief Observed\" by C.S. Lewis (a classic exploration of grief and faith)\n\t+ \"When Bad Things Happen to Good People\" by Harold S. Kushner (a rabbi's perspective on suffering and faith)\n\t+ \"Man's Search for Meaning\" by Viktor E. Frankl (a Holocaust survivor's search for meaning in the midst of unimaginable suffering)\n* **Online resources**:\n\t+ The Grief Toolbox (articles, podcasts, and resources on grief and loss)\n\t+ The Humanist (a website exploring humanism, atheism, and agnosticism)\n\t+ TED Talks on spirituality and existentialism (e.g., \"The power of vulnerability\" by Bren\u00e9 Brown)\n* **Counseling or therapy**: Consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your grief, spiritual doubts, and existential questions.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Your search for meaning and purpose is unique, and it might take time to find what resonates with you.\n\nHow do you feel about exploring these resources and ideas? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or would you like to discuss further?",
