It's a journey that requires patience, self-compassion, and understanding.\n\n**It's wonderful that you're recognizing the importance of appreciating the people in your life.** Impermanence can be a powerful motivator for living more mindfully and cherishing the time we have with loved ones. By acknowledging that our time together is limited, we can cultivate a deeper sense of gratitude and appreciation for the relationships we have.\n\n**Remember that it's okay to still feel a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, and frustration.** Grief is a complex and messy process, and it's normal to experience a mix of emotions as you navigate your loss.\n\n**Keep in mind that you don't have to do this alone.** Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support. Sharing your feelings and experiences with others can help you feel heard, validated, and understood.\n\n**Lastly, be gentle with yourself as you continue to process your emotions and come to terms with your loss.** Remember to practice self-care, engage in activities that bring you comfort and joy, and acknowledge your strengths and resilience.\n\nHow do you think you might continue to honor your friend's memory and legacy in your life? Are there any specific ways you'd like to keep their spirit alive or celebrate their impact on your life?",
