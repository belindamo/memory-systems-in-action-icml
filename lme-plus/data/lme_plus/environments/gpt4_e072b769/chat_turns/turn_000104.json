I'll definitely keep that in mind, especially since I've been to several graduation celebrations recently, including my colleague's Ph.D. graduation celebration at the office on June 15th, 2022. Speaking of graduations, I've been meaning to write a congratulatory message to my high school friend who just graduated from law school. Do you have any tips on how to write a heartfelt and sincere congratulatory message?",
