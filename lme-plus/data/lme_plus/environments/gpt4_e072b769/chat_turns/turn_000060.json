I'd be happy to help you plan a memorable anniversary celebration for your parents.\n\nFor a gathering of 20-30 people, you'll want to consider venues that offer a comfortable and intimate setting. Here are some options to consider:\n\n1. **Private dining rooms at restaurants**: Many restaurants have private rooms that can be reserved for special occasions. This way, you can choose a menu that suits your parents' tastes, and the staff will handle the food and service.\n2. **Event spaces or banquet halls**: These venues often have amenities like tables, chairs, and audio-visual equipment. You can choose a catering service or bring in your own food.\n3. **Community centers**: Community centers, recreation centers, or park districts often have event spaces that can be rented for private events. They may have kitchen facilities, tables, and chairs available.\n4. **Winery or vineyard**: If your parents enjoy wine, consider renting a private room at a local winery or vineyard. Many offer wine tastings, tours, and catering services.\n5. **Backyard or outdoor spaces**: If the weather permits, hosting the event at your home, a family member's home, or a local park can be a lovely option. You can rent tables, chairs, and tents if needed.\n6. **Country clubs or golf courses**: These venues often have private event spaces with scenic views and catering services.\n7. **Brewery or distillery**: Similar to a winery, a brewery or distillery can offer a unique atmosphere and catering options.\n\nWhen selecting a venue, be sure to consider factors like:\n\n* Availability and accessibility for your guests\n* Parking and transportation options\n* Audio-visual equipment and Wi-Fi availability\n* Catering options and restrictions\n* Decoration and theme flexibility\n* Budget and pricing\n\nAs for catering, you can opt for:\n\n* **Full-service catering**: The venue or a catering company provides food, servers, and bartenders.\n* **Drop-off catering**: Food is delivered, and you handle the setup and serving.\n* **Potluck**: Guests bring dishes to share, which can be a fun and interactive way to celebrate.\n* **Food trucks**: A unique option that can add a fun twist to the event.\n\nSince you've been to baby showers recently, you might consider incorporating some of those ideas into your parents' anniversary celebration. Think about the elements that made those events successful and enjoyable, such as:\n\n* Decorations and theme\n* Food and beverage options\n* Activities or entertainment\n* Guest interaction and mingling opportunities\n\nFeel free to share more about your parents' preferences and interests, and I can offer more tailored suggestions!",
