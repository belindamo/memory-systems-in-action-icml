Considering your background in Vinyasa Flow and your appreciation for your current instructor's attention to detail, here are some recommendations for yoga classes that focus on inversions and arm balances:\n\n1. **Inversion and Arm Balance Workshops**: Look for specialized workshops that focus on inversions and arm balances. These classes are usually 1-2 hours long and provide a more in-depth exploration of these advanced postures. You'll likely learn proper alignment, techniques, and modifications to help you build strength and confidence.\n2. **Advanced Vinyasa Flow or Ashtanga classes**: These classes often incorporate more challenging postures, including inversions and arm balances. They'll help you build strength, endurance, and technique, which will prepare you for more advanced postures.\n3. **Yin-Yang or Yoga Fusion classes**: These classes often combine the slow, meditative pace of Yin Yoga with the more dynamic movements of Vinyasa Flow or Ashtanga. They may incorporate inversions and arm balances, and the slower pace can help you focus on proper alignment and technique.\n4. **Handstand and Inversion classes**: Some studios offer classes specifically focused on handstands, forearm stands, or other inversions. These classes will provide you with a deeper understanding of the techniques and strength required for these postures.\n5. **Online classes and tutorials**: Websites like YogaGlo, DoYouYoga, and YouTube channels like Dylan Werner Yoga or Fightmaster Yoga offer online classes and tutorials that focus on inversions and arm balances. These can be a great supplement to your regular practice and provide you with additional guidance and inspiration.\n\nBefore taking on these more advanced classes, consider the following:\n\n* **Build a strong foundation**: Make sure you have a solid foundation in basic postures like downward-facing dog, plank, and chaturanga. This will help you build the strength and control needed for inversions and arm balances.\n* **Listen to your body**: Inversions and arm balances can be challenging and may require modifications or rest when needed. Be mindful of your body's limitations and take regular breaks to avoid injury.\n* **Work with a knowledgeable instructor**: Your favorite instructor's attention to detail will be even more important as you explore more advanced postures. Look for instructors who have experience teaching inversions and arm balances and can provide personalized guidance and feedback.\n\nRemember to communicate with your instructor about your goals and any concerns you may have. They can help you prepare for more advanced classes and provide guidance as you progress in your practice. Happy practicing!",
