I've been meaning to reflect more on my readings and identify patterns in my tastes and preferences. By the way, have you heard about Jennifer Weiner's new novel \"Who Did It\"? I attended a book reading event at my local bookstore on February 10th, where she read from her new novel, and it was amazing to discuss the book with other readers in person. I've been a huge fan of her previous books, so it was exciting to meet her and get my book signed.",
