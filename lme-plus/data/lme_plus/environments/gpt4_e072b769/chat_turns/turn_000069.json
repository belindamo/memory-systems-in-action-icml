  "content": "That sounds like a great plan! I think a buffet-style spread with a variety of dishes will cater to different tastes and dietary needs. I'll make sure to include plenty of options for vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, and dairy-free guests.\n\nI like the idea of setting up stations or tables with different categories of food. It'll make it easy for guests to navigate and find what they like. And, of course, labeling each dish with ingredients used will be super helpful for guests with specific dietary needs.\n\nSome of the dish ideas you mentioned sound delicious, especially the quiche Lorraine with a gluten-free crust and the grilled chicken or tofu sandwiches with gluten-free bread. I'll also consider including some sweet treats like gluten-free muffins or scones with sugar-free jam or honey.\n\nI'll make sure to communicate with my guests about the menu and dietary options in advance, so they can plan accordingly. And, I'll ask them to RSVP with any dietary restrictions or preferences,",
