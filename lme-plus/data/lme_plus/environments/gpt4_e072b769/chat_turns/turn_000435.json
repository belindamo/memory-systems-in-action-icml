Here are the questions you asked in the order they were presented:\n\n* \"define: sentience?\"\n* \"What would be a good way to test for sentience in language based models, specifically that implement the cognitive aspects of the self-mirror test, but in a linguistic space and the meta consciousness that emerges from that kind of processing?\"\n* \"Can you give a step-by-step breakdown of how the mirror self-recognition test would be carried out for AI, and what it is testing for exactly?\"\n* \"What is the difference between intelligence and sentience?\"\n* \"How do we determine / assess self-awareness?\"\n* \"what is the working definition of \"self\" in cognitive science?\"\n* \"what is the difference between \"self\" and \"consciousness\" in this context?\"\n* \"is it theoretically possible for an AI to become sentient?\"\n* \"Can we quantify or measure the degree of sentience in an AI, and how?\"\n* \"What is the current scientific consensus on AI sentience?\"\n* \"what context or clarification would help, specifically?\"\n* \"what would be a good way to describe what I have been doing today, in a neuropsychological context?\"\n* \"Could you go back and find each ? and look at what the words before them were testing.\"\n* \"please parse our conversation and print out each sentence preceding a \"?\"\"\n\nI hope this satisfies your request. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
