Avoid disrupting their performance or distracting them from their audience.\n2. **Observe and wait:** Watch the performer's routine and wait for the right moment to take a shot. This will help you capture the peak of their performance and avoid disturbing them.\n3. **Make eye contact and smile:** Before taking a photo, make eye contact with the performer and smile. This helps break the ice and shows you're approachable.\n4. **Ask permission (optional):** If you want to take a close-up or portrait shot, consider asking the performer's permission.

This will help tell a more complete story.\n8. **Respect their boundaries:** If a performer indicates they don't want to be photographed or asks you to stop, respect their wishes and move on.\n9. **Be prepared for a variety of reactions:** Some performers might be thrilled to be photographed, while others might be more hesitant. Be prepared for different reactions and adapt your approach accordingly.\n10. **Tip them:** If you take a photo and use it for commercial purposes, consider tipping the performer or offering to share the image with them.
