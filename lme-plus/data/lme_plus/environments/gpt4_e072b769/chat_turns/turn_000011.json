  "content": "What a great idea! Mexican street corn, or elote, is a perfect side dish to pair with your kimchi quesadilla. It's a classic Mexican street food that's easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4-6 ears of corn, husked and silked\n* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise\n* 1/4 cup grated cotija cheese (or feta or Parmesan as a substitute)\n* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)\n* 1/2 teaspoon lime juice\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish\n* 1 lime, cut into wedges, for serving\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Grill the corn:** Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Grill the corn ears for about 10-12 minutes, turning every 2-3 minutes, until they're lightly charred and tender.\n2. **Slather with mayonnaise:** Once the corn is grilled, slather each ear with mayonnaise. You can use a brush or a spoon to apply an even layer.\n3. **Sprinkle with cotija cheese:** Sprinkle the grated cotija cheese over the mayonnaise. You can also add a sprinkle of smoked paprika for an extra depth of flavor.\n4. **Squeeze with lime juice:** Squeeze a sliver of lime juice over the corn to add a touch of brightness and acidity.\n5. **Season with salt and pepper:** Season the corn with salt and pepper to taste.\n6. **Garnish with cilantro:** Sprinkle chopped cilantro over the corn for a fresh and herbaceous flavor.\n7. **Serve with lime wedges:** Serve the elote with lime wedges on the side, so everyone can squeeze an extra sliver of juice over their corn.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use high-quality mayonnaise, as it makes a big difference in the flavor.\n* If you can't find cotija cheese, you can substitute it with feta or Parmesan.\n* Smoked paprika adds a nice smoky flavor, but you can omit it if you don't have it.\n* Grilling the corn gives it a nice char, but you can also boil or steam it if you prefer.\n* Elote is best served immediately, so try to time it with the kimchi quesadilla.\n\nThat's it! This recipe makes 4-6 servings, so feel free to adjust the ingredients based on your needs. Elote is a perfect side dish for your kimchi quesadilla, and I'm sure your guests will love it.",
