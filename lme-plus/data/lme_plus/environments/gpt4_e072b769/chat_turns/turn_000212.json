  "content": "Unfortunately, I am not able to browse the web or access images, so I am not able to draw a diagram of the modules for you. However, here is a description of how the different modules might interact:\n\n* The API integration module would handle the integration with the Jira and ServiceNow APIs. This would allow the software to create, read, update, and delete tickets in both systems.\n* The webhooks module would handle the configuration and management of webhooks. When an event occurs in one system (for example, a new ticket is created in ServiceNow), the webhook would trigger the software to take the appropriate action in the other system (for example, creating a corresponding ticket in Jira).\n* The ticket sync module would handle the actual syncing of tickets between Jira and ServiceNow. This would involve storing information about the relationship between tickets in a database, and periodically checking for updates in both systems and propagating any changes to the corresponding tickets in the other system.\n* The user interface module would provide a user interface for managing and configuring the sync between Jira and ServiceNow. This could include features like configuring which Jira and ServiceNow projects should be synced, and which fields should be synced between the two systems.\n* The background job module would handle the execution of the ticket sync process on a periodic basis, checking for updates in both Jira and ServiceNow and propagating any changes to the corresponding tickets in the other system.",
