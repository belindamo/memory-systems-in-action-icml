  "content": "One possible architecture for a software that keeps tickets in sync between Jira and ServiceNow would involve the following components:\n\n1. Integration with the Jira and ServiceNow APIs. This would allow your software to create, read, update, and delete tickets in both systems.\n2. Webhooks to listen for events in one system and trigger actions in the other. For example, you could set up a webhook in ServiceNow that listens for new tickets being created, and when a new ticket is created, the webhook can trigger your software to create a corresponding ticket in Jira.\n3. A database or other persistent storage to keep track of the relationship between tickets in Jira and ServiceNow. This would allow your software to propagate changes made in one system to the corresponding ticket in the other system.\n4. A user interface for managing and configuring the sync between Jira and ServiceNow. This could include features like configuring which Jira and ServiceNow projects should be synced, and which fields should be synced between the two systems.\n5. A background job or other mechanism to periodically check for updates in both Jira and ServiceNow, and propagate any changes to the corresponding tickets in the other system.\n\nOverall, this architecture would involve integrating with the Jira and ServiceNow APIs, using webhooks to listen for events, storing information about the relationship between tickets in a database, and providing a user interface and background job for managing and executing the sync between the two systems.",
