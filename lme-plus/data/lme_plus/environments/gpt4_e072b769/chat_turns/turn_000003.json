I'm sure your guests will love those dishes.\n\nFinding the right ingredients can be a challenge, but it's wonderful that you've already found a store that carries some of the harder-to-find items. Here are some additional tips to help you track down the remaining ingredients:\n\n**For the Korean-Mexican Kimchi Quesadilla:**\n\n* **Kimchi:** You can find kimchi in most Asian markets or well-stocked supermarkets. If not, you can also make your own kimchi at home (there are many recipes online).\n* **Bulgogi beef:** Look for thinly sliced beef (e.g., ribeye or sirloin) in an Asian market or a high-end supermarket. You can also substitute with thinly sliced beef strips from a regular supermarket.\n* **Gochujang (Korean chili paste):** This can be found in Asian markets or online. If you can't find it, you can substitute with a mixture of gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) and soy sauce.\n\n**For the Moroccan-Chinese Chicken Tagine with Udon Noodles:**\n\n* **Preserved lemons:** These can be found in some specialty stores or online. You can also make your own preserved lemons at home (it's a simple process).\n* **Ras el hanout:** This Moroccan spice blend can be found in some specialty stores or online. You can also create your own blend using a combination of spices like cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, and turmeric.\n* **Udon noodles:** These can be found in most Asian markets or well-stocked supermarkets.\n\n**Online Resources:**\n\n* **Amazon:** Amazon offers a wide selection of international ingredients and spices, including many of the ones mentioned above. You can also check out Amazon's international food sections, such as Amazon's Korean or Moroccan food sections.\n* **Asian markets online:** Websites like Amazon or specialty online stores like Luckyfood.com or HMart.com often carry a wide selection of Asian ingredients.\n* **Middle Eastern or African markets online:** Websites like Amazon or specialty online stores like Kalustyan's or SaharaMart.com often carry a wide selection of Middle Eastern and African ingredients.\n\n**Substitutions:**\n\n* If you can't find a specific ingredient, don't be afraid to substitute with something similar. For example, you can use sriracha instead of gochujang or cumin instead of ras el hanout.\n* Be mindful of the flavor profiles and adjust the amount of seasoning accordingly.\n\nI hope these tips help you find the ingredients you need. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your cooking, and I hope your dinner party is a huge success!",
