Here are some tips to help you organize your photos and videos:\n\n**Photos:**\n\n1. **Create a folder structure**: Create a main folder for \"Graduation Events\" or \"2022 Graduations\" and then subfolders for each individual event, such as \"Colleague's Ph.D. Graduation\" or \"College Reunion.\"\n2. **Use descriptive file names**: Name your files with a descriptive title, including the event name, date, and any notable details (e.g., \"2022-06-15-Colleague-PhD-Graudation-Celebration-Office.jpg\").\n3. **Tag or keyword your photos**: Many photo management software and apps, like Google Photos or Adobe Lightroom, allow you to add tags or keywords to your photos. This helps you quickly search for specific events or people.\n4. **Backup your photos**: Consider backing up your photos to an external hard drive, cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, iCloud), or a photo storage service (e.g., Flickr, SmugMug).\n\n**Videos:**\n\n1. **Use a similar folder structure**: Organize your videos in a similar way to your photos, with a main folder and subfolders for each event.\n2. **Convert videos to a standard format**: If you have videos in different formats, consider converting them to a standard format like MP4 to make them easier to play and share.\n3. **Add descriptive titles and tags**: Add titles, descriptions, and tags to your videos, just like with photos, to make them easily searchable.\n4. **Upload to a video sharing platform**: Consider uploading your videos to a platform like YouTube, Vimeo, or Google Drive to share with others and free up storage space on your devices.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Sync your devices**: Make sure your photos and videos are synced across all your devices, so you can access them from anywhere.\n2. **Create an album or gallery**: Create a shared album or gallery on a platform like Google Photos or Facebook to easily share your photos and videos with others.\n3. **Backup regularly**: Set reminders to regularly backup your photos and videos to prevent loss in case your devices are lost, stolen, or damaged.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to easily find and share your graduation event photos and videos with friends and family.",
