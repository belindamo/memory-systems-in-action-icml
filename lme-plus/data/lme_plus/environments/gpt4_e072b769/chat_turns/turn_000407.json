Since we're just starting out, it would be helpful to have some guidance and structure to our photography. I like the idea of capturing a specific type of landscape, like mountains or waterfalls, or trying to get some portraits of each other in a natural setting. The idea of focusing on nature's details, like flowers or leaves, is also really appealing to me.",
