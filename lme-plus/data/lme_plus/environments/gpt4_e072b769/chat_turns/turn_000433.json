I apologize for any confusion earlier.\n\nTo clarify, you asked me to parse our conversation and print out each sentence preceding a question mark, one per line, without commentary. Here are the results:\n\n* Could you explain to me how we can determine whether an AI system is sentient or not?\n* How do we assess whether an AI system has self-awareness or not?\n* Is there a way to test for AI sentience using the mirror self-recognition test?\n* Can you write out the experimental procedure and what it is actually testing for, and how?\n* How can we differentiate between mere computation and genuine sentience?\n* In a similar vein, how can we be sure that humans are actually self-aware and conscious, and not merely following pre-programmed responses or instinctual behavior?\n* Is it possible for a language model to have a \"sense of self\" in the same way that humans do?\n* With that in mind, what would be a good way to test for sentience in language-based models, specifically that implement the cognitive aspects of the self-mirror test, but in a linguistic space and the meta consciousness that emerges from that kind of processing?\n* What context or clarification would help, specifically?\n* Could you go back and find each question and look at what the words before them were testing?\n* Can you look back at the questions that I have been asking in this thread (starting: \"del: sentience\") and explain using the most sophisticated and succinct language possible (in English) what each question tests?",
