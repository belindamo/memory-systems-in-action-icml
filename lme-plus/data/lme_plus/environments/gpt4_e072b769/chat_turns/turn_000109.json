Here are some tips to help you perfect your form for push-ups, squats, and lunges:\n\n**Push-ups:**\n\n1. **Start in a plank position**: Place your hands shoulder-width apart, with your arms straight and your hands directly under your shoulders. Engage your core by drawing your belly button towards your spine.\n2. **Keep your body in a straight line**: From head to heels, your body should form a straight line. Avoid letting your hips sag or your back arch.\n3. **Lower yourself slowly**: Slowly lower your body until your chest almost touches the ground. Avoid letting your chest bounce off the ground or your elbows flare out.\n4. **Pause at the bottom**: Hold for a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds) at the bottom of the movement.\n5. **Push back up**: Push back up to the starting position, squeezing your chest muscles as you do so.\n6. **Avoid letting your hips rise**: Try to keep your hips in line with your shoulders and ankles throughout the entire movement.\n\n**Squats:**\n\n1. **Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart**: Keep your feet facing forward or slightly outward, with your weight evenly distributed between both feet.\n2. **Keep your back straight**: Engage your core and maintain a straight back, avoiding any arching or rounding.\n3. **Slowly lower yourself**: Slowly lower your body down into a squat, keeping your weight in your heels. Aim to lower down to a depth where your thighs are parallel to the ground.\n4. **Keep your knees behind your toes**: Make sure your knees are in line with your toes, not extending past them.\n5. **Pause at the bottom**: Hold for a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds) at the bottom of the movement.\n6. **Stand up**: Push through your heels to return to the starting position, squeezing your glutes and quads as you do so.\n\n**Lunges:**\n\n1. **Stand with your feet together**: Start with your feet together, taking a large step forward with one foot.\n2. **Keep your front knee behind your toes**: Make sure your front knee is in line with your toes, not extending past them.\n3. **Lower yourself slowly**: Slowly lower your body down into a lunge, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.\n4. **Keep your back knee almost touching the ground**: Aim to lower down to a depth where your back knee is almost touching the ground.\n5. **Pause at the bottom**: Hold for a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds) at the bottom of the movement.\n6. **Push back up**: Push through your front heel to return to the starting position, squeezing your glutes and quads as you do so.\n7. **Alternate legs**: Make sure to alternate legs with each rep to maintain balance and symmetry.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Start with lower reps and sets**: Begin with lower reps and sets and gradually increase as you build strength and endurance.\n2. **Focus on controlled movements**: Move slowly and deliberately through each exercise, avoiding jerky or bouncy movements.\n3. **Engage your core**: Keep your core muscles engaged throughout each exercise to maintain good form and stability.\n4. **Listen to your body**: If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop immediately and adjust your form or consult with a fitness professional.\n\nRemember, proper form and technique take time and practice to develop. Be patient, and don't be afraid to ask for guidance or feedback from a fitness professional if you're unsure.",
