You can expect to come across a fair number of hikers on the trail, but it is not overly crowded. The volume of hikers depends on the time of day and day of the week you are hiking. If you start the hike earlier in the morning, you'll likely encounter fewer people on the trail. The trail is well-marked, and there are plenty of opportunities for rest stops and scenic views.
