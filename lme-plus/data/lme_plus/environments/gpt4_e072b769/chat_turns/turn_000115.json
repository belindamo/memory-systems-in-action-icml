Slowly lift your hips up towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top, and then lower back down.

Lift the weight up, keeping your back straight and your core engaged, and then lower it back down. Focus on squeezing your glutes at the top of the movement. Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 reps.\n3. **Hip Thrusts**: Sit on the edge of a bench or chair with your feet flat on the floor.
