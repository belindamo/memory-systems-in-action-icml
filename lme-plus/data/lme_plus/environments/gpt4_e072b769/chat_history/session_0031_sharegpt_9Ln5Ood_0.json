      "content": "1. What proportion of consumer focused desktop apps require GPU?\nA relatively small proportion of consumer-focused desktop apps actually require a GPU, most notably games and certain 3D modeling software. However, a significant number of everyday tasks such as web browsing, office productivity, video playback, and photo editing can still be performed without a GPU.\n2. What proportion of consumer focused PC apps can utilize GPUs and will work better with them?\nA much larger proportion of consumer-focused desktop apps can take advantage of a GPU and perform better with one. This includes but is not limited to image and video processing, scientific simulations, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n3. Given the 2 dimensions above, how important is having a software defined or physical dedicated GPU in delivering a good PC experience?\nHaving a dedicated GPU can greatly enhance the overall PC experience, particularly for tasks that can take advantage of a GPU's parallel processing capabilities. However, the specific need for a physical dedicated GPU vs a software-defined GPU (such as those offered by Nvidia and AMD) will vary depending on the user's requirements and use-case scenario.\n4. What are the specific advantages and disadvantages of software defined gpus vs physical dedicated gpus?\nAdvantages of software-defined GPUs:\n* They are typically less expensive\n* They can be implemented as an add-on to an existing CPU\n* They typically consume less power\n* They don't require physical installation\n\nDisadvantages of software-defined GPUs:\n\n* They may not provide the same performance as a physical dedicated GPU\n* They can add latency due to the added processing steps\n* They may not support certain features or applications\n\nAdvantages of physical dedicated GPUs:\n\n* They offer better performance\n* They are specifically designed and optimized for graphics processing\n* They have dedicated memory, allowing for faster and more efficient processing\n\nDisadvantages of physical dedicated GPUs:\n\n* They are typically more expensive\n* They require physical installation\n* They consume more power."

      "content": "In the consumer space, some of the most prominent apps that will perform better with a GPU include:\n\n1. Gaming: Games that require intensive graphics processing such as first-person shooters, racing games, and open-world games will perform better with a GPU.\n2. Video Editing and Creation: Video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and DaVinci Resolve will benefit from a GPU's parallel processing capabilities.\n3. 3D Modeling and Animation: 3D modeling and animation software such as Autodesk 3ds Max, Blender, and Maya will perform better with a GPU, especially for tasks such as rendering and simulations.\n4. Photo Editing: Photo editing software such as Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and GIMP can take advantage of a GPU's parallel processing capabilities to speed up tasks such as image manipulation, color correction, and effects.\n5. Scientific simulations: Scientific simulations, such as weather forecasting, computational fluid dynamics, and molecular dynamics, will perform better with a GPU due to the ability to perform complex calculations quickly.\n6. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: AI and ML applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning, will perform better with a GPU, as they are designed to take advantage of a GPU's parallel processing capabilities."
