      "content": "Here is the text: What are your Hobbies?\nIn the last 2 years I have really developed a love for cycling. Injury has curtailed my marathon running journey so I have transferred into cycling. Music bingo is also something else I love to do given my love of music and collecting vinyl. My favourite things to do always involve my friends. Whether that be going to the pool or simply just playing card games, the most enjoyment I get in life comes from spending time with my friends.\n\nWho do you look up to (or admire)? And please explain.\nSir Bobby Charlton and all the other members of the 1958 Munich Disaster. My favourite soccer team is Manchester United and for me, it wasn't enough to follow the team at the present time. I dived into the history of the club and the foundations that led to where the club is today. The 1958 Munich Disaster was a seminal moment in the club's history. A plane carrying the team crashed on the runway trying to take off and most of the team was killed and the few survivors were severely injured. For those who did survive, a couple like Sir Bobby Charlton and Harry Gregg helped carry other team members from the wreckage. A short time later Sir Bobby returned to play for a makeshift Manchester United Team. He was the keystone in the rebuilding of the team who went on to win the 1968 European Cup, the most respected trophy in club football. Sir Bobby Charlton is Manchester United and he represents everything that is great about the club, his greatness in all areas is legendary.\n\nAdam Day is someone I greatly admire as well. He is one of the coaching staff with the Canadian Women's National Soccer Team and was at the Whitecaps when I was a part of their residency program. He has been a real rock in an environment that is extremely hectic and intense. The ability to perform his job at the highest level while also not losing the sense of fun and enjoyment that one should bring to a team environment. When things got tough in camp with the national team, he was always there to help out or be my support system. In a place full of ego and expectation, Adam was the one that would ground everyone and remind them that fun and performance are not mutually exclusive.\n\nWhat was your first job and how old were you when you had that job?\nI was a referee and linesman for soccer games and I started doing this when I was 12 or 13 years old.\n\nWhat do you like most about your most recent place of Employment?\nEveryone's opinion is respected and heard.\n\nWhat do you like least about your most recent place of Employment\nIt can be hard for certain people to commit to meeting times.\n\nWhat is something you would be happy doing everyday for the rest of your career?\nlearning.\n\nWhat do you feel is your greatest strength?\nadaptability.\n\nWhat do you feel is your greatest weakness?\nI can take criticism personally. because I then feel like I have let people down\n\nIf you could have lunch with anyone (dead or alive) who would it be and why?\nEric Cantona, because he was the springboard for Manchester United's success in from the early 90's until now. He is an enigmatic man who is multi-layered and I feel like he would have interesting opinions on a vast array of topics.\n\nWhat advice would you give to society to make it better?\nEverybody is going through something, whether big or small."

      "content": "I would rate the candidate's need for external support at a 70. The candidate mentions that they rely on their friends and mentors for enjoyment and support in both their personal and professional life. They also mention that a mentor, Adam Day, was a \"rock\" for them in a high-pressure environment and someone who helped ground and remind them to have fun. This suggests that the candidate values and seeks out support from others. However, it also suggests that they may struggle to be self-reliant and perform at their best without the support of others."
