Here are some of them:\n\n1. The Central Corridor: Tanganyika has invested in the Central Corridor project, a transport corridor that connects the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania with Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and the eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The corridor includes road, rail, and water transport infrastructure and has helped to reduce transportation costs and boost trade and commerce in the region.\n\n2. The Tunduma-Nakonde Road: Tanganyika has also invested in the construction of the Tunduma-Nakonde Road, a major road link between Tanzania and Zambia. The road is part of the North-South Corridor project, which aims to improve connectivity between Tanzania and the southern African region.\n\n3. The Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA): Tanganyika played a significant role in the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA), which provides a rail link between Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia. The rail line has helped to reduce transportation costs and boost trade between the two countries.\n\n4. The Bagamoyo Port: Tanganyika is also investing in the construction of the Bagamoyo port project, which will provide an alternative to the port of Dar es Salaam and improve the country's connectivity with the rest of the world. The port is expected to be a major gateway to the East African region.\n\nOverall, Tanganyika has made significant investments in infrastructure projects to improve its connectivity with neighboring countries and enhance its trade and commerce. These projects have helped to reduce transportation costs and boost trade, while also strengthening Tanganyika's position as a hub for trade and commerce in East Africa.",
