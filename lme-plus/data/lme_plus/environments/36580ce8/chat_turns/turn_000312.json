  "content": "Sokolov Malopolski is a breed of horse that originated in Poland in the 19th century. The breed was developed by crossing Arabian horses with local mares, and was named after its place of origin, Sokolow Podlaski.\n\nThe breed was initially used as a cavalry mount, but its popularity declined after World War I. In the 1920s, a breeding program was established to improve the breed, and it was renamed Sokolow Malopolski. The breed was further developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1964, the first studbook was established.\n\nToday, the Sokolow Malopolski is a versatile breed used for riding, driving, and light draft work. It is known for its athletic ability, good temperament, and endurance. The breed is relatively rare, with a population of only a few thousand worldwide, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote it.",
