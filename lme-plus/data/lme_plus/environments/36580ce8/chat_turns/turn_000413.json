Here are some popular Korean chili flake brands that are highly regarded by many Korean food enthusiasts:\n\n1. **Sempio**: Sempio is a well-known Korean brand that offers high-quality chili flakes with a deep, rich flavor. They have different levels of spiciness, so you can choose the one that suits your taste.\n2. **Koko**: Koko is another popular brand that offers a range of chili flakes, from mild to extremely spicy. Their flakes are made from high-quality Korean chili peppers and have a nice balance of heat and flavor.\n3. **Chongga**: Chongga is a Korean brand that's been around for over 70 years.

Their flakes are made from high-quality Korean chili peppers and have a nice balance of heat and flavor.\n\nWhen choosing a Korean chili flake brand, look for the following:\n\n* **Origin**: Look for brands that source their chili peppers from Korea, as they tend to have a more authentic flavor.\n* **Spice level**: Korean chili flakes can range from mild to extremely spicy, so choose a brand that offers different levels of heat.\n* **Ingredients**: Make sure the ingredients list only includes chili peppers and maybe some salt. Avoid brands with added preservatives or fillers.\n* **Aroma**: Good-quality Korean chili flakes should have a strong, pungent aroma. If the flakes smell weak or stale, they might not be the best choice.\n\nFor your Korean-Style BBQ Chicken and Spicy Korean Fried Chicken recipes, I'd recommend using a medium to hot level of chili flakes. You can always adjust the heat level to your taste, but it's better to start with a smaller amount and add more heat as needed.\n\nEnjoy your Korean culinary adventures, and I hope you find a chili flake brand that becomes your new favorite!",
