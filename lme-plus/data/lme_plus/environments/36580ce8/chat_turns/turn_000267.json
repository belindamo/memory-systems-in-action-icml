  "content": "The Hanover Smart Energy Challenge was an initiative launched in 2016 to reduce energy consumption, promote sustainable energy practices, and reduce the carbon footprint of Hanover, a town in New Hampshire where Dartmouth College is located. The goal was to engage residents, businesses, and community organizations in reducing their energy consumption and promoting sustainable energy practices.\n\nOne of the primary ways in which the Hanover Smart Energy Challenge sought to achieve its goals was through a series of competitions and events aimed at promoting energy reduction and community engagement. These included events such as the \"50-50 Challenge\" in which Hanover residents and businesses were challenged to reduce their energy consumption by 50%, as well as \"Solarize Hanover,\" which aimed to encourage the adoption of solar energy systems in the community.\n\nTo measure the success of the Hanover Smart Energy Challenge, the town of Hanover and its partners used a variety of metrics, including energy consumption data and feedback from community members. According to the town's 2018 annual report on the initiative, the challenge exceeded its goal of reducing energy consumption by 5%, achieving a 6.95% reduction in town-wide energy consumption from 2015 to 2018. In addition, the report notes that the initiative helped to promote sustainable practices and a culture of sustainability in the community, with many residents and businesses adopting sustainable energy practices both during and after the challenge period.",
