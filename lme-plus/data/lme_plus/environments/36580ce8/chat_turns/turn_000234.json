If you want a bolder, more eye-catching look, white might be the way to go. If you prefer a more understated, versatile option, gray could be the better choice.\n\nKeep in mind that, as a neutral color, both white and gray will show dirt and stains more easily. However, the Ultraboosts are relatively easy to clean, and Adidas offers cleaning products specifically designed for their shoes.\n\nWhich one are you leaning towards, white or gray?",
