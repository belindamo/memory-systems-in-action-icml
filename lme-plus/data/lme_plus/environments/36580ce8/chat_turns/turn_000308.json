  "content": "Yes, that's a great observation. The director Christopher Nolan made a deliberate choice to depict the black and white scenes chronologically, as they serve as markers for the audience to understand the linear progression of events. The color scenes, on the other hand, are in reverse order, and they reveal fragments of Leonard's past experiences in a non-linear fashion. This contrast between the two timelines and the use of the two different color palettes create a striking visual contrast that adds to the overall effect of the film. And, as you said, the confusion and chaos of the color scenes ultimately make sense in the end, which creates a satisfying payoff for the audience.",
