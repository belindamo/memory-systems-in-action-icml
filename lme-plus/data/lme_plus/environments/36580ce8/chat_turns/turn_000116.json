  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to predict the future, but it is unlikely that we will ever be able to eliminate allergens from our food supply completely. The food chain is complex and can be difficult to control, and many food allergens are very common, such as wheat, soy, and peanuts.\n\nHowever, progress is being made to improve food safety and reduce the risk of allergen exposure. New technologies and innovations are being developed to improve food processing, labeling, and testing. And health organizations, advocacy groups, and food industry stakeholders are collaborating to raise awareness and improve education around food allergies.\n\nUltimately, the best way to protect ourselves and our loved ones from food allergens is to remain informed, vigilant, and proactive. This means reading labels carefully, communicating our needs to restaurant staff and others, and being prepared for emergency situations with appropriate medication and treatment.",
