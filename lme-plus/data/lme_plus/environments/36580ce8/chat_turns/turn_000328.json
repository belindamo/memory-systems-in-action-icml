  "content": "Yes, the lifespan of a wallaby can be affected by their living conditions and diet. In the wild, wallabies generally have a lifespan of 7-9 years, but those living in zoos or captivity can live up to 15-20 years or even more with proper care.\n\nA wallaby's diet plays a significant role in their health and overall lifespan. A balanced diet consisting of fresh fruits, vegetables, and hay is essential to their well-being. Poor nutrition can lead to malnourishment, which can cause illnesses and a shorter lifespan.\n\nAdditionally, living conditions can affect a wallaby's lifespan. In the wild, they have access to natural resources, such as open spaces and a variety of vegetation, which can promote better health. In zoos or captivity, their living conditions must be carefully monitored to ensure they have enough space, proper hygiene, and access to clean water and food. These factors can significantly impact their lifespan, as well as their physical and mental well-being.",
