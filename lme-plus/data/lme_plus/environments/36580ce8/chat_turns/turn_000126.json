Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Separate Instagram account for books:**\n\nPros:\n\n* **Niche audience**: You can attract a dedicated audience specifically interested in books and reading, which can lead to more engagement and meaningful interactions.\n* **Focused content**: You can post exclusively about books, authors, and reading-related topics, without worrying about diluting your content with other topics.\n\nCons:\n\n* **Added maintenance**: You'll need to manage multiple accounts, which can be time-consuming and may lead to burnout.\n* **Split audience**: You might split your existing audience, as some followers might not be interested in books and won't follow your new account.\n\n**Incorporating book content into your main account:**\n\nPros:\n\n* **Cross-pollination**: You can reach a broader audience interested in fitness, mindfulness, and other topics, who might also be interested in books and reading.\n* **Streamlined management**: You'll only need to manage one account, making it easier to post and engage with your audience.\n\nCons:\n\n* **Content dilution**: If you post too much book-related content, you might dilute the focus of your main account and confuse your audience.\n* **Limited visibility**: Your book-related posts might get lost among other content, reducing their visibility and impact.\n\nConsidering your interests and audience, I'd recommend incorporating book-related content into your main account, but with a few strategies to make it work:\n\n1. **Use a specific hashtag**: Create a unique hashtag for your book-related posts, so your audience can easily find and engage with them.\n2. **Batch book posts**: Group your book-related posts together, perhaps on a specific day or week, to create a sense of consistency and make it easier for your audience to follow.\n3. **Balance content**: Make sure to balance your book-related posts with your other content, so your audience doesn't feel overwhelmed or neglected.\n4. **Use Instagram's features**: Utilize Instagram's features like IGTV, Reels, or Stories to share book-related content in a way that complements your other posts.\n\nBy incorporating book-related content into your main account, you can attract a broader audience and showcase your diverse interests while maintaining a streamlined online presence.",
