  "content": "Yes, I understand what you are proposing. It sounds like you want to create an interface that allows users to ask data-related questions, and if the questions require a more complex analysis such as a t-test between two vectors, you would provide the query that you want to run on an SQL database and the Python or R code to perform the analysis. Then, you would send the data back to the interface for the user to view and provide a natural language summary of the results.\n\nFrom a high-level perspective, this project involves integrating several technologies to create a user-friendly interface for data analysis. It requires a good understanding of SQL and statistical analysis using R or Python. It also requires careful consideration of how to connect and pass data between different technologies in a secure and efficient way.",
