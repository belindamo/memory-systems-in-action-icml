  "content": "The Rooibos Chocolate Chai and chocolate-dipped shortbread cookies will make a wonderful pairing.\n\nAs for the savory options, I think the Rooibos Chocolate Chai will actually complement the mini quiches or finger sandwiches quite well. The tea's subtle spices and chocolate notes will add a warm, comforting element to the savory flavors. The tea's smooth, caffeine-free nature will also help to balance out the richness of the savory options.\n\nIn particular, the tea's flavors will pair nicely with:\n\n* Mini quiches: The tea's spices will complement the quiche's savory flavors, and the chocolate notes will add a nice depth to the richness of the eggs and cheese.\n* Finger sandwiches: The tea's subtle spices will enhance the flavors of the meats, cheeses, and bread, while the chocolate notes will add a surprising but pleasant twist to the classic combinations.\n\nHowever, if you're concerned about the tea clashing with the savory options, you could consider offering a second tea option that's more neutral in flavor profile. A herbal tea like peppermint, chamomile, or hibiscus would provide a nice contrast to the Rooibos Chocolate Chai and won't overpower the savory flavors.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider serving the savory options first, followed by the sweet treats and tea. This way, the palate can transition from savory to sweet, and the tea can be enjoyed as a lovely finishing touch.\n\nUltimately, it's up to your personal preference and the tone you want to set for your team-building event. But I think the Rooibos Chocolate Chai will hold its own nicely alongside the savory options!",
