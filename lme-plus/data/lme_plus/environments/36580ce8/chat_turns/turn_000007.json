  "content": "Breaking Bad is a highly acclaimed show, and I think you'll really enjoy it.\n\nAs for your question, Breaking Bad is a show that requires some focus, but it's not overly complex or convoluted. The story is well-written, and the characters are well-developed, so it's easy to follow along. However, the show does deal with some heavy themes, and the tension can build up over time, so it's not something you can necessarily \"mindlessly\" binge.\n\nThat being said, the episodes are relatively short (around 45-50 minutes each), and the show is expertly paced, so you'll likely find yourself getting sucked into the story and wanting to keep watching. If you're used to binge-watching shows, you might find yourself devouring 2-3 episodes in a single sitting.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of how long it might take to get through Breaking Bad:\n\n* There are 5 seasons, with 62 episodes in total.\n* If you watch 2-3 episodes per day, you can finish the entire series in around 20-30 days.\n* If you watch 1 episode per day, it'll take you around 62 days to finish the series.\n\nOf course, this is just a rough estimate, and you should feel free to watch at your own pace. The most important thing is to enjoy the show and not rush through it.\n\nAs for Mindhunter, it's a bit of a slower burn, and it's more of a psychological thriller than an action-packed show. The episodes are around 45-60 minutes each, and there are 2 seasons with 19 episodes in total. You can likely watch 1-2 episodes per day and finish the series in around 10-20 days.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
