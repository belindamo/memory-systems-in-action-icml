  "content": "Panko breadcrumbs are a great choice for a lighter, crisper breading, and the addition of dried oregano and basil will definitely add a nice depth of flavor to your Chicken Parmesan.\n\nRemember to also pat the chicken dry with paper towels before dredging it in flour and then the breading mixture to help the breadcrumbs adhere evenly. And don't be afraid to get a little aggressive when pressing the breadcrumbs onto the chicken to ensure they stick well.\n\nUsing a good melting cheese like mozzarella or a mozzarella-Parmesan blend will also help to create a creamy, bubbly top layer. Just be sure to not overcook the chicken, as you mentioned, and use a broiler to get that cheese nice and melted.\n\nIf you want to take it to the next level, you could also try adding some sliced fresh basil leaves on top of the melted cheese for a pop of color and freshness.\n\nI hope your Chicken Parmesan turns out amazing, and I'm excited to hear how it goes!",
