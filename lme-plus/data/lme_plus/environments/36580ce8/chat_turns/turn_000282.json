Here are some tips to help you create a welcoming and functional station:\n\n**Station Setup:**\n\n1. **Dedicate a separate station for each type of beverage**: While it's possible to combine the tea and coffee stations, I recommend setting up separate stations for each. This will allow guests to focus on one type of beverage at a time and prevent flavor profiles from getting mixed up.\n2. **Use visually appealing displays**: Use decorative tables, linens, and risers to create an inviting atmosphere. Consider using tiered displays to showcase the tea and coffee options.\n3. **Labeling is key**: Clearly label each tea and coffee option with its name, flavor profile, and any relevant brewing instructions. This will help guests navigate the options and make informed choices.\n4. **Provide tasting cups and utensils**: Offer small tasting cups and utensils (e.g., spoons, tea infusers) for guests to use.\n5. **Add a water station**: Consider setting up a separate water station with flavored waters or infused water options to cleanse palates between tastings.\n\n**Tea Station:**\n\n1. **Tea brewing equipment**: Provide tea brewing equipment, such as teapots, tea infusers, and tea balls, to allow guests to brew their own tea.\n2. **Tea selection display**: Display the tea options in a visually appealing way, such as in decorative tins or jars.\n3. **Tea pairing suggestions**: Offer pairing suggestions for the teas, such as recommended sweet treats or savory options.\n\n**Coffee Station:**\n\n1. **Coffee brewing equipment**: Provide coffee brewing equipment, such as pour-overs, French presses, or drip coffee makers, to allow guests to brew their own coffee.\n2. **Coffee selection display**: Display the coffee options in a visually appealing way, such as in decorative bags or cans.\n3. **Coffee pairing suggestions**: Offer pairing suggestions for the coffees, such as recommended sweet treats or savory options.\n\n**Tips for a Smooth Event:**\n\n1. **Have a plan for waste disposal**: Make sure to have a plan in place for disposing of used tea bags, coffee grounds, and other waste.\n2. **Staff the stations**: Have staff or volunteers available to answer questions, refill supplies, and ensure the stations are clean and organized.\n3. **Encourage exploration**: Encourage guests to try different options and explore the various flavors and pairings.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll create a welcoming and functional tea and coffee tasting station that will delight your guests and make your team-building event a success!",
