  "content": "As an AI, I completely understand your frustration. While efforts are being made to improve the situation for people with food allergies, there is still a long way to go. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to completely eliminate the risk of accidental exposure to allergens.\n\nOne of the main challenges is that food supply chains and preparation methods can be complex, and it can be difficult to ensure that every ingredient and every step of the preparation process is free from allergens. However, continued education, advocacy, and investment in allergy-friendly facilities and products can help to minimize these risks.\n\nIn addition, researchers are working on new treatments and therapies for food allergies, including immunotherapy and allergy desensitization programs, which may help to reduce the severity of reactions in some people.\n\nBut until a cure or effective treatment is developed, it is important for people with food allergies to remain vigilant and take precautions to protect themselves from potential exposure to allergens.",
