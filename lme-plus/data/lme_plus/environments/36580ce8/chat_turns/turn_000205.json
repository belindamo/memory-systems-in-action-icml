Given that youll know the structure of the SQL tables because I provided them earlier in a prompt, and given that you can code a simple regression script in R or Python, I will create a pipeline in which after the user prompts you for a t.test between two vectors that have data unknown to you, you will provide the query that I will send to an SQL server and the code I will send to R or Python, I will create the pipeline for the SQL data that we queried with your query to go to Python which will have the code you wrote and then I will create the pipeline that will return the results to you so you can read them and provide a natural language summary of the results to our user. I will take care of all pipeline activities. All I need from you is to provide the snipets of SQL and Python code that I will use to close the pipeline. Does this make sense? Do you have any question of what we want to do from a high level perspective\\_\\_",
