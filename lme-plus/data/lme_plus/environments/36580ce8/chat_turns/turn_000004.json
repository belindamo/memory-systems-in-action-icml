I just finished \"Stranger Things\" and \"Ozark\", and I'm looking for something new. Oh, by the way, I've also been watching \"The Office\" reruns on Comedy Central, usually when I'm having dinner or before bed - it's just so comforting to have it playing in the background. Can you recommend some shows similar to \"Ozark\"?",
