  "content": "Wallabies have a varied diet that includes various fruits, vegetables, hay, and occasionally commercial diets formulated for them. Since they have a diverse diet, they may develop preference to some food items depending on the individual Wallaby. However, they don't have a single favorite food. \n\n Sometimes, wallabies may be more attracted to specific types of fruits or vegetables, but this can vary depending on their current nutritional needs as well.
