  "content": "Table 1 called SPENTS has three columns RPP\\_ID is an ID column, Spent is a continuous column for expenditures in USD and Date is a timestamp column. The number of observations in the table is irrelevant. There can be multiple observations per RPP\\_ID. Table 2 is called SAVES and has also three columns. Column one is called RPP\\_USER\\_ID and maps perfectly with RPP\\_ID from table 1. Column 2 called Fecha is a timestamp of the transaction and column 3 called AHORRO is a monetary value of a saved ammount. Is the table structure clear and actionable?",
