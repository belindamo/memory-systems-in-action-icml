  "content": "Sure, here's an SQL query that should give you the total savings for each customer in the period between March 2022 and June 2023:\n```sql\nSELECT SAVES.RPP_USER_ID, SUM(SAVES.AHORRO - SPENTS.Spent) AS Total_Savings\nFROM SAVES\nINNER JOIN SPENTS\nON SAVES.RPP_USER_ID = SPENTS.RPP_ID\nWHERE SAVES.Fecha BETWEEN '2022-03-01' AND '2023-06-30'\nGROUP BY SAVES.RPP_USER_ID\n```\nThis query performs an inner join between the `SAVES` and `SPENTS` tables on the `RPP_USER_ID` and `RPP_ID` columns, respectively. It then calculates the total savings for each customer by subtracting the `Spent` column in `SPENTS` from the `AHORRO` column in `SAVES`. Finally, it filters the results to only include transactions that occurred between March 2022 and June 2023 and groups the results by `RPP_USER_ID`. The resulting output will show the `RPP_USER_ID` and the corresponding total savings for each customer during the specified period.",
