That will definitely help you make informed decisions about the tea and coffee options. And by offering a range of options, you'll ensure that everyone has something they'll enjoy.\n\nRemember, the key is to provide a variety of options that will appeal to different tastes and preferences. By doing so, you'll create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for your team-building event.\n\nI think you're making great decisions, and I'm confident that your event will be a success!
