  "content": "At the beginning of the story, Kira and Eris are waiting on the city wall for Zeph's arrival. They are both excited and nervous to see him again after four years of being apart. They talk about their expectations for his return and reminisce about old memories they shared together before he left for Fortress Academy.\n\nEris is particularly excited to see him as she has always had a crush on him and hopes that he will feel the same way about her. Kira, on the other hand, is more focused on the fact that he will be home and she will finally have the support of her brother again. They discuss their plans for when he returns and how they will spend time together as a family.\n\nAs they wait, they also talk about the recent unrest in the empire and the rumors of uprisings in the neighboring kingdoms. They discuss how the magic of Taizhen keeps the city safe from the dangers outside its walls, but they also wonder about the fate of those living in the other regions that are not as fortunate.\n\nAs the sun sets, they spot Zeph's caravan in the distance. They excitedly wave and shout his name, and he sees them and waves back. They run to meet him and embrace him warmly, happy to be reunited.\n\nWith Zeph back, the three of them set out to navigate the challenges of their society, which is on the brink of collapse. They have to confront their own personal demons and find a way to survive in this world where magic is both a blessing and a curse. They also have to find a way to make peace with the new power dynamics in their family, and navigate through the political turmoil in the empire.",
