We will focus on the items we came up under each module topic called \"Practical example\".\n\nLet's name the exercises:\n - Module Exercise (ME) 1.1,\n - ME1.2\n - ME1.3 (for module 1 exercise)\n - ME1.4\n\nand so forth.\n\nLet's thus start with Module 1 exercises.\n\nPlease make all exercises as relevant or applicable to the banking industry as possible.\n\nPlease propose and construct the first exercise ME1.1 with Python code, based on what we discussed being \"Example code for using control flow statements to process banking data\".\n\nLet us base our coding exercises of the following list which we proposed for module 1:\n\n ## Practical exercises and examples\nME3.1 - Example code for reading and cleaning data from a CSV file using Python\nME3.2 - Demonstration of how to manipulate Excel files using Python and the xlwings library\nME3.3 - Example code for converting and merging multiple CSV files using Python\nME3.4 - Overview of how to work with compressed files using Python\n\nWith this in mind, let us now start again with ME3.1:",
