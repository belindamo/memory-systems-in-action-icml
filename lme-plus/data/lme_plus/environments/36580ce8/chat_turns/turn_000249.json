  "content": "Virtual interactions with pets can to some extent help in mitigating the psychological effects of long-term isolation, but they may not be as effective as in-person interactions. Pets, in general, can provide companionship, comfort, and a sense of responsibility for their owners, helping to reduce loneliness and feelings of isolation.\n\nVirtual interactions with pets can take various forms, such as setting up regular video calls, sending texts, or sharing pictures with them on social media platforms. These interactions can help individuals feel less alone and can provide a sense of emotional support, which can help to promote better mental health.\n\nWhile virtual interactions with pets may not be the same as in-person interactions, they can still be beneficial, especially for those who cannot interact with their pets in person due to distance or other factors. However, it's essential to note that physical interaction with pets, such as petting or playing with them, can have more potent effects in reducing stress and promoting positive feelings.",
