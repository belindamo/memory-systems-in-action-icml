  "content": "Yes, there are some fruits that aren't safe for wallabies to consume, as these fruits contain high levels of sugar, acids or can cause digestive issues. Here are a few examples of fruits that are not recommended for wallabies:\n\n1. Citrus fruits: Oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits contain high levels of acidity, which can cause digestive upset in wallabies. 2. Avocado: Avocado contains persin, which is toxic for many animals, including wallabies, and can cause cardiovascular damage. 3. Grapes or raisins: These fruits can lead to kidney failure in dogs, but it's not clear if wallabies are affected, so it's better to avoid them altogether. 4. Rhubarb: Contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic to wallabies and can cause kidney damage. 5. Unripe fruits: Unripe fruits contain toxins that can cause digestive issues and diarrhea, so they should be avoided. Providing a balanced diet and feeding the correct types and amounts of fruits is essential for your wallaby's health. It's always best to consult with your veterinarian or an expert in exotic animal nutrition for the best dietary options for your wallaby.",
