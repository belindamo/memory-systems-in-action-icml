What a delight to spot one of these iridescent beauties!\n\nThe Ruby-throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) is a common and widespread hummingbird species in North America, and they do migrate through many areas, including yours, it seems!\n\nHere are some fascinating facts about the Ruby-throated Hummingbird and their migration pattern:\n\n**Migration Pattern:**\n\n* Ruby-throated Hummingbirds migrate alone, not in flocks, and make a remarkable solo journey each year.\n* They migrate from their breeding grounds in the eastern and central United States and Canada to their wintering grounds in Central America and Mexico.\n* The fall migration typically begins in July and August, with the peak migration period usually occurring in September and October.\n* During this time, they fly non-stop over the Gulf of Mexico, a journey of around 500-600 miles (800-965 km), which can take up to 24 hours!\n* In the spring, they return to their breeding grounds, with the migration typically occurring from February to May.\n\n**Identification and Behavior:**\n\n* Ruby-throated Hummingbirds are relatively small, reaching lengths of about 3-4 inches (7-10 cm) and weighing around 0.1-0.2 ounces (2-6 grams).\n* Males have a distinctive bright red throat patch (or \"ruby throat\"), which is iridescent and can appear black or dark red in certain lighting conditions.\n* Females lack the ruby throat patch and have a white throat with a faint grayish-white stripe.\n* Ruby-throated Hummingbirds are attracted to nectar-rich flowers, particularly red, orange, and purple flowers, as well as sugar-water feeders.\n* They are known for their fast wingbeats, reaching up to 80 times per second, which create a distinctive humming sound.\n\n**Tips for Spotting Ruby-throated Hummingbirds:**\n\n* To increase your chances of spotting a Ruby-throated Hummingbird, plant nectar-rich flowers in your yard, such as trumpet-shaped flowers like honeysuckle, fuchsia, or coral bells.\n* Use sugar-water feeders with a ratio of 4 parts water to 1 part sugar (no artificial sweeteners or red dye, please!).\n* Place feeders in open areas, about 10-15 feet off the ground, and in partial shade to full sun.\n* Be patient and observe feeders or flowers regularly, as Ruby-throated Hummingbirds can be territorial and may visit frequently.\n* Keep an eye out for their characteristic fast, darting flight and listen for their distinctive humming sound.\n\nWith these tips and a little luck, you might just spot a Ruby-throated Hummingbird during their migration through your area!",
