Here's the SQL query you can use to get the total savings for each customer in the period between March 2022 and June 2023:\n```sql\nSELECT SAVES.RPP_USER_ID, SUM(SAVES.AHORRO - SPENTS.Spent) AS Total_Savings\nFROM SAVES\nINNER JOIN SPENTS\nON SAVES.RPP_USER_ID = SPENTS.RPP_ID\nWHERE SAVES.Fecha BETWEEN '2022-03-01' AND '2023-06-30'\nGROUP BY SAVES.RPP_USER_ID;\n```\nThis query will return the total savings for each customer during the specified time period by joining the `SAVES` and `SPENTS` tables on `RPP_USER_ID` and `RPP_ID`, respectively. The `SUM` function calculates the total savings for each customer by subtracting the `Spent` column in `SPENTS` from the `AHORRO` column in `SAVES`. The `WHERE` clause filters the transactions to those that occurred between March 2022 and June 2023, and the `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `RPP_USER_ID`.",
