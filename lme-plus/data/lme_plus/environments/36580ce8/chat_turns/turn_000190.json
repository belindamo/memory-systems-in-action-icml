Assuming you'll need some time to grab lunch and relax after your jog, let's say you'll head to the party around 1 pm. That gives you a couple of hours to unwind and refuel after your jog.\n\nHere's an updated schedule:\n\n* Saturday: \n\t+ 8:30 am - Jog with Chris\n\t+ 1:00 pm - Birthday party (4-5 hours)\n\nThis should give you enough time to attend the party and still have some buffer time to relax afterwards. You can always adjust the schedule if you need more time to unwind or if the party runs longer than expected.\n\nHow's that look?",
