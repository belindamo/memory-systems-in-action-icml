I can use a specific hashtag like #bookstagram and batch my book posts together, maybe on Wednesdays. That way, I can still share my love of reading with my audience without diluting my main account's focus on fitness and wellness. Do you think I should also create a separate highlight reel for my book-related content, so it's easy for people to find and view?",
