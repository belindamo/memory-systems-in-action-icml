  "content": "Yes, many people have advocated for increased regulations to ensure food safety for people with allergies. In fact, there already are some regulations in place. For example, the US Food Allergy Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) requires that food labels must clearly state if a product contains any of the major food allergens.\n\nHowever, some people argue that more regulations are needed, particularly in the area of food preparation and restaurant practices. For example, some have suggested that restaurants should have specific protocols in place for preparing meals for people with allergies, and that staff should receive regular training on food allergies and cross-contamination.\n\nUltimately, it will require collaboration between government, industry, and advocacy groups to improve food allergy safety. When stakeholders work together to develop and implement best practices, this can help to minimize the risks and improve the overall safety of the food supply.",
