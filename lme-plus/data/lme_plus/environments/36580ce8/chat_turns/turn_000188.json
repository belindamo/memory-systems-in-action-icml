You're free after that, so it's possible to fit in a birthday party in the afternoon.\n\nHow long do you think the party will last? Will it be a few hours, or do you think you'll be there for most of the afternoon?\n\nAlso, do you want to leave some buffer time between your jog and the party to grab lunch or relax a bit before heading out again?",
