  "content": "I've had some experience with sourdough starters, although my last attempt at making bread with it didn't turn out so well. I tried out a new bread recipe using sourdough starter on Tuesday, but the dough didn't rise as much as I expected, and the bread came out dense and heavy. I think I need to work on my sourdough starter's health and maybe adjust the recipe. But I'm willing to give it another try for this Italian bread recipe. Do you have any tips on how to create a preferment using my sourdough starter?",
