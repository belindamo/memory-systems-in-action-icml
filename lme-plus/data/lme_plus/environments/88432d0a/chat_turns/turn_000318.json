  "content": "Sure! To incorporate crime rate, safety, and incomes into your real estate search application, you can add these factors to your data and use machine learning algorithms to weigh them in your search results.\n\n1. First, you'll need to load additional data sources, such as data on crime rate, safety, and incomes:\n```makefile\ncrime_rate = pd.read_csv(\"crime_rate.csv\")\nsafety = pd.read_csv(\"safety.csv\")\nincomes = pd.read_csv(\"incomes.csv\")\n```\n2. Next, you'll need to merge this additional data with your property data to create a comprehensive dataset:\n```kotlin\ndata = pd.merge(data, crime_rate, on=\"property_id\")\ndata = pd.merge(data, safety, on=\"property_id\")\ndata = pd.merge(data, incomes, on=\"property_id\")\n```\n3. You can then use machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or random forests, to build a model that incorporates all of these features:\n```scss\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\nfeatures = data.drop(\"property_id\", axis=1)\ntarget = data[\"property_price\"]\n\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor()\nmodel.fit(features, target)\n```\n4. Finally, you can use this model to rank properties based on their crime rate, safety, and incomes, as well as other factors such as proximity to amenities, distances to important locations, and demographics:\n```kotlin\npredictions = model.predict(features)\ndata[\"rank\"] = predictions\ndata = data.sort_values(\"rank\", ascending=False)\n```\nThis example uses a random forest regression model to rank properties based on multiple factors, including crime rate, safety, and incomes. You can adjust the model and the factors included to suit your specific requirements.",
