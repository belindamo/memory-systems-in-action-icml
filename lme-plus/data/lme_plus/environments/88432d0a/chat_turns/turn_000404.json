Getting the perfect crumb and crust on focaccia requires some technique, but don't worry, I've got you covered!\n\nHere are some tips to help you achieve the perfect crumb and crust on your Garlic and Herb Whole Wheat Focaccia:\n\n**Crumb:**\n\n1. **Hydration**: Make sure the dough is properly hydrated. Whole wheat flour can be more absorbent than all-purpose flour, so you may need to adjust the water content.\n2. **Autolyse**: Let the dough rest for 20-30 minutes after mixing to allow the flour to absorb the water. This will help develop the gluten and create a more even crumb.\n3. **Gentle mixing**: Mix the dough gently to avoid developing too much gluten, which can lead to a dense crumb.\n4. **Longer fermentation**: Allow the dough to ferment for at least 1 hour, or until it's nearly double its original size. This will help develop the flavor and create a more open crumb.\n\n**Crust:**\n\n1. **High-temperature steam**: Create a steamy environment in your oven by placing a pan of water on the bottom rack. This will help create a crispy crust.\n2. **Score the dough**: Use a sharp blade or lame to score the dough in a diagonal pattern. This will help control the way the bread expands during baking and create a more even crust.\n3. **Bake with steam**: Bake the focaccia in a steamy oven (with the pan of water) for the first 10-15 minutes. This will help create a crispy crust.\n4. **Finish with dry heat**: After 10-15 minutes, remove the pan of water and continue baking the focaccia in a dry oven to crisp up the crust.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* **Use a pizza stone**: Baking the focaccia on a preheated pizza stone can help create a crispy crust.\n* **Don't overbake**: Focaccia is best when it's lightly golden and still slightly soft in the center. Overbaking can lead to a dry, crumbly crumb.\n* **Cool on a wire rack**: Cooling the focaccia on a wire rack will help it retain its crust and prevent it from becoming soggy.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a beautifully crusted and crumbly Garlic and Herb Whole Wheat Focaccia to pair with your crispy chicken wings and roasted veggies!\n\nDo you have any questions about these tips, or would you like some more guidance on the recipe?",
