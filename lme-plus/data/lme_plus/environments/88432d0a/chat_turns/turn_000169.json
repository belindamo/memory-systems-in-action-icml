Some of the onsen I mentioned earlier do offer private baths, and I'd be happy to provide more information on their availability and pricing.\n\n1. **Otemba Hot Spring ()**: Otemba offers private baths that can be reserved for 45-minute increments. The cost is \u00a52,000 (around $18 USD) per person, with a maximum of 5 people per bath. They have 2 private baths available, each with a different theme.\n2. **Toshimaen Niwa no Yu ()**: Toshimaen Niwa no Yu offers private baths that can be reserved for 45-minute increments. The cost is \u00a52,500 (around $23 USD) per person, with a maximum of 6 people per bath. They have 4 private baths available, each with a different theme.\n3. **Shinjuku Jakotsuyu ()**: Shinjuku Jakotsuyu offers private baths that can be reserved for 45-minute increments. The cost is \u00a52,000 (around $18 USD) per person, with a maximum of 4 people per bath. They have 2 private baths available.\n\nPlease note that private bath reservations may require advance booking, and prices may vary depending on the time of day, season, or other factors. It's best to check the onsen's website or call them directly to confirm pricing and availability.\n\nAdditionally, some onsen may offer special packages or deals that include private baths, massages, or other amenities. These can be a great way to indulge in a luxurious experience, but be prepared for a higher price tag.\n\nKeep in mind that private baths are usually more expensive than the general admission fee, but they offer a more intimate and relaxing experience. If you're looking to splurge and treat yourself, a private bath might be the perfect way to unwind after a long week of teaching!",
