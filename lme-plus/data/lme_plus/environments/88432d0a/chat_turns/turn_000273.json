  "content": "Cartwheel offers are typically limited-time offers, and they usually have an expiration date or a specific duration. The 20% off Cartwheel offer on all Up & Up brand cleaning supplies you used last week was likely a one-time offer, and it's unlikely to be available again this week.\n\nHowever, I always recommend checking the Target app or website to confirm the availability of Cartwheel offers. You can log in to your Target account, go to the Cartwheel section, and search for \"Up & Up cleaning supplies\" or \"cleaning supplies\" to see if there are any new or active offers.\n\nIf you don't see the 20% off offer, you can still use the 5% off Cartwheel offer I mentioned earlier on the Up & Up All-Purpose Cleaner and Disinfecting Wipes. It's not as good as the 20% off deal, but it's still a discount!\n\nRemember to always check the Cartwheel offers and digital coupons before you head to the store to make sure you're getting the best deal possible.",
