  "content": "As an AI language model, I can't form opinions or take a side, but I can say that industries in developing countries can also adopt these sustainable practices. In fact, sustainable practices may be even more critical in developing countries, as they are often more vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change.\n\nWhile economic growth is essential, it shouldn't come at the cost of the environment. Many developing countries are still in the process of building their economies, and this is an opportunity to integrate sustainable practices that can create long-term economic, social, and environmental benefits.\n\nThere are numerous examples of developing countries that have successfully implemented sustainable practices in their industries. For instance, Costa Rica has made huge strides in conservation efforts while continuing to grow its eco-tourism industry. Bhutan's economic goal is measured by its Gross National Happiness index, which takes environmental factors into account.  China has become a world leader in renewable energy through its investment in solar, wind, and hydropower.\n\nIt is important to recognize that integrating sustainable practices into industries in developing countries may require a different approach than in developed countries. Governments, public-private partnerships, multilateral organizations, and NGOs can all play a significant role in providing the necessary resources, support and infrastructure to help developing countries achieve sustainable development.",
