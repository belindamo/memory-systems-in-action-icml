Cultural competence requires more than just an intellectual understanding of other cultures; it also requires the ability to recognize and overcome implicit biases and stereotypes in order to effectively communicate and interact with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds.\n\nTherefore, it is not enough for individuals to simply choose to be open-minded and accepting; they must actively work to identify and challenge their biases and stereotypes in order to develop a higher level of cultural competence. This can be achieved through education, exposure to diverse cultural experiences, and ongoing self-reflection and self-awareness.",
