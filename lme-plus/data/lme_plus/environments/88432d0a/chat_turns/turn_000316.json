  "content": "To incorporate amenities, distances, and demographics into the property search application, you can add additional features to your data and use machine learning algorithms to weigh these factors in your search results.\n\n1. First, you'll need to load additional data sources, such as data on nearby amenities, distances to important locations, and demographic information:\n```makefile\namenities = pd.read_csv(\"amenities.csv\")\ndistances = pd.read_csv(\"distances.csv\")\ndemographics = pd.read_csv(\"demographics.csv\")\n```\n2. Next, you'll need to merge this additional data with your property data to create a comprehensive dataset:\n```kotlin\ndata = pd.merge(data, amenities, on=\"property_id\")\ndata = pd.merge(data, distances, on=\"property_id\")\ndata = pd.merge(data, demographics, on=\"property_id\")\n```\n3. You can then use machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or random forests, to build a model that incorporates all of these features:\n```scss\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\nfeatures = data.drop(\"property_id\", axis=1)\ntarget = data[\"property_price\"]\n\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor()\nmodel.fit(features, target)\n```\n4. Finally, you can use this model to rank properties based on their proximity to amenities, distances to important locations, and demographics:\n```kotlin\npredictions = model.predict(features)\ndata[\"rank\"] = predictions\ndata = data.sort_values(\"rank\", ascending=False)\n```\nThis example uses a random forest regression model to rank properties based on multiple factors, including amenities, distances, and demographics. You can adjust the model and the factors included to suit your specific requirements.",
