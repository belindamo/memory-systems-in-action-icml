  "content": "Yes, the Toronto Raptors did have some key players leave the team during the offseason. Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol, who were both centers on the team, left in free agency to join other teams. These departures could have a significant impact on the team's performance in the next season, especially in terms of their defensive presence and rebounding ability. However, the team still has talented players such as Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, and Pascal Siakam, so their performance in the upcoming season may still be strong. It will ultimately come down to how well the team can adapt to these changes and develop new strategies to succeed.",
