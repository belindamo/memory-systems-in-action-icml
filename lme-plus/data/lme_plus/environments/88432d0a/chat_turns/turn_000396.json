  "content": "Roasted vegetables are a fantastic match for crispy chicken wings. For your convection setting, it's great that you've already experimented with it and had success with your cookies! Convection baking can be a game-changer for many recipes, including chicken wings. The circulating hot air helps to distribute heat evenly and can lead to faster cooking times and crisper results. Here are some convection-roasted vegetable recommendations that would pair well:\n\n1. **Broccoli**: Cut broccoli into florets, toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a pinch of garlic powder. Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n2. **Carrots**: Slice carrots into sticks or coins, toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a drizzle of honey. Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and slightly caramelized.\n3. **Brussels Sprouts**: Cut Brussels sprouts in half, toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n4. **Cauliflower**: Break cauliflower into florets, toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of paprika. Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and slightly caramelized.\n5. **Asparagus**: Toss asparagus spears with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 12-15 minutes, or until tender and slightly caramelized.\n\nWhen roasting vegetables with convection, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n1. **Spread them out**: Arrange the vegetables in a single layer on the baking sheet to ensure even air circulation and roasting.\n2. **Toss with oil and seasonings**: Toss the vegetables with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings before roasting.\n3. **Adjust cooking time**: Convection roasting can cook vegetables faster, so check on them frequently to prevent overcooking.\n4. **Use the right pan**: Choose a baking sheet with a wire rack or a silicone mat to promote air circulation and prevent the vegetables from steaming instead of roasting.\n\nAs for flour experimentation, that's a great hobby! Have you tried working with ancient grains or alternative flours like almond or coconut flour? They can add unique textures and flavors to your baked goods.\n\nRemember to have fun and experiment with different vegetable combinations and seasonings to find your favorite pairings with crispy chicken wings!",
