  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future but there is a risk that modernization could lead to the disappearance of some traditional practices and festivals in Jilin province. Rapid urbanization, globalization, and the influence of foreign cultures could potentially cause the loss of cultural identity and values. The younger generations may not be as interested in traditional practices and festivals as they once were, due to the availability of modern entertainment and lifestyle choices.\n\nAdditionally, modernization could lead to the commercialization of cultural practices and festivals, with the focus shifting from cultural significance to financial gain. This could dilute the original meaning and significance of traditional practices and festivals, leading to their eventual disappearance or loss of cultural value.\n\nTo prevent the disappearance of traditional practices and festivals, it is important for both individuals and government institutions to work towards their preservation and promotion. This can be done through education, cultural exchange programs, and festivals, as well as efforts to integrate traditional practices into modern life in relevant and meaningful ways. By preserving and passing down these cultural practices and festivals, we can ensure that they continue to be a part of our shared cultural heritage.",
