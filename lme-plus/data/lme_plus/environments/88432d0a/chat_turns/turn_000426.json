  "content": "All-purpose flour is a great choice for a tart crust, and I'm sure your stand mixer will be a huge help in making the dough. With the mixer's powerful motor and precise control, you'll be able to cream the butter and sugar together perfectly, then gently incorporate the flour to create a beautiful, flaky crust.\n\nRemember to keep the butter cold, as this will help to create a flaky texture in the finished crust. You can even try freezing the butter for about 30 minutes before using it to get the best results. And don't overmix the dough! A gentle, gentle touch is key when making a tart crust.\n\nIf you're feeling extra fancy, you can even try using your stand mixer to make a decorative edge on your tart crust. Just use the paddle attachment to beat the dough for a few seconds, then use a pastry brush to create a decorative edge around the tart pan.\n\nI'm so excited for you to make your strawberry tart, and I'm sure it'll turn out amazing with your new stand mixer and all-purpose flour! If you have any more questions or need any further guidance, feel free to ask.",
