By tracking likes, comments, and retweets on Twitter, you'll get a sense of how well your content is resonating with your audience. On LinkedIn, views and engagement rate will help you understand how your content is performing in terms of visibility and interaction.\n\nFollower growth is also a crucial metric to track, as it indicates whether your branded hashtag is attracting new followers to your accounts. This can help you determine the effectiveness of your hashtag strategy and make adjustments to optimize your growth.\n\nHere are some additional tips to keep in mind when tracking your hashtag performance:\n\n* **Compare metrics over time**: Look at your metrics week-over-week or month-over-month to identify trends and patterns. This will help you understand what's working and what's not.\n* **Analyze top-performing content**: Identify which types of content (e.g., tweets, LinkedIn posts, etc.) are performing well and try to replicate that success in future posts.\n* **Monitor hashtag variations**: If you're using variations of your branded hashtag (e.g., #WriteWithSarah, #WriteWithSarahTips, etc.), track their performance separately to see which ones are most effective.\n* **Keep an eye on hashtag hijacking**: If you notice other accounts using your branded hashtag, monitor their content to ensure it aligns with your brand values and messaging.\n\nBy tracking your hashtag performance regularly and making data-driven decisions, you'll be able to optimize your strategy and maximize the impact of your branded hashtag #WriteWithSarah.\n\nDo you have any plans to create a content calendar or schedule for your social media posts, or do you prefer to create content on the fly?",
