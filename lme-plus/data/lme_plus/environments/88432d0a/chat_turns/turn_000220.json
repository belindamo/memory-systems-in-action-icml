As society changes and modernizes, traditional practices may become less relevant or lose their original meaning. However, it is also possible for modernization to bring about new opportunities to reinterpret and revive traditional practices and festivals. \n\nIt is important to note that the survival of traditional practices and festivals ultimately depends on the efforts of people and government institutions to preserve, promote, and pass them down to future generations. By educating and raising awareness about the significance and beauty of traditional practices and festivals, they can be appreciated and celebrated both culturally and commercially. \n\nOverall, while it is impossible to predict the future, it is important to recognize the value of traditional practices and festivals and to work towards preserving and promoting them for future generations.",
