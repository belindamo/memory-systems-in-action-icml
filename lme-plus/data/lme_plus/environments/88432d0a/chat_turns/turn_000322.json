Front-end:\n* HTML: Use HTML to create the structure of your web pages, including header, footer, search bar, and property listings.\n* CSS: Use CSS to style your pages and make them visually appealing.\n* JavaScript: Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your pages, such as search functionality, filtering, and map visualization.\n2. Back-end:\n* Database: Store your real estate data, crime rate data, safety data, and income data in a database. You can use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, depending on your needs.\n* Server: Build a server-side component to handle HTTP requests from your front-end and interact with your database. You can use a framework like Flask (Python) or Express (JavaScript) to build your server.\n* Machine learning: Use machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, to build models that incorporate crime rate, safety, and income data into your real estate search results.\n3. Data processing:\n* Apache Kafka: Use Apache Kafka to process large amounts of real estate data and update your database in real-time. You can use producers to send data to Kafka topics and consumers to read from those topics and update your database.\n\nThis is just a high-level layout and there are many details to consider in each component. It is best to seek the assistance of experienced developers to implement a real-world application.",
