Specify the role of the AI in the beginning:\nReplace \"You are life coach\" with \"As a life coach, provide me with a detailed routine to help me achieve my goals for the next month in the following areas:\"\n2. Use consistent formatting for the two main goals:\n\na. For the weight loss goal:\ni. Reword and reformat: \"1. Weight Loss (10 kg): Allocate a maximum of 1.5 hours per day.\"\nii. Combine sub-points: \"1.1. Provide a daily workout and diet plan based on this objective.\"\n\nb. For the linear algebra goal:\ni. Reword and reformat: \"2. Learn Linear Algebra: Allocate a maximum of 1 hour per day.\"\nii. Combine sub-points: \"2.1.

      "content": "REVISED PROMPT:\n\nAs a life coach, provide me with a detailed routine to help me achieve my goals for the next month, taking into account my background and preferences in the following areas:\n\nBackground context:\n\nI am a 30-year-old male with a sedentary job. I have some experience with weightlifting and moderate cardio exercises, but I haven't been consistent with my workouts for the past year. I prefer plant-based meals and have a slight lactose intolerance. My goal is to lose 10 kg to improve my health and overall wellbeing.\n\nIn terms of learning linear algebra, I have a solid foundation in high school mathematics, including algebra and basic calculus. My goal is to learn linear algebra for personal enrichment and to potentially pursue higher education in a STEM field. I am a visual learner and prefer a combination of lectures, practice problems, and interactive resources for learning.\n\nGoals and detailed routine:\n\n1. Weight Loss (10 kg): Allocate a maximum of 1.5 hours per day.\n1.1. Considering my workout history and food preferences, provide a daily workout and plant-based diet plan that accommodates my lactose intolerance and helps me reach my weight loss objective.\n2. Learn Linear Algebra: Allocate a maximum of 1 hour per day.\n2.1. Given my prior knowledge of math, learning style, and goals for learning linear algebra, provide a daily study plan with a combination of visual lectures, practice problems, and interactive resources, including detailed homework assignments for each day."
