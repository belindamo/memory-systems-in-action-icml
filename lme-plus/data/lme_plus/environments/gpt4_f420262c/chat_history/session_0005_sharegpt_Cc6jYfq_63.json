For example, consider a situation where a person is deciding whether or not to go to a party. There are two possible actions they can take: go to the party or stay home. The person may be uncertain about which action to take, and so the truth-value of the proposition \"go to the party\" may be 2 (indicating that it is possible but not certain) while the truth-value of the proposition \"stay home\" may be 3 (indicating that it is possible but not certain).\n\nHowever, this is just one possible example and the specific details of the situation would depend on the particular interpretation of the truth-values and connectives used in the non-deterministic matrix.\n\nI hope this helps!
