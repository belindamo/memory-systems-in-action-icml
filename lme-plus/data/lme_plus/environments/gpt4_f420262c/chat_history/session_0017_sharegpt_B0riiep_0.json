Legendary value investor Bill Miller is taking a different route.\n\nMiller, 72, is sticking with the plan he announced in January to hang up his investment cleats at the end of 2022, a year in which his flagship mutual fund turned in a back-of-the-pack performance. Miller Opportunity Trust LGOAX +1.03% (ticker: LGOAX) has lost 37% this year, placing it in the bottom quartile of the Mid-Cap Blend category, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s a far cry from Miller\u2019s performance at Legg Mason Value Trust, which bested the S&P 500 SPX +0.59% for 15 years in a row while he was in charge.\n\nDespite his recently poor performance, Miller remains steadfast in his investing strategy. Speaking with Barron\u2019s from his home in Florida, he says he has recently added to his holdings of Amazon.com (AMZN) and Silvergate Capital (SI), the parent of crypto-focused Silvergate Bank. He\u2019s a big fan of Delta Air Lines (DAL), and Bitcoin BTCUSD +0.08% remains among his top personal holdings. In addition to sharing his eclectic mix of stock picks, Miller discussed his plans for retirement, and which sports league he thinks might be a particularly good buy now. An edited version of the conversation follows.\n\nBarron\u2019s: Some investment titans\u2014Warren Buffett comes to mind\u2014manage money well into their 90s. Why did you decide to retire now?\n\nBill Miller: We all have to retire sometime. I\u2019m basically splitting the firm in two, and my son [Bill Miller IV] gets the part of the firm that has the income fund [ Miller Income LMCJX +0.74% (LMCJX)]. Samantha McLemore is buying the Opportunity Trust part. I\u2019ll be 25% owner of the two pieces and the largest investor in both those funds. Even though I won\u2019t be managing money for the public anymore, I expect to be just as engaged in markets.\n\nYou\u2019ll remain an adviser to both your successors?\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be hard to find me if they want to, but I\u2019m not sure how much advice they will want. I don\u2019t want the overall responsibility for other people\u2019s money. There is a mountain of compliance responsibilities. At my age, it is time to do something else.\n\nSo, this seems like the right time?\n\nYes. There are some striking similarities between now and 1990, when I took over management of Legg Mason\u2019s equity funds. My partner then was 72 in 1990, and I\u2019m 72 now. He had just had two bad years in a row, and we\u2019ve had two bad years. Bill and Samantha are the same age I was in 1990. I went on to beat the market for the next 15 years. This is a propitious time for Bill and Samantha to take over, since stocks are cheap.\n\nThat\u2019s a good segue to your market outlook. What do you see in 2023?\n\nThe future is inherently unknowable. Nobody predicted inflation at this level. Investor positioning now looks to be quite pessimistic, but if you think about it, the basic fact is that the U.S. economy grows over time. You\u2019re probably going to do fine if your time horizon is longer than a year or so.\n\nHas the Federal Reserve mucked things up?\n\n\u201c\n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard for Amazon not to double over the next three years given how much cash AWS and the advertising business are throwing off.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Bill Miller\nYes, basically, that\u2019s what happened. The Fed said inflation would be transitory. Now the Fed is using backward-looking indicators and has already probably gone too far in hiking rates. The inflation that people are actually experiencing is falling rapidly. The history of the Fed is exactly what we\u2019re experiencing: They are late to react, and then they overreact.\n\nYou are known as a value investor, yet your top personal holdings include Amazon.com and Bitcoin. How do they fit with your definition of value?\n\nI don\u2019t have my own definition. I take it right out of a Finance 101 textbook. The value of any investment is the present value of the future free cash flows. There\u2019s nothing in there about a low P/E [price/earnings multiple] or a dividend yield.\n\nTake a look at Amazon, my largest personal holding by a mile. In the very first annual report, Jeff [Bezos] talks about their objective being to grow the present value of the future free cash flow at the highest possible rate. Today, Amazon stock is about $85, below where it was at the market low on March 23, 2020. It was $170 a year ago. It\u2019s going to be hard for Amazon not to double over the next three years given how much cash AWS [web services] and the advertising business are throwing off. It is one of cheapest stocks overall, despite the fact that it looks expensive today.\n\nWhat are some of your other favorite stocks now?\n\nDelta is one of the few airlines that didn\u2019t dilute investors with equity issuance during the pandemic. I like to look at a stock\u2019s free-cash-flow yield [a ratio that measures the free cash flow per share against the share price]. The market\u2019s free-cash-flow yield now is about 6%. Delta is trading at 6.8 times next 12 months earnings and has a 10% free-cash-flow yield. That is cheap.\n\nI\u2019ll give you a couple more. We believe Chesapeake Energy [CHK] has a secure 10% dividend yield, and earnings are basically all free cash. Then there is OneMain Holdings [OMF], a subprime lender with an 11% dividend yield that is trading for less than five times this year\u2019s earnings. People are worried because they expect a recession and unemployment to rise, but I see almost no scenario short of World War III where OneMain would lose money.\n\nI have a few to mention that are way under the radar. There\u2019s a little company called Quad/Graphics [QUAD], a printer, trading at $3.50, or about one times estimated free cash flow over the next five quarters. No one follows it. It\u2019s about as cheap as anything you\u2019ll ever see that\u2019s out there. Then there is Gannett [GCI], the largest newspaper chain in the country. The CEO has been buying shares. In the next 12 months it should generate half its market cap in free cash.\n\nI have a large carried interest in Clear Secure [YOU], a biometric security company which is a window into travel and has an attractive membership model. I was an early investor and was on the board. The stock isn\u2019t down. I also like Farfetch [FTCH], a luxury-goods online company. It\u2019s kind of the Shopify [SHOP] for high-end luxury. It\u2019s doing badly because of Russia, but China is reopening. The stock is at $4.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the crypto sector. Where do things go from here?\n\nIt\u2019s very controversial right now. I own Bitcoin personally and we also own Bitcoin in some private accounts. We also own Coinbase Global [COIN] and Silvergate Capital. Coinbase is a real company headquartered in the U.S. It\u2019s transparent and dominant in the crypto space. There is an opportunity there. Even more interesting, but less sure, is Silvergate, which is an FDIC-insured bank. And because it is a bank, it is subject to [banking] regulations. A year ago the stock was $155; today it is $17.\n\nDid the FTX debacle make you wonder if you should get out of the crypto area?\n\nFirst, I want to differentiate between Bitcoin, which I see as a potential store of value like digital gold, and all the other cryptocurrencies, which can be lumped together in the category of venture speculation. Most of them, like most venture investments, will fail. But I\u2019ve never heard a good argument that you shouldn\u2019t put at least 1% of your net worth into Bitcoin. Anybody can afford to lose 1%.\n\nAt the market low of 2020, Bitcoin was $5,800. Bitcoin is now $17,400. Roughly since then, the market is up 70%, and Bitcoin is up 190%. If anyone has a time horizon of longer than a year, you should do quite well in Bitcoin. I wouldn\u2019t call that an investment. I would call it a speculation, but I would call it a sound speculation.\n\nAre you surprised Bitcoin hasn\u2019t provided a hedge against inflation?\n\nI\u2019m surprised Bitcoin isn\u2019t at half of its current price given the FTX implosion. People have fled the space, so the fact that it\u2019s still hanging in there at $17,000 is pretty remarkable. But inflation is being attacked and real rates are rising rapidly. I would expect that if and when the Federal Reserve begins to pivot [toward easier monetary policy], Bitcoin would do quite well.\n\nDid you sell any of your crypto holdings in the past year, or did you buy more?\n\nI generally thrive on inaction. I don\u2019t like to sell anything unless I\u2019m forced to with margin calls. I recently bought more Amazon. I bought Silvergate a week ago and expect to buy more Coinbase.\n\nYou must have to sell sometimes. You\u2019ve given a lot to Johns Hopkins University, and now you\u2019re retiring.\n\nI have very little cash. If I buy a house, I would sell stuff. If I have higher-cost lots, I would tend to sell those first and take a tax loss. But my cost basis in Amazon, Clear, and Bitcoin is so low, it\u2019s virtually all capital gains. Think about it: If you sell a stock that has gains, you\u2019re going to pay a 20-plus percent capital-gains tax. So there would be no reason to sell anything unless you think it\u2019s going down more than 20%. I try to buy things I\u2019ll never have to sell.\n\nAre you still a billionaire? Even after the past year?\n\nMy net worth is down a lot in the past 12 months. It depends how you calculate. It is close, but it was way above that a year ago.\n\nWhat are your goals in retirement?\n\nI\u2019ll have more time when I\u2019m not owning the firm and managing other people\u2019s money. I\u2019ll be able to get away for longer, and I expect to do more traveling this year. I\u2019m in Florida now, where I\u2019m a resident, but I\u2019ll be back in Baltimore for [baseball\u2019s] Opening Day.\n\nYou\u2019re a well-known Baltimore Orioles fan. Are you interested in ownership?\n\nI expect the Orioles are going to come up for sale for a price that is more than they\u2019re worth, based on the numbers being talked about for the [Washington] Nationals. I\u2019ll definitely take a look, but I\u2019m much more inclined to buy something that seems like a good value. It seems to me there is a big opportunity in women\u2019s basketball right now.\n\nDo you plan to do more with philanthropy?\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason that I\u2019m actively investing now. It\u2019s not like I need more money. But I think I can grow my net worth, and that money is all going to be given away. The causes that I believe in are in the education and science area. I intend to be more active with the Santa Fe Institute [a nonprofit that researches complex systems] and I\u2019m on the board of Johns Hopkins and on its investments committee. I\u2019ve got a foundation started. There\u2019s stuff to do.\n\nThanks, Bill.\n\nWrite to Amey Stone at amey.stone@barrons.com\n\nconversation-loading\""
