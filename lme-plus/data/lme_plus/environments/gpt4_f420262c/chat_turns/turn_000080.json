  "content": "Congratulations on seeing improvements in your peace lily and African violets!\n\nSnake plants are relatively low-maintenance and don't require a lot of fertilizer. However, they can still benefit from occasional feeding. You can use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer on your snake plant, but it's not necessary to use the same fertilizer you're using for your peace lily and African violets.\n\n**Snake plant fertilizer needs:**\n\nSnake plants are adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments, so they don't require a lot of fertilizer. A general-purpose, balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 20-20-20 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) or 10-10-10 can be used. You can also use a fertilizer specifically formulated for indoor plants or houseplants.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n1. **Dilute the fertilizer:** Snake plants prefer weak fertilization, so it's essential to dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n2. **Fertilize sparingly:** Feed your snake plant only during the growing season (spring and summer), and skip fertilizing during the dormant season (fall and winter).\n3. **Soil pH:** Snake plants prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil pH (around 6.0-7.0). If your fertilizer is formulated for acid-loving plants, it might not be suitable for your snake plant.\n\n**When to fertilize:**\n\nFertilize your snake plant during the growing season (spring and summer) when it's actively producing new leaves and stems. You can fertilize once a month, but make sure to follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging and dilute it to half the recommended strength.\n\nRemember, snake plants are forgiving and can thrive in neglect. If you're unsure about fertilizing, it's always better to err on the side of caution and under-fertilize than to over-fertilize, which can cause more harm than good.",
