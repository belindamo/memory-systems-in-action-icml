Remember to focus on proper form, controlled movements, and engaging the correct muscles. This will help you get the most out of your session and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nDon't forget to warm up before your strength training session, and cool down afterwards to help your body recover. Stretching and foam rolling can also be beneficial in helping your body recover from your run and strength training.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, get out there and crush your run and strength training session!\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust your routine as needed. It's always better to err on the side of caution and prioritize recovery and rest when needed.\n\nHappy running and strength training!",
