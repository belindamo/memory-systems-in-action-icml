Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Trip tracking:** You can track your trips using Shoeboxed's mobile app (iOS and Android). Simply tap \"Start Trip\" when you begin driving, and the app will use your phone's GPS to track your route.\n2. **Automatic mileage logging:** The app will automatically log your miles, including the date, time, distance, and route taken.\n3. **Classification:** You can classify each trip as business or personal, and add notes or tags to describe the trip.\n4. **Reimbursement:** You can generate a reimbursement report, which includes the total miles driven, mileage rate, and reimbursement amount.\n\n**GPS Compatibility:**\n\nShoeboxed's mileage tracking feature uses your phone's built-in GPS to track your trips. This means you don't need a separate GPS device or any special hardware. As long as you have a smartphone with a GPS chip (which most modern phones do), you're good to go!\n\nHowever, if you'd like to use an external GPS device or integrate with your vehicle's GPS system, Shoeboxed doesn't have native support for that. Their mileage tracking feature is designed to work with your phone's GPS, and it's not compatible with third-party GPS devices or vehicle systems.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Manual entry:** If you forget to track a trip or don't have GPS signal, you can manually log your miles using the app.\n* **Mileage rates:** Shoeboxed allows you to set custom mileage rates or use the standard IRS rate (currently 57.5 cents per mile).\n* **Integration:** Shoeboxed integrates with popular accounting software like QuickBooks and Xero, making it easy to export your mileage logs and reimbursement reports.\n\nOverall, Shoeboxed's mileage tracking and reimbursement feature is a convenient and user-friendly way to log business miles and get reimbursed.
