You can pay for a carry-on bag during booking or at the airport, but prices vary depending on the route and time of booking.\n* Maximum size for a carry-on bag is 22\" x 14\" x 9\".\n\n**Checked bags:**\n\n* Checked bags are also not included in the base fare. You can pay for checked bags during booking or at the airport, but prices vary depending on the route and time of booking.\n* Maximum size for a checked bag is 62 linear inches (length + width + height).\n* Spirit has a weight limit of 40 lbs. per checked bag. If your bag weighs more, you'll be charged an overweight fee.\n\n**Bag fees:**\n\n* Fees for carry-on and checked bags vary depending on the route, time of booking, and your membership status with Spirit's loyalty program, Free Spirit.

Check their website for details.\n* Some items, like lithium batteries and certain chemicals, are prohibited or restricted in carry-on and checked bags.\n\nTo minimize fees, consider packing light, paying for bags during booking (when prices are often lower), and taking advantage of Spirit's bundle deals, which can include baggage fees.\n\nBefore your trip, double-check Spirit's website for the most up-to-date baggage policies and fees, as they may change. It's also a good idea to weigh and measure your bags to ensure they meet Spirit's size and weight requirements.\n\nHave a great trip to Fort Lauderdale, and I hope this information helps you navigate Spirit's baggage policies!",
