Limit the number of vintage pieces: Focus on incorporating a few statement vintage pieces into your decor, rather than filling your whole space with vintage items. This will ensure a cohesive look and prevent your space from looking cluttered. 2. Use a neutral backdrop: Use a neutral color palette for your walls, floors, and larger furniture pieces. This will provide a calm backdrop that allows your vintage items to stand out without overwhelming the space. 3. Follow a design style: Choose a design style that you like and use it as a guide for your decor. For instance, if you like mid-century modern design, focus on incorporating mid-century vintage items. 4. Mix and match textures: Vintage pieces often have a lot of texture, so mix them with modern items that have a smoother texture to create balance and prevent the space from feeling cluttered. 5. Create vignettes: Create vignettes with your vintage items that tell a story or have a common theme. Grouping together items with a shared aesthetic will make a more significant statement than scattering them throughout your space. 6. Use vintage items as accents: Use vintage items as accents, such as decorative pieces or art, to complement your existing decor rather than having them as the focal point. Remember to balance vintage pieces with modern items to create a cohesive look in your space.",
