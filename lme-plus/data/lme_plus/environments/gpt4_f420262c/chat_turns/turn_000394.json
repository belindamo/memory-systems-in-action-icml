  "content": "As a Marriott Bonvoy member, you're on the right track to using your points to upgrade your stay.\n\nHowever, I need to clarify that upgrading to a suite using points is not a guaranteed option. Suite upgrades are typically subject to availability and can vary by hotel. The JW Marriott in Austin, Texas, may have different policies and availability for suite upgrades.\n\nThat being said, as a Marriott Bonvoy member, you can try to use your points to upgrade your room category, including potentially to a suite. Here are a few options you can explore:\n\n1. **Room Upgrade Awards**: Marriott Bonvoy offers Room Upgrade Awards, which allow you to upgrade your room category using points. The number of points required varies by hotel and room type. You can check the Marriott website or contact their customer service to see if this option is available for your stay.\n2. **Suite Night Awards**: If you have Suite Night Awards available, you can use them to upgrade to a suite. Suite Night Awards are earned by achieving certain elite status levels or through special promotions. You can check your Marriott Bonvoy account to see if you have any Suite Night Awards available.\n3. **Points Upgrade**: Some hotels may offer points upgrades to suites, but this is typically only available if the suite is available at check-in. You can ask the hotel directly if they offer points upgrades to suites and what the point requirement would be.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a suite upgrade, I recommend:\n\n* Booking your stay well in advance to ensure availability\n* Contacting the hotel directly to inquire about suite upgrade options and availability\n* Being flexible with your travel dates and room preferences\n* Considering booking a room category that is more likely to be upgraded to a suite (e.g., a higher-category room or a room with a separate living area)\n\nKeep in mind that suite upgrades are subject to availability and may not be guaranteed, even with points. However, it never hurts to ask, and being a loyal Marriott Bonvoy member can certainly increase your chances of getting a upgrade.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in getting a suite upgrade for your stay in Austin!",
