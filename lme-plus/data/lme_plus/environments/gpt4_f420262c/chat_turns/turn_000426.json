  "content": "Here is an example of an HTML program that creates a simple table with two rows and two columns:\n```php\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n\t<title>Simple Table Example</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\t<table border=\"1\">\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Header 1</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Header 2</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Row 1, Column 1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Row 1, Column 2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Row 2, Column 1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Row 2, Column 2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</table>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nIn the above example, we have defined a table with two rows and two columns, with a border attribute set to \"1\" to display a border around the table. The first row of the table contains two header cells created with the \"th\" tag, and the subsequent rows contain data cells created with the \"td\" tag. You can customize the contents of the cells by replacing the text within the tags.\n\nNote that the \"DOCTYPE html\" declaration at the beginning of the code is used to indicate that the code is written in HTML5, which is the latest version of the HTML standard.",
