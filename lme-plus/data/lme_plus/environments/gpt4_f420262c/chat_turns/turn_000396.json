And don't worry, we won't hold the United Airlines delay against them .\n\nNow, let's compare the in-flight entertainment systems of American Airlines and Delta:\n\n**American Airlines**\n\n* Seat-back screens: Available on most aircraft, including Boeing 737-800, 777-200, and Airbus A321T.\n* Personal device entertainment: Available on most domestic flights, allowing you to stream content to your device via the American Airlines app.\n* Content: Offers a wide selection of movies, TV shows, music, and games.\n* Availability: Entertainment is available on most flights, but the selection might be limited on shorter flights.\n* Charging: Power outlets and USB ports are available on most aircraft, but availability may vary depending on the seat and aircraft type.\n\n**Delta**\n\n* Delta Studio: Offers a wide selection of movies, TV shows, music, and games on seat-back screens or via the Fly Delta app on your personal device.\n* Seat-back screens: Available on most aircraft, including Airbus A321, Boeing 737-900ER, and Airbus A350.\n* Personal device entertainment: Available on most flights, allowing you to stream content to your device via the Fly Delta app.\n* Content: Features a vast library of content, including new releases and exclusive content from partners like HBO and Showtime.\n* Availability: Entertainment is available on most flights, with a limited selection on shorter flights.\n* Charging: Power outlets and USB ports are available on most aircraft, with some seats offering USB-C charging ports.\n\nBoth airlines offer similar in-flight entertainment options, with seat-back screens and personal device entertainment available on most flights. However, Delta's Delta Studio is often praised for its more extensive content library and user-friendly interface.\n\nConsidering your previous experience with American Airlines' entertainment system, you might want to try Delta's system to see if it better meets your needs. On the other hand, American Airlines has made efforts to improve their entertainment system, so it's possible that your next experience might be better.\n\nBefore making a final decision, you might want to check the specific aircraft and route you'll be flying to ensure that the entertainment system is available on your flight.\n\nI hope this helps, and have a great trip to Miami!",
