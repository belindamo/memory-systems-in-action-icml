  "content": "I think you might be referring to a drain screen or drain cover! A drain screen is a mesh or perforated cover that fits over the drain hole in your sink to catch hair, soap scum, and other debris before they go down the drain. This helps prevent clogs and makes cleaning the drain easier.\n\nIf you're looking for a replacement, you can usually find drain screens or covers at most hardware stores, home goods stores, or online marketplaces. They come in different sizes and materials, so make sure to get one that fits your sink's drain hole and meets your needs.\n\nIf you're not sure what to call it, you can also try searching for \"sink drain catcher\" or \"drain guard\" \u2013 these terms might help you find what you're looking for!\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!",
