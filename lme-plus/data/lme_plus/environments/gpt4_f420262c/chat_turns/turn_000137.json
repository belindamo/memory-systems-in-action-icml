I'm interested in trying out the \"Simple and Gentle\" routine, starting with stretching and hydrating. I'll also consider adding some morning sunlight to my routine, as I've heard it can help regulate my circadian rhythms. By the way, I slept in until 11:00 AM on a Thursday, which was a bit of an anomaly for me. I'm hoping to avoid days like that by establishing a consistent wake-up routine. Do you have any tips on how to make my wake-up routine stick?",
