It's great to hear that you're happy with the results.\n\nRegarding setting solutions for decals, I'm glad you've already tried one out and seen positive results! A good setting solution can make a huge difference in getting decals to conform to the model's surface and preventing silvering or bubbles.\n\nHere are a few popular setting solutions that are highly recommended by modelers:\n\n1. **Micro Set**: This is a classic setting solution that's been around for years. It's a gentle, non-toxic formula that helps decals settle down and conform to the model's surface. Micro Set is available in various sizes and is widely available at hobby stores.\n2. **Micro Sol**: This is another popular setting solution from the same manufacturer as Micro Set. Micro Sol is a more aggressive formula that's designed for more stubborn decals or those with complex curves. It's also great for getting rid of silvering or bubbles.\n3. **Tamiya Mark Fit**: Tamiya is a well-known brand in the modeling world, and their Mark Fit setting solution is a favorite among many modelers. It's a gentle, non-toxic formula that's designed to help decals settle down quickly and evenly.\n4. ** Vallejo Decal Fix**: Vallejo is a well-respected brand in the modeling world, and their Decal Fix setting solution is a popular choice among modelers. It's a gentle, water-based formula that's designed to help decals conform to the model's surface and prevent silvering.\n\nWhen choosing a setting solution, make sure to read the instructions carefully and follow the recommended application guidelines. It's also a good idea to test the solution on a small, inconspicuous area of the model before applying it to the decals.\n\nSome general tips for using setting solutions:\n\n* Apply the solution sparingly, as excess solution can cause the decals to float or spread excessively.\n* Use a soft brush to gently apply the solution to the decals, working from the center outwards.\n* Avoid applying too much pressure, as this can cause the decals to stretch or distort.\n* Allow the solution to dry completely before handling the model or applying additional coats.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy modeling!",
