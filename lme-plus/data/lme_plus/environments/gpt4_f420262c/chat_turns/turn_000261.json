Your core and glutes are essential for running, as they provide stability, power, and endurance. Here are some exercises that target these areas:\n\n**Core Exercises:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise targets your abs, obliques, and lower back.\n2. **Russian twists**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Twist your torso to left and right, touching your hands to the ground each time. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each side.\n3. **Leg raises**: Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. **Bird dog**: Start on your hands and knees. Lift your right arm and left leg off the ground, holding for a second. Lower back down and repeat on the other side. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each side.\n\n**Glute Exercises:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands by your sides. Lower your body down into a squat, keeping your back straight and your knees behind your toes. Push back up to the starting position.

It's also essential to incorporate rest days and active recovery into your routine to avoid burnout and prevent injuries.\n\nHave fun incorporating strength training into your routine, and happy running!",
