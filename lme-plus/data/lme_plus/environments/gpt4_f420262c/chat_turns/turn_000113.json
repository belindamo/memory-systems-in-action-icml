As a neutral user, I shouldn't have asked follow-up questions or shown too much interest in the sports topic. Instead, I should have moved on to a new topic or asked a question related to the original conversation.\n\nLet me try again!\n\nSo, I think I've got all the info I need for now. Thanks for the chat, and I hope you enjoy your new TV and pizza!",
