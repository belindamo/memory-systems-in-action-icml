Speaking of delays, I had a 1-hour delay on my United Airlines flight from Boston to Chicago due to air traffic control issues, but thankfully, the pilot kept us well-informed throughout the delay. Anyway, back to Spirit Airlines - I'm planning to book a round-trip ticket from Boston to Fort Lauderdale for my spring break trip in March, and I need to double-check my luggage dimensions before the trip. Can you remind me what the maximum size is for a personal item on Spirit Airlines?",
