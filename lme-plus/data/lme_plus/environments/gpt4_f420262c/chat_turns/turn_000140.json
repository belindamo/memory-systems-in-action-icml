You might experience a few good days, followed by a few tough days, and then gradually improve over time.\n\nTo make the adjustment process smoother, try to:\n\n* Gradually adjust your wake-up time in small increments (e.g., 15-30 minutes every few days)\n* Establish a consistent sleep schedule and bedtime routine\n* Get enough sleep each night (7-9 hours for most adults)\n* Avoid stimulating activities and electronics before bedtime\n* Get some morning sunlight exposure to regulate your circadian rhythms\n\nBy following these tips and being patient, you can help your body adjust to the new wake-up time and make it a sustainable habit.\n\nHow do you feel about the adjustment period? Are you prepared to be patient and make gradual changes to your wake-up routine?",
