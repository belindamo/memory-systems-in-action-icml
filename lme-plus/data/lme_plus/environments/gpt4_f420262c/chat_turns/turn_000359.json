  "content": "The Fossil Grant Chronograph Watch (FS4486) is a larger watch, and it might not fit comfortably on a smaller wrist.\n\nHowever, Fossil does offer a smaller version of the Grant Chronograph Watch, specifically designed for smaller wrists. Here are some options:\n\n1. **Fossil Grant Chronograph Watch (FS4484)**: This version has a slightly smaller case diameter of 42mm (1.65 inches) and a thinner case thickness of 10mm (0.39 inches). It's available in various color combinations and strap options.\n2. **Fossil Grant Chronograph Watch (FS4490)**: This model has an even smaller case diameter of 38mm (1.50 inches) and a case thickness of 9mm (0.35 inches). It's a more compact version of the Grant Chronograph Watch, perfect for smaller wrists.\n\nBoth of these smaller versions still feature the same chronograph functions, date display, and quartz movement as the original FS4486 model. They're also priced similarly, ranging from $50-$65 on Amazon.\n\nBefore making a purchase, I recommend checking the product description or manufacturer's website to ensure the watch fits your brother's wrist size comfortably. You can also read reviews from other customers with similar wrist sizes to get a better understanding of the watch's fit.",
