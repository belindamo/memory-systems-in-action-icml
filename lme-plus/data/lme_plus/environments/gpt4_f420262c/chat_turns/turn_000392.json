  "content": "As a Marriott Bonvoy member, you're on the right track to earning points towards a free stay.\n\nHowever, I need to clarify that the Westin New York at Times Square is a Starwood property, not a Marriott property. Starwood and Marriott merged in 2016, but they still operate under separate loyalty programs.\n\nAs a Marriott Bonvoy member, you wouldn't be able to redeem points for a free night at the Westin New York at Times Square. Instead, you would need to earn and redeem points through the Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) loyalty program.\n\nIf you're interested in earning points towards a free stay at the Westin New York at Times Square, I recommend joining the SPG program and earning points through their loyalty program. You can then redeem those points for a free night at the hotel.\n\nKeep in mind that the number of points required for a free night will vary depending on the hotel category, room type, and time of year. I recommend checking the SPG website or contacting their customer service to determine the exact point requirements for a free night at the Westin New York at Times Square.\n\nI hope this clears things up, and happy earning!",
