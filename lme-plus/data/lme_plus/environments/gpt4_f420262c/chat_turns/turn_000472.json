  "content": "Process mining is a technique used to analyze and improve business processes. It uses data from various systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and workflow management systems, to create a visual representation of the process and identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement. The process mining software analyzes the data to discover the underlying process models, which can be used to identify inefficiencies, non-compliant behavior and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, process mining can also be used to verify if the process is being executed as defined in the process model and to monitor the process in real-time.",
