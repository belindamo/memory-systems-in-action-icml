I'd be happy to help you with its care.\n\n**Watering:**\nPrayer plants (Maranta leuconeura) prefer moist soil, but they don't like to be waterlogged. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. Water your prayer plant when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry. Water thoroughly, making sure the pot drains well to prevent root rot. Avoid getting water on the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.\n\nAs a general rule, water your prayer plant:\n\n* Every 7-10 days during the spring and summer months when it's actively growing.\n* Every 4-6 weeks during the fall and winter months when it's dormant.\n\n**Fertilization:**\nGreat to hear about your success with your peace lily and African violets! You can definitely use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer on your prayer plant as well. Feed your prayer plant during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced fertilizer (20-20-20) at half the recommended strength. Diluting the fertilizer will prevent burning the roots.\n\nFertilize your prayer plant:\n\n* Once a month during the spring and summer months.\n* You can skip fertilizing during the fall and winter months when the plant is dormant.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Prayer plants prefer bright, indirect light, but not direct sunlight.\n* Maintain a consistent temperature between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C).\n* Humidity: Prayer plants thrive in humid environments, but they can adapt to average humidity levels. To keep your plant happy, you can place the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier nearby.\n* Prune your prayer plant regularly to maintain its shape and encourage new growth.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your prayer plant healthy and thriving. Good luck, and enjoy your new plant!",
