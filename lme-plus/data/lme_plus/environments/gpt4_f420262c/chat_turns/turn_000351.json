Whole-grain sandwiches: Instead of white bread, choose whole-grain bread or wraps for your sandwiches/wraps. You can also add lean proteins like grilled chicken, turkey breast, roasted tofu, or hummus and plenty of vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers, avocado, etc.\n\n2. Salads: Salads can be a great option for a nutrient-rich meal when you are in a hurry. Look for salads with a variety of colorful vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and healthy fats like nuts, seeds, and olive oil.\n\n3. Fresh fruit: Fresh fruit is a great source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, and berries are easy to carry and can be a great snack to-go.\n\n4. Trail mixes: Try making your own trail mix with dried fruits, nuts, seeds, and a small amount of dark chocolate.\n\n5. Yogurt: Yogurt is an excellent source of probiotics and calcium. Look for plain yogurt and add your own fruit and nuts, or choose greek yogurts that are higher in proteins.\n\nIn general, it is always best to choose meals that are rich in nutrients and low in unhealthy fats, salt, and added sugars. If you have to eat on the go frequently, try to plan ahead and carry healthy snacks and meals with you whenever possible.",
