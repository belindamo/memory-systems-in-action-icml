  "content": "I apologize for the misunderstanding. Here is a revised definition of a non-deterministic matrix semantics that takes into account the arity of the connectives, as requested:\n\n\\begin{frame}\n\\frametitle{Revised Non-Deterministic Matrix Semantics}\n\\begin{definition}\nA \\emph{non-deterministic logical matrix} is a tuple $(X, Y, V, C, \\cdot)$, where:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $X$ is a set of truth-values.\n\\item $Y \\subseteq X$ is a set of \\emph{designated truth-values}.\n\\item $V$ is a set of propositions called the \\emph{universe of discourse}.\n\\item $C$ is a set of logical connectives, each with a specified arity.\n\\item $\\cdot: C \\times X^{arity} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a function that assigns a set of truth-values in $X$ to each logical connective in $C$ and a tuple of truth-values in $X$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{definition}\n\\end{frame}\n\nThis revised definition takes into account the arity of the connectives, meaning that the interpretation function assigns a set of truth-values to each connective and a tuple of truth-values, rather than a single truth-value. This allows for a more flexible and expressive definition of non-deterministic matrix semantics.\n\nI hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
