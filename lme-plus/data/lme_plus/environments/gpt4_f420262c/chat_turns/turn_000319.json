As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal interactions or conversations, so I didn't help you with a new shower curtain or discuss soap scum removal with you before.\n\nBut don't worry, I'd be happy to provide you with some general tips on how to get rid of soap scum in the shower!\n\nSoap scum can be a real pain, but there are a few methods to remove it:\n\n1. **Baking soda and vinegar**: Mix baking soda and vinegar to create a paste. Apply it to the soap scum stain and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Then, scrub it off with a non-abrasive sponge or cloth and rinse with warm water.\n2. **White vinegar**: Spray white vinegar directly on the soap scum and let it sit for a few minutes. The acid in the vinegar will help break down the scum. Scrub it off with a non-abrasive sponge or cloth and rinse with warm water.\n3. **Barkeeper's Friend**: This is a gentle, non-abrasive cleaner that's specifically designed to remove soap scum and mildew. Apply it to the affected area, scrub it off, and rinse with warm water.\n4. **Soap scum removers**: You can also purchase specialized soap scum removers at most hardware stores or home goods stores. Follow the product's instructions for best results.\n\nAs for your new shower curtain, it's great to hear that it's still looking brand new after three weeks! To keep it looking its best, make sure to clean it regularly and dry it thoroughly after each use. You can also consider using a shower curtain liner to help prevent soap scum and mildew buildup.\n\nI hope that helps! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
