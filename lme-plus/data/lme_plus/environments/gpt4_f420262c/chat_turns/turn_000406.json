  "content": "The Hyatt Regency Miami Airport is a great choice, and their shuttle service to the Port of Miami cruise terminal can be a convenient perk. Here's what I found out about their shuttle service:\n\n**Shuttle Schedule:**\n\nThe Hyatt Regency Miami Airport offers a shuttle service to the Port of Miami cruise terminal on cruise departure days. The shuttle typically runs on a schedule, with multiple departures throughout the morning. The exact schedule may vary depending on the cruise line and terminal, but here's a general idea:\n\n* Departures from the hotel: around 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM, and 12:00 PM (subject to change)\n* Travel time: approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on traffic\n\n**Reserving a Spot on the Shuttle:**\n\nTo reserve a spot on the shuttle, you'll need to contact the hotel directly. Here's how:\n\n1. Call the hotel's concierge team at (305) 871-1234 and ask to book a spot on the Port of Miami cruise terminal shuttle.\n2. Provide your cruise line, ship name, and departure date to ensure the correct shuttle schedule.\n3. Confirm your reservation with the concierge team, as space is limited.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* The shuttle service is available on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's essential to reserve your spot as early as possible.\n* The hotel recommends arriving at the hotel at least one day prior to your cruise departure to ensure a smooth transfer.\n* If you have a lot of luggage, you may want to consider arranging for a private transfer or taxi service, as the shuttle may have limited space for luggage.\n* The shuttle service is subject to change or cancellation due to weather, traffic, or other unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIt's always a good idea to reconfirm the shuttle schedule and your reservation with the hotel a day or two before your cruise departure to ensure everything is in place.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a smooth and enjoyable cruise experience!",
