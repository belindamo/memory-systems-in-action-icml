  "content": "You're welcome! I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to try out the Sage Syrup. Using fresh sage leaves and infusing it for 30 minutes to 1 hour will result in a beautiful, subtle flavor that will complement the Hendrick's gin perfectly.\n\nRemember to taste the syrup as you go and adjust the infusion time to your liking. You can always infuse it for a bit longer if you prefer a stronger sage flavor.\n\nWhen you're ready to mix your Sage Gimlet or Sage Spritz, don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further guidance or have any questions. I'd be happy to help you refine your recipe or provide suggestions for garnishes and other ingredients.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and enjoy the process of creating something new and delicious!",
