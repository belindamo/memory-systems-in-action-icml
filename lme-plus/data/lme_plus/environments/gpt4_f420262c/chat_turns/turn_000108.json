You're in luck because I've got some hot deals on 4K TVs for you!\n\nBefore I dive into the deals, I want to recommend a few things to consider when shopping for a 4K TV:\n\n1. **Screen size**: Measure your room and consider how far you'll be sitting from the TV.

Look for HDR10, HDR10+, or Dolby Vision support.\n3. **Refresh rate**: A higher refresh rate (e.g., 120Hz or 240Hz) ensures smoother motion, which is perfect for fast-paced sports.\n4. **Smart TV features**: Ensure the TV has built-in streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and sports-specific apps like ESPN or Fox Sports.\n\nNow, here are some current deals on 4K TVs that might interest you:\n\n**Budget-friendly options:**\n\n1.
