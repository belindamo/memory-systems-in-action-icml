  "content": "What a great combination! Basil, mint, and cherry tomatoes are a match made in heaven! Now, let's talk about companion plants that can help your cherry tomatoes thrive. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Borage**: As I mentioned earlier, borage is a great companion plant for tomatoes. It attracts beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, which help pollinate cherry tomatoes. Its tall stems also provide shade and support for indeterminate cherry tomato varieties.\n2. **Chives**: Chives are a natural repellent for aphids and other pests that target cherry tomatoes. They also add a mild onion flavor to many dishes, making them a great addition to your garden.\n3. **Marigold**: Marigold repels nematodes, which can harm cherry tomatoes, and also attracts beneficial insects that prey on tomato pests.\n4. **Oregano**: Oregano is a natural fungicide that can help prevent diseases like early blight and septoria leaf spot in cherry tomatoes.\n5. **Parsley**: Parsley is another natural pest repellent that can help keep carrot flies and other pests away from cherry tomatoes.\n6. **Radish**: Radish can help to repel cucumber beetles, which can spread bacterial wilt to cherry tomatoes.\n7. **Nasturtium**: Nasturtium repels aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that target cherry tomatoes. Its bright flowers also attract beneficial insects.\n8. **Dill**: Dill is a natural pest repellent that can help keep aphids, spider mites, and other pests away from cherry tomatoes.\n\nWhen planting companion plants with cherry tomatoes, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n* Plant companion plants around the perimeter of your cherry tomato bed to create a \"trap crop\" effect, where pests are attracted to the companion plants instead of the cherry tomatoes.\n* Plant companion plants at the same time as your cherry tomatoes, or slightly before, to give them a head start.\n* Make sure to plant companion plants according to their growing requirements and space needs.\n* Keep the soil consistently moist and well-draining to promote healthy growth for both your cherry tomatoes and companion plants.\n\nBy incorporating these companion plants into your garden, you can create a thriving ecosystem that benefits your cherry tomatoes and adds flavor and beauty to your cooking!",
