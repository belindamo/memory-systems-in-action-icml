  "content": "Sevilla celebrates its cultural festivals and traditions with great fervor and enthusiasm. The two most famous festivals in Sevilla are Semana Santa and Feria de Abril.\n\nSemana Santa, or Holy Week, is celebrated in the week leading up to Easter Sunday. It is a religious festival where processions of elaborately decorated floats depicting scenes from the Passion of Christ are carried through the streets by members of the city's religious brotherhoods. People gather in the streets to watch the processions, and many families have their own traditions and rituals associated with the festival, such as attending particular processions or visiting specific churches.\n\nFeria de Abril is a week-long festival that takes place two weeks after Semana Santa. It is a celebration of the Andalusian culture, with lots of dancing, music, food, and drink. The festival is held in a large fairground on the outskirts of the city, with huge marquees, or casetas, set up by families, businesses, and social clubs. The casetas are brightly decorated and offer food and drink to visitors. Flamenco dancers and musicians provide entertainment, and the whole city seems to come alive with the spirit of the festival.\n\nOverall, Semana Santa and Feria de Abril are both celebrated with great passion and pride in Sevilla. They are times of joy and celebration, when people come together to celebrate their culture and traditions with their friends and family.",
