It's a wired mouse that's specifically designed for comfort and performance. It features a 12,000 CPI HERO sensor, which provides fast and accurate tracking, and a lightweight, ergonomic design that's meant to reduce fatigue.\n\nThe Logitech G Pro X is also known for its comfortable shape, which should help reduce thumb cramping during long gaming sessions. Many users have reported that it's one of the most comfortable mice they've ever used.\n\nAdditionally, the Logitech G Pro X is a great value for its price, and it's widely available in the $50-$70 range.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring other options, the **SteelSeries Rival 3** and **Corsair Harpoon** are also great choices that prioritize comfort and accuracy. However, the Logitech G Pro X is a great all-around option that should meet your needs.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to explore other options!",
