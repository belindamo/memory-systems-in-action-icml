Can you improve my current text?\n\n\"Hi Khalid,\n\nIt looks like I will have to push the start date back by one month...\nI'm still in the process of getting the necessary documents that should allow me to leave Ukraine for extended periods of time. I thought I already had all of them, but on Feb 23 I was not allowed to leave Ukraine by the Ukrainian border control, and now I have applied for additional documents. It may take a month to get them according to the officials. \nI should be able to leave Ukraine once the new documents are ready. But it is not 100% guaranteed given the current situation, as the regulations on this topic change very often (16 times since the war started).\nThus I will be able to notify my current employer of my leave only once I've left Ukraine. Given the 1-month notice period, it brings my start date around May 2.\"",
