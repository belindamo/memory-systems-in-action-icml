Since you're looking for a similar vibe to the black turtleneck, I'd suggest exploring tops that have a similar silhouette or texture to create a cohesive look. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Simple white or beige tank top**: A lightweight, fitted tank will create a clean contrast with the bold floral pattern of the skirt. You can add a denim jacket or cardigan for a casual, effortless look.\n2. **Cropped fitted sweater**: A fitted, cropped sweater in a neutral color like beige, light gray, or pale blue will complement the high-waisted skirt nicely. You can opt for a similar texture to the black turtleneck for a cohesive look.\n3. **Blouse with a relaxed fit**: If you want to add some visual interest, try pairing the skirt with a blouse with a relaxed fit, V-neck, and a soft fabric like cotton or silk. Look for a blouse with a subtle pattern or texture to avoid competing with the floral skirt.\n4. **Graphic tee**: If you want to dress down the skirt, try pairing it with a graphic tee in a neutral color. This will create a fun, casual look perfect for a weekend gathering.\n\nTo complete the outfit, consider adding some neutral-colored shoes, like sneakers, sandals, or ankle boots, depending on the occasion and your personal style.\n\nRemember, the key is to balance the boldness of the floral skirt with a simpler top that complements its silhouette and texture. Experiment with different combinations, and have fun with it!",
