That black turtleneck sweater from Paris must have been a great find!\n\nAnd I'm excited for you to try out the white linen shirt with the floral skirt. It's always fun to experiment with new combinations and see what works. Don't be afraid to try different styles and see what makes you feel confident and comfortable. That's what fashion is all about!\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to wear what makes you happy and feel like yourself. If the white linen shirt and floral skirt combo doesn't work out, you can always try something else. But I hope it does, and you'll have a great time rocking that outfit!\n\nHave fun experimenting, and I hope you have a fantastic weekend ahead!",
