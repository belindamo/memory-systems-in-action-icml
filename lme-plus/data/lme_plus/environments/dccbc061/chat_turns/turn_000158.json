  "content": "Yes, there are many modern buildings that use travertine in a similar way as the Getty Center to make classical elements stand out. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Villa La Roche, Paris: Designed by Le Corbusier, Villa La Roche is a modernist house with classical elements such as a colonnade of travertine columns on the fa\u00e7ade. The use of travertine gives the house a timeless quality, while still being a modernist work.\n\n2. Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth: Designed by Louis Kahn, the exterior of the Kimbell Art Museum is composed of travertine walls with long bands of windows. The use of travertine creates a monolithic and timeless quality to the building.\n\n3. National Museum of American Jewish History, Philadelphia: Designed by Ennead Architects, the museum's fa\u00e7ade is clad with travertine panels, which gives the building a classical appearance. The use of travertine panels also highlights the building's historic and cultural importance.\n\n4. The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis: Designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, the Walker Art Center's fa\u00e7ade is composed of a massive travertine wall system, which creates a calm and serene environment within the building's walls.\n\nThese are just a few examples of modern buildings that use travertine in a similar way as the Getty Center to make classical elements stand out.",
