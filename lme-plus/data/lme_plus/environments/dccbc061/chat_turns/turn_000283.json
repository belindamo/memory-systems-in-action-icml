  "content": "I'm looking for some recommendations on Broadway plays to watch online. I recently watched a play online and was really impressed by the performance, especially the actor who played one of the main characters - his voice was so powerful and emotive. I wanted to catch all the lyrics and nuances of the performance that I might have missed the first time around, so I watched it again. Do you have any suggestions?",
