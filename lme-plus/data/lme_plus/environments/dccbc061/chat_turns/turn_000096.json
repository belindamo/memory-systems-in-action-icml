I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't have any information about your past purchases or activities.\n\nIf you're trying to remember where you bought your new goggles, you might want to try checking your email receipts, credit card statements, or searching your online order history. You could also try asking a family member or friend if they remember where you bought them.\n\nIf you're looking to get back into swimming, I'd be happy to provide you with some general information or tips to get you started again!",
