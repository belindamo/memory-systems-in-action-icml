  "content": "A coupon binder is a fantastic way to keep your coupons organized and easily accessible.\n\nCategorizing your coupons is a crucial step in creating a functional binder. You can categorize your coupons in various ways, depending on your personal preferences and shopping habits. Here are some popular methods to consider:\n\n1. **Store-based categorization**: Organize your coupons by store name (e.g., H&M, Target, Walmart, etc.). This is helpful if you frequently shop at specific stores and want to see all the coupons you have for each store in one place.\n2. **Product-based categorization**: Group your coupons by product type (e.g., food, household, clothing, beauty, etc.). This is useful if you tend to buy similar products regularly and want to see all the relevant coupons together.\n3. **Expiration date-based categorization**: Organize your coupons by expiration date, with the soonest expiring coupons at the front of the binder. This ensures you use the coupons that are about to expire first and avoid missing out on deals.\n4. **Hybrid approach**: Combine two or more of the above methods. For example, you could have separate sections for stores, and within each store section, organize coupons by product type or expiration date.\n\nHere's a sample outline to get you started:\n\n**Store-based categorization**\n\n* H&M\n\t+ Clothing\n\t+ Accessories\n* Target\n\t+ Food\n\t+ Household\n* Walmart\n\t+ Beauty\n\t+ Health\n\n**Product-based categorization**\n\n* Food\n\t+ Grocery stores (e.g., Walmart, Target)\n\t+ Restaurants (e.g., pizza, coffee shops)\n* Household\n\t+ Cleaning supplies\n\t+ Paper products\n* Clothing\n\t+ H&M\n\t+ Department stores (e.g., Macy's, Nordstrom)\n\n**Expiration date-based categorization**\n\n* Expiring this week\n* Expiring next week\n* Expiring in 2-3 weeks\n* Expiring in 1-2 months\n\nRemember, the key is to create a system that works for you and your shopping habits. You can always adjust your categorization method as needed.\n\nWhat do you think? Is one of these methods resonating with you, or do you have a different approach in mind?",
