  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific details of the film adaptation process, but it is likely that the Coen brothers made changes to both the setting and dialogue to create a more modernized version of \"Macbeth\". The language and dialogue used in Shakespearean plays can be difficult for modern audiences to understand, so it is probable that the filmmakers updated the language and dialogue to make it more accessible. Additionally, the criminal underworld setting would require changes to the plot, characters, and events to ensure they fit seamlessly into this new context. It is also possible that the filmmakers used elements of the original play's dialogue as well but changed certain phrases or idioms to better fit the modern era. Overall, it is common for adaptations of literary works to make changes to both the setting and dialogue to create a more coherent and effective film for modern audiences.",
