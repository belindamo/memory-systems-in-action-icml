Here's how to freeze pesto:\n\n**Freezing Pesto: A Step-by-Step Guide**\n\n1. **Transfer to airtight containers**: Divide the freshly made pesto into airtight containers, such as glass jars or freezer-safe plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. You can also use ice cube trays or freezer bags.\n2. **Remove air and flatten**: Remove as much air as possible from the containers or bags to prevent freezer burn. Use a spatula or spoon to flatten the pesto to an even layer, making sure to remove any air pockets.\n3. **Label and date**: Label each container or bag with the date and contents (e.g., \"Pesto - 07/15/23\").\n4. **Freeze**: Place the containers or bags in the freezer and store at 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C) or below.\n\n**Tips for Freezing Pesto:**\n\n* **Freeze in small portions**: Divide the pesto into small portions (e.g., 1/4 cup or 60ml) to make it easier to thaw and use only what you need.\n* **Use within 6 months**: Frozen pesto will generally keep for 6 months. After that, the flavor and texture may start to degrade.\n* **Thaw frozen pesto slowly**: When you're ready to use the frozen pesto, remove it from the freezer and place it in the refrigerator to thaw slowly. You can also thaw it at room temperature, but be careful not to let it sit at room temperature for too long.\n* **Stir well after thawing**: Once thawed, give the pesto a good stir to re-emulsify the ingredients.\n\n**Alternative Freezing Methods:**\n\n* **Ice cube trays**: Freeze pesto in ice cube trays and then transfer the frozen cubes to a freezer bag or container. This is a great way to freeze small portions and add them to dishes as needed.\n* **Freezer bags**: Freeze pesto in freezer bags, making sure to remove as much air as possible and flatten the bag to prevent freezer burn.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you'll be able to enjoy your delicious homemade pesto throughout the year!",
