  "content": "Yes, that is absolutely true. Horror movies can also be used as a form of social commentary and critique, and some filmmakers use horror tropes to subvert harmful stereotypes and challenge societal norms. Movies like Get Out, The Babadook, and many others have been praised for their nuanced depictions of issues like race, gender, mental illness, and more. These films have the potential to promote social change and challenge oppressive structures by highlighting societal issues and encouraging viewers to critically examine their own attitudes and biases.\n\nHorror movies can be a powerful tool for promoting empathy and understanding by introducing viewers to new perspectives and experiences. They can also create spaces for marginalized voices to be heard by subverting tropes and stereotypes and creating complex and nuanced portrayals of people and experiences that are often simplified or demonized in mainstream media.\n\nTherefore, while it's important to be aware of the potential risks and harms associated with horror movies, we should also recognize the potential they have to promote social change and challenge oppressive structures by creating more inclusive and equitable representations of marginalized groups.",
