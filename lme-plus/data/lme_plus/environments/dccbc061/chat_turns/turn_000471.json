  "content": "You're really dialing in your coffee game! Experimenting with coffee-to-water ratios is a great way to find your perfect balance. The 1:6 ratio you mentioned is quite strong, but hey, if that's what you enjoy, that's all that matters!\n\nUsing oat milk is a great choice, too. Oat milk has a creamy texture and a neutral flavor that complements the coffee nicely. Have you tried any other non-dairy milks, or are you sticking with oat milk for now?\n\nAs you continue to experiment, you might want to try adjusting the grind size of your coffee beans to see how it affects the flavor. A burr grinder can make a big difference in the flavor profile, and it's a great investment for any coffee enthusiast.\n\nNow, back to tea! Since you're enjoying strong coffee, you might appreciate a stronger green tea as well. Look for Japanese green teas like Sencha or Gyokuro, which have a more robust flavor profile compared to Chinese green teas. You could also try a green tea blend with a higher tea leaf content to intensify the flavor.\n\nDo you have a preferred tea brand or style in mind, or would you like some recommendations?",
