Unfortunately, I have to clarify that Broadway plays are typically spoken-word performances, not musicals with lyrics. However, I'd be happy to suggest some excellent Broadway plays that are available to stream online, featuring talented actors with powerful and emotive performances.\n\nHere are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Hamilton** (Disney+): Although a musical, I have to mention it since you mentioned being impressed by a powerful and emotive performance. Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit musical is a game-changer, and the filmed version on Disney+ is a great way to experience it.\n2. **The Play That Goes Wrong** (BroadwayHD): This hilarious play is a parody of Agatha Christie-style murder mysteries, with plenty of slapstick humor and witty dialogue. The cast's comedic timing and physical comedy will have you laughing out loud.\n3. **The Ferryman** (BroadwayHD): A powerful drama by Jez Butterworth, set in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. The ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances, and the play explores themes of family, loyalty, and betrayal.\n4. **The Lehman Trilogy** (National Theatre at Home): This epic play tells the story of three brothers who emigrate from Germany to the United States in the mid-19th century and build a financial empire. The performances by the three leads are phenomenal, and the play's themes of family, power, and identity are timely and thought-provoking.\n5. **What the Constitution Means to Me** (Amazon Prime Video): This thought-provoking play, written by and starring Heidi Schreck, explores the Constitution and its impact on American society. Schreck's performance is both personal and powerful, making this a great choice for those interested in politics and social commentary.\n6. **The Inheritance** (BroadwayHD): A two-part play by Matthew Lopez, inspired by E.M. Forster's novel \"Howards End.\" The play explores themes of identity, family, and community in modern-day New York City, with a talented ensemble cast delivering nuanced performances.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many amazing Broadway plays available to stream online. I hope you find something that piques your interest and provides the same level of enjoyment you experienced with your previous watch!",
