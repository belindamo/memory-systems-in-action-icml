Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Simple Butter Chicken Recipe:**\n\n**Marinade:**\n\n* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces\n* 1/2 cup plain yogurt\n* 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n* 2 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil\n* 2 teaspoons garam masala\n* 1 teaspoon cumin powder\n* 1 teaspoon coriander powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)\n* Salt, to taste\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* 2 large onions, thinly sliced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 medium tomatoes, diced\n* 1 tablespoon butter\n* 2 tablespoons tomato puree\n* 1 tablespoon ghee or vegetable oil\n* 1 teaspoon garam masala\n* 1 teaspoon cumin powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)\n* Salt, to taste\n* Fresh cilantro, for garnish\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large bowl, mix together the marinade ingredients. Add the chicken and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n2. Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Cook the chicken until browned and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.\n3. In the same skillet, heat another tablespoon of ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they're lightly browned and caramelized, about 8-10 minutes.\n4. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.\n5. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato puree, garam masala, cumin powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly.\n6. Add the cooked chicken back into the skillet and stir to coat with the sauce.\n7. Add the butter and stir until melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt to taste.\n8. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve over basmati rice or with naan bread.\n\n**Indian Cooking Techniques:**\n\n1. **Tempering**: Heating oil or ghee in a pan and adding whole spices to release their flavors and aromas. This is often done at the beginning of a recipe.\n2. **Bhunao**: Cooking onions until they're lightly browned and caramelized, which adds depth and sweetness to the dish.\n3. **Dum**: Cooking food in a sealed container with steam, often used for cooking basmati rice or making biryani.\n4. **Tadka**: Adding a small amount of oil or ghee to a pan and adding whole spices, which are then poured into the dish for added flavor.\n5. **Layering flavors**: Building flavors in a dish by adding spices, herbs, and other ingredients in layers, allowing each layer to cook before adding the next.\n\nSome general tips for Indian cooking:\n\n* Use high-quality spices and ingredients to ensure the best flavor.\n* Don't overcook the spices, as they can become bitter.\n* Acidity, such as from tomatoes or yogurt, helps to balance the richness of Indian dishes.\n* Experiment with different spice levels and flavor combinations to find your preferences.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and eating this Butter Chicken recipe!
