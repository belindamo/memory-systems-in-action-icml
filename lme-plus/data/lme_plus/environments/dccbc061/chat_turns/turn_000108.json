However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or the specific state park you're referring to. But I can provide you with some general tips and suggestions that might be helpful.\n\n1. **Check the park's website**: The state park's website should have a list of trails, their difficulties, lengths, and features. You can filter trails based on your preferences and interests.\n2. **Look for trail reviews and ratings**: Websites like AllTrails, Trailforks, or Hiking Project allow users to review and rate trails. You can get an idea of the trail's condition, scenery, and difficulty level from these reviews.\n3. **Consider the season**: Fall is a great time to hike, with comfortable temperatures and beautiful foliage. Look for trails with scenic overlooks, waterfalls, or areas with deciduous trees to take in the autumn colors.\n4. **Choose trails with varying difficulties**: If you're looking to challenge yourself, try a trail with some inclines or technical sections. If you prefer a more relaxed hike, opt for a gentle, well-maintained trail.\n5. **Check for any regulations or restrictions**: Some trails might be closed due to maintenance, wildlife habitat protection, or other reasons. Make sure to check the park's website or contact the park's administration before heading out.\n\nAs for your surfing lessons, that's awesome! It's great that you're trying something new and having fun. Who knows, you might discover a new passion!\n\nRemember to stay safe and prepared on your hikes, and enjoy the beautiful fall weather!",
