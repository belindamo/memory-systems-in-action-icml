  "content": "Tomatoes are one of the most popular garden fruits (yes, they're a fruit!), and they benefit from being paired with certain companion plants that can enhance their growth, flavor, and overall health. Here are some good companion plants for tomatoes:\n\n1. **Basil**: Planting basil near tomatoes is a classic combination. Basil repels pests that target tomatoes, such as whiteflies and aphids, and adds flavor to many tomato-based dishes.\n2. **Marigold**: These bright, cheerful flowers repel nematodes, which can harm tomatoes, and also attract beneficial insects that prey on tomato pests.\n3. **Borage**: Borage attracts beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, which help pollinate tomatoes. Its tall stems also provide shade and support for indeterminate tomato varieties.\n4. **Chives**: Chives are a natural repellent for aphids and other pests that target tomatoes. They also add a mild onion flavor to many dishes.\n5. **Oregano**: Oregano is a natural fungicide that can help prevent diseases like early blight and septoria leaf spot in tomatoes.\n6. **Parsley**: Parsley is another natural pest repellent that can help keep carrot flies and other pests away from tomatoes.\n7. **Carrots**: Planting carrots near tomatoes can help to break up compacted soil and improve its structure, which benefits tomato roots.\n8. **Radish**: Radish can help to repel cucumber beetles, which can spread bacterial wilt to tomatoes.\n9. **Dill**: Dill is a natural pest repellent that can help keep aphids, spider mites, and other pests away from tomatoes.\n10. **Comfrey**: Comfrey acts as a fertilizer plant, adding nutrients to the soil that benefit tomatoes. Its deep taproots also bring up nutrients from the subsoil.\n\nSome plants to avoid planting near tomatoes include:\n\n* **Fennel**: Fennel can inhibit tomato growth and flavor.\n* **Kohlrabi**: Kohlrabi can attract the same pests that target tomatoes.\n* **Potatoes**: Potatoes and tomatoes are both members of the nightshade family and can be susceptible to similar diseases.\n* **Rue**: Rue can be toxic to tomatoes and other plants.\n\nRemember to plant companion plants according to their growing requirements and space needs. Happy gardening!",
