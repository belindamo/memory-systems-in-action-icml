Although Baha'i faith does not have any formal rituals, there are some common practices that are followed by the followers of the faith. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Daily Prayer: Baha'is are encouraged to pray every day. They do not have any set prayers, but they are free to pray in their own words or to use prayers revealed by the Baha'i writings.\n\n2. Community Gatherings: Baha'is hold regular gatherings for prayer, worship, and consultation. These gatherings are open to all, and there is no clergy or formal hierarchy. The purpose is to foster unity and to work towards the betterment of society.\n\n3. Holy Days: Baha'is have 9 Holy Days in a year, which are celebrated by the community. These days commemorate events in the life of the prophets and the founders of the Faith. They are occasions for prayer, reflection, and community celebration.\n\n4. Nineteen Day Feast: Baha'is hold a 19-day feast every Baha'i month (which lasts 19 days). This gathering is a time for prayer, consultation, and socializing. It is held in local communities and is open to all.\n\n5. Fast: Baha'i followers fast for 19 days from sunrise to sunset during the month of Ala. It is a period of spiritual reflection and discipline.\n\nOverall, Baha'is emphasize simplicity and individual prayer and often hold gatherings to foster unity, consultation, and social progress.",
