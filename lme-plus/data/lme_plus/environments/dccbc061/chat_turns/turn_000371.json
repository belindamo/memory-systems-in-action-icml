I'm glad to hear you enjoyed Galactic Conquest!\n\nAs a prototype, it's likely that the game is still in development, but it's great that you got to provide feedback and help shape the game's direction. Did the designers or developers share any information about the game's release date or any notable features that will be included in the final version?\n\nAlso, what specifically did you enjoy about Galactic Conquest? Was it the gameplay mechanics, the theme, the components, or something else that caught your attention?\n\n(By the way, I'm curious - was the convention you attended a local event or a larger convention like Gen Con or Origins Game Fair?)",
