As for preventing blisters, I've got some tips to share:\n\n1. **Wear properly fitting shoes**: Make sure your shoes fit comfortably, with enough room in the toe box and a snug heel. Avoid shoes that are too tight or too loose.\n2. **Wear moisture-wicking socks**: Choose socks that wick away moisture to keep your feet dry and reduce friction.\n3. **Use blister prevention products**: Apply blister prevention products like blister shields, blister bands, or friction-reducing sprays to areas prone to blisters.\n4. **Wear socks with extra cushioning**: Socks with extra cushioning in high-friction areas can help reduce pressure and friction.\n5. **Gradually increase your mileage**: Avoid sudden changes in your running routine to give your feet time to adapt.\n6. **Run in well-ventilated shoes**: Shoes with good ventilation can help keep your feet cool and dry, reducing the risk of blisters.\n7. **Change your socks regularly**: If you're running long distances, change your socks halfway through to keep your feet dry and fresh.\n8. **Keep your feet clean and dry**: Wash your feet daily and dry them thoroughly, especially between the toes.\n9. **Use a lubricating balm**: Apply a lubricating balm like petroleum jelly or coconut oil to areas prone to blisters to reduce friction.\n10. **Strengthen your feet**: Strengthening your foot muscles through exercises like toe curls and heel raises can help reduce your risk of blisters.\n\nRemember, everyone's foot shape and running style are different, so it may take some trial and error to find the best blister prevention strategy for you.\n\nAs for buying the Brooks Ghost series, I'm sure you'll get around to it when the time is right!
