  "content": "A hybrid approach will give you the best of both worlds.\n\nRegarding your digital coupons, it's a good idea to store them separately from your physical coupons in your binder. Here's why:\n\n1. **Accessibility**: Digital coupons are often stored in your email inbox or on the retailer's app/website. You can access them from your phone or computer, making it convenient to use them on-the-go.\n2. **Organization**: Digital coupons can clutter your binder, and it might be challenging to keep them organized alongside your physical coupons.\n3. **Expiration tracking**: Digital coupons often have built-in expiration dates, and you'll receive reminders or notifications when they're about to expire.\n\nInstead, consider creating a digital folder or label in your email inbox or cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) specifically for your digital coupons. This way, you can easily find and access them when you need to.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n**Digital Coupon Organization**\n\n* Create a folder or label in your email inbox (e.g., \"Digital Coupons\") or cloud storage (e.g., \"Coupons & Discounts\").\n* Set up subfolders or labels for each store (e.g., \"H&M\", \"Target\", etc.) to organize your digital coupons by store.\n* Consider setting reminders or notifications for digital coupons that are about to expire.\n\nBy keeping your digital coupons separate from your physical coupons, you'll be able to easily access and manage both types of coupons.\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any other questions about organizing your digital coupons?",
