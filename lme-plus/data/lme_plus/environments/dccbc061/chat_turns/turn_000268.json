Salary information can vary based on factors such as industry, specific role, years of experience, and education levels. Additionally, salary ranges may be impacted by other factors, such as location and the overall job market. I suggest reviewing job postings on career websites such as Glassdoor, Indeed, or LinkedIn to get a sense of salary ranges for specific roles in the San Francisco area. It may also be useful to consult with a career counselor or headhunter who has access to current salary data for marketing professionals in the San Francisco area.",
