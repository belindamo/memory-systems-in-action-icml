  "content": "That's frustrating!\n\nLet's troubleshoot this step by step. Since you've already tried unplugging and replugging the headset, here are a few more things to check:\n\n1. **Check your audio settings**: Ensure that your headset is selected as the default device for both input (microphone) and output (headphones) in your operating system's audio settings. You can do this by going to your system settings, then audio or sound, and looking for the \"Input\" or \"Microphone\" and \"Output\" or \"Speakers\" sections.\n2. **Check your game settings**: Make sure that your game is set to use the correct audio device. In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, you can do this by going to Options > Audio > Voice Chat Device and selecting your headset.\n3. **Check for loose connections**: Verify that all cables are securely connected to both the headset and your computer or gaming console.\n4. **Check for dust or debris**: Inspect the microphone port on your headset and the connector on the cable for any dust, dirt, or debris. Clean it gently with a soft brush or cloth if you find any obstructions.\n5. **Try a different USB port**: If you're using a USB-connected headset, try plugging it into a different USB port on your computer or console.\n6. **Disable and re-enable the microphone**: In your operating system's audio settings, try disabling the microphone and then re-enabling it. This can sometimes resolve issues with microphone detection.\n7. **Check for software updates**: Ensure that your headset's drivers and firmware are up-to-date. You can usually find these updates on the manufacturer's website.\n8. **Try a different microphone**: If you have access to another microphone, try swapping it with the one on your headset to rule out any issues with the microphone itself.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there's a problem with the headset itself. You may want to contact the manufacturer's support or consider visiting a repair center.\n\nLet me know if any of these steps help, or if you need further assistance!",
