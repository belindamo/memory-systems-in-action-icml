  "content": "If the `useEffect()` function is not being called, it's possible that there is an issue with the dependencies array. Here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Check that the dependencies array is correct. In the current implementation, the `useEffect()` hook has an empty dependencies array, which means that it will only run once when the component first mounts. To make sure that it re-runs when the component updates, you should add `template` to the dependencies array, like this:\n```scss\nuseEffect(() => {\n  axios.get('http://localhost:8080/template')\n    .then(response => {\n      setTemplate(response.data);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.log(error);\n    });\n}, [template]);\n```\nThis will cause the `useEffect()` function to run every time the `template` state variable changes.\n\n1. Another issue might be related to CORS. If the server is running on a different domain or port than the React application, you might need to enable CORS in your server code to allow the browser to make requests to it. You can check the browser console for any CORS-related errors.\n2. If none of the above works, you can try adding some console.log statements to the `useEffect()` function to debug the issue. For example, you can add a console.log statement before and after the `axios.get()` call to make sure that the function is being called at all, and to check for any errors in the response:\n```scss\nuseEffect(() => {\n  console.log('useEffect called');\n  axios.get('http://localhost:8080/template')\n    .then(response => {\n      console.log(response.data);\n      setTemplate(response.data);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.log(error);\n    });\n}, []);\n```\nThis will help you identify where the issue might be.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.",
