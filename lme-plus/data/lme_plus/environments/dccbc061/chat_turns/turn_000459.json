  "content": "The locals of Sevilla prepare for the festivals of Semana Santa and Feria de Abril in different ways.\n\nDuring Semana Santa, the locals usually dress up in traditional clothing, with women wearing mantillas and lace shawls over their heads, and men wearing suits and hats. They participate in rituals such as carrying the floats and accompanying them as they move through the streets. The religious brotherhoods prepare for weeks in advance, cleaning and decorating their floats and rehearsing the procession routes.\n\nFor Feria de Abril, the locals also dress up in traditional clothing. Women wear flamenco dresses, which are colorful and flowing gowns with ruffles and polka dots, often paired with a shawl, a flower in their hair, and high heels. Men wear suits or traditional Andalusian outfits, such as the traje corto, which consists of short pants, a jacket, and a flat-brimmed hat. The locals prepare for the festival by decorating their casetas and inviting friends and family to join them. They dance and sing Sevillanas, a local style of flamenco, and enjoy the food and drink provided by the casetas.\n\nIn both festivals, the locals take great pride in their cultural traditions and are happy to share them with visitors.",
