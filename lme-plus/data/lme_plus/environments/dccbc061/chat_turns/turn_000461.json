  "content": "Absolutely, non-locals are more than welcome to participate in the festivals of Semana Santa and Feria de Abril in Sevilla. The locals are very proud of their culture and traditions, and they love to share them with visitors from around the world. In fact, these festivals attract a large number of tourists every year, and many hotels and restaurants offer special packages and menus during the festivities.\n\nDuring Semana Santa, visitors can watch the processions and admire the beautiful floats and religious statues. They can also visit the many churches and cathedrals in Sevilla, which are often elaborately decorated for the occasion. Some tourists even choose to participate in the processions themselves, accompanying the floats as they make their way through the city.\n\nFor Feria de Abril, visitors can enjoy the music, dancing, and food in the casetas set up throughout the fairground. They can even rent a caseta for themselves and their friends or family, immersing themselves in the festival atmosphere. Tourists can also take part in the Sevillanas dances, often with the help of locals who are happy to teach them the steps.\n\nIn short, both Semana Santa and Feria de Abril are very inclusive festivals that welcome visitors from all over the world to experience the rich culture and traditions of Sevilla.",
