This blend is perfect for those who want a more subtle citrus flavor.\n4. **Meyer Lemon Green Tea**: Meyer lemons are a cross between a lemon and an orange, giving this tea a sweet and tangy flavor profile that complements the green tea beautifully.\n5. **Green Tea with Bergamot**: Bergamot is a citrus fruit that adds a distinctive, citrusy flavor with hints of sweetness and a slightly bitter finish.\n\nAs for making your own coffee at home, that's great!
