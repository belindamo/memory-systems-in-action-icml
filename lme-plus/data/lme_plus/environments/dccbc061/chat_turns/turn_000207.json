This approach is known as biological control or integrated pest management (IPM), and it's a natural, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly way to manage pests.\n\n**Ladybugs**\n\nLadybugs, also known as lady beetles or ladybird beetles, are natural predators of aphids. They're especially effective against aphid colonies, and they can consume large quantities of aphids in a short amount of time.
