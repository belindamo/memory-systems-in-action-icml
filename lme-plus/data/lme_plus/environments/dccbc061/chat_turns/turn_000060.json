This means outlining what is expected of employees, how their work is evaluated, and the criteria for success.\n\n2. Provide regular feedback: Regular feedback is essential for employee growth and development. Feedback must be delivered regularly throughout the year, instead of just at the end of the performance review cycle.\n\n3.
