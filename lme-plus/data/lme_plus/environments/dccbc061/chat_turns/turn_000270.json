  "content": "Basil is a wonderful addition to any salad!\n\nHarvesting basil without damaging the plant is crucial to encourage bushy growth and prevent the plant from flowering. Here are some tips to help you harvest basil like a pro:\n\n1. **Pinch or cut, don't pull**: Instead of pulling the leaves off the stem, pinch or cut them off with scissors or pinchers. This will help prevent damaging the stem and promote new growth.\n2. **Harvest in the morning**: Basil is typically at its most flavorful and aromatic in the morning, after the dew has dried but before the heat of the day.\n3. **Take the top sets of leaves**: Remove the top sets of leaves, just above a node (where a leaf meets the stem). This will encourage the plant to branch out and produce more leaves.\n4. **Leave at least two sets of leaves**: Make sure to leave at least two sets of leaves on each stem to allow the plant to continue growing and producing new leaves.\n5. **Harvest regularly**: Regular harvesting will encourage the plant to produce more leaves and prevent it from flowering. Try to harvest your basil every 7-10 days.\n6. **Don't harvest too much**: Only take what you need, as over-harvesting can stress the plant and reduce its productivity.\n7. **Use clean scissors or pinchers**: Clean your scissors or pinchers before harvesting to prevent spreading diseases from one plant to another.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy a bountiful harvest of delicious, fragrant basil all season long!\n\nAnd, by the way, it sounds like you put in some great prep work in early April getting your garden ready. All that effort will surely pay off as your plants grow and thrive!",
