Respect is a two-way street, and it's essential to provide it to receive it. \n\nBeing the event planner does not give you full authority over the vendors or clients. It's crucial to discuss expectations and come to an agreement where both parties feel valued and heard. Collaboration and communication are key, and it's crucial to build a relationship based on mutual respect and trust to achieve the desired results. \n\nUltimately, the success of the event is dependent on everyone involved, and it's important to establish a positive working relationship to ensure that the event runs smoothly.",
