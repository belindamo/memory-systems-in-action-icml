February 10-11\n3. February 17-18\n4. February 24-25\n\nCan you think of any other details that might help you remember which weekend it was? For example:\n\n* Was it a Valentine's Day weekend (February 10-11)?\n* Was it a Presidents' Day weekend (February 17-18)?\n* Was it a particularly cold or snowy weekend?\n* Did you attend a specific event or festival in Chicago during that weekend?\n* Did you take a photo or post on social media during the trip that might give us a clue about the dates?\n\nAny information you can provide will help us narrow down the possibilities and figure out the exact dates of your Chicago trip!",
