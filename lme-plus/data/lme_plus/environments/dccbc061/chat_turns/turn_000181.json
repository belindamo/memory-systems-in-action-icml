His photographs were notable for their sensitivity and respect for his subjects, and for their technical excellence and artistic innovation.\n\nDavis's portraits of Pacific Islanders captured the beauty and complexity of their cultures, and they helped to introduce the world to these people and their traditions. His photographs were widely exhibited in Europe and America, and they had a profound impact on the way that people in the West viewed the Pacific Islands and their inhabitants.\n\nToday, Davis's photographs are recognized as important historical documents, and they continue to inspire and influence photographers and scholars around the world.
