      "content": "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a political and military alliance of 30 North American and European countries. NATO was established on April 4, 1949, in the aftermath of World War II, with the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, D.C. Its primary purpose is to provide collective defense against potential security threats from outside the alliance, while also promoting democratic values, stability, and cooperation among its member states.\n\nNATO's key principles include collective defense, where an attack on one member state is considered an attack on all, and consultation and cooperation on defense and security issues among member states. NATO's military capabilities include land, air, and sea forces, as well as nuclear deterrence, and the alliance also engages in partnerships with other countries and organizations around the world to promote peace and security."
