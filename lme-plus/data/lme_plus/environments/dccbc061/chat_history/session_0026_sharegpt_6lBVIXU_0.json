Can you improve my current text?\n\n\"Hi Khalid,\n\nIt looks like I will have to push the start date back by one month...\nI'm still in the process of getting the necessary documents that should allow me to leave Ukraine for extended periods of time. I thought I already had all of them, but on Feb 23 I was not allowed to leave Ukraine by the Ukrainian border control, and now I have applied for additional documents. It may take a month to get them according to the officials. \nI should be able to leave Ukraine once the new documents are ready. But it is not 100% guaranteed given the current situation, as the regulations on this topic change very often (16 times since the war started).\nThus I will be able to notify my current employer of my leave only once I've left Ukraine. Given the 1-month notice period, it brings my start date around May 2.\""

      "content": "Dear Khalid,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to inform you that I will need to push my start date back by one month. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and I appreciate your understanding in this matter.\n\nI'm still in the process of obtaining the necessary documents to leave Ukraine for extended periods of time. While I thought I had everything I needed, I encountered an issue with Ukrainian border control on Feb 23 and have since applied for additional documents. Unfortunately, the officials have informed me that it may take up to a month to obtain these documents due to the current situation, as regulations on this topic are subject to frequent change.\n\nI want to assure you that I am working diligently to obtain the necessary documentation as soon as possible. However, it's not 100% guaranteed that I will be able to leave Ukraine even once the new documents are ready. I will notify my current employer of my leave only once I have safely left the country. As a result, my start date will likely be around May 2, taking into account the one-month notice period.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding in this matter. Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me during this time. I'm looking forward to joining the team at our new company soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"
