Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and reporting on the dark underbelly of the internet.\nSee More \u2192\nThe RESTRICT Act, a proposed piece of legislation which provides one way the government might ban TikTok, contains \u201cinsanely broad\u201d language and could lead to other apps or communications services with connections to foreign countries being banned in the U.S., multiple digital rights experts told Motherboard.\n\nThe bill could have implications not just for social networks, but potentially security tools such as virtual private networks (VPNs) that consumers use to encrypt and route their traffic, one said. Although the intention of the bill is to target apps or services that pose a threat to national security, these critics worry it may have much wider implications for the First Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe RESTRICT Act is a concerning distraction with insanely broad language that raises serious human and civil rights concerns,\" Willmary Escoto, U.S. policy analyst for digital rights organization Access Now told Motherboard in an emailed statement.\n\nDo you know anything else about the RESTRICT Act? We'd love to hear from you.

The pair introduced the bill earlier this month, which is deliberately not limited to just TikTok.\n\nUnder the RESTRICT Act, the Department of Commerce would identify information and communications technology products that a foreign adversary has any interest in, or poses an unacceptable risk to national security, the announcement reads. The bill only applies to technology linked to a \u201cforeign adversary.\u201d Those countries include China (as well as Hong Kong); Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Russia, and Venezuela.\n\nThe bill\u2019s language includes vague terms such as \u201cdesktop applications,\u201d \u201cmobile applications,\u201d \u201cgaming applications,\u201d \u201cpayment applications,\u201d and \u201cweb-based applications.\u201d It also targets applicable software that has more than 1 million users in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe RESTRICT Act could lead to apps and other ICT services with connections to certain foreign countries being banned in the United States. Any bill that would allow the US government to ban an online service that facilitates Americans' speech raises serious First Amendment concerns,\u201d Caitlin Vogus, deputy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology\u2019s Free Expression Project, told Motherboard in an emailed statement. \u201cIn addition, while bills like the RESTRICT Act may be motivated by legitimate privacy concerns, banning ICT services with connections to foreign countries would not necessarily help protect Americans' privacy. Those countries may still obtain data through other means, like by purchasing it from private data brokers.\u201d\n\nEscoto from Access Now added, \u201cAs written, the broad language in the RESTRICT Act could criminalize the use of a VPN, significantly impacting access to security tools and other applications that vulnerable people rely on for privacy and security.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany individuals and organizations, including journalists, activists, and human rights defenders, use VPNs to protect their online activity from surveillance and censorship. The RESTRICT Act would expose these groups to monitoring and repression, which could have a chilling effect on free speech and expression,\u201d Escoto wrote.\n\n(Many VPN companies engage in misleading marketing practices which exaggerate their importance and alleged security benefits. Used correctly, and with a provider that does not introduce its own issues such as logging users\u2019 traffic, VPNs can be a useful tool for digital security).\n\nAdvertisement\nRachel Cohen, communications director for Senator Warner, responded by telling Motherboard in an email \u201cThis legislation is aimed squarely at companies like Kaspersky, Huawei and TikTok that create systemic risks to the United States\u2019 national security\u2014not at individual users.\u201d She added \u201cThe threshold for criminal penalty in this bill is incredibly high\u2014too high to ever be concerned with the actions of someone an individual user of TikTok or a VPN.\u201d\n\nWith the bill\u2019s introduction, Warner and Thune instead pointed to other foreign-linked companies that may pose their own security and privacy issues.\n\n\u201cBefore TikTok, however, it was Huawei and ZTE, which threatened our nation\u2019s telecommunications networks. And before that, it was Russia\u2019s Kaspersky Lab, which threatened the security of government and corporate devices,\u201d Warner said in a statement at the time. \u201cWe need a comprehensive, risk-based approach that proactively tackles sources of potentially dangerous technology before they gain a foothold in America, so we aren\u2019t playing Whac-A-Mole and scrambling to catch up once they\u2019re already ubiquitous.\u201d\n\nSens. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Susan Collins (R-ME), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), and Mitt Romney (R-UT) are co-sponsors of the proposed legislation\n\nBoth Vogus and Escoto pointed to another potential solution: the U.S. passing a more fundamental privacy law.\n\n\u201cIf Congress is serious about addressing risks to Americans\u2019 privacy, it could accomplish far more by focusing its efforts on passing comprehensive privacy legislation like the American Data Privacy and Protection Act,\u201d Vogus said.\n\nUpdate: This piece has been updated to include comment from Senator Warner\u2019s office.\n\nSubscribe to our cybersecurity podcast, CYBER.

      "content": "The critics cited in the article have raised valid concerns about the broad language of the RESTRICT Act and its potential implications for free speech and privacy. The language of the bill does not appear to be limited to just TikTok and could potentially ban other apps and services with connections to foreign countries. The bill's use of vague terms could also lead to confusion about what exactly is covered by the legislation. Additionally, the bill's criminal penalties are high and could be interpreted in a way that criminalizes individual users. However, supporters of the bill argue that it is necessary to address national security threats posed by certain foreign-owned tech companies."
