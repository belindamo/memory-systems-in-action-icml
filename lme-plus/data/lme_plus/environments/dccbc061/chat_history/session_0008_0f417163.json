Here are some tips to help you keep your goggles fog-free:\n\n1. **Anti-fog coating**: Make sure your goggles have an anti-fog coating. Most modern swim goggles come with this feature. If your goggles don't have it, consider getting a new pair with this feature.\n2. **Spit and rub**: Yes, you read that right! Spit on the lenses and rub them gently with your fingers. Saliva contains enzymes that help break down the fog. This method is especially effective for short-term fog prevention.\n3. **Shaving cream**: Apply a small amount of shaving cream to the lenses and rub it in. The soap helps to reduce fogging. Just be sure to rinse your goggles thoroughly after your swim.\n4. **Anti-fog sprays or wipes**: There are specialized products designed to prevent fogging. You can find anti-fog sprays or wipes at most swim shops or online. Follow the product instructions for best results.\n5. **Rinse with cold water**: Before putting on your goggles, rinse them with cold water. This helps to reduce fogging by reducing the temperature difference between the lenses and the air.\n6. **Avoid touching the lenses**: Oils from your skin can contribute to fogging. Try to handle your goggles by the frames instead of the lenses.\n7. **Clean your goggles regularly**: Regular cleaning can help prevent fogging. Use a soft cloth and mild soap to clean your goggles.\n8. **Use a goggle cleaner**: There are specialized goggle cleaners that can help prevent fogging. Look for products containing ingredients like silicone or hydrophobic materials.\n9. **Try a different type of goggle**: If you're still experiencing fogging issues, you might consider trying a different type of goggle. Some goggles are designed to be more fog-resistant than others.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to reduce fogging and enjoy a clearer swim session!\n\nDo you have any other questions about swimming or goggles?"

However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal information or memories, so I couldn't possibly know about your visit to the Wilson store or any specific details about your tennis racket.\n\nBut, I'd be delighted to provide you with some general tips on improving your serve in tennis! Here are a few:\n\n1. **Grip it right**: Make sure you're holding your racket with a continental grip, which is the most common grip for serving. Experiment with different grip pressures to find what works best for you.\n2. **Stance and footwork**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with your body facing the net. Take a small step forward with your non-dominant foot as you toss the ball, and transfer your weight onto your back foot as you make contact.\n3. **Toss consistency**: Focus on tossing the ball at the same spot every time, about 6-8 feet in the air and slightly in front of your body. Practice your toss to develop muscle memory.\n4. **Racquet head speed**: Generate power by using your legs, hips, and core to generate racquet head speed. Aim to make contact with the ball at the top of your swing.\n5. **Follow-through**: Complete your serve with a strong follow-through, keeping your arm extended and your racquet facing downwards. This helps maintain control and generates more power.\n6. **Variety is key**: Mix up your serves to keep your opponent guessing. Try different types of serves, such as flat, topspin, or slice serves, to keep them off balance.\n7. **Practice, practice, practice**: Serving is a skill that requires repetition to develop. Set aside time to practice your serve regularly, focusing on technique and consistency.\n\nRemember, improving your serve takes time and practice. Be patient, stay consistent, and you'll see improvement over time!\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these tips or any other aspects of tennis?"

However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or preferences, nor do I have access to your personal information or running habits.\n\nBut, I can provide you with some general tips and factors to consider when choosing a new pair of running shoes:\n\n1. **Determine your foot type**: If you have flat feet, high arches, or other foot issues, you may need shoes with specific features to support your foot type.\n2. **Consider your running style**: If you're a heavy heel striker, you may need shoes with more cushioning in the heel. If you're a midfoot or forefoot striker, you may prefer shoes with a more responsive toe-off.\n3. **Think about your running terrain**: If you run on trails, you'll need shoes with more aggressive tread and better traction. If you run on roads or tracks, you may prefer shoes with a more responsive and cushioned ride.\n4. **Look for a comfortable fit**: Make sure the shoes fit comfortably, with enough room in the toe box and a snug heel.\n5. **Read reviews and try them on**: Research different models and read reviews from other runners to get a sense of how they perform. Try on several options to find the one that feels best for you.\n\nSome popular running shoe brands include:\n\n* Nike\n* ASICS\n* Brooks\n* Saucony\n* New Balance\n* Hoka One One\n\nSome popular models include:\n\n* Nike Air Zoom Pegasus\n* ASICS Gel-Kayano\n* Brooks Ghost\n* Saucony Freedom ISO\n* New Balance Fresh Foam\n\nUltimately, the best shoe for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. I recommend visiting a specialty running store, where knowledgeable staff can help you find the perfect shoe based on your running style, foot type, and personal preferences.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about running shoes or running in general?"
