      "content": "This is an exercise routine that teaches how to do the Bridge exercise. The Bridge exercise helps wake up the gluteal muscles, reinforces spinal stabilization, builds endurance and strength in the muscles on the front and back of the core, and is a precursor to doing a proper squat. To perform the Bridge exercise, one should lie on their back with their arms at their side, legs hip-width apart, and feet in a flexed position."

      "content": "Step 3: Put your top foot in front of your bottom foot.\nStep 4: Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in place. \nStep 5: Slowly lift your hips off the ground as you bring them forward to form a straight line from foot to shoulders, like a plank. You do this to avoid side bending in the spine. This motion is the same as for the bridge except it is done on your side; in other words, you are are bringing your pelvis forward as you come up, going from bent hips to straightened hips so that you don\u2019t bend your spine sideways. \n\nStep 6: If you can, raise your upper arm up toward the ceiling with the palm facing forward, and pull that shoulder blade back toward the spine and buttocks as well.\nStep 7: Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten seconds being the goal.\nStep 8: Slowly \u201csit back,\u201d pushing your hips back behind your feet and shoulders as you return to the floor in the starting position. Again, think about the movement of the bridge exercise, only done on your side.\nStep 9: Do two to five reps on each side, with five being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\n\u2022 Shoulder pain. If your shoulder hurts, make sure you pay attention to Step 1. Is your elbow directly under your shoulder? Did you pull your shoulder blade in toward the spine and down toward your back pocket before lifting up? If you feel you did these motions correctly and your shoulder still hurts, try bracing your shoulder with your upper hand as in the following picture.\nIf it still hurts, move on to one of the following regressions on the next page, and perform these until you build strength in the shoulder. Then try again in a few weeks.\n\u2022 Back Pain. If your lower back hurts with this exercise, try finding your neutral spine again. Try performing the exercise with a slightly more flat or rounded back and see if the pain resolves. If it does, that is your neutral spine. If the lower back pain doesn\u2019t resolve, move on to one of the following regressions, and try again after a few weeks.\n\u2022 Pain on the downward side in the abdomen. This is likely muscular pain because these are the muscles you are working. Remember, if it resolves quickly once you stop the exercise, you are very likely okay doing this exercise.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 Starting in a \u201cstraight line\u201d from shoulder to foot and lifting straight up from that position. This position puts potentially dangerous pressures through the spine. Instead, start with the hips back and bring them forward as you rise.\n\u2022 Rolling the top shoulder forward. Throughout this exercise, make sure that your body is perpendicular to the floor and ceiling.\nREGRESSIONS\nSide Plank on Your Knees\nIf you are unable to perform side plank, try this one.\n\n1. Lie on your side with your legs stacked neatly on top of each other.\n2. Bend your knees at a 45-degree angle, and drop your hips back so they are behind your feet and shoulders when viewed from above.\n3. Find your neutral spine and brace your core.\n4. Place your elbow under your shoulder with your forearm on the floor. Your other arm can stay relaxed in whatever position feels comfortable for now.\n5. Pull your lower shoulder blade back toward your spine and down toward your back pocket and lock it in place.\n6. Slowly lift your hips off the floor as you bring them forward, forming a straight line from kneecaps to shoulders, like a plank. Think of the bridge exercise, only done on your side. This is a hip movement done to avoid side-bending of the spine.\n\n7. If you can, lift your upper arm up toward the ceiling with the palm facing forward, and pull the upper shoulder blade back and down toward the spine and buttocks as well.\n8. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n9. Carefully return to the starting position by dropping your hip back while maintaining your core brace.\n10. Repeat two to five times, with five being the goal.\nModified Side Plank\nIf you are unable to do the side plank on your knees, try this version, with your hip on the floor. Almost everyone should be able to do this version. Do it for a few weeks, and then go back to trying the side plank on your knees.\n1. Lie on your side, supporting your head with the hand of your bottom arm (you can also use a pillow).\n2. Use the hand of your top arm to brace yourself by putting it flat on the floor in front of your stomach.\n3. Find your neutral spine and brace your core.\n\n4. Slowly and carefully lift both of your thighs and legs off the floor toward the ceiling at the hip joints.\n5. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n6. Carefully return your legs to the starting position while maintaining core brace.\n7. Repeat two to five times each side, with five being the goal.\nPROGRESSION\nSide Plank with Pull\nFor those of you who progress to doing the side plank with relative ease and want to pursue increased fitness and spinal stability, and are willing to accept a slight increase in risk in that pursuit, try this progression.\n1. You will need a band, tubing, dumbbell, or a cable machine to perform this exercise.\n2. Set the resistance to light or the weight to low to start.\n3. Go into a side plank. Hold the handle of the band.\n\n4. Without twisting the torso or moving the hips, and with your top arm straight at the elbow, pull the shoulder blade back toward your spine and down toward your buttocks. The movement occurs in the shoulder joint and between the shoulder blade and the spine. Your arm should stay straight from the shoulder down to the hand.\n5. Do ten to fifteen reps on that side, then repeat on the other side.\nEXERCISE 6\nCat/Camel Mobilization\nOkay, this is the only time in the book I am going to ask you to forget about neutral spine and spinal stability. This exercise is meant to build a bit of mobility in the lumbar spine and thoracic spine without loading them during the process. This is also a good way to find your neutral spine when on your hands and knees, for Exercise 7. This one is easy.\nGet on your hands and knees, with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips. Pull both shoulder blades in toward the spine and back toward the back pockets in a \u201cclockwise corkscrew\u201d fashion. To get a sense of this movement, think of looking at someone\u2019s back. You would see their right shoulder blade turning in a slightly clockwise motion (left shoulder blade in counterclockwise motion) while also coming down at the same time, allowing the person\u2019s chest to stick out.\n\nStep 1: Keep your neck in neutral with the rest of your spine. You should be looking down at the floor, not out in front of you.\n\nStep 2: Slowly and carefully, let your stomach sink to the floor below you, creating an arch in your lower back. Go only as far as feels good.\n\nStep 3: Then, slowly and carefully, push your mid/lower back up to the ceiling but only as far as feels good.\nStep 4: Do not think of this as a stretch. Keep moving back and forth between those two positions, very slowly, getting mobility in the spine. Don\u2019t force it: This should feel good, not hurt.\nStep 5: Notice the position that feels the best between down and up. This will be your neutral spine for the next exercise.\nStep 6: Do ten reps. Make sure to breathe.\nEXERCISE 7\n\u201cBird Dog,\u201d or Opposite Arm/Leg Extension \nThe opposite arm/leg extension exercise, otherwise known as the \u201cbird dog,\u201d is one of the most commonly prescribed exercises for back pain. Unfortunately, it is also the one most commonly done improperly.\nThis exercise seeks to accomplish several things: (a) increased spinal stability when the spine is challenged from different directions with varying loads; (b) increased engagement, endurance, and strength of the back extensors including the lats; and (c) increased gluteal engagement, endurance, and strength. Done right, this exercise is a beauty.\nStep 1: Get on your hands and knees, with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Pull both shoulder blades in toward the spine and back toward the back pockets in a \u201cclockwise corkscrew\u201d fashion.\nStep 2: Keep your neck in neutral with the rest of your spine. You should be looking down at the floor, not out in front of you.\nStep 3: Go through the \u201ccat\u201d and \u201ccamel\u201d positions to find your neutral spine."
