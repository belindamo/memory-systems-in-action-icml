      "content": "That makes sense! I think I'm drawn to the Nataraja form of Shiva because I'm really into dancing."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The Nataraja form of Shiva is very popular as it symbolizes the rhythm and harmony of the universe through dance. Shiva is believed to have performed the cosmic dance of creation, preservation, and destruction, and the Nataraja form captures the essence of this dance. It is natural that you feel drawn to this form of Shiva as you have an affinity towards dancing. Many people connect with Shiva in this form through dance and music and find it helpful in their spiritual practice."
