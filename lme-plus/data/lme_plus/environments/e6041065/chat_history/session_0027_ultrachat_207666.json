      "content": "I'm sorry, as an AI language model I don't have up to date information on what steps the Prime Minister has taken. However, here are some general things that governments around the world do to educate the public on reducing carbon footprints and environmental responsibility:\n\n1. Launching public awareness campaigns: The government can use mass media to create awareness on environmental issues and provide guidelines on sustainable living. They can run campaigns on TV, radio, and social media, emphasizing the significance of eco-friendly lifestyle.\n\n2. Implementing eco-friendly policies: The government can adopt eco-friendly policies to encourage businesses to reduce their carbon emissions. These actions can include providing incentives for the production and use of low-emission products, charging higher taxes for high-emission products, and providing subsidies for green technologies.\n\n3. Educating school children and youth: Educating the next generation is crucial in environmental conservation. The government can develop programs for children to learn about climate change and sustainability in school, make it a part of the curriculum, and encourage extra-curricular activities that promote eco-friendliness.\n\n4. Providing grants for clean technologies: The government can provide grants, subsidies, and financial incentives to build clean energy infrastructure, research innovative, green technologies, and support renewable energy projects.\n\n5. Encouraging public participation: Advocating for public participation in eco-friendly initiatives, encouraging people to participate in environmental conservation programs such as recycling drives, tree planting initiatives, and workshops, etc. \n\nThese are some of the steps the government can implement to educate the public on reducing carbon footprints and environmental responsibility."

      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the latest updates on the government's policies related to carbon emissions. However, I can provide you with some examples of the policies that some governments have implemented to reduce carbon emissions. \n\n1. Carbon pricing: Some governments have implemented carbon pricing policies to incentivize businesses to reduce their carbon emissions. This policy works by putting a monetary price on each ton of carbon emitted, thereby making businesses accountable for their carbon emissions, and encouraging them to invest in more sustainable practices.\n\n2. Renewable energy targets: Governments can set targets for the production and use of renewable energy. This encouragement can help shift the energy production of countries away from non-renewable resources such as oil, coal or gas towards cleaner and greener methods.\n\n3. Fuel efficiency standards: Governments can implement fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, building equipment, and appliances, aimed at reducing carbon emissions caused by burning fossil fuels.\n\n4. Sustainable Agriculture: Governments can encourage sustainable agriculture practices, which conserve soil and water resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve soil health.\n\nOverall, governments around the world can implement various policies and programs aiming to reduce carbon emissions and environmental pollution. These programs would help in the transition to sustainable development and the preservation of the environment for future generations."
