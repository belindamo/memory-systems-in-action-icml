These are all within the 'Getting the Culture right' module and the method of delivery for all of these is 'Consult'.\n\nPlease can you complete the same exercise you have just done around reworking the overview and defining the activity and outcomes? \n\nOnce done, please could you add to the bottom of the table you have just made?\n\nHere are the extra objectives and overviews:\n\\*Create a complete Communication Plan on this strategy \n\nBefore you begin marketing your vacancies to recruiting people with convictions, it is important that it does not come as a surprise to your stakeholders. \n\n \n\nBuilding a culture of acceptance will come with involving stakeholders in Catch22\u2019s journey as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nThis is includes internal approval from the board, colleagues and hiring managers as well as external approval from clients, commissioners and other beneficiaries. \n\n \n\nBringing together a communication strategy on who needs to be informed and how this can be done effectively is going to be critical to ensure future colleagues with convictions are welcomed into the organisation by all stakeholders. \n\n\\*Appoint an Ex-offender Inclusion Champion \n\nWho will ensure the fire for the cause keeps lit? \n\n \n\nAs colleagues and priorities change throughout the organisation it is important to have someone as the voice of people with convictions to ensure this socially excluded group constantly remains represented. \n\n \n\nThe Ex-offender Inclusion Champion role could be incorporated into existing EDI roles. \n\n \n\nThe role could be as broad and as wide as needed. The EIC could become a single point of contact for all colleagues (conviction or not) to ask questions about the strategy / let their needs be known \u2013 equally they may simply be responsible for ensuring the voices of people with convictions are represented at EDI meetings. This will depend on the wider strategy of the organisation and the resource available. \n\n\\*Create a bank of case studies of existing colleagues with convictions \n\nReal case studies stop us thinking about the ex-offender in the orange jump suit with their hands on the prison bars. \n\n \n\nAsking colleagues to come forward can be daunting, sensitive and may even come with some GDPR compliance challenges \u2013 once you\u2019ve published a story of a colleague, even with consent, that bell cannot be un-rung. \n\n \n\nThere is also the nature of the colleagues offence or circumstances surrounding the offence that may need managing to ensure the case study is not a risk to the organisation or the colleague. \n\n \n\nHowever, if done right, the case study will be one of the best ways inspire and change colleague perceptions across the organisation. \n\n\\*Launch an annual colleague ex-offender perception survey \n\nWhere are we now and how does this improve over time? \n\n \n\nWe\u2019ve all heard the saying \u2018culture eats strategy for breakfast\u2019. An anonymous survey across the organisation will show you where there are gaps in either training or consultation of your internal stakeholders when it comes to welcoming and supporting people with convictions."
