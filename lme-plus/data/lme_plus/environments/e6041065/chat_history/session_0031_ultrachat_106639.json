      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide an answer based on industry trends and analysis. \n\nWith the rise of digital music platforms, independent artists have more ways to promote and distribute their music than ever before. As a result, some artists choose to forgo signing with a record label and instead use digital distribution services like DistroKid, Tunecore, or CD Baby to distribute their music to major streaming platforms.\n\nHowever, there are still advantages to signing with a record label, especially for artists who are interested in expanding their reach beyond just digital distribution. For example, record labels can provide marketing and promotional support that can help an artist gain broader exposure, as well as connections to industry professionals that can lead to new opportunities. Additionally, some record labels can offer a more structured approach to an artist's career development, providing guidance in areas such as branding, image creation, and touring logistics. Ultimately, whether or not to sign with a record label depends on the goals and needs of the individual artist."
