      "content": "Alioto's and The Crab Shack are both excellent choices for fresh seafood, and you can't go wrong with Dungeness crab.\n\nFor a scenic walk or hike in the Fisherman's Wharf area, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Pier to Pier Walk**: Start at Pier 39 and walk north along the waterfront to Pier 45, then continue to Pier 47, and finally end at Pier 49. This walk offers stunning views of the Bay Bridge, Alcatraz, and the San Francisco Bay. You'll also pass by the Sea Lions at Pier 39 and get a glimpse of the fishing boats docked at the piers.\n2. **The Waterfront Promenade**: This picturesque walkway runs along the eastern edge of Fisherman's Wharf, offering beautiful views of the Bay Bridge, Treasure Island, and the San Francisco Bay.

You can also combine them to create a longer, more scenic hike.\n\nIf you're looking for a more challenging hike, consider the **Hyde Street Pier to the WPA Murals**: This 2.5-mile hike takes you from Hyde Street Pier to the WPA Murals, a historic mural project from the 1930s. The hike offers stunning views of the Bay and the city, but be prepared for some steep inclines and stairs.\n\nWhich of these walks or hikes appeals to you?"
