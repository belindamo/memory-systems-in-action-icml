  "content": "Rousseau's Social Contract is the idea that as members of a society, we enter into an agreement with each other and the government. In this agreement, we promise to follow the \"general will\" of the society as expressed by the laws made by the government. In return, we receive the liberty to live our lives as we choose, as long as we do not break these laws. This idea emphasizes the role of the government to ensure the well-being of all citizens, and the individual's responsibility to support and abide by the laws for the benefit of the community as a whole.",
