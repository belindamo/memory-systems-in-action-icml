Save energy: This can be done by turning off appliances and lights when not in use, installing energy-efficient LED bulbs, using natural light when possible or adjusting your thermostat settings to reduce the use of heating/cooling.\n\n4. Use public transport, bike or walk: Consider using public transport, or carpooling to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Where possible, walk, or cycle to nearby destinations.\n\n5. Buy local and seasonal produce: Choosing to buy produce that has been grown or made locally, can reduce the carbon footprint resulting from the transportation and refrigeration.\n\n6.
