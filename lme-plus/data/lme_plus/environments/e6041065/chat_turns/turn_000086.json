I'm particularly interested in podcasts that offer in-depth analysis and commentary, so I'll start with Pod Save America and The Axe Files with David Axelrod. I've also been thinking about exploring podcasts that cover science and technology, since I enjoyed the episode about the science behind dreams from \"Stuff You Should Know\". Can you recommend any popular science or tech podcasts?",
