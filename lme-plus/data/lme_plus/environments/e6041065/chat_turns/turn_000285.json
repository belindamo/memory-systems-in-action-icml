The frequency of tune-ups varies depending on the vehicle, driving conditions, and manufacturer recommendations.\n\nTypically, a tune-up is recommended:\n\n* Every 30,000 to 60,000 miles for conventional spark plugs\n* Every 100,000 miles for platinum or iridium spark plugs\n* Every 5,000 to 7,500 miles for synthetic oil changes (if you're using synthetic oil)\n\nHowever, it's best to consult your owner's manual or speak with a trusted mechanic to determine the recommended tune-up schedule for your specific vehicle.\n\nWhen you ask Firestone Complete Auto Care about a tune-up, be sure to ask about:\n\n1. What's included in the tune-up: Find out what specific services are included, such as spark plug replacement, fuel injector cleaning, and ignition system inspection.\n2. The cost: Get a quote for the tune-up and ask if they have any promotions or discounts available.\n3. Any additional recommendations: Ask the mechanic to inspect your vehicle and provide recommendations for any other services that might be due or necessary.\n\nSome common services that might be included in a tune-up:\n\n* Spark plug replacement\n* Fuel injector cleaning or replacement\n* Air filter replacement\n* PCV valve replacement\n* Belt replacements (e.g., serpentine belt, timing belt)\n* Fluid checks and top-offs (e.g., oil, coolant, transmission fluid)\n* Ignition system inspection and repair\n\nBy staying on top of tune-ups, you'll help:\n\n* Improve your car's performance and fuel efficiency\n* Reduce emissions and environmental impact\n* Identify potential issues before they become major problems\n* Maintain your car's warranty (if applicable)\n\nKeep in mind that modern vehicles often have more advanced systems, and the traditional \"tune-up\" might not be as necessary as it was in the past. However, it's still essential to follow the recommended maintenance schedule to ensure your car runs smoothly and efficiently.",
