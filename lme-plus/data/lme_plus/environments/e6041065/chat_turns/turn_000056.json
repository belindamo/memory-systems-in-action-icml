  "content": "I think I'll go with a personalized message that includes a special quote. Something like:\n\n\"Dear Rachel, I'm beyond thrilled to welcome Ethan and Lucas to the family! As you embark on this incredible journey of motherhood, I want you to remember that 'a mother's love is like a blanket that wraps around her children, keeping them safe and warm.' You're already doing an amazing job, and I'm so grateful to be a part of your life. This gift is a small token of my love and admiration for you and your little ones. Remember to take time for yourself, too - you deserve it! Love, [Your Name]\"\n\nI think this captures the sentiment perfectly, and the quote adds a touching element to the message. Thanks for the suggestions!",
