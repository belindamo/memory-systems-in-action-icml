I'm here to provide information and answer your questions to the best of my abilities.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to help you reflect on your experience at the Artisan Market! You mentioned you made around $80 with your knitted scarves and hats. Congratulations on that!\n\nCan you tell me more about your experience at the market? What was the most popular item among your customers? Did you have any interesting conversations with them? What did you learn from the experience, and how will you apply that to future markets or sales events?",
