Here's a simple formula to help you decide how many tops to bring:\n\n**The 3-2-1 Rule**\n\n* 3 tops for every 5 days (so, 3 tops for your 5-day trip)\n* 2 of those tops should be versatile enough to be dressed up or down\n* 1 top should be a special occasion or \"wow\" piece (if you have plans for a nicer dinner or event)\n\nThis rule assumes you'll be wearing each top once or twice, depending on your activities and preferences. You can always do a quick wash or spot clean if needed.\n\nConsidering your tendency to overpack, let's stick to the 3-top rule. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* 1-2 tops for casual days (e.g., a lightweight t-shirt or blouse)\n* 1 top for a slightly dressier occasion (e.g., a button-down shirt or a nicer blouse)\n\nRemember, you can always mix and match with the bottoms you bring to create multiple outfits. Do you have any other packing concerns or questions?",
