High-grade comics with minimal wear and tear are more valuable.\n3. **Age**: Older comics, especially those from the Golden Age (1938-1955) or Silver Age (1956-1970), are generally more valuable than newer ones.\n4. **Popularity**: Comics featuring popular characters, like Spider-Man, can command higher prices.\n5. **Grading**: Professional grading companies, like the Certified Guaranty Company (CGC), can provide a third-party assessment of a comic's condition and authenticity.\n\n**Grading scales**: Comics are typically graded on a 1-10 scale, with 10 being mint condition.
