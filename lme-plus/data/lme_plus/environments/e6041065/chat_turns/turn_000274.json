  "content": "I think focusing on her sense of humor would be a great idea. Grandma was always making us laugh, and I think it would be wonderful to share some funny stories and memories of her. It could be a great way to celebrate her life and legacy, and it would definitely bring some joy and laughter to the celebration. Plus, it would be a nice way to balance out some of the more emotional moments that are sure to come up during the storytelling portion. What do you think about setting up a few \"laughter stations\" around the celebration area, with some funny photos or quotes from grandma? It could be a nice way to add some visual elements to the celebration and encourage people to share their own funny stories and memories.",
