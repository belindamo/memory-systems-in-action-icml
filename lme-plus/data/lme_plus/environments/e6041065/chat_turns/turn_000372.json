  "content": "I can't predict snowfall or weather patterns, but in general, the most reliable snow conditions in switzerland are typically found between december and april. january and february are often the best months for powder, but this can vary from year to year. some of the higher elevation resorts, such as verbier or zermatt, can often have snow well into may or even june. keep in mind that weekends and school holidays tend to be busier and more expensive, so if you can, consider visiting during weekdays or offseason to potentially find more affordable rates and less crowds. it's always best to check the latest snow reports before booking your ski trip to ensure that the conditions meet your expectations.",
