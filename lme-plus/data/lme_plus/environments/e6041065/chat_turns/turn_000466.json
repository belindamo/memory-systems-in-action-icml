  "content": "Sea turtles use a combination of environmental cues, such as the Earth's magnetic field and the location of the sun and stars, to navigate the ocean and migrate long distances. They have been recorded traveling over 10,000 miles in a single year.\n\nSea turtles also have a number of adaptations that allow them to survive in different ocean environments. For example:\n\n1. Their adaptively shaped shell allows them to swim quickly and efficiently through the water\n2. Their strong legs and flippers help them to navigate through the surf and onto sandy beaches to lay their eggs\n3. They can hold their breath for long periods of time, up to several hours, allowing them to dive deep beneath the surface to feed on sea grasses, jellyfish, and other food sources\n4. They have a special gland that allows them to excrete excess salt from their bodies, enabling them to survive in both salty and fresh water environments\n5. Some sea turtles also have a unique ability to regulate their body temperature, allowing them to stay warm in colder waters and cool in warmer waters.",
