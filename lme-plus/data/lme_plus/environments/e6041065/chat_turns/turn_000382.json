  "content": "**Rice Vinegar:**\nFor this recipe, I recommend using a mild, Japanese-style rice vinegar (, \"japanese rice vinegar\" in Japanese). This type of vinegar has a sweeter and milder flavor profile compared to Chinese rice vinegar, which can be too strong and overpowering. You can find Japanese rice vinegar at most Asian grocery stores or online. Some popular brands include:\n\n* Mitsukan\n* Kikkoman\n* Nakano\n* Marukan\n\nIf you can't find Japanese rice vinegar, you can substitute it with a mild white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar. However, keep in mind that the flavor profile will be slightly different.\n\n**Sides:**\nHere are some traditional Korean side dishes that pair well with spicy pork belly:\n\n1. **Kimchi** (): Spicy fermented Korean cabbage that complements the pork belly's spiciness.\n2. **Steamed Rice** (): A bowl of hot, fluffy rice helps to balance the spiciness and richness of the dish.\n3. **Bok Choy Stir-Fry** (): Quickly saut\u00e9ed bok choy with garlic and ginger adds a nice contrast in texture and flavor.\n4. **Gyeranjjim** (): Steamed eggs flavored with sesame oil, soy sauce, and garlic make a comforting side dish.\n5. **Sigeumchi** (): Boiled spinach seasoned with garlic, sesame oil, and salt provides a refreshing contrast to the rich pork.\n6. **Kongnamul** (): Bean sprout salad with garlic, ginger, and gochugaru adds a nice crunch and spice.\n7. **Cucumber Kimchi** (): A simple kimchi made with cucumbers, onions, and gochugaru provides a cooling contrast.\n\nOther options:\n\n1. **Pickled Ginger** (): Thinly sliced ginger pickled in vinegar and sugar helps to cut the richness of the pork.\n2. **Roasted Vegetables** (e.g., broccoli, carrots, zucchini): Roasted vegetables with a drizzle of soy sauce and sesame oil make a tasty and healthy side dish.\n3. **Korean-Style Coleslaw** (): A slaw made with shredded napa cabbage, carrots, and cucumber, dressed with a Korean-inspired vinaigrette.\n\nFeel free to choose one or two sides to serve with your spicy pork belly. Enjoy!",
