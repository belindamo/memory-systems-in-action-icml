It's a popular North Indian recipe that originated in the city of Delhi, and it's a staple in many Indian restaurants around the world. I'd be happy to share a recipe with you.\n\n**Butter Chicken Recipe (Murgh Makhani)**\n\n** Servings: 4-6 people**\n\n**Marinade:**\n\n* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces\n* 1/2 cup plain yogurt\n* 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n* 2 teaspoons garam masala powder\n* 1 teaspoon cumin powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon coriander powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for some heat)\n* Salt, to taste\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* 2 large onions, thinly sliced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 medium tomatoes, diced\n* 1 tablespoon butter\n* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n* 2 teaspoons cumin seeds\n* 1 teaspoon coriander powder\n* 1 teaspoon garam masala powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n* 1 cup chicken broth\n* 1/2 cup heavy cream\n* Fresh cilantro, for garnish\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Marinate the chicken:** In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, garam masala, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper (if using), and salt. Add the chicken and mix well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n2. **Make the sauce:** Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Add the sliced onions and cook until they're lightly browned and caramelized (about 8-10 minutes).\n3. **Add the garlic and spices:** Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and black pepper. Cook for 1 minute, until the spices are fragrant.\n4. **Add the tomatoes:** Add the diced tomatoes and cook until they're soft and mushy (about 5 minutes).\n5. **Add the flour and chicken broth:** Add the all-purpose flour and cook for 1 minute, until it's lightly browned. Gradually add the chicken broth, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it thickens (about 5 minutes).\n6. **Add the heavy cream and butter:** Add the heavy cream and remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Stir until the butter is melted and the sauce is smooth.\n7. **Cook the chicken:** Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until it's cooked through (about 6-8 minutes).\n8. **Assemble and serve:** Add the cooked chicken to the sauce and stir to coat. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, until the chicken is fully coated. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with basmati rice or naan bread.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use bone-in chicken for a more authentic, Indian-style butter chicken.\n* Add some bell peppers or mushrooms to the sauce for extra flavor and texture.\n* Use Greek yogurt or sour cream instead of heavy cream for a lighter version.\n* Serve with rice, naan bread, or roti for a complete meal.\n\nI",
