The crunchy texture and nutty flavor of the almonds will complement the sweet cherries and the dense, cake-like clafoutis perfectly. It's a great way to add depth and visual appeal to the dish.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when adding sliced almonds:\n\n* Use sliced almonds that are thinly sliced, almost like slivers. This will help them toast evenly and prevent them from becoming too crunchy or bitter.\n* Sprinkle the sliced almonds evenly over the cherries, making sure to cover the entire surface. You can use about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of sliced almonds, depending on your personal preference.\n* If you're using brown sugar, you might want to sprinkle a pinch of brown sugar over the sliced almonds before baking. This will help caramelize the sugar and create a crunchy, sweet topping.\n* Keep an eye on the clafoutis while it's baking, as the almonds can quickly go from toasted to burnt. You might need to cover the top with foil during the last 10-15 minutes of baking to prevent over-browning.\n\nBy incorporating brown sugar, almond flour, and sliced almonds, you'll create a truly unique and delicious cherry clafoutis that's sure to impress your friends and family. The combination of flavors and textures will be amazing!\n\nRemember to have fun and be flexible when experimenting with new ingredients and recipes. Don't be afraid to try new things and adjust the recipe to your liking. And if you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!",
