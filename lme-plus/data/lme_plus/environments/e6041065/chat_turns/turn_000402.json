The defending champions of Wimbledon 2022 are:\n\n* Men's Singles: Novak Djokovic ( Serbia) - He won his 20th Grand Slam title and 7th Wimbledon title in 2021 by defeating Matteo Berrettini in the final.\n* Women's Singles: Ashleigh Barty (Australia) - She won her 2nd Grand Slam title and 1st Wimbledon title in 2021 by defeating Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 in the final.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Ashleigh Barty has since announced her retirement from professional tennis in March 2022, so she will not be defending her title this year.\n\nAs for Novak Djokovic, he'll be looking to win his 21st Grand Slam title and 8th Wimbledon title. But, with the likes of Rafael Nadal, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Daniil Medvedev in the mix, the competition is expected to be fierce!\n\nWho do you think will emerge victorious at Wimbledon this year?",
