I just visited the Modern Art Museum's new exhibition and was really impressed by the installation featuring a large-scale metal structure. Do you have any recommendations for similar artists or exhibitions I should check out? By the way, I'm taking a break from volunteering at the Museum of Contemporary Art's summer festival today, so I'm in an art-filled mood.",
