In addition to regulations and mechanisms, it is crucial to have a culture of transparency and accountability to prevent corruption effectively. The government needs to lead by example, and top officials must set the tone for ethical behavior by their actions. The government should prioritize creating an enabling environment that motivates public officials and contractors to be transparent and accountable in their dealings. It might also help to promote ethical leadership that rewards transparency, openness, and uprightness in public dealings. By creating a culture of transparency and accountability across all levels of government, public officials will be less likely to engage in corrupt practices, and people will have greater confidence in the government's ability to conduct fair and efficient procurement processes.",
