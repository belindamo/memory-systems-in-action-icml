  "content": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau was born in Geneva, Switzerland. He spent much of his adult life travelling first as a teacher and the secretary of the French ambassador in Venice, Italy. He spent time in Paris where he met and socialized with other Enlightenment philosophers including Voltaire and Diderot. Rousseau returned to Switzerland when his relationships with other Enlightenment Thinkers became strained. \n\nWhile in Geneva, Switzerland, he wrote his most famous book, The Social Contract. In the book, Rousseau argues that as members of a society we enter an agreement, the social contract, in which we promise to follow the \u201cgeneral will\u201d of the members of the society as expressed by the laws made by the government. In exchange, we receive the liberty to do what we want as long as we do not break those laws. \n\nThe Social Contract was banned in France and Switzerland. To avoid arrest for his views, Rousseau moved to England. Eventually he returned to Paris where he lived until his death and continued to write books that were politically controversial. \n\nHis writings, which were heavily influenced by John Locke, inspired the leaders of the French Revolution which started shortly after his death. \nDescribe Rousseau's Social Contract in your own words. \n The government must provide for all",
