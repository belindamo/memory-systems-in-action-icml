  "content": "You're in for a treat! Korean-style spicy pork belly, also known as \"jeyuk bokkeum\" in Korean, is a popular dish that's both flavorful and addictive. Here's a recipe that yields tender, spicy, and savory pork belly with a depth of flavor:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the pork belly:\n\n* 2 lbs pork belly, skin removed\n* 1/4 cup Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)\n* 2 tbsp brown sugar\n* 2 tbsp garlic, minced\n* 1 tsp grated ginger\n* 1 tsp ground black pepper\n* 1/4 cup Korean chili paste (gochujang)\n* 2 tbsp soy sauce\n* 2 tbsp rice vinegar\n* 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n\nFor the spicy sauce:\n\n* 1/2 cup Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)\n* 1/4 cup gochujang\n* 2 tbsp soy sauce\n* 2 tbsp rice vinegar\n* 1 tsp sugar\n* 1 tsp garlic, minced\n* 1 tsp grated ginger\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Cure the pork belly:** In a small bowl, mix together the chili flakes, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and black pepper. Rub the mixture all over the pork belly, making sure to coat it evenly. Let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the cure to penetrate the meat.\n2. **Marinate the pork belly:** In a large bowl, whisk together the chili paste, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and vegetable oil. Add the cured pork belly and make sure it's fully coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.\n3. **Cook the pork belly:** Remove the pork belly from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Cut the pork belly into 1-inch thick slices. Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the pork belly slices and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes per side. Remove the pork from the skillet and set aside.\n4. **Make the spicy sauce:** In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add the chili flakes, gochujang, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, and ginger. Whisk until the sauce is smooth and bubbly. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until it thickens slightly.\n5. **Finish the dish:** Add the cooked pork belly back into the skillet with the spicy sauce. Toss the pork to coat it evenly with the sauce. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the pork is fully coated and the sauce has thickened to your liking.\n6. **Serve:** Slice the pork belly into bite-sized pieces and serve with steamed rice, kimchi, or other Korean-style sides.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* For a more intense flavor, let the pork belly marinate for a longer period, such as 24 hours or even 48 hours.\n* Adjust the level of spiciness to your liking by adding more or less chili flakes and gochujang.\n* Add some crispy garlic and ginger on top of the pork belly before serving for added texture and flavor.\n* Serve with a fried egg on top for a more indulgent treat.\n\nEnjoy your delicious Korean-style spicy pork belly!",
