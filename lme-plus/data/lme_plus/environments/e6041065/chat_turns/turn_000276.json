The \"laughter stations\" will add a fun and interactive element to the celebration, and will surely bring smiles to everyone's faces. I'm sure grandma would be thrilled to know that her sense of humor is being celebrated in such a creative way.\n\nNow, I have to ask, have you thought about how you'll incorporate the story of your cousin's husband into the celebration? You mentioned earlier that he passed away suddenly, and I'm sure his memory will be on everyone's minds during the celebration. How do you plan to honor his memory during the storytelling portion or throughout the celebration?",
