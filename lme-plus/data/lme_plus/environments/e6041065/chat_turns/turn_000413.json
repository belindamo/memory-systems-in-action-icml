I did learn my lesson on my last trip when I packed an entire bag of skincare products and hair care products, but I only ended up using half of them. I'm also thinking of packing some snacks, like nuts and energy bars, so I don't have to rely on airport or bus station food. Do you have any recommendations for healthy snack options that are easy to pack?",
