  "content": "I'm glad you're considering packing healthy snack options. On my last trip, I packed a bunch of snacks, including nuts and energy bars, and it really helped me save money and stay energized during my travels. Since I packed 5 pairs of shoes, I had to make sure I had enough space in my luggage for my snacks, too! Anyway, I was wondering if you could recommend some good ways to stay organized while packing. I've started using packing cubes, and they've been a game-changer, but I'm always looking for more tips and tricks.",
