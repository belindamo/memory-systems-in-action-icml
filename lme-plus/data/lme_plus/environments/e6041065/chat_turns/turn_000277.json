  "content": "Thank you for bringing that up. Yes, my cousin's husband's passing was a shock to all of us, and his memory will definitely be present during the celebration. I've been thinking about how to incorporate his story into the celebration, and I think I've come up with a few ideas.\n\nFirstly, I plan to acknowledge his passing during the opening remarks or welcome speech. I'll take a moment to express my condolences to my cousin and her family, and to acknowledge the impact his loss has had on all of us. I want to make sure that his memory is acknowledged and respected during the celebration.\n\nDuring the storytelling portion, I'll make sure to leave some time for guests to share stories or memories of my cousin's husband. I'll encourage them to share funny anecdotes, touching moments, or inspiring stories about him. I want to create a space where people can share their thoughts and feelings about him, and where we can all celebrate his life and legacy together.\n\nI'm also thinking of setting up a memorial or a remembrance area during the celebration, where guests can write notes, leave flowers, or share memories of my cousin's husband. This will provide a quiet and intimate space for people to reflect on his life and pay their respects.\n\nFinally, I'm considering incorporating a special activity or ritual during the celebration that will honor his memory. This could be a candlelight vigil, a moment of silence, or a special song or prayer that was meaningful to him. I want to find a way to acknowledge his passing and celebrate his life in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to everyone involved.\n\nI hope these ideas will help to incorporate my cousin's husband's story into the celebration in a meaningful way. It's important to me that we honor his memory and celebrate his life, while also acknowledging the pain and loss that his passing has brought to our family.",
