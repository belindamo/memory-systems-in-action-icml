Brake pads are a critical safety component, and worn-out brake pads can lead to:\n\n1. Reduced stopping power: Worn-out brake pads can increase your stopping distance, which can be risky, especially in emergency situations.\n2. Damage to other brake components: Worn-out brake pads can cause damage to other brake system components, such as rotors, calipers, and brake lines, leading to costly repairs.\n3. Noise and vibration: Worn-out brake pads can cause annoying noises and vibrations when you press the brake pedal.\n\nFirestone Complete Auto Care can inspect your brake pads and provide a report on their condition. If they're worn out, they can replace them for you.\n\nWhen you ask about brake pad inspection, also ask about:\n\n1. The cost of the inspection: Some shops may include a free brake inspection with other services, while others may charge a small fee.\n2. The cost of replacement: If your brake pads need to be replaced, ask about the cost of the parts and labor.\n3. The type of brake pads they use: Make sure they use high-quality brake pads that meet or exceed OEM specifications.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider asking about other services that might be due or recommended, such as:\n\n1. Belt replacements (e.g., serpentine belt, timing belt)\n2. Fluid checks (e.g., transmission, coolant, brake fluid)\n3. Battery inspection and maintenance\n\nBy asking about these services, you can get a better understanding of your car's overall condition and address any potential issues before they become major problems.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be proactive with maintenance to ensure your safety on the road and to avoid costly repairs down the line.",
