Here's a general guideline:\n\n* Undergarments: Pack 5-7 pairs, depending on the length of your trip and your personal preferences. You can always do a quick wash or have some laundered if needed.\n* Socks: Pack 7-10 pairs, assuming you'll wear a pair each day and have a few extras in case some get wet or dirty.\n\nConsider packing:\n\n* A few pairs of quick-drying, moisture-wicking socks for outdoor activities or athletic pursuits\n* A few pairs of dressier socks to match your nicer outfits\n* A few pairs of plain white or neutral-colored socks that can be paired with your black pants or shorts\n\nRemember to choose undergarments and socks that are comfortable, breathable, and suitable for your planned activities.\n\nTips:\n\n* Pack socks and undergarments that can be easily mixed-and-matched with your outfits.\n* Consider packing a few travel-sized packets of laundry detergent or travel wash, in case you need to wash any undergarments or socks during your trip.\n* Roll your socks and undergarments to save space in your luggage and reduce wrinkles.\n\nWith your packing list shaping up, don't forget to leave some extra space in your luggage for souvenirs and any items you might purchase during your trip!",
