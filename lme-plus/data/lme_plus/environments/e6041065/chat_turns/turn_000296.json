  "content": "Certainly, here's a revised version of the advisory:\n\n\"It is essential to keep in mind that an appraiser's assessment of a property as complex does not conclusively establish its complexity. Although appraisers possess expertise and experience in evaluating the complexities of properties, it is imperative to meticulously consider their opinion and accompanying evidence in conjunction with our own research and analysis. This is especially important to remember as appraisers may have a vested interest in securing the highest fee possible, and may therefore be inclined to search for justifications of complexity. As a team, it is crucial that we exercise caution in our judgement and ensure that our decisions are informed by objective criteria and a comprehensive examination of the property and market conditions.\"",
