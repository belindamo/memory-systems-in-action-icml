However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or physical presence, so I don't have specific recommendations for watch repair services in your city. But I can offer some general advice to help you find a reputable and reliable watch repair service.\n\n1. **Word of mouth**: Ask friends, family, or fellow watch enthusiasts for recommendations. They might have had good experiences with a particular repair service.\n2. **Online reviews**: Check online review platforms like Yelp, Google Reviews, or Trustpilot to see what other customers have to say about a particular repair service. Pay attention to the overall rating and read the reviews to get a sense of the service's strengths and weaknesses.\n3. **Professional associations**: Look for watch repair services that are members of professional associations like the American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute (AWCI) or the British Horological Institute (BHI).
