  "content": "Make it sound a bit more professional: \"It is important to remember that an appraiser's opinion that a property is complex does not automatically make it so. While an appraiser may have expertise and experience in determining the complexity of properties, it is important to carefully weigh their opinion and supporting evidence with our own analysis and research. This is especially important since appraisers have an interest in collecting as high of a fee as possible, and may be incentivized to look for any reason to justify complexity. Our team must be careful in our judgement and ensure that we are making well-informed decisions based on objective criteria and a thorough analysis of the property and market conditions.\"",
