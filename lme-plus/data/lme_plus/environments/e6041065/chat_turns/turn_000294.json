  "content": "Certainly, here's a revised version of the advisory:\n\n\"It is imperative to keep in mind that an appraisal professional's designation of a property as complex does not automatically make it so. While appraisers possess expertise and experience in evaluating the complexities of properties, it is crucial to rigorously consider their opinion and accompanying evidence in conjunction with our own research and analysis. This is particularly important to remember as appraisers may have a vested interest in securing the highest fee possible, and may therefore be inclined to search for justifications of complexity. As a team, it is imperative that we exercise caution in our judgement and ensure that our decisions are informed by objective criteria and a comprehensive examination of the property and market conditions.\"",
