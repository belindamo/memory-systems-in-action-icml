  "content": "Both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Locke believed in the idea of a social contract, where individuals give up some of their individual rights to a government in exchange for protection and security. Both philosophers also believed in the right to revolt against a government that fails to uphold its end of the contract and the idea of the government being based on the consent of the governed. However, there are also some differences in their beliefs, such as the primary purpose of government and the concept of private property.",
