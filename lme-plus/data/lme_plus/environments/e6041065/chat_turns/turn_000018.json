  "content": "I'm glad you were able to help me break down the project into smaller tasks and estimate the effort required. I think I have a better understanding of what needs to be done and how to prioritize my time. I also appreciate the time management tips - I tend to get overwhelmed when faced with a lot of tasks at once. By the way, I've been reviewing my notes from the project management workshop I attended at the Marriott hotel last month, and I realized I need to set up a dashboard to track my progress. Can you recommend any tools or software that can help me with that?",
