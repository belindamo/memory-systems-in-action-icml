  "content": "I've been thinking a lot about self-compassion lately, and I believe loving-kindness meditation can really help with that. In my spiritual retreat group, we've been exploring different aspects of self-awareness, and I've come to realize how important it is to treat myself with kindness and understanding. Can you recommend any books or resources on self-compassion that I can explore further?",
