Many are following the FA's lead and taking steps to ensure that their sport is open to everyone.\n\nFor instance, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has been actively promoting diversity and inclusion through various initiatives. In 2014, the NBA created the Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Council, which is comprised of team owners, executives, and other stakeholders. The council's goal is to promote diversity within the league and address issues related to discrimination.\n\nSimilarly, the National Football League (NFL) has implemented various diversity initiatives, including the Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate for head coaching and senior football operations positions.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has also taken steps to promote diversity and inclusion in sport. In 2014, the IOC added sexual orientation to its non-discrimination policy, and in 2018, the organization launched an Olympic Refuge Foundation to support refugees and displaced persons.\n\nOverall, many sports organizations have recognized the importance of diversity and inclusion, and are taking steps to ensure that their sport is accessible to everyone.",
