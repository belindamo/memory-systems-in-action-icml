  "content": "Yes, many of the new parties in Panama have made addressing corruption and restoring public trust in the government a key part of their political platforms. Here are a few examples of how some of the newer parties plan to tackle this issue:\n\n1. Alianza: The party has put forward a comprehensive anti-corruption plan that includes measures such as strengthening accountability and transparency in government, increasing funding for anti-corruption agencies, and implementing stricter penalties for corrupt officials.\n\n2. Frente Amplio: The party has called for greater transparency around government contracts and for removing companies linked to corruption from public bidding processes. They've also advocated for stronger penalties for those found guilty of corruption and for greater public oversight of government activities.\n\n3. Partido Revolucionario Democr\u00e1tico: As the party that implemented many of the social and economic reforms in Panama during its time in power, the PRD has been working to distance itself from its past association with corruption. The party has promised to restore public trust in government by prioritizing transparency and accountability in its policies and actions.\n\nIt's worth noting that addressing corruption is a complex issue that requires sustained, long-term efforts from the government and civil society. The proposed anti-corruption measures must be implemented effectively and enforced vigorously to have a real impact. However, the fact that newer parties are making this issue a priority suggests that there is a growing acknowledgment of the need for change and a renewed commitment to building a more transparent and fair political system in Panama.",
