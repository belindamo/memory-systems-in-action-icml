  "content": "Concept maps and diagrams are fantastic tools for visualizing complex concepts, especially in data science. While not all the apps I mentioned earlier have built-in diagramming capabilities, some of them do offer features or integrations that can help you create concept maps or diagrams. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Notion**: Notion has a built-in Kanban board and table features that can be used to create concept maps or diagrams. You can also use its block-based structure to create a mind map-like layout. Additionally, Notion has a Web Clipper browser extension that allows you to clip web pages and turn them into diagrams.\n2. **Evernote**: Evernote has a feature called \"Skitch\" which is a built-in image annotation and markup tool. You can use Skitch to create simple diagrams and concept maps, and then save them as notes within Evernote.\n3. **OneNote**: OneNote has a \"Draw\" feature that allows you to create diagrams and sketches using a variety of tools, including shapes, lines, and text. You can also use its \"Ink to Text\" feature to convert handwritten notes into typed text.\n4. **Bear**: Bear has a feature called \"Focus Mode\" which allows you to create a distraction-free writing environment. While it doesn't have built-in diagramming capabilities, you can use its syntax highlighting and formatting options to create simple diagrams using ASCII art or Markdown.\n5. **Trello**: Trello is a visual tool by nature, and you can use its boards, lists, and cards to create concept maps or diagrams. You can also use its Power-Ups feature to integrate with other diagramming tools like Lucidchart or Gliffy.\n\nIf you're looking for more advanced diagramming capabilities, you may want to consider using a dedicated diagramming tool that integrates with your note-taking app. Some popular options include:\n\n1. **Draw.io**: A free, open-source diagramming tool that integrates with Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive.\n2. **Lucidchart**: A popular diagramming tool that offers a range of templates and integrations with popular productivity apps.\n3. **MindMeister**: A mind mapping tool that integrates with Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote.\n4. **Grapholith**: A diagramming tool that allows you to create complex diagrams and graphs, with integrations with GitHub and Dropbox.\n\nThese tools often offer web-based interfaces, so you can access them from any device and sync your diagrams with your note-taking app.\n\nI hope this helps you create some amazing concept maps and diagrams for your data science course!",
