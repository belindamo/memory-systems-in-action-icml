Here are some tips to help you recreate her recipe:\n\n**Thyme and Rosemary:**\n\n* Use fresh thyme and rosemary sprigs, as they'll provide a more potent flavor than dried herbs. You can chop them finely or leave them whole, depending on your preference.\n* Consider using a bit more thyme than rosemary, as thyme is often the dominant herb in traditional turkey seasoning.\n\n**Stuffing with Onions and Carrots:**\n\n* Chop the onions and carrots into small pieces and saut\u00e9 them in butter until they're softened and caramelized. This will bring out their natural sweetness and add depth to the turkey's flavor.\n* Stuff the turkey loosely with the saut\u00e9ed onions and carrots, making sure not to pack them too tightly. You want the turkey to cook evenly and not steam instead of roast.\n\n**Seasonings:**\n\n* Salt, pepper, and paprika are a great starting point. You can also consider adding a pinch of black pepper, as it pairs well with the herbs.\n* If you want to add a bit of smokiness, you could try using smoked paprika or chipotle powder in small amounts.\n\n**Roasting the Turkey:**\n\n* Roasting the turkey at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) is a good temperature. You can also try roasting it at 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C) for a more gentle cooking process, which can help keep the turkey juicy.\n* Make sure to baste the turkey with its pan juices every 30 minutes or so to keep it moist and promote browning.\n\nHere's an updated recipe based on your grandma's approach:\n\n**Herb-Roasted Turkey Breast with Onions and Carrots**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 (4-6 pound) boneless, skinless turkey breast\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 large onion, chopped\n* 2 large carrots, chopped\n* 2 sprigs fresh thyme\n* 1 sprig fresh rosemary\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1/2 teaspoon paprika (optional)\n* 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika or chipotle powder (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

In a small bowl, mix together the thyme, rosemary, salt, black pepper, paprika, and smoked paprika (if using).\n4. Rub the herb mixture all over the turkey breast, making sure to get some under the skin as well.\n5. Stuff the turkey breast with the saut\u00e9ed onions and carrots.\n6. Place the turkey in a roasting pan and put it in the oven.\n7. Roast the turkey for about 2-2 1/2 hours, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).
