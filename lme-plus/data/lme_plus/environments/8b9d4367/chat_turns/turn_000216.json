Here is a revised version of the Sermon on the Mount in rhyme form:\n\nBlessed are the poor in soul,\nFor theirs is the kingdom whole.\nBlessed are those who are sad,\nFor they will be comforted, not mad.\nBlessed are the meek and mild,\nFor they will inherit the earth, so wild.\nBlessed are those who crave righteousness,\nFor they shall be filled, not in emptiness.\nBlessed are the merciful, kind and true,\nFor mercy they will find, and renew.\nBlessed are the pure in heart and mind,\nFor they will see God, so divine.\nBlessed are the peacemakers, pure in deed,\nFor they will be called God's children indeed.\nBlessed are those who suffer for right,\nFor theirs is the kingdom, shining bright.\n\nRejoice and be glad, don't be blue,\nFor your reward in heaven is waiting for you.\nYou are the salt of the earth, so strong,\nBut if your salt has lost its flavor, it can't belong.\nIt's good for nothing, thrown away,\nBut if you keep your taste, you'll have your day.\nYou are the light of the world, so bright,\nA city on a hill can't be hidden from sight.\nIt shines for all to see, so clear,\nSo let your light shine, and have no fear.\nMen will see your good works and praise your Father on high,\nGlorifying Him in all they do, and never shy.",
