  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to a current list of contemporary architectural examples in Krasnoyarsk. However, there are several examples of contemporary architecture in Krasnoyarsk that reflect these international trends. One example is the Krasnoyarsk Regional Museum of Local Lore, which was designed by the Russian architect Yuri Grigoryan. The building features a steel and glass facade, which creates a sleek and modern look. Another example is the Hyatt Regency Krasnoyarsk Hotel, designed by the Russian architect Alexey Kiselev. The hotel features a sleek and modern design that incorporates elements of postmodernism, such as curved lines and sculptural forms. Additionally, the \"City of Sun\" residential complex, designed by the Russian architect Sergey Skuratov, features contemporary design elements such as clean lines, minimal ornamentation, and large windows that maximize natural light.",
