  "content": "Mashed potatoes and green beans are classic Thanksgiving side dishes that are easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser. Here are two simple recipes to get you started:\n\n**Creamy Mashed Potatoes**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 3-4 large potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1-inch cubes\n* 1/4 cup milk or half-and-half\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Optional: garlic powder, chives, or grated cheese for added flavor\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Place the chopped potatoes in a large pot and add enough cold water to cover them. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.\n2. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the milk, butter, salt, and pepper, and mash the potatoes with a potato masher or a fork until they're smooth and creamy.\n3. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If the potatoes are too thick, add a little more milk. If they're too thin, add a little more butter or mash them for a few more minutes.\n4. Serve hot, garnished with chopped chives or scallions if desired.\n\n**Roasted Green Beans with Garlic and Lemon**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Optional: 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley or thyme for added flavor\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n2. In a large bowl, toss the green beans with the olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper until the beans are evenly coated.\n3. Spread the green beans in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n4. Roast the green beans in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until they're tender and slightly caramelized, stirring occasionally.\n5. Remove the green beans from the oven and sprinkle with chopped parsley or thyme if desired. Serve hot.\n\nThese recipes are easy to make and require minimal ingredients. You can also customize them to your taste by adding different herbs or spices. For example, you could add some grated nutmeg or cinnamon to the mashed potatoes for a warm, autumnal flavor, or sprinkle some red pepper flakes over the green beans for a spicy kick.\n\nI hope you enjoy these recipes!
