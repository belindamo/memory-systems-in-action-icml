  "content": "**Network Congestion Handling:**\n\nThe Google Wifi system is designed to handle network congestion in several ways:\n\n1. **Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation:** Google Wifi dynamically allocates bandwidth to devices based on their needs, ensuring that each device gets the necessary bandwidth for its application.\n2. **Quality of Service (QoS):** Google Wifi has built-in QoS features that prioritize traffic based on the type of application or device. For example, it can prioritize video streaming or online gaming traffic over less critical applications like file downloads.\n3. **Traffic Shaping:** Google Wifi can limit the amount of bandwidth available to certain devices or applications to prevent them from hogging the network.\n4. **Mesh Networking:** The mesh network architecture allows Google Wifi to dynamically reroute traffic between nodes to avoid congestion and ensure that devices always have the best possible connection.\n\n**Prioritizing Devices or Applications:**\n\nYes, Google Wifi offers features to prioritize certain devices or applications for better performance:\n\n1. **Priority Device:** You can designate a specific device (e.g., a smart TV or gaming console) as a \"Priority Device\" in the Google Wifi app. This ensures that the device gets priority access to bandwidth and reduces latency.\n2. **Application Priority:** You can prioritize specific applications (e.g., Netflix, YouTube, or online gaming) to ensure they get the necessary bandwidth and low latency.\n3. **Device Groups:** You can create device groups in the Google Wifi app to prioritize devices based on their type or usage patterns. For example, you can create a group for smart home devices or gaming consoles.\n4. **Custom QoS Rules:** Advanced users can create custom QoS rules to prioritize specific traffic types or applications using the Google Wifi app.\n\n**Additional Features:**\n\nGoogle Wifi also offers some additional features to help manage network congestion and prioritize performance:\n\n1. **Network Assist:** This feature uses machine learning to detect and optimize network performance in real-time, ensuring that devices get the best possible connection.\n2. **Network Scheduling:** You can schedule network downtime or limit internet access during specific times of the day to reduce congestion and prioritize certain devices or applications.\n3. **Guest Network:** You can create a separate guest network to isolate visitors' devices and prevent them from impacting your main network's performance.\n\nOverall, the Google Wifi system is designed to provide a robust and flexible network infrastructure that can handle network congestion and prioritize performance for critical devices and applications.",
