NEMESIS, the hulking bioweapon, activates the machine and steps inside.\n\nINT. TIME MACHINE - DAY\n\nNemesis sets the coordinates to Jerusalem, 33 AD, just before the crucifixion of JESUS CHRIST. The machine whirs to life, and he is transported back in time.\n\nEXT. JERUSALEM - DAY\n\nNemesis arrives in ancient Jerusalem. He sees ROMAN SOLDIERS leading JESUS, bruised and wearing a crown of thorns, through the streets. A large crowd follows.\n\nNEMESIS\n(Grumbling, determined)\nMust... save... Jesus...\n\nNemesis follows the procession, waiting for the right moment to intervene.\n\nEXT. GOLGOTHA - DAY\n\nThe procession reaches Golgotha, where three crosses are prepared. The ROMAN SOLDIERS begin to nail JESUS to the cross. Nemesis springs into action.\n\nNEMESIS\n(Shouting)\nStop!\n\nNemesis charges towards the soldiers, causing them to scatter in fear. The crowd watches in shock and awe.\n\nNEMESIS\n(To Jesus)\nYou... safe... now...\n\nJESUS\n(Weak, but grateful)\nThank you... but... destiny... must... fulfill...\n\nNEMESIS\n(Confused)\nDestiny?\n\nJesus looks at Nemesis with compassion and understanding.\n\nJESUS\nYes... my destiny. My sacrifice will bring salvation to mankind. Your heart is pure, but this must be done.\n\nNemesis hesitates, then nods solemnly.\n\nNEMESIS\n(Grumbling)\nUnderstand... will... remember...\n\nJesus smiles at Nemesis, and the soldiers regroup and proceed with the crucifixion. Nemesis steps back, watching the event unfold with a heavy heart.\n\nEXT. GOLGOTHA - SUNSET\n\nThe crucifixion is complete, and the crowd has dispersed. Nemesis approaches the cross where Jesus hangs, his head bowed.\n\nNEMESIS\n(Whispering)\nThank... you... Jesus...\n\nNemesis turns and walks back to the time machine, understanding the weight of the moment and the importance of Jesus' sacrifice.\n\nINT. TIME MACHINE - NIGHT\n\nNemesis activates the time machine, returning to his own time. As he reflects on his journey, he realizes the significance of the experience and the lesson he has learned about sacrifice and destiny.\n\nFADE OUT.",
