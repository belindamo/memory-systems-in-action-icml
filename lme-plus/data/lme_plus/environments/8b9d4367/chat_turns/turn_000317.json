  "content": "The popularity of Gothic architecture declined in the 16th century due to several reasons. Firstly, the Reformation led to a shift in architectural tastes, with many Protestant nations rejecting the grand and ornate styles of the Catholic Church in favor of a simpler, more austere style. Secondly, the rise of classical revivalism in the 17th and 18th centuries, which borrowed from the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome, brought a new interest in classical orders such as the Doric and Ionic columns.\n\nIn addition, Gothic architecture was seen as impractical and outdated due to its complex and labor-intensive building techniques. The cost of maintaining and restoring Gothic buildings also became a burden on many institutions, leading to some structures falling into disrepair.\n\nFinally, the rise of new architectural styles such as Baroque, Rococo, and Neoclassicism further displaced Gothic architecture from the forefront.\n\nDespite falling out of favor, Gothic architecture continued to influence various styles of architecture. The Gothic Revival in the 19th century brought back many of the features of Gothic architecture, and also inspired the development of new architectural styles such as Art Nouveau and Art Deco. Today, Gothic architecture remains an important part of the architectural heritage of Europe and other parts of the world.",
