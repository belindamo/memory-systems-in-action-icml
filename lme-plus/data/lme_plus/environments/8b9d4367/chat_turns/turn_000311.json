  "content": "You're welcome! I'm glad to hear you have experience with bears and know how to handle yourself in bear country. It's great that you're aware of the differences between the valley floor and the backcountry.\n\nLeaving the bear spray behind is a reasonable decision for this hike, especially since you'll be on a well-traveled trail and in a more populated area. Just remember to still be mindful of your surroundings and keep an eye out for any wildlife, including bears, even if they're less common in the valley.\n\nEnjoy your hike to Vernal Fall, and take in the stunning views of Yosemite Valley! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, have a safe and wonderful adventure!",
