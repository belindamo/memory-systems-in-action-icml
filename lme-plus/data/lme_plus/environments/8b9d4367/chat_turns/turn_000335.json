  "content": "Energy storage is a critical component of renewable energy systems that can help enhance the reliability and stability of the grid. When renewable energy sources are generating excess energy, the surplus can be stored to be used during periods of low generation or high energy demand. This is particularly useful for intermittent sources of power such as wind and solar, which generate power based on weather conditions and may not always align with energy demand.\n\nThere are several types of energy storage systems that can be used with renewable energy sources, such as batteries, pumped hydro storage, compressed air energy storage, flywheels, and thermal energy storage. Batteries are the most commonly used energy storage system due to their high efficiency, quick response time, and declining costs.\n\nRenewable energy storage systems are becoming increasingly affordable, leading to a rise in adoption across the world. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected global energy storage capacity to grow from approximately 11 GWh in 2019 to over 100 GWh by 2030, with similar projections also made by other organizations such as BloombergNEF. This expansion in storage capacity is expected to help stabilize renewable energy systems and reduce the reliance on traditional, polluting energy sources.\n\nFurthermore, energy storage systems also provide the possibility of providing power in areas where traditional grid infrastructure is absent, which would be conducive to the development of microgrids as a new type of energy delivery platform. Overall, energy storage systems offer significant potential to enhance the value and contribution of renewable energy to the energy system, as well as allow for more reliable and secure energy services.",
