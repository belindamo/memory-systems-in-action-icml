  "content": "Gothic architecture is characterized by its pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, which allowed for higher and more complex structures compared to other styles of architecture at the time. Other key features include elaborate stone carvings and sculptures, tall spires and towers, and stained glass windows.\n\nToday, Gothic architecture can be found in churches and cathedrals across Europe, such as Notre-Dame de Paris, Westminster Abbey, and Cologne Cathedral. It has also influenced the design of many buildings around the world, including some skyscrapers and universities.",
