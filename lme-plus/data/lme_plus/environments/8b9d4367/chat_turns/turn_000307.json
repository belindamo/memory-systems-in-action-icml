  "content": "The park shuttle bus is a convenient way to get to the trailhead, and starting early is a great idea.\n\nThe Yosemite Valley Shuttle Bus service typically starts running at 7:00 AM year-round, with buses departing every 10-20 minutes. However, it's always a good idea to check the park's website or the Yosemite Valley Shuttle Bus webpage for the most up-to-date information on schedules and any potential changes.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use the Yosemite National Park App, which provides real-time bus schedules and tracking information to help you plan your trip.\n\nIf you're planning to start your hike even earlier, you can consider parking your vehicle at the trailhead or using a private shuttle service. Just be aware that parking spaces can fill up quickly, especially during peak season.\n\nRemember to plan your hike according to your own pace and comfort level, and don't hesitate to ask for guidance or assistance from park rangers or visitor centers if you need it. Have a great hike!",
