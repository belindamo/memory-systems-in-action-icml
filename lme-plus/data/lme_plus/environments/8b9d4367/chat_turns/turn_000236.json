Dr. Brian Walker, a renowned ecologist and expert on resilience and adaptive cycles in ecosystems.\n2. Dr. Fikret Berkes, a marine biologist and social scientist who has studied the interaction between human systems and ecosystems, including the adaptive cycles of fishing communities.\n3. Dr. Marten Scheffer, a theoretical ecologist who has contributed to the study of early warning signals of tipping points in complex systems, including ecosystems and human systems.\n4. Dr. Elinor Ostrom, a political economist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for her work on the governance of common-pool resources, including forests, fisheries, and irrigation systems.\n5. Dr. Peter Haas, a political scientist who has studied the governance of global environmental problems, including the adaptive cycles of international regimes for managing transboundary resources.\n\nThese experts would bring a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to the discussion, including ecology, social science, economics, and political science.
