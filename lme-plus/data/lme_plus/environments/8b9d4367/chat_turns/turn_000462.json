  "content": "That's very helpful, thanks for the detailed advice. For the wooden trunk, I'll make sure to assess its condition carefully and take my time with the restoration process. I've already found a good wood conditioner and some brass hardware that matches the original style, so I'm all set on that front. \n\nRegarding the antique silverware, I've been searching online for a replacement handle, but I haven't had any luck so far. Do you know of any online marketplaces or forums where I could post an ad to find a matching handle? I've tried eBay and Craigslist, but no one seems to have what I'm looking for.",
