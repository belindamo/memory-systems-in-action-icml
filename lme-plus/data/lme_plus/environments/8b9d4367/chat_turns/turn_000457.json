Time-Blocking: Doug can use the time-blocking technique to prioritize his hobbies and interests. He can block out specific periods of time during the week or month for each hobby. This will help him focus on each hobby without feeling overwhelmed or guilty about not spending enough time on it.\n\n2. Multi-Task: Doug can multitask by combining two or more hobbies in one activity. For example, he can listen to an audiobook or podcast related to his hobbies while he's working out or traveling.\n\n3. Delegate: In case Doug feels overwhelmed, he can delegate some tasks or responsibilities related to his hobbies to others. He can ask family or friends to help him with certain tasks or even hire a professional to get some work done.\n\n4. Limit Distractions: Doug can limit distractions by controlling his environment to make it more conducive to his hobbies. For example, he can create a designated workspace, turn off his phone or email notifications during certain hours, or use noise-canceling headphones to block out external noise.\n\n5. Review Regularly: Doug can review his progress regularly to track his achievements and adjust his priorities accordingly. He can also reflect on why he's pursuing his hobbies or interests and what he wants to achieve in the long run to keep him motivated and energized.",
