  "content": "Sure, both the Panamenista Party and the Democratic Change Party (CD) have faced controversies over their policies in recent times. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Infrastructure projects: Both parties have placed a significant emphasis on large-scale infrastructure projects, such as highways, bridges, and airports. While these projects have been credited with boosting economic growth and creating jobs, there have been concerns about their environmental impact and the displacement of local communities.\n\n2. Corruption scandals: Both parties have been implicated in high profile corruption scandals. The CD's Ricardo Martinelli administration was accused of embezzlement and abuse of power, leading to his arrest in 2015. The Panamenista Party's Juan Carlos Varela administration was also implicated in the Odebrecht corruption scandal, which resulted in several high-profile arrests.\n\n3. Social policies: The Panamenista Party's recent administration led by Juan Carlos Varela was heavily criticized for not doing enough to address rising crime rates and drug trafficking. On the other hand, the Democratic Change Party's Ricardo Martinelli administration faced criticism for focusing too much on economic development and not enough on social programs.\n\n4. Labor policies: During the Martinelli administration, the CD passed labor laws that severely limited the rights and protections of workers. This led to protests and strikes by labor unions and human rights organizations.\n\nThese controversies have led to public dissatisfaction with these parties and have generated calls for political reform. However, they have also highlighted the challenges that Panama faces as it continues to work towards economic and social development.",
