Here is another revised version of the Lord's Prayer in rhyme form, based on the version in the Sermon on the Mount in the book of Matthew in the Bible:\n\nDear Father, up above,\nYour name is holy, filled with love.\nYour kingdom come, your will be done,\nOn earth as it is in heaven, won.\nGive us today our daily bread,\nAnd forgive us, as we daily plead.\nForgive us, as we forgive,\nLead us not into temptation, but help us live.\nDeliver us from evil, now and forever,\nAmen, we pray, now and forever.",
