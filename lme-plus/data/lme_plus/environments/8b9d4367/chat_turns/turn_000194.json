  "content": "**Single Wifi Point vs. 3-Pack: What's the difference?**\n\nThe main difference between the single Wifi point and the 3-pack is the number of access points (APs) you get, which affects the overall coverage and performance of your mesh network.\n\n**Single Wifi Point:**\n\n* A single Wifi point is a single device that provides Wi-Fi coverage for a smaller area (around 1,500 square feet or 140 square meters).\n* It's ideal for small to medium-sized homes, apartments, or areas with minimal obstacles (e.g., few walls, open spaces).\n* The single point is a standalone device that can be used as a single router or as part of a larger mesh network.\n\n**3-Pack:**\n\n* The 3-pack includes three Wifi points that work together to provide Wi-Fi coverage for a larger area (around 4,500 to 9,000 square feet or 420 to 840 square meters).\n* It's designed for larger homes, homes with multiple floors, or areas with more obstacles (e.g., thick walls, multiple rooms).\n* The 3-pack is a bundle of three Wifi points that are specifically designed to work together as a mesh network. They communicate with each other to provide a strong, seamless Wi-Fi experience throughout your home.\n\n**Is the 3-pack just three individual Wifi points?**\n\nWhile the 3-pack does include three individual Wifi points, it's not just a bundle of three separate devices. The points in the 3-pack are specifically designed to work together as a mesh network, which provides several benefits:\n\n* **Seamless handoff:** As you move around your home, your devices will automatically switch between the three points to ensure a strong, uninterrupted connection.\n* **Improved coverage:** The three points work together to provide a stronger signal and better coverage, reducing dead spots and weak signals.\n* **Increased capacity:** With three points, you can support more devices and more demanding applications (e.g., 4K streaming, online gaming).\n\n**Setup differences:**\n\nThe setup process for the single Wifi point and the 3-pack is similar, but there are some differences:\n\n* **Single Wifi Point:** Simply plug in the device, download the Google Wifi app, and follow the in-app instructions to set up your network.\n* **3-Pack:** You'll need to set up each Wifi point individually using the Google Wifi app, but the app will guide you through the process of connecting the points and configuring your mesh network.\n\nIn summary, the 3-pack is a bundle of three Wifi points designed to work together as a mesh network, providing better coverage, performance, and capacity than a single Wifi point. While you can use individual Wifi points to create a mesh network, the 3-pack is a more convenient and cost-effective option for larger homes or areas with more complex Wi-Fi needs.",
