However, in recent years, there has been a growing focus on sustainability in construction projects throughout Russia, including in Krasnoyarsk. The city has implemented various programs to encourage eco-friendly construction and renovation, including tax breaks for developers who use renewable energy sources and incentives for the renovation of historic buildings.\n\nIn addition, the Russian government has launched an initiative called \"Green City\" to promote sustainable urban development across the country. The initiative aims to create more environmentally friendly cities by emphasizing sustainable architecture and design, energy-efficient buildings, and green public spaces.\n\nOverall, it is likely that future architectural developments in Krasnoyarsk will continue to prioritize sustainability and eco-friendliness as new construction projects are planned and implemented.",
