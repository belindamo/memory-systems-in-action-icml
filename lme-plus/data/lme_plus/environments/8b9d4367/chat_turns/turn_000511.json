  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the most recent developments in Krasnoyarsk's architecture. However, in general, Krasnoyarsk's architectural style has been influenced by several historical periods, including the pre-revolutionary era, the Soviet era, and the contemporary era. Pre-revolutionary architecture, characterized by ornate fa\u00e7ades, curved lines, and intricate stucco decorations, can be seen in many of the city's historical buildings. Soviet-era architecture, on the other hand, is characterized by industrial and functionalist designs, which feature simple forms and minimal decoration. Finally, contemporary Krasnoyarsk architecture has been influenced by international trends in modernism and postmodernism, with an emphasis on creating transparent and open spaces. Sustainability and energy efficiency have also become increasingly important considerations in recent years.",
