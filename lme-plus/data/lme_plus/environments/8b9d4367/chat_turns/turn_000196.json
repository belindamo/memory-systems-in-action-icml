In this case, the extra cost of the 3-pack might not be justified.\n* However, if your medium-sized home has a more complex layout (e.g., multiple floors, thick walls, many rooms), the 3-pack might be a better option to ensure strong coverage throughout.\n\n**Number of devices and usage:**\n\n* If you have a large number of devices (e.g., many smartphones, laptops, smart home devices) or heavy internet usage (e.g., 4K streaming, online gaming), the 3-pack might be a better option to provide a stronger, more reliable connection.\n* If you have a smaller number of devices and moderate internet usage, a single Wifi point might be sufficient.\n\n**Future-proofing:**\n\n* If you're planning to add more devices or expand your home in the future, the 3-pack might be a better investment to ensure you have a robust mesh network that can handle increased demand.\n\n**Convenience:**\n\n* The 3-pack is a more convenient option if you want to ensure whole-home coverage without having to worry about placing individual Wifi points in specific locations.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nIf you have a medium-sized home with a relatively open layout and moderate internet usage, a single Wifi point might be sufficient. However, if you have a more complex home layout, a large number of devices, or heavy internet usage, the 3-pack might be worth the extra cost.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n* If you can get by with a single Wifi point, you'll save around $200-$230.\n* If you need the extra coverage and features of the 3-pack, the additional cost might be justified.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to assess your specific needs and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.",
