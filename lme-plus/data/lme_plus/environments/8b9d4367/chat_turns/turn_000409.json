  "content": "It's difficult to say for certain whether any of these new parties will be able to shake up the established political order in Panama. However, there are signs that suggest that change could be on the horizon.\n\nFor example, recent protests against corruption and political impunity in the wake of the Odebrecht scandal have drawn widespread support from across the political spectrum. This suggests that there is a growing demand for transparency, accountability, and honesty in politics.\n\nAdditionally, the upcoming presidential elections in 2024 will be an important battleground for these new parties. It remains to be seen whether they can compete with the established parties or whether they will remain marginalized.\n\nUltimately, the success of these new parties will depend on a range of factors, such as their ability to build a strong and sustained grassroots movement, their ability to effectively communicate their policies and ideas to the public, and their ability to mobilize resources and support. Only time will tell if they will be able to make a real impact on Panama's political landscape.",
