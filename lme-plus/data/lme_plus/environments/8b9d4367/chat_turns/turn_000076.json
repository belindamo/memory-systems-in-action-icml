You can check with your hotel, a local tourist information center, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.\n2. **Use a refillable water bottle**: Like you mentioned, bring a refillable water bottle to reduce plastic waste and save money. Make sure it's BPA-free and durable.\n3. **Avoid drinking tap water in high-risk areas**: If you're traveling to an area with questionable water quality, avoid drinking tap water altogether. Instead, opt for bottled or filtered water.\n4. **Use a water filter or purification tablets**: If you're unsure of the water quality, consider bringing a portable water filter or purification tablets. These can help remove bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants from the water.\n5. **Avoid drinking from public fountains or street vendors**: While they might look refreshing, public fountains and street vendors may not have proper sanitation and water treatment.\n6. **Check the seal on bottled water**: When buying bottled water, make sure the seal is intact and the bottle is from a reputable brand.\n7. **Avoid consuming ice**: In areas with questionable water quality, it's best to avoid consuming ice, as it may be made from tap water.\n8. **Be mindful of water-borne illnesses**: If you experience symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, or stomach cramps after drinking water, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nBy taking these precautions, you can enjoy your trip while staying safe and healthy.\n\nNow that we've covered snacks and water, are there any other essentials you'd like to discuss or any specific activities you're planning for your day trip?",
