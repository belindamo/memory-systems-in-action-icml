  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on restoring an old wooden trunk. I recently acquired it from my parents' attic and it needs some TLC. The wood is dry and cracked, and the hardware is rusty. I was thinking of applying some wood conditioner and replacing the old hardware with new brass fixtures. Do you have any experience with this kind of project? By the way, I also recently won a beautiful set of antique silverware from the 1800s at an auction, but one of the forks was missing its handle - have you come across anything like that before?",
