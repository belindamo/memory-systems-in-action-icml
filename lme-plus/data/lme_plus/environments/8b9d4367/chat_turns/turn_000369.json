  "content": "A farm that primarily raises animals and does not grow crops, but is small in size, would not generally be considered a ranch. Ranches are typically large in size, covering a significant amount of land, but the size of the land is not the only factor in determining whether a farm is a ranch or not. It is more about the primary use of the land, which is the raising of animals for meat, milk, or hide. So, a small farm that raises animals for the same purpose would be considered a ranch, even if it is not as large as most ranches.",
