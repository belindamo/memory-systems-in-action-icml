Here is a revised version of the Lord's Prayer in rhyme form, based on the version in the Sermon on the Mount in the book of Matthew in the Bible:\n\nOur Father, who art in heaven,\nHallowed be thy name, so heaven.\nThy kingdom come, thy will be done,\nOn earth as it is in heaven, so won.\nGive us this day our daily bread,\nAnd forgive us our debts, as we have said.\nAs we have forgiven those who have wronged,\nLead us not into temptation, but from evil, stay strong.\n\nAmen.",
