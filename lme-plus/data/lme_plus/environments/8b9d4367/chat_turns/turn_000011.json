I'm happy to help you with a recipe that'll transport you back to your grandma's kitchen.\n\nOld-fashioned apple pie is all about simplicity, quality ingredients, and a flaky, buttery crust. Here's a recipe that's sure to please:\n\n**Grandma-Approved Apple Pie Recipe**\n\n**Crust:**\n\n* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes\n* 1/4 cup ice-cold water\n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 6-8 medium-sized apples, peeled and sliced (Granny Smith or a mix of sweet and tart varieties work well)\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour\n* 1 tsp cinnamon\n* 1/4 tsp nutmeg\n* 1/4 tsp salt\n* 1/4 cup butter, cut into small pieces\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. Make the crust: In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the cubed butter and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work it into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the ice-cold water, stirring with a fork until the dough comes together in a ball. Divide the dough in half, shape into discs, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n3. Prepare the filling: In a separate large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Mix until the apples are evenly coated.\n4. Roll out one of the chilled dough discs to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Place it into a 9-inch pie dish, trimming the edges to fit. Fill the pie crust with the apple mixture and dot the top with the butter pieces.\n5. Roll out the second dough disc to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Use this to cover the pie and crimp the edges to seal. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.\n6. Brush the top crust with a beaten egg and sprinkle with sugar.\n7. Bake the pie for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the apples are tender.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a mix of apple varieties for a more complex flavor profile.\n* Add a splash of vanilla extract or a pinch of nutmeg to the apple mixture for extra depth.\n* Try using a food processor to make the crust, or use a pastry blender for a more rustic texture.\n* If you're feeling fancy, add a streusel topping or a crumbly oat and brown sugar mixture to the top crust before baking.\n\nThis recipe should give you a delicious, old-fashioned apple pie that's sure to transport you back to your grandma's kitchen. Happy baking!",
