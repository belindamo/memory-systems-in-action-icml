      "content": "A Field Application Engineer (FAE) is a technical specialist who works for a company that designs and manufactures complex products, such as electronic components or software systems. FAEs work directly with customers to provide technical support, troubleshoot problems, and develop solutions.\n\nThe primary role of an FAE is to help customers integrate the company's products into their own systems or products. This may involve working closely with engineers at the customer's site, providing technical training and support, and collaborating with the company's research and development teams to identify and solve technical problems.\n\nFAEs need to have strong technical knowledge and communication skills, as they often act as a liaison between customers and the company's internal teams. They must be able to understand complex technical concepts, explain them in simple terms to customers, and provide guidance and support throughout the entire product development process.\n\nFAEs typically have a background in engineering or a related technical field, and they may specialize in a particular area, such as software development, electronics design, or mechanical engineering."

      "content": "The opportunities for growth for FAEs in a startup company with less than 200 employees and a small product portfolio with no revenue would be somewhat different than those in a larger, more established company.\n\nIn a startup, the focus is often on building and growing the business, rather than on managing large teams or developing complex product lines. As a result, the opportunities for growth for FAEs may be more focused on contributing to the overall success of the company, rather than on advancing through specific career tracks.\n\nHere are a few possible growth opportunities for FAEs in a startup:\n\n1. Product development: FAEs in a startup may have the opportunity to play a key role in product development, helping to design and test new products and features. This could involve working closely with the company's founders and engineers to ensure that products meet customer needs and are technically feasible.\n2. Customer success: FAEs in a startup may also have the opportunity to work closely with customers, helping them to get the most value out of the company's products and services. This could involve providing technical support, troubleshooting issues, and developing relationships with key customers.\n3. Business development: FAEs in a startup may be able to contribute to the company's business development efforts, helping to identify new markets, partnerships, and revenue streams. This could involve conducting market research, attending industry events, and networking with potential customers and partners.\n4. Entrepreneurship: Finally, FAEs in a startup may have the opportunity to develop their own entrepreneurial skills, learning how to build and grow a successful business from the ground up. This could involve taking on leadership roles, developing new product ideas, and helping to shape the overall strategy of the company.\n\nOverall, the opportunities for growth for FAEs in a startup will depend on the specific needs and goals of the company, as well as the skills and interests of the individual FAE. However, in a startup environment, there is often more room for creativity and innovation, and FAEs may have the opportunity to make a significant impact on the company's success."
