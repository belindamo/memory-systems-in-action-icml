      "content": "According to Freudian theory, dreams are a way for the unconscious mind to express repressed desires, fears, and conflicts. Therefore, let's analyze your dream from a Freudian perspective.\n\nBeing a host on stage for your friend's wedding represents a sense of responsibility and a desire to be in control of an important event. This may reflect your need for recognition and a desire to be the center of attention.\n\nYour job of calling people out to express their blessings to the couple represents a need for validation and approval from others. This may indicate a desire to be accepted and loved by those around you.\n\nHowever, the fact that you were also busy with other things and being a bit slow on your job could indicate that you are feeling overwhelmed and unable to handle everything that is expected of you. This may be a reflection of your inner conflict between your desire to be in control and your inability to do so.\n\nThe sentence \"people can wait and enjoy themselves\" on your mind suggests that you may be unconsciously trying to convince yourself that it's okay to take a break and enjoy yourself, despite feeling overwhelmed. This may indicate a need to let go of some of the responsibilities and expectations that you have put on yourself and allow yourself to relax and have fun.\n\nOverall, your dream may be reflecting your inner conflict between your desire for recognition and control, and your need for validation and approval from others. It may also be a reminder to take a break and allow yourself to enjoy the moment, rather than being overly focused on responsibilities and expectations."
