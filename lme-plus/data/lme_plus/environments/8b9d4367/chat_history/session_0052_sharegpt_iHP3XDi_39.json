      "content": "Grifter realizes the importance of finding out more about these alien creatures and their potential threat to the world. He knows that he can't do it alone and decides to reach out to some of his contacts in the intelligence community for help.\n\nHe contacts his old friend and fellow Team 7 member, John Lynch, who now works for the International Operations (I.O.) organization. He briefs Lynch on what he has witnessed, including the fact that the creatures seemed to be able to possess human bodies and take on their appearance.\n\nLynch agrees to help Grifter investigate this new threat and brings in the resources of I.O. to aid in their efforts. They begin to scour intelligence reports and gather information from their sources to learn more about these mysterious creatures.\n\nAs they delve deeper into their investigation, they discover that these beings are part of a larger alien race that has been secretly infiltrating Earth for years, covertly taking over human bodies to further their own agenda. The creatures are incredibly difficult to detect and even harder to kill, making them a formidable and dangerous enemy.\n\nGrifter and Lynch work together to develop a plan to stop the alien infiltration and protect humanity from this new threat. They know it won't be easy, but they are committed to the mission and will do whatever it takes to save the world from this alien menace."

      "content": "It's possible that someone with extrasensory perception, such as clairvoyance or telepathy, could potentially detect the presence of extraterrestrial beings. However, such abilities are currently not scientifically proven, and individuals claiming to have them should be approached with skepticism.\n\nAlternatively, we could look into developing specialized equipment or technologies to help us identify the aliens. This could include sensors capable of detecting alien life signs, advanced imaging systems for analyzing physical characteristics, or even genetic testing to determine whether a particular individual is of extraterrestrial origin.\n\nUltimately, identifying the aliens will likely require a combination of scientific analysis, investigative work, and perhaps a bit of luck. But with a dedicated team and a systematic approach, we can increase our chances of success."

We could also look for individuals with experience in intelligence gathering, law enforcement, or military operations, as they may be able to provide strategic insights and tactics for tracking and apprehending the aliens.\n\nOther potential team members could include scientists or engineers with expertise in developing specialized equipment or technologies, as well as medical professionals who could help us analyze and understand any unique biological features or health risks associated with the aliens.\n\nUltimately, the composition of our team will depend on the specific needs of our mission and the resources available to us. We should aim to assemble a diverse and well-rounded group of individuals with a range of skills and expertise to help us achieve our goals."

He scours the internet and various forums for any mention of them, but there doesn't seem to be much information available to the public.\n\nAfter a few hours of searching, he comes across a private message board that discusses unusual occurrences and conspiracy theories. There, he finds a thread dedicated to the daemonites, and several users who claim to have encountered them in the past.\n\nCondition Red reaches out to the users privately, and after some back and forth communication, he discovers that one of them, who goes by the username \"Specter\", has extensive knowledge of the daemonites and their activities on Earth.\n\nHe shares this information with the rest of the team and suggests reaching out to Specter for more information and possibly recruiting them to our cause."
