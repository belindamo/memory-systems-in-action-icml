However, in general, Krasnoyarsk's architectural style has been influenced by several historical periods, including the pre-revolutionary era, the Soviet era, and the contemporary era. Pre-revolutionary architecture, characterized by ornate fa\u00e7ades, curved lines, and intricate stucco decorations, can be seen in many of the city's historical buildings. Soviet-era architecture, on the other hand, is characterized by industrial and functionalist designs, which feature simple forms and minimal decoration. Finally, contemporary Krasnoyarsk architecture has been influenced by international trends in modernism and postmodernism, with an emphasis on creating transparent and open spaces. Sustainability and energy efficiency have also become increasingly important considerations in recent years."

The city has implemented various programs to encourage eco-friendly construction and renovation, including tax breaks for developers who use renewable energy sources and incentives for the renovation of historic buildings.\n\nIn addition, the Russian government has launched an initiative called \"Green City\" to promote sustainable urban development across the country. The initiative aims to create more environmentally friendly cities by emphasizing sustainable architecture and design, energy-efficient buildings, and green public spaces.\n\nOverall, it is likely that future architectural developments in Krasnoyarsk will continue to prioritize sustainability and eco-friendliness as new construction projects are planned and implemented."
