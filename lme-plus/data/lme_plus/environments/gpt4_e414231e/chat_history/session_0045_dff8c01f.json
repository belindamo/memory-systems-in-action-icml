We can categorize your shoes by type, such as:\n\n1. Heels\n2. Flats\n3. Boots\n4. Sneakers\n5. Sandals\n6. Slippers\n7. Dress shoes\n8. Casual shoes\n9. Work shoes\n10. Outdoor shoes (hiking, etc.)\n\nLet's start with one category at a time. Begin by gathering all your shoes and sorting them into piles by category. Then, we can create a list of each shoe in each category.\n\nWhich category would you like to start with?"
