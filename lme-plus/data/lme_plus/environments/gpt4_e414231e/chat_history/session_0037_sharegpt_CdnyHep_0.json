The Company posted quarterly revenue of $117.2 billion, down 5 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.88.\n\u201cAs we all continue to navigate a challenging environment, we are proud to have our best lineup of products and services ever, and as always, we remain focused on the long term and are leading with our values in everything we do,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cDuring the December quarter, we achieved a major milestone and are excited to report that we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base.\u201d\n\u201cWe set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in our Services business, and in spite of a difficult macroeconomic environment and significant supply constraints, we grew total company revenue on a constant currency basis,\u201d said Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s CFO. \u201cWe generated $34 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the quarter while continuing to invest in our long-term growth plans.\u201d\nApple\u2019s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock. The dividend is payable on February 16, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 13, 2023.\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q1 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on February 2, 2023 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call. This webcast will be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.\n\nApple reported its earnings for Q1 2023 today, and it was one of the company's poorest-performing quarters in recent years. It was the company's biggest decline since 2016 and the first since 2019. Overall revenue was down more than 5 percent year over year as the company failed to match sales from the same quarter last year across most of its hardware categories.\n\niPhone revenue was $65.78 billion for the quarter, down 8.17 percent year over year. Similarly, \"Other Products\"\u2014which includes the Watch, AirPods, and some other outliers\u2014was down 8.3 percent year over year at $13.48 billion. The real underperformer was the Mac, which was down almost 30 percent at $7.74 billion.\n\nThe two parts of the business that did grow were services\u2014which include things like Apple Music and TV+, iCloud, and AppleCare\u2014and the iPad. Services were up 6.4 percent at $20.77 billion, while the iPad grew 29.66 percent to $9.4 billion.\nCEO Tim Cook said in the company's earnings call that Apple faces a \"challenging macroeconomic environment.\" Besides that, he named two other main factors behind the down quarter: production and supply issues in China and a strong US dollar. Apple struggled to meet consumer demand across many of its products, with shipping sometimes running several weeks behind. Cook said that while Apple might have met analysts' estimates had the supply issues not been a factor, it's impossible to know for sure.\n\nOn the bright side, Apple says it has resolved many of those supply problems for now and that there are now 2 billion active Apple devices in users' hands worldwide. And obviously, $117.15 billion in revenue for the quarter is still huge, even if it didn't meet expectations or match last year.\n\nApple declined to give guidance on what it expects for the next quarter. It has not done so for any quarter since the pandemic began in 2020."

Services, which includes Apple Music, TV+, iCloud, and AppleCare, grew by 6.4% to $20.77 billion, while the iPad grew by 29.66% to $9.4 billion.

They have resolved supply chain issues and are still experiencing growth in some areas. Apple did not provide guidance for the next quarter, but with their continued commitment to their long-term growth plan and their best range of products and services, it's safe to say that the company remains optimistic about the future."
