I've got some tips to help you stabilize that island and make it sturdy again.\n\n**Tightening loose screws:**\n\n1. **Identify the source:** Check the entire island, including the legs, shelves, and drawers, to find the loose screws or bolts that are causing the wobble.\n2. **Use the right tools:** Make sure you have the correct screwdriver or Allen wrench for the job. If the screws are stripped or damaged, you might need a screw extractor or a drill bit to remove them.\n3. **Tighten in sequence:** Tighten the screws in a star pattern (tightening one screw a little, then moving to the next one, and so on) to avoid putting too much pressure on one spot.\n4. **Don't overtighten:** Be careful not to overtighten, as this can damage the material or strip the screws further.\n\n**Stabilizing the island:**\n\n1. **Check the legs:** Ensure the legs are even and level. If they're adjustable, try adjusting them to see if it stabilizes the island.\n2. **Add shims or feet:** Place shims or felt pads under the legs to level the island and prevent scratching the floor.\n3. **Use anti-tip brackets:** If the island has a tendency to tip over, consider installing anti-tip brackets to prevent accidents.\n4. **Secure the shelves:** Check if the shelves are properly secured to the island's frame. Add screws or brackets if necessary to prevent them from shifting or falling.\n5. **Add weights:** If the island is still wobbly, try adding weights (like heavy objects or sandbags) to the shelves or legs to stabilize it.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Inspect the island's frame:** Check for any signs of damage, rust, or corrosion. If you find any issues, consider replacing the affected parts or seeking professional help.\n2. **Clean and lubricate:** Clean the screws, hinges, and moving parts to ensure smooth operation. Apply lubricant to any hinges or moving parts to reduce friction.\n3. **Test and adjust:** Once you've made the necessary adjustments, test the island to ensure it's stable and even. Make further adjustments as needed.\n\nRemember to work safely, and if you're not comfortable with the project, consider consulting a professional. Good luck, and I hope your kitchen island is stable and sturdy in no time!",
