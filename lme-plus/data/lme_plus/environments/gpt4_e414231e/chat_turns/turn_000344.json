This app would contain models, serializers, and views to handle the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of cases. You could also add authentication views and models to handle user authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying cases.\n\nThe `urls.py` file in the `api/v1/` directory would also need to be updated to include the URLs for the new case-related views.\n\nOverall, the file structure would now include a separate app for handling cases, along with the existing app for spinal implant identification and authentication.",
