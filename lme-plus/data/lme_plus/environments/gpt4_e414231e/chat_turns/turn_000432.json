  "content": "A charter is a legal document issued by a government or other authority that grants certain rights or privileges to an individual or organization. In the context of economic systems, a charter is often used to grant a company or organization the authority to operate within a specific area or industry.\n\nIn mercantilism, for example, a government might issue a charter to a company granting it a monopoly over trade in a certain commodity or region. This would give the company exclusive rights to trade in that commodity or region and prevent others from entering the market and competing with them. Charters might also include other rights and privileges, such as the right to self-governance or to collect taxes.\n\nThe issuing of charters is often a way for the government to exert control over the economy by granting certain privileges to certain individuals or groups, and to protect the interests of those groups by limiting competition.",
