  "content": "Let's dive deeper into radiomics.\n\nI'd like to know more about the **types of radiomics features**. Can you tell me about the different categories of radiomics features, such as intensity-based, texture-based, shape-based, and size-based features? How are these features calculated, and what are their advantages and limitations in cancer diagnosis?\n\nAdditionally, I'd love to learn more about **higher-order radiomics features**, such as those derived from fractal analysis, wavelet analysis, or machine learning-based approaches. How do these features differ from traditional radiomics features, and what insights do they provide into cancer biology?\n\nLastly, could you discuss the **importance of feature selection and engineering** in radiomics? How do researchers select the most relevant features from a large pool of radiomics features, and what techniques are used to improve the robustness and generalizability of radiomics models?\n\nThese topics will help me better understand the foundation of radiomics and its applications in cancer diagnosis.",
