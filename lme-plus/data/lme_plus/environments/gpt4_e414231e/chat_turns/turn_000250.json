Measure the width of your journal page and divide it by the number of scallops you want to use. For example, if your page is 8 inches wide and you want 8 scallops, each scallop would be approximately 1 inch apart.\n2. Mark the edge of the page with a pencil or marker at the measured intervals. This will give you a guide for placing your scallops.\n3. Begin attaching your scallops to the page, aligning them with the marks you made.\n\n**Method 2: Using a Template or Ruler**\n\n1. Create a template or use a ruler with evenly spaced marks (e.g., 1 inch or 2 cm apart).\n2. Place the template or ruler along the edge of the journal page, aligning it with the edge.\n3. Attach your scallops to the page, using the template or ruler as a guide to space them out evenly.\n\n**Method 3: Eyeballing and Adjusting**\n\n1. Begin attaching your scallops to the page, starting from one end and working your way along the edge.\n2. As you add each scallop, eyeball the spacing and adjust as needed. You can move the scallops slightly to create a more balanced look.\n3. Continue adding scallops, adjusting the spacing as you go, until you reach the end of the page.\n\n**Tips for Even Spacing:**\n\n* Use a quilling board or a ruler to help you create uniform coils and scallops, which will make it easier to space them out evenly.\n* Start with a smaller number of scallops and add more as needed, rather than trying to fit too many into a small space.\n* Don't be afraid to adjust the spacing as you go. It's better to make small adjustments along the way than to end up with a lopsided design.\n* If you're using a particularly intricate or large scallop design, you may need to adjust the spacing to accommodate the size and shape of the scallops.\n\nBy using one of these methods, you should be able to achieve a beautifully spaced scalloped edge border on your journal page. Remember to have fun and be patient \u2013 it's all part of the creative process!\n\nDo you have any other questions about spacing out scallops or need further guidance?",
