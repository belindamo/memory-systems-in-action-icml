Let me start again.\n\nTo answer your question, I don't have any other smart devices in my home that I'd like to integrate with the timer. However, I do think energy usage tracking would be a useful feature. It would be interesting to see how much energy I'm saving by using a smart timer.\n\nAs for other energy-efficient options, I've actually been considering replacing the fluorescent light in my laundry room with an LED one. The current one is really harsh and unpleasant, and I'm sure an LED one would be much more energy-efficient. Do you have any recommendations for good LED bulbs for laundry rooms?",
