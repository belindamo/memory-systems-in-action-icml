  "content": "In feudalism, those in power were typically the lords and nobles who owned the land. They intervened in the economy by controlling access to land and resources, and by setting the terms of the relationship between themselves and the peasants who worked the land. This often included setting the amount of rent or labor that the peasants had to provide in exchange for the use of the land.\n\nIn mercantilism, those in power were typically the monarchs and their government officials. They intervened in the economy by regulating trade and commerce through tariffs, quotas, and other protectionist measures. They also established monopolies, granted charters and subsidies to businesses, and regulated prices, wages and other aspects of the economy.\n\nIn socialism, those in power are the state or the community. They intervene in the economy by owning and controlling the means of production. The state plan the economy and make all the important decisions on how and what to produce, how much to produce and for whom, and how to distribute the goods and services.\n\nIn all of these systems, those in power intervened in the economy in order to maintain their own power and control over resources, and to shape the economy to serve their own interests.",
