  "content": "In some forms of Buddhism, \"emptiness\" (shunyata in Sanskrit) does not refer to a state of being, but rather to the absence of an inherent or independent existence in all things. According to this view, all things are empty of an unchanging self or essence, and they arise and exist in dependence on other things and conditions.\n\nIn this sense, emptiness is not an unchanging state, but rather an absence of inherent existence and a recognition of the interdependence and impermanence of all things. Emptiness is seen as a key insight into the nature of reality, and it is believed to help break the cycle of suffering and ignorance.\n\nSo, while some forms of Buddhism reject the idea of an unchanging self or essence, this does not mean that they view reality as an unchanging state. Instead, they see reality as dynamic and interdependent, and emphasize the impermanence and interdependence of all things.",
