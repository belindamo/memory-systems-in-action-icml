  "content": "Yes, I can certainly provide information on the fees involved in the citizenship application process and any financial assistance available for low-income immigrants.\n\nAs of 2021, the USCIS filing fee for a citizenship application (Form N-400) is $725, which includes a $640 application fee and an $85 biometric services fee. Applicants may be eligible for a fee waiver for the application and biometric services fees if they can demonstrate they are unable to pay due to financial hardship. To be considered for a fee waiver, the applicant must submit Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, along with their citizenship application.\n\nIn addition to the filing fees, there may be other costs associated with the citizenship application process, such as fees for medical examinations or translations of documents if applicable.\n\nFor low-income immigrants, there are some organizations and programs that offer financial assistance or fee waivers for citizenship applications. These organizations may also offer free or low-cost legal assistance with the application process. Some examples of such organizations include:\n\n- The International Institute of New England\n- The Latino Network\n- The Asian Pacific American Legal Center\n- The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. (CLINIC)\n- The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project (ILAP)\n\nIt is important to note that the availability of financial assistance may vary depending on the organization and the applicant's individual circumstances.",
