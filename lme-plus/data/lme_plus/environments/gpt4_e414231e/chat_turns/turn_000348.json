Case:\n\t* case\\_id (ascending)\n\t* user\\_id (ascending)\n\t* created\\_at (descending)\n\nThis schema includes three entities: User, Image, and Case. Each entity has a unique ID, as well as various required and optional attributes. Users can upload images, which are classified as either AP or lateral view and stored with their classification result. Users can also create cases, which can include one or more images and have a title and description.\n\nThe indexes are created to optimize common queries on the entities, such as retrieving a user's images or cases.",
