  "content": "What a great idea to grab a coffee before exploring the exhibit!\n\nAnd **absolutely**, it's a great idea to ask the museum staff about kid-friendly food options or snacks available at the caf\u00e9! Museums often cater to families and may have a variety of options that are suitable for kids. By asking ahead, you can:\n\n* Ensure that the caf\u00e9 has options that your niece will enjoy and that fit her dietary needs or restrictions\n* Avoid a potential meltdown or disappointment if the caf\u00e9 doesn't have anything she likes\n* Plan ahead and budget for snacks or meals that fit your needs and preferences\n\nSome questions you could ask the museum staff include:\n\n* Do you have any kid-friendly food options or snacks available at the caf\u00e9?\n* Are there any healthy snack options or meals that would be suitable for children?\n* Do you have any options that are gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan?\n* Can we bring our own snacks or food into the caf\u00e9 or exhibit areas?\n* Are there any special deals or discounts for kids' meals or snacks?\n\nBy asking these questions, you can help ensure that your niece has a positive experience at the caf\u00e9 and that you're prepared for any food-related needs that may arise during your visit.\n\nRemember, it's always better to ask ahead and plan accordingly, especially when it comes to food and kids!",
