  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on landscaping designs. I've been thinking of doing some work in my backyard to make it more functional and visually appealing. Do you have any recommendations for a patio and small garden combo that would be great for entertaining and relaxing? By the way, I just bought a new plot of land near the beach, which I plan to use to build a vacation home, so I'm also open to any beach-inspired landscaping ideas.",
