  "content": "That's a great approach! It's perfect to focus on the 6-week group course for now, and then reassess your goals and priorities after completing it. Here's why:\n\n1. **Group course foundation**: The group course will provide a solid foundation in guitar playing, covering the basics and giving you a sense of accomplishment. It's an excellent way to build your confidence and skills.\n2. **Focus on fingerstyle later**: By focusing on the group course first, you'll have a better understanding of guitar playing in general, which will make it easier to dive deeper into fingerstyle techniques later on.\n3. **Private lessons for specific goals**: Once you've completed the group course, you can identify specific areas you'd like to improve, such as fingerstyle techniques. Private lessons can then be tailored to help you achieve those goals.\n4. **No long-term commitment**: By not committing to private lessons right away, you can test the waters, so to speak, and see how you enjoy the group course. If you find that you need more personalized attention or want to focus on specific styles, you can always opt for private lessons later.\n5. **Flexibility**: This approach allows you to be flexible with your schedule and goals. You can reassess your priorities after the group course and decide whether private lessons are the right fit for you at that time.\n\nAfter completing the group course, take some time to reflect on your progress, identify areas you'd like to improve, and set specific goals for yourself. If fingerstyle guitar is still a priority, you can then explore private lessons with an instructor who specializes in fingerstyle techniques.\n\nRemember, the key is to be patient, enjoy the process, and have fun playing the guitar!",
