  "content": "**Pork Bones for Tonkotsu Ramen:**\n\nYou can definitely use pork neck bones or pork rib bones as a substitute for pork bones in Tonkotsu Ramen. In fact, these bones are often preferred because they have more collagen and marrow, which will add richness and body to your broth.\n\n**Pork Neck Bones:**\n\n* Pork neck bones have a higher ratio of collagen to meat, which makes them ideal for creating a rich, gelatinous broth.\n* They're also relatively inexpensive and easy to find at most Asian markets or butcher shops.\n\n**Pork Rib Bones:**\n\n* Pork rib bones have a good balance of meat and bone, which will add depth and complexity to your broth.\n* They're also a great option if you can't find pork neck bones or prefer a slightly meatier broth.\n\n**Other Pork Bones:**\n\n* You can also use other pork bones like pork shank bones, pork hock bones, or even a combination of different bones.\n* Just keep in mind that different bones will yield slightly different flavor profiles, so feel free to experiment and find the combination that you like best.\n\n**Carne Asada Fries:**\n\nFor Carne Asada Fries, you can definitely use other types of steak instead of flank steak. Here are some options:\n\n**Ribeye:**\n\n* Ribeye steak is a great option for Carne Asada Fries because it's tender, juicy, and packed with flavor.\n* It's also relatively easy to find and can be cooked to a nice medium-rare or medium.\n\n**Sirloin:**\n\n* Sirloin steak is another popular option for Carne Asada Fries because it's leaner than ribeye but still packed with flavor.\n* It's also relatively affordable and can be cooked to a nice medium-rare or medium.\n\n**Other Steaks:**\n\n* You can also use other steaks like strip loin, tri-tip, or even skirt steak for Carne Asada Fries.\n* Just keep in mind that different steaks will have different flavor profiles and textures, so feel free to experiment and find the one that you like best.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Regardless of the steak you choose, make sure to slice it thinly against the grain to ensure tender, easy-to-chew strips.\n* Also, don't overcook the steak, as it can become tough and dry. Aim for a nice medium-rare or medium to ensure juicy, flavorful strips.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",
