I think I'll go with the slideshow idea, it's a great way to showcase her journey and growth since she joined our family. I'll make sure to include pictures from the day she arrived, special milestones, and fun moments we've shared together. I'll also add some heartfelt captions to make it extra special. Thanks for the suggestion!",
