Applicants may request accommodations such as extra time, a sign language interpreter, or an oral interpreter if they have a physical or developmental disability that prevents them from taking the test in the usual manner. \n\nIf an applicant is unable to read or write because of an age-related disability, they may be eligible for a waiver of the history and government knowledge test. However, they must still take the English proficiency test, unless they meet the exemptions mentioned above. \n\nTo request accommodations or a waiver, the applicant must fill out the appropriate forms and provide medical documentation or other evidence to support their claim.",
