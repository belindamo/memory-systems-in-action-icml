Here are some tips to help you keep the ice cream from melting too quickly:\n\n1. **Use a Cold Serving Surface:** Place the ice cream containers on a cold surface, such as a granite or marble countertop, or even a large block of ice wrapped in a tablecloth. This will help keep the ice cream cold and slow down the melting process.\n2. **Keep it in the Shade:** If you're serving outdoors, try to keep the ice cream station in the shade, especially during peak sun hours. Direct sunlight can quickly melt the ice cream.\n3. **Use Insulated Containers:** Use insulated containers or bins with ice packs to keep the ice cream cold. You can also use large, insulated coolers with ice packs to keep the ice cream frozen.\n4. **Pre-Scoop the Ice Cream:** Consider pre-scooping the ice cream into balls or scoops and placing them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. This way, you can keep the scoops in the freezer until it's time to serve, and they'll stay frozen longer.\n5. **Use Dry Ice:** If you have access to dry ice, you can place it at the bottom of the ice cream containers or bins to keep the ice cream frozen. Just be sure to handle the dry ice safely and wear gloves when handling it.\n6. **Keep the Toppings Chilled:** Keep the toppings, such as whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and caramel, refrigerated until it's time to serve. This will help prevent them from melting or becoming too warm.\n7. **Serve in Small Portions:** Serve the ice cream in small portions to prevent the ice cream from melting quickly. This will also encourage guests to try different flavors and toppings without feeling overwhelmed.\n8. **Have a Backup Plan:** Be prepared for the unexpected! Have a backup plan in case the ice cream starts to melt too quickly, such as having a few extra containers of ice cream in the freezer or having a backup dessert option available.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your ice cream frozen and fresh for your guests to enjoy. Remember to have fun and be flexible \u2013 it's all about celebrating Lily's special day!",
