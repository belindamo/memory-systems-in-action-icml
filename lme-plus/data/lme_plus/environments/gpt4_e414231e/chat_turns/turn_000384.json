I exist solely to provide information and assist with tasks, so I don't have a current roast or any personal experiences with coffee.\n\nHowever, I'm always happy to chat about coffee and help you explore different roasts, brewing methods, and flavors! If you'd like to share more about your current roast or ask for recommendations, I'm all ears (or rather, all text).",
