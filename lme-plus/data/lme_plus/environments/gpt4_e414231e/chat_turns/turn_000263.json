  "content": "Historical materialism and dialectical materialism are both associated with the Marxist tradition of social and political thought, and are often used interchangeably. However, they refer to two distinct, yet related, concepts.\n\nHistorical materialism refers to the idea that the structure of society and its development over time are primarily determined by the mode of production, which is the way goods and services are produced and distributed.\n\nDialectical materialism, as developed by Engels, is a particular philosophical approach that seeks to understand and explain the world in terms of contradictions and conflicts, and the way these contradictions and conflicts are resolved through a process of development and transformation. Engels applied this dialectical approach to historical materialism, viewing the development of society as the result of contradictions and conflicts within the mode of production, and the resolution of these contradictions through historical change.\n\nThus, dialectical materialism can be seen as a philosophical framework that informs and underlies historical materialism, providing a way of understanding and explaining the contradictions and conflicts that drive historical change, and the resolution of these contradictions through historical development.\n\nIn this sense, dialectical materialism is a key component of historical materialism, providing a framework for understanding how historical change arises from contradictions and conflicts within society, and how these contradictions are resolved through the development of new modes of production.",
