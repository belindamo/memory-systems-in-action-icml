Start with a simple flower design, like a daisy or a cherry blossom, using quilled petals and centers.\n3. **Monogram or Initial**: Quill a decorative monogram or initial using coils and scrolls. This makes a lovely personalized gift or decoration.\n4. **Butterfly or Insect**: Create a colorful butterfly, bee, or ladybug using quilled shapes and add some wire antennae for a finishing touch.\n5. **Leafy Wreath**: Design a simple wreath using quilled leaves and vines. You can add a personalized message or a small decoration in the center.\n6. **Quilled Border**: Create a decorative border using quilled shapes, like a scalloped edge or a geometric pattern, to frame a photo, card, or journal page.\n7. **Simple Animals**: Quill a cute animal, like a cat, bird, or rabbit, using basic shapes and add some personality with eyes and a nose.\n8. **Mandala**: Design a simple mandala using quilled shapes, like coils and scrolls, in a symmetrical pattern.\n9. **Frame Decoration**: Quill a decorative frame around a small mirror, picture, or quote using coils and scrolls.\n10. **Seasonal Designs**: Create a seasonal-themed design, like a snowflake for winter, a heart for Valentine's Day, or a shamrock for St. Patrick's Day.\n\nRemember, the key to quilling is to practice, practice, practice!
