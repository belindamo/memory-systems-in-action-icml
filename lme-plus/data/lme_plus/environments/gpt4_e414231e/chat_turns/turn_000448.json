  "content": "Kudos to you for getting a head start on preparing your soil! You've already taken a great first step by tilling the soil and adding a 2-inch layer of compost. That will definitely help improve the soil's structure and fertility. Here are some additional tips to further prepare your soil for warm-season crops:\n\n1. **Check the soil pH**: Warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants prefer a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, ranging from 6.0 to 7.0. If your soil pH is too high or too low, it may affect nutrient availability and plant growth. Consider getting a soil test kit or sending a sample to a lab for analysis.\n2. **Add organic matter**: In addition to the compost you've already added, consider incorporating other organic matter like well-rotted manure, leaf mold, or green sand. These will help improve soil structure, increase water-holding capacity, and provide slow-release nutrients.\n3. **Remove debris and rocks**: Since you've already tilled the soil, make sure to remove any debris, rocks, or weed roots that may have been brought to the surface. This will help prevent damage to your crops' roots and make it easier to plant.\n4. **Level and rake the soil**: Use a rake to level the soil and create a smooth, even surface. This will help ensure good contact between the soil and your seeds or seedlings.\n5. **Create a well-draining soil**: Warm-season crops don't like waterlogged soil, so make sure your soil drains well. If your soil is heavy clay or prone to waterlogging, consider adding organic matter or perlite to improve drainage.\n6. **Warm up the soil**: Warm-season crops thrive in warm soil. You can speed up the soil warming process by using black plastic mulch or clear plastic sheeting to trap the sun's heat. This can help raise the soil temperature by 2-5\u00b0F (1-3\u00b0C).\n7. **Check for nutrient deficiencies**: Based on your soil test results, you may need to add specific nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium to optimize soil fertility for your warm-season crops.\n8. **Consider raised beds or mounds**: If your soil is heavy clay or poorly draining, consider creating raised beds or mounds to improve soil aeration and drainage.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well-prepared to plant your warm-season crops and give them the best possible start. Happy gardening!",
