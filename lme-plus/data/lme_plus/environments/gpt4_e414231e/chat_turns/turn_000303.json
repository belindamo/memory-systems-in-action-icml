What are your top three personal activities you want to prioritize in your daily routine (e.g., exercise, meditation, reading, spending time with family/friends, hobbies)?\n4. Do you have any fixed appointments or commitments during the week (e.g., classes, meetings, appointments)?\n5. Are there any specific time blocks you want to allocate for meals, relaxation, or self-care?\n6. Are there any specific goals or habits you want to incorporate into your daily routine (e.g., learning a new skill, journaling, practicing a musical instrument)?\n7. Would you prefer a more structured schedule or a flexible one with some buffer time?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a personalized daily routine that suits your needs and priorities.\n\nAlso, just to confirm, you mentioned you wake up between 8:30 am and 9:30 am on weekends.
