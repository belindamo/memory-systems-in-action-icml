Here's an example of API documentation that could be generated based on the OpenAPI schema I provided earlier:\n\nSpinal Implant Identification API\n=================================\n\nAn API for identifying spinal implants in X-ray images.\n\nAPI Endpoints\n-------------\n\n### Create a new case\n\n`POST /cases`\n\nCreate a new case and store it in the database. The request body should contain information about the case, such as the patient's name, the image file(s), and the predicted implant(s).\n\n#### Request Body\n\n* `patient_name` (string, required): The name of the patient associated with the case.\n* `image_files` (array, required): An array of X-ray image files in JPEG or PNG format.\n\n#### Response\n\n* `201 Created`: The case was created successfully.\n\n### Get all cases\n\n`GET /cases`\n\nRetrieve a list of all cases in the database. This endpoint supports pagination to limit the number of results returned in a single request.\n\n#### Query Parameters\n\n* `page` (integer, optional, default: 1): The page number to retrieve.\n* `limit` (integer, optional, default: 20): The maximum number of items to return per page.\n\n#### Response\n\n* `200 OK`: A list of cases.\n\n### Get a specific case\n\n`GET /cases/{id}`\n\nRetrieve a specific case by its ID.\n\n#### Path Parameters\n\n* `id` (integer, required): The ID of the case to retrieve.\n\n#### Response\n\n* `200 OK`: The case with the specified ID.\n\n### Update a specific case\n\n`PUT /cases/{id}`\n\nUpdate a specific case by its ID. This endpoint could be used to add notes or comments to a case, or to update the predicted implant(s) if a mistake was made.\n\n#### Path Parameters\n\n* `id` (integer, required): The ID of the case to update.\n\n#### Request Body\n\n* `notes` (string, optional): Additional notes or comments to add to the case.\n* `predicted_implants` (array, optional): The predicted implant(s) associated with the case.\n\n#### Response\n\n* `200 OK`: The updated case.\n\n### Delete a specific case\n\n`DELETE /cases/{id}`\n\nDelete a specific case by its ID.\n\n#### Path Parameters\n\n* `id` (integer, required): The ID of the case to delete.\n\n#### Response\n\n* `204 No Content`: The case was deleted successfully.\n\n### Search for cases\n\n`GET /cases/search`\n\nSearch for cases based on various criteria, such as the patient's name or the predicted implant(s). This endpoint supports filtering and sorting options to help users find the cases they are looking for.\n\n#### Query Parameters\n\n* `q` (string, optional): The search query.\n* `patient_name` (string, optional): The name of the patient associated with the case.\n* `predicted_implants` (string, optional): The predicted implant(s) associated with the case, separated by commas.\n* `sort_by` (string, optional): The field to sort the results by.\n* `sort_order` (string, optional): The sort order (asc or desc).\n\n#### Response\n\n* `200 OK`: A list of cases that match the search criteria.\n\n### Get case statistics\n\n`GET /cases/stats`\n\nRetrieve statistics about the cases in the database, such as the total number of cases, the most common implant(s), and the average time to make a prediction.\n\n#### Response\n\n* `200 OK`: Statistics about the cases in the database.",
