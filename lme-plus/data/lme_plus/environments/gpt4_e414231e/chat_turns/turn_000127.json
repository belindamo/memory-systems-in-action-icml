Now, let's tackle that frizz and unmanageability.\n\nFor wavy hair, it's common to experience frizz, especially on humid days. Here are some tips to help you combat frizz and add more manageability to your hair:\n\n1. **Condition, condition, condition!** Use a moisturizing conditioner, focusing on the ends of your hair, which tend to be the driest. Leave the conditioner on for 1-2 minutes before rinsing. You can also try a deep conditioning treatment once a week to provide an intense dose of moisture.\n2. **Use a leave-in product**: A leave-in conditioner, hair serum, or oil can help lock in moisture and reduce frizz. Look for a product containing ingredients like argan oil, coconut oil, or shea butter. Apply a small amount to the ends of your hair, working your way up to the roots.\n3. **Air-dry or diffuse**: Air-drying your hair is a great way to minimize heat damage and frizz. If you need to use a blow dryer, try using a diffuser attachment to help distribute heat evenly and enhance natural texture.\n4. **Use a humidity-fighting spray**: There are many products on the market designed to combat frizz and humidity. Look for a spray containing ingredients like silicones (e.g., dimethicone) or plant extracts (e.g., green tea). Apply the spray to damp hair before styling.\n5. **Protect your hair from heat**: When using heat styling tools, always use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage and frizz. Choose a lower heat setting and avoid holding the tool in one place for too long.\n6. **Trim regularly**: Regular trims can help reduce split ends, which can contribute to frizz and unmanageability. Try to get a trim every 6-8 weeks.\n7. **Microfiber towel or an old t-shirt**: When you get out of the shower, gently blot your hair with a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt instead of rubbing it with a regular towel. This can help reduce friction and prevent frizz.\n8. **Add a frizz-fighting ingredient to your routine**: Consider adding a small amount of frizz-fighting ingredients like argan oil, coconut oil, or beeswax to your hair before styling.\n\nSome popular hair care products that might help with frizz and unmanageability include:\n\n* Moroccanoil Frizz Fight Leave-In Conditioner\n* Bumble and bumble Hairdresser's Invisible Oil\n* Aveda Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair\n* DevaCurl Definity Shaping Cream\n* Ouidad Wave & Shine Styling Gel\n\nRemember, everyone's hair is different, so it might take some trial and error to find the right combination of products and techniques that work for you.\n\nHow do these tips sound? Are there any specific products or techniques you've tried in the past that have worked or not worked for you?",
