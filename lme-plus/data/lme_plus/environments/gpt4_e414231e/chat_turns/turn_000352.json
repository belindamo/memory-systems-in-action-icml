It's a high-end, traditional Edomae-style sushi experience with a focus on seasonal ingredients. The chef, Nozomu Abe, is a master of his craft, and the omakase (chef's selection) experience is truly exceptional.\n\n**One Ramen Recipe:**\n\nIf I had to recommend just one ramen recipe, I'd suggest trying **Tonkotsu Ramen**.
