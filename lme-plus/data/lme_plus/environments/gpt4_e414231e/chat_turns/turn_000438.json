  "content": "Yes, consumers, who are made up of citizens, are ultimately responsible in the hierarchy of consumer protection. The government is accountable to the citizens it represents, and it has a responsibility to protect their interests. Consumer unions, as organizations made up of consumers, also play a role in representing the interests of consumers and providing them with information. But ultimately, it is up to individual consumers to make informed decisions about the products and services they purchase, and to hold the government, consumer unions, and businesses accountable for their actions.\n\nConsumers have the power to vote for representatives who will promote their interests and support policies that protect them. They also have the power to make purchasing decisions that support businesses that align with their values, and to pressure businesses and government to make changes through collective action.\n\nIt's important for consumers to be informed, active, and engaged in order to ensure that their interests are protected and that they have access to safe and high-quality products and services. The government and consumer unions can play a role in providing information and advocacy, but ultimately it is the consumers who are responsible for using that information to make informed decisions and hold the government and businesses accountable.",
