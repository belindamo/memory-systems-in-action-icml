Install and configure the necessary tools and dependencies, such as PHP, Apache, MySQL, Composer, and npm.\n2. Clone your Laravel project from its repository on GitHub and install the project's dependencies using Composer and npm.\n3. Configure your web server to serve your Laravel project from the `public` directory and enable the `mod_rewrite` module.\n4. Create a new database and user for your Laravel project, and update the `.env` file in your project's root directory with the database connection settings.\n5. Run any database migrations using the `php artisan migrate` command.\n6. Add your domain name and SSL certificate to your Laravel project on DigitalOcean, and update the virtual host configuration to use the SSL certificate.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, your Laravel project should be properly configured and ready to run smoothly on your server. You can access your Laravel project in a web browser by visiting the domain name you added, and the connection will be secure thanks to the SSL certificate.\n\nPlease note that these are just general instructions and the exact steps may vary depending on your specific server environment and the tools you are using. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, you can contact DigitalOcean support for help.",
