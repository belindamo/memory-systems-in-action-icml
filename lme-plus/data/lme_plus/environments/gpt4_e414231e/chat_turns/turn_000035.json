  "content": "Missing rehearsals can be a challenge, but it's not uncommon. It's great that you had a valid reason for missing them, and you've been keeping up with your preparation for the audition.\n\nJust to put your mind at ease, missing rehearsals for a previous play shouldn't necessarily impact your chances at this audition. What's more important is how you've prepared for this specific audition and how you perform on the day.\n\nThat being said, it's essential to be honest and prepared to discuss your availability and commitment to the production if you're cast. Be prepared to explain your situation and reassure the casting team that you're committed to the project and will make up for any lost time.\n\nRemember, the audition is an opportunity to showcase your skills, passion, and dedication to the craft. Focus on what you can control, which is your preparation and performance, and don't let concerns about past rehearsals hold you back.\n\nTake a deep breath, stay focused, and go out there and give it your best shot!",
