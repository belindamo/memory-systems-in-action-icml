  "content": "\"Design a clear, minimalist tile for use as a background for a letter or other document. The tile should be simple and uncluttered, with a transparent or white background. In the foreground, a subtle, abstract design or pattern should be visible, such as a series of lines or geometric shapes. The tile should be easy to read and not distract from the main content of the document. Use a clean, modern style and a limited color palette to create a professional, polished look.\"",
