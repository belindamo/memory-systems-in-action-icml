It often satirizes prominent issues, events, and people in modern society, highlighting their flaws and shortcomings in a humorous or exaggerated manner. Because it is meant to entertain as well as inform, it has the potential to reach a wide audience, even those who are not necessarily interested in politics or social issues.\n\nParodies can be effective tools for political commentary or social criticism because they can expose the hypocrisy, absurdity, and corruption inherent in political systems and social norms. They can also point out the failings of leaders or institutions by mocking their actions, beliefs, or values.
