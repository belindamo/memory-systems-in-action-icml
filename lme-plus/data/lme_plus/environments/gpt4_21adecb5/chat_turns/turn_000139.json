By the way, I also recently volunteered at the Children's Museum for their \"Art Day\" event, where local artists set up stations for kids to create their own art pieces. I helped supervise the painting station and assisted the kids with their masterpieces. It was a lot of fun, and I got to take home one of the paintings created by a 6-year-old girl, which now hangs in my living room.",
