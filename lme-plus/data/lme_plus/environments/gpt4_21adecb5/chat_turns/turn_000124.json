  "content": "In the apartment above the settlement in Erethel, there lived a reclusive writer known as Theyla Keth. Though she went out among the people in her daily routine, donning a shawl and playing the role of an old woman to blend in, she preferred to spend most of her time alone with her robots and Richard Bot, who assisted her with her errands. She submitted her recordings to the Library branch and retreated to her home to recover from the effort.\n\nOne day, while she was at her desk, the walls shook, and she heard an aircraft landing on the roof of the mud brick apartment complex. Frustrated by the disturbance, she donned her hooded cloak and grabbed her walking stick to confront the intruder. However, when she stepped outside, she froze in shock as she saw Val Renberg standing before her, backlit by the sun.\n\nVal Renberg was not wearing her usual Co-Op flight suit or white and gold clothing, but rather plain brown leathers. Her angular face and severe hairstyle had remained the same, as had her dark green gaze and goggles pushed up onto her forehead. Theyla couldn't help but stare at her in disbelief. Val looked at her briefly and then away again, her lip quivering slightly as she spoke Theyla's name.\n\nTheyla trembled as Val took her hands and pulled her into a tight embrace. The touch of Val's hand made her heart race, and she was acutely aware of how vulnerable she was in her barefoot state. She could barely speak as Val held her, feeling her tears welling up as she breathed in Val's scent of sweat and leather.\n\nVal suggested they go inside, and Theyla led her back up the stairs to her apartment. They walked through the rooms as the evening light filled them, and Theyla showed Val the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and sitting room. Val followed her silently and nodded in understanding.\n\nWhen they sat down on the sofa in the living room, surrounded by piles of books and media, Theyla asked Val why she had come. Val revealed that she had quit DSES and cashed out her pension, staying at Novaya Waypoint while waiting for her hazard pay to cash out so she could buy a ship. She had come to see Theyla before she left.\n\nFinally, Val reached into her leather jacket and produced a small folded square of paper, setting it down on the table in front of them. It was the letter Theyla had written to Val, expressing her feelings and concerns before they had parted ways months ago. They had spent their last night together making love all night long, and Theyla had slipped the letter into Val's jacket pocket before she left, knowing she might never see her again.\n\nAs Theyla looked at the letter on the table, memories flooded her mind, and she struggled to contain her emotions. Val sat silently beside her, waiting for her to speak.",
