I don't know about the Science Museum's new dinosaur exhibit or its popularity.\n\nBut I can suggest a few things to help you plan your family outing:\n\n1. Check the Science Museum's website: You can visit the museum's website to find information about their exhibits, including the dinosaur exhibit. You can check if it's still on display, what's featured, and if there are any special events or activities related to the exhibit.\n2. Look for online reviews and articles: You can search online for reviews and articles about the exhibit to get an idea of what to expect and if it's suitable for your younger brother.\n3. Contact the Science Museum directly: You can reach out to the Science Museum's customer service or information desk to ask about the exhibit and get more information.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your younger brother will have a roaring good time at the Science Museum!",
