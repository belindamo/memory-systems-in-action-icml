They could also consider the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals to ensure alignment with global sustainability objectives.\n\nc) System Failure? Taking Account of Incentives Within Systems: In developing their strategies for overcoming challenges, the team could apply concepts from the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Tragedy of the Commons to anticipate potential incentive problems within the financial systems they aim to influence.\n\nd) Self-Regulation and Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives: The team might consider engaging with multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) and self-regulation as part of their strategy to promote financial inclusion. This approach could help demonstrate their commitment to responsible business practices and build trust with stakeholders in the region.\n\ne) Strategies for Sustainable and Profitable Investment: The team could refer to the readings and videos on sustainable business, fortune at the bottom of the pyramid, and Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan to further refine their investment strategy in Latin America and the Caribbean, ensuring the long-term sustainability and profitability of their proposed expansion.",
