  "content": "I'm thrilled to hear that! \"The Poison Tree\" is a fantastic choice, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Erin Kelly's writing is masterful, and the story is both captivating and unsettling.\n\nRemember, it's a slower-burning thriller, so be prepared to immerse yourself in the atmosphere and characters. The twists and turns might not be as fast-paced as some other thrillers, but they're no less surprising and impactful.\n\nIf you have any questions or need any more recommendations, feel free to reach out to me anytime. I'm always here to help.\n\nHappy reading, and I hope you'll enjoy \"The Poison Tree\"!",
