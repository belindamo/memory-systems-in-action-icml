  "content": "Thank you for the information!\n\nBased on what you've shared, I'll offer some potential causes and suggestions to help you address the algae bloom:\n\n**Possible causes:**\n\n1. **Excess nutrients**: With a new tank, it's common to experience an algae bloom due to the initial nutrient surge from the cycling process. This can be exacerbated by overfeeding, which can lead to excess ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels.\n2. **Insufficient biological filtration**: A 2-week-old tank might not have a fully established biological filter, which can struggle to keep up with the waste produced by the fish.\n3. **Inadequate water changes**: Infrequent or inadequate water changes can allow nutrient levels to build up, contributing to algae growth.\n4. **Lighting**: While you've adjusted the lighting, it's possible that it's still too intense or promoting algae growth.\n5. **Overcrowding**: With a mix of fish, it's possible that the bioload is too high for the tank, leading to excess waste and nutrient buildup.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Monitor and adjust feeding**: Review your feeding schedule and amount to ensure you're not overfeeding your fish. Consider reducing the frequency or amount of food to prevent excess nutrients from building up.\n2. **Increase water changes**: Perform a 25-50% water change every week to remove excess nutrients and waste products. This will help reduce the likelihood of algae growth.\n3. **Check and adjust water parameters**: Monitor your water test results to ensure ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are within safe ranges. Adjust your water change schedule accordingly.\n4. **Optimize lighting**: Consider reducing the lighting duration or intensity to prevent promoting algae growth. You can also try using a timer to create a more natural day-night cycle.\n5. **Add plants**: Live plants can help absorb excess nutrients, reducing the likelihood of algae growth. Consider adding some low-maintenance plants like Java moss or Anacharis to your tank.\n6. **Consider a algae preventative**: Products containing algae-preventing ingredients like algae-absorbing resins or beneficial bacteria can help control algae growth.\n\n**Additional questions:**\n\n* What type of food are you feeding your fish, and how often?\n* Have you tested your water parameters recently? If so, what are the results?\n* What kind of filtration system do you have, and how often do you clean or replace the media?\n* Are you using any algae-preventing products or additives in your tank?\n\nBy addressing these potential causes and implementing some of the suggested changes, you should be able to get your algae bloom under control and create a healthier environment for your fish.",
