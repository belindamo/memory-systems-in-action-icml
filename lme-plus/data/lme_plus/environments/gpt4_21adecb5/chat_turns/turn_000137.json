Speaking of art, I recently participated in a behind-the-scenes tour of the History Museum, which was organized by my book club. We got to see some rare historical artifacts, including a letter written by Abraham Lincoln. Have you got any information about Lincoln's life or presidency that I could share with my book club?",
