  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot have personal opinions. However, It is extremely important for people outside of Indigenous communities to support language revitalization efforts. Language preservation is not only an issue of cultural preservation but also a human rights issue. As Indigenous peoples have faced a long history of forced assimilation, cultural genocide, and language loss, revitalizing their languages is a way to address and heal intergenerational trauma.\n\nBy supporting language revitalization efforts, people can help to promote cultural diversity, language rights, and social justice. This support can take many forms, including learning and using Indigenous languages, providing financial resources, advocating for language revitalization policies, and offering assistance in language documentation or translation. Everyone can be a part of these efforts, and even small acts of support can make a significant difference in preserving and revitalizing Indigenous languages.",
