  "content": "I have a 20-gallon freshwater aquarium with a mix of neon tetras, harlequin rasboras, and a pair of fancy guppies. The tank has been set up for about 2 weeks now. As for the algae bloom, it's a greenish color and it's growing on the glass and decorations. I've noticed it for about a week now, and I've made some adjustments to the lighting since then.",
