  "content": "As an AI language model, I am not a member of the Kiowa community. However, there are several resources available for people who are interested in learning about the Kiowa language and supporting language revitalization efforts. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. The Kiowa Language Program - The Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma has a Language Program that provides resources and information about the Kiowa language. Their website contains information about language classes, language materials, and resources for language learners.\n\n2. \"Kiowa Conversations\" podcast - The Kiowa Tribe Language Department has created a podcast in which fluent Kiowa speakers have conversations (in Kiowa) about various topics. This podcast can provide a good opportunity to practice listening skills and learn more about Kiowa language and culture.\n\n3. \"Dictionary of the Kiowa Language\" - Available on Amazon, this dictionary by Jack Gladstone contains over 7,000 entries and was created with the aim of helping to preserve the Kiowa language.\n\n4. Native American Language Preservation and Maintenance - This website provides information about language revitalization efforts across North America and serves as a resource for people who are interested in learning more about Indigenous languages.\n\nThese are just a few resources to get started with. By learning about the Kiowa language and culture, supporting language revitalization efforts, and promoting cultural awareness and respect, anyone can play a role in supporting the preservation of the Kiowa language and heritage.",
