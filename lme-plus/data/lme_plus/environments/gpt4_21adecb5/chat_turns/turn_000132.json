I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time information about specific museums or their exhibits.\n\nBut I can suggest a few things to help you plan your visit:\n\n1. Check the Natural History Museum's website: You can visit the museum's website to find information about the exhibit, including the number of artifacts on display, special features, and any notable pieces.\n2. Look for online reviews and articles: You can search online for reviews and articles about the exhibit to get an idea of what to expect and what not to miss.\n3. Contact the museum directly: You can reach out to the museum's customer service or information desk to ask about the exhibit and get more information.\n\nAs for your visit to the \"Impressionist Masters\" exhibit at the City Art Museum, I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it! However, I should let you know that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal interactions or memories, so I didn't know you visited the exhibit or that you have a colleague named Rachel.\n\nFeel free to ask me any general questions about museums, art, or history, and I'll do my best to help!",
