Flake food can be rich in nutrients, which can contribute to algae growth. Consider monitoring your fish's consumption and adjusting the amount accordingly.\n* Supplementing with frozen brine shrimp and bloodworms is excellent for providing variety and nutrients. Just be mindful of the frequency and amount to avoid overfeeding.\n\n**Water testing:**\n\n* It's great that you plan on testing your water parameters soon! This will give you a better understanding of your tank's water chemistry and help you identify potential issues. Make sure to test for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, and temperature.\n* Consider investing in a water test kit that includes a nitrate test, as high nitrate levels can contribute to algae growth.\n\n**Filter maintenance:**\n\n* Cleaning your filter every 2 weeks is a good start, but you might need to clean it more frequently, depending on the type of filter and the bioload of your tank. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for maintenance and replacement of filter media.\n\n**Algae prevention:**\n\n* Since you're not using any algae-preventing products, you might consider adding some to your routine. Beneficial bacteria supplements can help maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in your tank, which can aid in controlling algae growth.\n* You could also consider adding some algae-absorbing materials, like activated carbon or phosphate-absorbing pads, to your filter to help control nutrient levels.\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n* Consider adding some fast-growing plants, like hornwort or water wisteria, to your tank. These can help absorb excess nutrients and reduce algae growth.\n* Make sure your tank is not getting too much direct sunlight, as this can contribute to algae growth. If possible, try to position your tank in a spot with indirect sunlight or use a timer to control the lighting duration.\n* Keep an eye on your tank's decorations and accessories, as some can harbor algae. Regularly clean or replace them as needed to prevent algae growth.\n\nBy addressing these areas and making some adjustments, you should be able to get your algae bloom under control and create a healthier environment for your fish.\n\nRemember to monitor your tank's progress and make adjustments as needed. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
