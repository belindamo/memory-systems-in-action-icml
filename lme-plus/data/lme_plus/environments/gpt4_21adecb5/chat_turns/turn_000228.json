  "content": "I do not have access to current up-to-date research or reports about the effectiveness of airbnb's measures to reduce discrimination on their platform. however, i can provide some insight into previous research on the topic.\n\na 2014 harvard business school study found that users with distinctively african american names were less likely to be accepted by hosts for rental requests than users with stereotypically white names. in response, airbnb introduced its non-discrimination policy and has since updated it to include more stringent penalties for violating the policy. \n\na 2016 report by the harvard business review found that the non-discrimination policy had reduced bias among some hosts, although it did not completely eliminate it. \n\nanother 2018 study by researchers at northeastern university found that there were still disparities in accommodation prices for guests with african american-sounding names, despite the non-discrimination policy.\n\nwhile there is evidence that airbnb's measures have had some impact in reducing discrimination, more research is needed to fully understand their effectiveness.",
