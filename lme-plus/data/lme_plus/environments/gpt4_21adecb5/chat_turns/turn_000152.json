However, I can guide you on how to find the information you're looking for.\n\nBased on our previous conversation, I assume you're looking at the website [www.modernartmuseum.org](http://www.modernartmuseum.org). Here's what you can do:\n\n1. Go to the website and navigate to the \"Events\" or \"Programs\" section (as I mentioned earlier).\n2. Look for a filter or sorting option to narrow down the events by type, such as \"Lectures\", \"Workshops\", \"Artist Talks\", or \"Exhibition-related events\".\n3. Check the event descriptions and dates to see if any of the upcoming events are related to the contemporary art exhibit you saw last Saturday.\n4. You can also try searching for keywords like \"contemporary art lecture\", \"artist talk\", \"workshop\", or \"exhibit-related event\" on the website's search bar.\n\nIf you're unable to find the information on the website, you can try:\n\n1. Contacting the museum directly via phone or email to ask about upcoming events related to the exhibit.\n2. Following the museum's social media accounts (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) to see if they post about upcoming events or programs.\n3. Signing up for the museum's newsletter or email list to receive updates on upcoming events and exhibitions.\n\nI hope this helps you find the lecture or workshop you're interested in!",
