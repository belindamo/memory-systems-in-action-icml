  "content": "I do not have access to current up-to-date information about whether there have been cases of discrimination on airbnb despite the company's policy and penalties. however, based on my previous training data, there have been reported cases of discrimination on airbnb in the past. these incidents suggest that discrimination can still occur on the platform, despite airbnb's efforts to combat it.\n\nfor example, in 2019, a harvard business school study found that discrimination against guests with african american sounding names persists on airbnb. in another incident in 2020, a black airbnb guest in seattle recorded an altercation with the host, who reportedly used racial slurs and demanded that the guest leave their property.\n\nairbnb has stated that they take reports of discrimination very seriously and will investigate claims. the company has taken action against hosts found to be engaging in discriminatory behavior, including permanently banning them from the platform.\n\nwhile airbnb has made significant efforts to address discrimination on its platform, incidents like these show that eliminating discrimination requires ongoing attention and action.",
