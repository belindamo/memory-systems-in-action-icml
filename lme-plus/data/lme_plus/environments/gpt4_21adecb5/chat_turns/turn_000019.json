You can choose from several rental companies that offer a range of vehicles, including campers and 4x4s for off-road adventures. However, make sure you are familiar with driving in Iceland, as the weather and road conditions can be challenging.\n- Taking tours is another great way to explore Iceland's natural wonders, especially if you want to learn more about the places you are visiting. There are many tour companies that offer day trips, guided tours, and multi-day excursions to different parts of the country.\n- If you're on a budget, consider camping or staying in hostels instead of hotels, as accommodation in Iceland can be expensive. Be sure to make reservations in advance, especially during peak tourist season.\n- Pack light and dress in layers, as the weather in Iceland can change quickly and drastically. Bring waterproof and windproof clothing, sturdy hiking shoes, and a hat and gloves.\n- Plan your itinerary in advance and try to avoid overbooking yourself. Leave time for relaxation and spontaneity, as some of Iceland's most beautiful and unexpected sights can be found off the beaten path.\n- Finally, respect Iceland's natural environment and be mindful of the country's delicate ecosystems.
