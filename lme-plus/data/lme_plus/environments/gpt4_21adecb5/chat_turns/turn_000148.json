However, I can guide you on how to find the exhibition schedule on the museum's website.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1. Open a web browser and type in [www.modernartmuseum.org](http://www.modernartmuseum.org) (or the URL listed on the brochure).\n2. Once you're on the website, look for a navigation menu or a section that says \"Exhibitions\", \"Events\", \"Calendar\", or something similar.\n3. Click on that section, and you should see a list of current and upcoming exhibitions, along with their dates and descriptions.\n4. You can also try searching for \"exhibition schedule\" or \"upcoming exhibitions\" in the website's search bar to find the information you're looking for.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding the exhibition schedule, you can also try contacting the museum directly through their website or social media channels. They should be able to provide you with the information you need.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find the exhibition schedule you're looking for!",
