  "content": "I would rate the candidate's need for external support at a 70. The candidate mentions that they rely on their friends and mentors for enjoyment and support in both their personal and professional life. They also mention that a mentor, Adam Day, was a \"rock\" for them in a high-pressure environment and someone who helped ground and remind them to have fun. This suggests that the candidate values and seeks out support from others. However, it also suggests that they may struggle to be self-reliant and perform at their best without the support of others.",
