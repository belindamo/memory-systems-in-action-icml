That's a great way to multitask.\n\nGiven your interest in audiobooks, I think some of the recommendations I provided earlier would translate well to the audio format. Here are a few that I think would be a good fit:\n\n1. **\"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn**: The audiobook is narrated by Julia Whelan and Kirby Heyborne, and it's an excellent production. The dual narration adds to the suspense and intrigue, making it a great fit for an audiobook.\n2. **\"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins**: The audiobook is narrated by Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey, and India Fisher, and it's a well-produced, engaging listen. The multiple narrators help to bring the different characters to life.\n3. **\"The Couple Next Door\" by Shari Lapena**: The audiobook is narrated by Luke Daniels, and it's a quick, easy listen. Daniels' narration keeps the pace fast and engaging, making it perfect for a jog or commute.\n4. **\"The Last Mrs. Parrish\" by Liv Constantine**: The audiobook is narrated by Julia Whelan, and it's a great fit for the format. Whelan's narration adds to the suspense and intrigue, making it a compelling listen.\n\nThese audiobooks are all well-produced, engaging, and easy to follow, even during a jog. However, if you're looking for something a bit more complex, like \"Sapiens\", you might want to try:\n\n1. **\"The Devil in the White City\" by Erik Larson**: The audiobook is narrated by Scott Brick, and it's an excellent production. Brick's narration is engaging, and the book's well-researched historical content translates well to the audio format.\n\nKeep in mind that audiobook preferences are highly personal, so you might want to check out samples or reviews to ensure the narration style and pace work for you.\n\nEnjoy your jog and your next audiobook adventure!",
