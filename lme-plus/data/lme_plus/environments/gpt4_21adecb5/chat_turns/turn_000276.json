Here are some insights based on various studies and Facebook's own recommendations:\n\n**Best times to go live on Facebook:**\n\n1. **Afternoon delight**: Just like you've observed, afternoons tend to be a sweet spot for Facebook Live engagement. Specifically, 12 pm - 3 pm EST ( Eastern Standard Time) seems to be a popular time slot. This might be because people are taking a break from work or school, and their lunch breaks coincide with this time frame.\n2. **Peak hours**: Facebook's own research suggests that peak hours for Facebook Live are between 12 pm - 4 pm EST, with a slight dip around 2 pm. This is likely due to the natural lull in engagement during the mid-afternoon slump.\n3. **Early evening**: 5 pm - 7 pm EST is another popular time slot, as people are wrapping up their workday and starting to unwind before dinner.\n4. **Weekdays**: Facebook Live engagement tends to be higher on weekdays (Monday to Thursday) compared to weekends. This might be because people are more likely to be active on Facebook during their lunch breaks or after work.\n5. **Avoid rush hour**: Try to avoid going live during rush hour (7 am - 9 am EST and 4 pm - 6 pm EST), as people are typically commuting or in transit during these times.\n\n**Additional factors to consider:**\n\n1. **Your audience's time zone**: If your target audience is primarily located in a specific time zone, consider scheduling your live sessions accordingly.\n2. **Your content's relevance**: If your content is more relevant to a specific time of day (e.g., a morning motivational session or an evening relaxation routine), schedule your live session accordingly.\n3. **Consistency**: Stick to a consistent schedule to build anticipation and expectation from your audience.\n4. **Experiment and adjust**: Analyze your Facebook Insights to determine which times work best for your specific audience and adjust your schedule accordingly.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and the best time to go live on Facebook ultimately depends on your unique audience and their preferences. Continue to experiment and adjust your schedule based on your engagement metrics and audience feedback.",
