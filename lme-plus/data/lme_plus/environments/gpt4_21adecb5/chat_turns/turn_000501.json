  "content": "I've been reading a lot lately, actually. Before \"The Silent Patient\", I read \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah, which took me around 3 weeks to complete. It's a historical fiction novel, but I think that's what made \"The Silent Patient\" such a quick read for me. I was really in the mood for a fast-paced thriller after that. Do you think any of these recommendations would be similar in terms of pacing?",
