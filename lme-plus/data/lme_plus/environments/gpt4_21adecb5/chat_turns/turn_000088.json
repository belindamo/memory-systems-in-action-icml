  "content": "Part 29 those issues it considered to be material. The Tribunal dealt with the 19 July 2017 letter as one part of a course of conduct (which included the builder\u2019s correspondence) that led the Tribunal to conclude that there was an agreement between the parties. Furthermore, we note that in its post-hearing submissions the builder did not specifically cite Butler v Fairclough. Rather, it cited Haller, which the Tribunal in turn cited at [20] of the Reasons. The Tribunal was not obliged to give any more detailed reasons than were provided.\nGrounds 6 and 7 - Completion date\nThe issues to be considered in respect of these grounds are whether the Tribunal made an error of law in finding that the completion date of the works undertaken pursuant to the parties\u2019 2009 contract was 20 October 2010 (Ground 6). This ground involves the proper construction of the contract, which is a question of law. Leave to appeal is not required in respect of Ground 6.\nThe issue in Ground 7 is whether leave to appeal should be granted on the basis that the Tribunal\u2019s finding concerning the completion date was against the weight of evidence.\nTribunal\u2019s finding\nIn relation to completion date, the Tribunal stated:\nThe owners argued that practical completion under the original contract took place on 20 October 2010 when the FOC issued. I agree respectfully with the thrust of the owners' submission in this respect. The \"building works\" as defined in cl 1.1 of the original contract meant \"the building works to be carried out, completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations\" (emphasis added), \"contract documents\" meant the general and special conditions and the plans, the specifications and other documents specified in Item 14 of Schedule 1, Sch 1 headed \"Particulars of Contracts\" was part of the contract, Sch 1 para 11 said that the builder was the person to obtain and pay for all planning and building approvals (which was the default position if a party was not, unlike here, expressly named), clause 7.1 said that the party named in item 11 must obtain and pay for all building and planning approvals, which necessarily included them in the contract price, the FOC is a planning and building approval because it approves lawful occupation on the basis of conformity of the physical structure with preceding approvals, and cll 26.2(c) to 26.7 with cl 15 required the final progress claim out of the contract price to be demanded and paid on, and only on, practical completion.\nMoreover, as a further but not necessary supporting basis for the conclusion, the first emphasised words in the definition of \"building works\" indicate that the physical works are of no use to the owner to possess, even if physical possession of them is given by giving of keys, unless they are legally approved for occupation by the owner. This last point is reinforced by the definition in cl 1.1 of \"practical completion\" which focuses on completeness except for matters not preventing use for usual purpose; such use cannot be present without the approval to occupy.\nFinally, and as a further but not necessary supporting argument, the second emphasised words in the definition of \"building works\" arguably cover the written variation to the original contract constituted by the terms of the builder's letter, although I note that I have \nPlease write in English language.",
