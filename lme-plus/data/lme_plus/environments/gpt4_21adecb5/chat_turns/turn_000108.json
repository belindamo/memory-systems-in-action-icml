  "content": "Thank you for this qualitative analysis of 13 factors impacting the price of insuring a vehicle. Please give some rough estimate of quantitative impact as best as you can.\nTaking 100 as a base price when all the most favorable values (from the range I provided for each factor) are satisfied, so as to get the cheapest possible price, please successfully assume a different value for a single of the 13 parameters at a time which is the worst in the range I have provided, for each of the parameters and estimate how the price might increase due to that factor not having the ideal value. For example everything else being optimal, except the age of the driver being is 32 instead of 48, if that impacts the cost of insurance by an additional 50%, give me 150 instead of 100 as the alternative less favorable pricing due to non optimal age.",
