  "content": "Certainly! Here are a few other examples of books that effectively use foreshadowing:\n\n1. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee: Foreshadowing is used throughout the novel to create a sense of tension and anticipation. For example, the reclusive Boo Radley is repeatedly mentioned, creating an air of mystery around his character and building towards his eventual appearance.\n\n2. \"Jane Eyre\" by Charlotte Bronte: The novel uses foreshadowing to create a sense of impending danger and foreboding. For example, the foreboding atmosphere of the novel is set early on when Jane first sees a ghost-like figure in the red room.\n\n3. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" by Edgar Allan Poe: This short story is a classic example of how foreshadowing can be used to build suspense. The narrator's increasingly erratic behavior and obsession with the old man's eye create a sense of dread and anticipation in the reader.\n\n4. \"The Hunger Games\" by Suzanne Collins: The novel uses foreshadowing to establish the brutal nature of the games and to hint at the dangers that await the characters. For example, the reapings and the violence of the games are foreshadowed in the early chapters of the book.\n\nThese are just a few examples of books that effectively use foreshadowing to enhance their narratives. There are surely many more out there to discover!",
