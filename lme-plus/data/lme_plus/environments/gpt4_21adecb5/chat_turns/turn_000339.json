John Doe is a fictional character often used as a placeholder in examples, and it's not a real person.\n\nIt's possible that the book you're thinking of is actually written by a different author, or the title is similar but not exactly the same.\n\nIf you can provide me with more details about the book, such as:\n\n* The publisher\n* The publication date\n* Any distinctive features or chapters you remember\n* The course or professor you used the book for\n\nI can try to help you identify the actual book and author. Alternatively, you can also try searching online or checking your university's library catalog to see if you can find the book.\n\nRemember, it's always important to verify the credibility and accuracy of sources, especially in academic research.",
