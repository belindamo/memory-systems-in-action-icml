Do you know the exact dates or at least a rough idea of when you'll be traveling? This will help us block out time in your schedule.\n2. **Cleaning out your email inbox:** How much time do you think this task will take? Is it something you can tackle in one sitting, or would you prefer to break it down into smaller chunks?\n\nAdditionally, do you have any other tasks, appointments, or commitments that you need to fit into your schedule for the week? Work projects, social engagements, exercise routines, or anything else?\n\nOnce we have a better idea of what needs to be done, we can start allocating time slots and creating a schedule that works for you!",
