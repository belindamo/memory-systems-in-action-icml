  "content": "I got my mom a new stand mixer, a set of pots and pans, and a kitchen utensil set from Bed Bath & Beyond. The mixer was on sale for $150, and the pots and pans were buy one get one 50% off, so I ended up saving around $100. \n\nFor my best friend's baby shower, I got her a set of adorable baby clothes, a baby blanket, and a personalized baby book from Amazon.
