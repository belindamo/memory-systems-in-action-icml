  "content": "Icelanders are raised in a harsh climate and have tailored their way of life to cope with the extreme weather conditions. They use various techniques like building houses with insulated walls and roofs to keep heat inside, and also equip them with wind deflectors so that the snow doesn't accumulate on the roof. The majority of the population has access to geothermal heat to keep their homes warm and electricity to power them. Additionally, Iceland has a well-developed infrastructure that ensures power outages are rare, and if they do occur, they are fixed quickly. Emergency services like search and rescue teams are also trained to respond to extreme conditions, such as volcanic eruptions, avalanches, or flash floods, which can happen in Iceland. Overall, while Iceland's weather can be challenging, the country is well-prepared to tackle it.",
