  "content": "Part 29:\n\nGrounds 6 and 7 concern the completion date of the works carried out under the parties' 2009 contract. In Ground 6, the issue is whether the Tribunal erred in finding that the completion date was 20 October 2010, while Ground 7 is about whether leave to appeal should be granted on the basis that the Tribunal's finding was against the weight of evidence.\n\nThe Tribunal found that practical completion of the building works took place on 20 October 2010 when the Final Occupation Certificate (FOC) was issued. The Tribunal relied on the definition of \"building works\" in the contract, which included \"completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations.\" The Tribunal also noted that the FOC was a planning and building approval that allowed lawful occupation of the building and that the contract required the final progress claim to be paid only on practical completion.\n\nIn relation to Ground 6, the Tribunal's conclusion about the completion date is a question of law, and leave to appeal is not required. As for Ground 7, the builder argues that the Tribunal's finding about the completion date was against the weight of evidence. However, the reasons provided by the Tribunal for its finding indicate that it properly considered the evidence, and the builder has not identified any errors in the Tribunal's approach. Therefore, we are not satisfied that Ground 7 is established.",
