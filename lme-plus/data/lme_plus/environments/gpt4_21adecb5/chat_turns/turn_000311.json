  "content": "If you're looking for shows with a similar atmosphere and focus on characters, but with a more light-hearted tone, I'd recommend the following:\n\n**Locke & Key** (Netflix)\n\n**Plot:** Based on the comic book series, Locke & Key follows the Locke family as they move back to their ancestral home, Keyhouse, after their father's murder. They soon discover that the house has magical keys that grant them incredible powers, but they're not the only ones searching for them.\n\n**Tone:** Locke & Key has a similar blend of mystery, adventure, and supernatural elements as Stranger Things, but with a more light-hearted tone. It's a family-friendly show that explores themes of grief, family, and self-discovery.\n\n**Seasons:** 2 seasons are currently available on Netflix, with a total of 20 episodes.\n\n**The Society** (Netflix)\n\n**Plot:** When a group of high school students returns from a cancelled school trip, they find their town empty and their families gone. They must work together to uncover the truth behind the disappearance and create a new society.\n\n**Tone:** The Society has a similar small-town, mysterious atmosphere as Stranger Things, but with a more teen-focused, light-hearted tone. It explores themes of identity, community, and social hierarchy.\n\n**Seasons:** 1 season is currently available on Netflix, with a total of 10 episodes.\n\n**The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina** (Netflix)\n\n**Plot:** Based on the Archie Comics character, Sabrina Spellman must navigate her half-witch, half-mortal heritage in the dark and mystical town of Greendale.\n\n**Tone:** CAOS has a similar blend of supernatural mystery and coming-of-age themes as Stranger Things, but with a more campy, light-hearted tone. It's a fun, satirical take on the teen horror genre.\n\n**Seasons:** 4 seasons (Parts 1-4) are currently available on Netflix, with a total of 36 episodes.\n\nThese shows all have a strong focus on characters and atmosphere, with a more light-hearted tone than The Haunting of Hill House and The OA. They're perfect for fans of Stranger Things who want to explore similar themes and genres without getting too dark or intense.",
