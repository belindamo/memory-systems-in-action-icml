You can find baskets and items at a local grocery store or online. ($10-20)\n3. **Fun desk accessory**: A cute paperweight, a funky mousepad, or a colorful sticky note holder can brighten up their new workspace.

      "content": "What a thoughtful neighbor you are! Getting a gift for your neighbor during her recovery is a wonderful gesture. Your ideas are great, but I have a few more suggestions to consider:\n\n1. **Cozy throw blanket**: Excellent choice! A soft, plush blanket can be very comforting during recovery. Consider a lightweight, easy-to-care-for material like fleece, Sherpa, or faux fur.\n2. **Scented candles**: Another great idea! Soothing scents like lavender, vanilla, or eucalyptus can promote relaxation and reduce stress. Just ensure the candles are safe for her to use while recovering.\n3. **Comfort foods**: A care package with comforting, easy-to-digest foods like soups, teas, or baked goods can be a lovely gesture. Consider her dietary restrictions and preferences, though.\n4. **Pampering gift basket**: Create a basket with items like luxurious bath bombs, scented soaps, face masks, or a good book to help her unwind and relax.\n5. **Practical help**: Offer to help with errands, grocery shopping, or dog walking (if she has a pet). Sometimes, practical assistance can be the most comforting gift of all.\n6. **Flower or plant arrangement**: A beautiful bouquet or a low-maintenance plant like a succulent can brighten up her space and lift her spirits.\n7. **Magazine or book subscription**: A subscription to a magazine or a new book can provide entertainment and mental stimulation during her recovery.\n8. **Personal care items**: A set of comfortable, cozy pajamas, a soft eye mask, or a set of scented lotions can be very practical and comforting.\n9. **Meal delivery**: Consider gifting her a meal delivery service or a gift card to her favorite restaurant, so she can enjoy a break from cooking.\n10. **Get well card**: A heartfelt, handwritten card expressing your well-wishes and support can mean a lot to your neighbor during her recovery.\n\nRemember to consider your neighbor's personal preferences, allergies, and recovery needs when choosing a gift. A thoughtful and caring gesture can go a long way in helping her feel more comfortable and supported during her recovery."
