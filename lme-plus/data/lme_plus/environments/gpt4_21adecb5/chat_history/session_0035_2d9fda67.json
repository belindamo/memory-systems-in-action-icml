      "content": "Don't worry about skipping a few runs due to the rain! It's completely understandable, and safety should always be your top priority.\n\nRunning in the rain can be challenging, and it's great that you're being cautious.

Use the rainy days as an opportunity to rest and recover, and you'll come back stronger for your next run.\n\nWhen the rain clears up, you can get back out there and crush your runs! Remember to stay flexible, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a few sessions. Consistency is key, but it's also important to prioritize your safety and well-being."
