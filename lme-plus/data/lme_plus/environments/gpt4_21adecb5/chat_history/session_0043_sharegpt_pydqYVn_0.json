      "content": "There is no precise moment at which a human becomes a human being. Human development begins at fertilization, when a sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote, which is the first stage in the development of a new individual. From the zygote stage, the developing individual goes through several stages of growth and development, including the embryonic stage and the fetal stage, before being born as a newborn baby.\n\nIn many countries, the law regards a fetus as a human being with certain rights, such as the right to life, from the moment of conception. However, the point at which a fetus is considered a \"person\" or a \"human being\" with full moral and legal status can vary depending on cultural, religious, and philosophical beliefs. Some people believe that personhood begins at the moment of conception, while others believe it begins at birth or at some point later in development."
