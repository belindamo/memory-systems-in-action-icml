By the way, speaking of markets, I'm reminded of the amazing brunch spot I went to in NYC with my friends a few weeks ago, Russ & Daughters Cafe on the Lower East Side. Have you heard of it?"

      "content": "Russ & Daughters Cafe is a legendary spot! I've heard great things about their Jewish deli-inspired dishes and classic New York-style bagels with lox and cream cheese. It's wonderful that you have fond memories of brunching with your friends there.\n\nNow, back to Tsukiji! Yes, you're correct that the inner fish market, where the famous tuna auction took place, has moved to a new location called Toyosu Market. However, the outer market, which is what most tourists visit, remains at the original site and is still a fantastic place to explore.\n\nThe Tsukiji Outer Market offers a unique experience, with its narrow alleys, bustling atmosphere, and endless food options. You can still find fresh sushi, seafood, and Japanese street food, as well as souvenirs and kitchenware. It's a great place to immerse yourself in Tokyo's food culture and take in the sights and sounds.\n\nWhile you won't be able to see the tuna auction at Tsukiji, you can still experience the energy of the market and enjoy some of the freshest seafood in the city. And, who knows, you might even discover some new favorite dishes or snacks to take back to your friends in NYC!\n\nBy the way, have you considered visiting the Toyosu Market as well? It's a bit more modern and sleek compared to Tsukiji, but it's still a fascinating place to see the fish auction and learn about Tokyo's seafood industry. Just keep in mind that it's a bit farther from central Tokyo, so you'll need to plan your trip accordingly."
