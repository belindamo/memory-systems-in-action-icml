One of my favorite libraries is ggplot2 - I love how easy it is to create visually appealing plots. I've been using it to create some really helpful graphs for my thesis. Speaking of my thesis, I was wondering if you could help me find some information on research methods in social sciences. I remember reading a book on the topic last semester, but I can't seem to find my notes."
