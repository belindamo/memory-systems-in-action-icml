      "content": "What a great idea! Garlic powder is a fantastic addition to the Herby Parmesan Popcorn recipe. It will add a savory, aromatic flavor that complements the herbs and Parmesan cheese perfectly.\n\n**Garlic Powder Variation:**\n\n Simply add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the herb mixture (depending on your personal taste preferences) and mix well. Then, proceed with the recipe as instructed.\n\nHere's the updated herb mixture:\n\n* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley\n* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil\n* 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n* Salt, to taste (optional)\n\nMix the garlic powder with the Parmesan cheese, parsley, and basil, and then toss with the popped popcorn and olive oil.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Start with a small amount of garlic powder (1/4 teaspoon) and adjust to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess garlic flavor.\n* If you're using a strong garlic powder, you might want to start with an even smaller amount to avoid overpowering the other flavors.\n* Consider using a roasted garlic powder for a deeper, nuttier flavor.\n\nThe garlic powder will add a rich, savory flavor to the popcorn without overpowering the herbs and cheese.
