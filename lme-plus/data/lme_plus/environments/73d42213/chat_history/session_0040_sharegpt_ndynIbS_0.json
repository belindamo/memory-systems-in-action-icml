In the Cullavagga, the Buddha is recorded as having forbidden monks from giving food to naked ascetics who do not observe the proper codes of conduct for ascetics. The Buddha taught that such naked ascetics were not worthy of respect or support, and that monks should not associate with them."

He lived in ancient India during the time of the Buddha and was widely revered for his charitable acts and his generosity to both the Buddha and the monastic community.\n\nIt is said that Dabba the Mallian had the power of giving, which is considered a rare and precious quality in Buddhist teachings. He was able to share his wealth and resources with others freely and without hesitation, and he inspired others to follow his example. The Buddha praised Dabba the Mallian as an exemplar of the lay follower who lived a virtuous and generous life, and he is remembered in Buddhist tradition as a model of generosity and kindness."

      "content": "how about in that sutta where he was distributing lodgings ?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In Buddhist literature, there is a sutta known as the \"Dabba Mallaputta Sutta\" where Dabba the Mallian is described as having the power to provide lodgings for the monastic community. According to the sutta, Dabba the Mallian had the ability to perceive the needs of the monastics and was able to provide them with suitable lodgings, even in cases where it seemed impossible to do so.\n\nIn this sutta, Dabba the Mallian is portrayed as a lay devotee of great generosity and kindness, who used his wealth and resources to support the Buddha and the monastic community. The sutta serves as a teaching on the importance of generosity and the power of giving, and it is remembered in Buddhist tradition as an example of how lay followers can live a virtuous and meaningful life."

      "content": "he had the ability to \"enter the fire element\""
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, in the \"Dabba Mallaputta Sutta,\" Dabba the Mallian is said to have had the ability to \"enter the fire element.\" According to the sutta, he was able to do this by focusing his mind on the impermanence of all things, and by practicing mindfulness and concentration. This allowed him to overcome fear and attachment to his physical body, and to endure physical hardships without suffering.\n\nThe ability to enter the fire element is seen as a metaphor for the spiritual attainment of a higher state of consciousness, where one is able to transcend worldly concerns and attain a state of peace and liberation. In Buddhist teachings, such spiritual attainments are seen as a result of spiritual practice and development, rather than as a result of any supernatural powers or abilities."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "so it's not much of a leap to consider that supernormal abilities described in the suttas are literal abilities and not metaphors. Same goes for talks of other realms, we have many NDE-ers today who report such realms, and they are coming from various cultures and backgrounds (done by research team at University of Virginia)"
