      "content": "Another example of how research questions can guide the product development process is in the case of developing a new social media platform. The team might have the following research questions:\n\nWhat features do users value most in a social media platform?\nWhat types of content do users want to see more of on social media?\nHow do users feel about the current privacy and security measures on existing social media platforms?\n\nBy asking these research questions, the team can gain a better understanding of the user's needs and wants in a social media platform, which can inform the development of new features and content that will be most valuable to users.\n\nUnderstanding the goals of the product development process and the insights the team is looking to gain from the user can also help to refine the research questions. For example, if the team is specifically looking to gain insights on how to improve the user interface of a website, they might ask research questions such as:\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges users face when navigating our website?\nHow can we make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for on our website?\nWhat design elements would users like to see more of on our website?\n\nBy focusing on these specific goals, the team can gain insights that will help them to make the necessary improvements to the website's interface.\n\nIn summary, research questions play a crucial role in guiding the conversation with the user towards specific goals that will help in product development. By understanding the goals of the product development process and what insights the team is looking to gain from the user, research questions can be crafted to better understand the user's needs and wants, which can then be used to inform the development of new features and improvements to existing products."

Because this activity is characterized by a small sample size, it is not representative, but in return allows you to discover information that cannot be obtained by large-scale studies, especially thoughts and ideas. way of thinking behind the action of the subject. So, interview regularly, thereby allowing you to regularly reach out and understand more and more about users.\n\nHowever, although this is often recommended, you still need to have a good goal for each of your interviews.\n\n### \\*\\*The direction of the interview should be tied to the context of the product development process\\*\\*\n\nThe objective of the interview should be tied to the context of the product development process. Depending on the stage of the product development process, (before, during or after development) the interview will explore different aspects of the user. Here are some examples of interview objectives based on the context of the product development process:\n\n\\*\\*Before product/feature development\\*\\*\n\n- Determine if the user is having a problem the product wants to solve and the severity of the problem. (or need)\n- Understand how users are currently troubleshooting (or satisfying a need), if any.\n- Identify the user's approach to current solutions or alternatives.\n- Determine users' willingness to pay for a solution.\n- Identify the factors that influence the user's decision-making process.\n- ...\n\n\\*\\*During product/feature development\\*\\*\n\n- Check how customers perceive product ideas, features, react to messages\n- Evaluate customer acceptability with product or feature, check price\n- Check customer priority with specific feature requests, look for unmet requirements\n- Check how customers use or react to the feature, evaluate its ease of use, ease of use\n- Test hypotheses about the product or feature in general (viability, usability)\n\nOnce the product/feature is released, user interviews can be conducted to gather feedback on the user experience and identify areas for improvement.\n\n- Understand how users are using the product/feature in their daily life\n- Measure user satisfaction and identify areas for improvement\n- Explain why the user left or why the user stayed\n- Collect feedback on potential improvements or new features for future iterations\n- Measure product/feature success based on user adoption and usage\n- Collect testimonials or success stories for marketing purposes.\n\n### \\*\\*Interview result must be actionable\\*\\*\n\nIn many cases, interview results are forgotten. The team may have conducted many interviews, but the results of these interviews did not add significant value to the work of the product development team.\n\nInterview questions should help identify problems, user needs, or test hypotheses about the product under development. Interview questions should be designed in such a way as to identify information relevant to decision-making for the product. The results of the interviews should be used to re-evaluate the strategy and direction of product development. And it takes coordination between departments in the company to interview users effectively.\n\nThere's a saying I use to remind myself: \"Before you ask a question, you need to know what you're going to do with the answer.\""
