  "content": "This equation can be proved using combinatorial techniques.\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 2n elements, and then choose 2 elements from the remaining n elements. This can be expressed as:\n\n(2n choose 2) \\* (n choose 2) = (2n!) / (2! (2n-2)!) \\* (n!) / (2! (n-2)!) = (2n \\* (2n - 1) \\* n \\* (n - 1)) / (4 \\* (2n - 2)!)\n\nThe right-hand side of the equation can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 2n elements, and then choose n - 2 elements from the remaining 2n - 2 elements. This can be expressed as:\n\n(2n choose 2) \\* (2n - 2 choose n - 2) = (2n!) / (2! (2n-2)!) \\* (2n - 2)! / ( (n-2)! (2n - 2 - (n - 2))!) = (2n \\* (2n - 1) \\* (2n - 2) \\* (2n - 3)) / (4 \\* (n-2)!)\n\nSince both sides of the equation result in the same expression, the equation is true, and this constitutes a combinatorial proof.",
