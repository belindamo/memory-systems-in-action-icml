  "content": "In Buddhist literature, there is a sutta known as the \"Dabba Mallaputta Sutta\" where Dabba the Mallian is described as having the power to provide lodgings for the monastic community. According to the sutta, Dabba the Mallian had the ability to perceive the needs of the monastics and was able to provide them with suitable lodgings, even in cases where it seemed impossible to do so.\n\nIn this sutta, Dabba the Mallian is portrayed as a lay devotee of great generosity and kindness, who used his wealth and resources to support the Buddha and the monastic community. The sutta serves as a teaching on the importance of generosity and the power of giving, and it is remembered in Buddhist tradition as an example of how lay followers can live a virtuous and meaningful life.",
