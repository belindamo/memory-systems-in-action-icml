You can usually find this information on the restaurant's page, in the checkout process, or in the \"Fees\" or \"Promotions\" section of the TasteBuddy app or website.\n\nIf you're unsure about the fees or promotions, you can also contact TasteBuddy's customer support for clarification. They should be able to provide you with more information on their delivery fees, free delivery thresholds, and any other promotions that might be available.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to review the fees and terms before placing an order, so you know exactly what to expect.
