  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. After further research, I found that TasteBuddy's delivery fees are a bit more nuanced than I initially stated.\n\n**TasteBuddy Delivery Fees:**\n\n* **Flat delivery fee:** TasteBuddy typically charges a flat delivery fee of $2.99 for most orders.\n* **Free delivery threshold:** If your order total is $20 or more, delivery is free. This means you won't pay the $2.99 delivery fee.\n* **Restaurant-specific fees:** Some restaurants on TasteBuddy may have their own delivery fees, which can vary from the standard $2.99 flat fee. These fees will be clearly displayed on the restaurant's page or during the checkout process.\n* **Peak hour fees:** TasteBuddy may charge an additional fee during peak hours (e.g., lunch or dinner rush) to ensure timely delivery. This fee will be clearly displayed during checkout.\n* **Long-distance fees:** For longer delivery distances, TasteBuddy might charge an additional fee to account for the increased delivery time and cost.\n\nTo summarize, while the $2.99 flat delivery fee is the standard, there are exceptions and variations depending on the restaurant, order total, and other factors. It's always a good idea to check the delivery fees and estimated delivery time during the checkout process to ensure you're aware of any additional costs.\n\nI hope this clarifies TasteBuddy's delivery fees for you!",
