  "content": "Let's break it down:\n\n**Pizza:**\n\n* 3-4 slices of pepperoni pizza, regular-sized (12-14 inches in diameter)\n* Assuming an average slice size of 1/8 of the pizza, each slice would be around 140-160 calories (depending on the crust thickness and toppings)\n* Total pizza calories: 3-4 slices x 150 calories/slice = 450-600 calories\n\n**Wings:**\n\n* 5-6 bone-in buffalo wings\n* A single bone-in buffalo wing typically has around 120-140 calories\n* Total wing calories: 5-6 wings x 130 calories/wing = 650-780 calories\n\n**Blue Cheese Dressing:**\n\n* Assuming you had around 2-3 tablespoons of blue cheese dressing (a rough estimate)\n* Each tablespoon of blue cheese dressing has around 90-100 calories\n* Total blue cheese calories: 2-3 tablespoons x 95 calories/tablespoon = 190-285 calories\n\n**Beer:**\n\n* 5 beers throughout the game\n* A standard beer (12 oz) has around 150-170 calories\n* Total beer calories: 5 beers x 160 calories/beer = 800 calories\n\n**Total Calories:**\n\nAdding up the estimated calories from pizza, wings, blue cheese dressing, and beer, you consumed around:\n\n450-600 (pizza) + 650-780 (wings) + 190-285 (blue cheese) + 800 (beer) = 2090-2565 calories\n\nSo, your total estimated calorie intake for the Super Bowl party is around 2090-2565 calories.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a rough estimate, as exact calorie counts can vary depending on the specific brands and preparation methods used. However, this should give you a good idea of the calorie range you're looking at.\n\nRemember, it's okay to indulge every now and then, but try to balance it out with healthier choices throughout the week.",
