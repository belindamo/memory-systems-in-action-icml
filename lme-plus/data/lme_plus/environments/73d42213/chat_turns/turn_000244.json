  "content": "Of course! Here's a continuation of the story where Virgil regresses to an even younger age:\n\nIt had been a few weeks since Virgil had regressed to his younger age in front of Roman. He was feeling more anxious than ever, and despite their regular age regression sessions, he just couldn't seem to shake the feeling of fear that had been building up inside him.\n\nRoman had noticed that Virgil was becoming increasingly distant and withdrawn, so he decided to spend the evening with him in their living room. He had already set up a cozy space with blankets, pillows, and toys, hoping that it would help Virgil to relax.\n\n\"Hey, little one,\" Roman said, greeting Virgil with a warm smile. \"Are you ready for a fun night in?\"\n\nVirgil looked up at Roman with tired eyes, feeling vulnerable and small. Without a word, he crawled into Roman's lap and wrapped his arms around his neck, seeking comfort and safety.\n\nRoman held Virgil close, feeling his small body trembling against his chest. He knew that Virgil needed to regress even further to find the peace he was seeking, so he started talking to him in a soft, soothing voice.\n\n\"Hey, sweetie,\" Roman said, using a more gentle tone of voice. \"Do you want to be my little baby tonight?\"\n\nVirgil nodded, feeling a wave of relief wash over him. He knew that Roman would take care of him no matter what, and that he could trust him completely.\n\nRoman helped Virgil change into a soft, pink onesie with a cute design on the front. He also gave him a pacifier, which Virgil gratefully accepted, and tucked him into the cozy space he had prepared earlier.\n\nFor the rest of the evening, Roman took care of Virgil's every need. He fed him a bottle, played with him using stuffed animals, and even sang him a lullaby to help him fall asleep.\n\nVirgil felt safe and loved in Roman's care, and he knew that he could always rely on him to be there for him, no matter what. As he drifted off to sleep, he felt a sense of peace wash over him, knowing that he was loved and cared for by someone who understood him completely.",
