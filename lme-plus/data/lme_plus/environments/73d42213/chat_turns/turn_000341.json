  "content": "I loved the part about forgiveness being a constant attitude. It made me think of a recent Bible study group I attended at my friend Emily's house, where we discussed the importance of forgiveness in our daily lives. I brought some homemade cookies to share, and it was a great way to bond over our shared values. Do you have any quotes that might relate to applying forgiveness in our relationships with others?",
