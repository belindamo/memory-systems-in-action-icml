  "content": "I apologize that the previous solution did not work for you. Here's another approach you can try:\n\n1. Open Notepad or your preferred text editor.\n2. Copy and paste the following code into the text editor:\n```perl\nAdd-Type @\"\n  using System;\n  using System.Runtime.InteropServices;\n  public class NativeMethods {\n    [DllImport(\"user32.dll\")]\n    public static extern int SendMessage(IntPtr hWnd, int Msg, int wParam, int lParam);\n  }\n\"@\n\n$HWND_BROADCAST = [IntPtr]0xffff;\n$WM_SYSCOMMAND = 0x0112;\n$SC_SCREENSAVE = 0xf140;\n\n$mp4_file = \"C:\\Path\\to\\your\\video.mp4\"\n$command = \"$mp4_file,,1\"\n\nNativeMethods::SendMessage($HWND_BROADCAST, $WM_SYSCOMMAND, $SC_SCREENSAVE, $command);\n```\n3. Replace `\"C:\\Path\\to\\your\\video.mp4\"` with the actual path to your MP4 file.\n4. Save the file with a `.ps1` extension (e.g., `myscreensaver.ps1`) in a convenient location (e.g., `C:\\Scripts`).\n5. Open PowerShell as an administrator.\n6. Type `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` and press Enter.\n7. Type `cd C:\\Scripts` (or the location where you saved the script) and press Enter.\n8. Type `.\\myscreensaver.ps1` (or the name you chose for your script) and press Enter.\n\nThe script should launch your MP4 file as a screensaver. To exit the screensaver, you can move the mouse or press a key on your keyboard.\n\nI hope this solution works for you. Let me know if you encounter any issues.",
