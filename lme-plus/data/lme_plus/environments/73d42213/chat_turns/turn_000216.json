  "content": "An extensive-form game to show how targeted sanctions incentivize a coup might look like the following:\n\n1. Nature chooses a state of the world: The state of the world determines the level of political stability in the target country, where a low level of political stability makes a coup more likely.\n2. The imposing country decides whether to impose sanctions: If the imposing country decides to impose sanctions, it reduces the target country's economic well-being, which can increase the likelihood of a coup.\n3. The target country decides whether to cooperate or resist: If the target country resists the sanctions, it can try to mitigate the economic harm by increasing economic self-sufficiency or seeking support from other countries. If the target country cooperates, it may reduce the economic harm from the sanctions, but it may also increase the likelihood of a coup by reducing the political legitimacy of the government.\n4. The military decides whether to stage a coup: If the military stages a coup, it can take control of the government and end the sanctions. If it does not stage a coup, the current government remains in power, and the sanctions remain in place.\n5. The payoffs: The payoffs for each actor depend on the state of the world, the actions of the other actors, and the outcome of the coup. The payoffs can include economic benefits or costs, political benefits or costs, and the stability of the government.\n\nIn this game, the imposition of sanctions can increase the likelihood of a coup by reducing the target country's economic well-being and political legitimacy. The target country's response to the sanctions can further increase or decrease the likelihood of a coup, and the military's decision to stage a coup depends on the level of political stability in the country.",
