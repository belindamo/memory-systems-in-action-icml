You might find that a combination of tools works best for you.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and stick to it. Be flexible, and don't be afraid to adjust your schedule or tools as needed.\n\nHow do you think you'll incorporate buffer time and flexibility into your schedule?
