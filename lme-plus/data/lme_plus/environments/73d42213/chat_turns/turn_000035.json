  "content": "As a Male Puritan living in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1632, I would likely believe in the doctrine of predestination. This doctrine, put forward by theologians such as John Calvin, holds that God has already predetermined who will be saved and who will not be saved, and that human effort cannot change this outcome.\n\nHowever, this belief in predestination would not mean that I would not take action to improve my life, or that I would not make an effort to plant crops and work hard to ensure a good harvest. Instead, it would mean that I would trust that whatever happens, it is part of God's plan, and that ultimately, my salvation is in his hands. So, I would work hard, do my best, but at the same time, I would trust in God's will and be content with it.",
