  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal views or beliefs, but here are some insights that might answer your question.\n\nThe legal recognition of same-sex marriage has had a significant positive impact on custody battles involving same-sex parents. Previously, before the recognition of same-sex marriage, the definition of who was a parent could vary by state, which could complicate custody battles. Consequently, same-sex parents could face additional barriers in obtaining custody or visitation rights for their child/children.\n\nHowever, with the legalization of same-sex marriage, same-sex parents' parental rights are more secure and recognized under the law. This legal recognition ensures that both parents, regardless of their gender or orientation, have equal legal standing when it comes to issues of custody, visitation, and other legal matters. Same-sex parents can secure their parental rights through adoption or other legal means, just as opposite-sex parents do. Therefore, same-sex parents are now more likely to be granted custody or share custody with their partners, without facing discriminatory legal barriers.",
