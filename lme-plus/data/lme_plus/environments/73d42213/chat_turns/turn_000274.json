If you have a small space, you can use a container that can be kept under your sink or on your balcony.\n\n2. Choose the right location: Choose a spot that is convenient and easily accessible for you to add and turn the compost. It should also be well-ventilated and away from direct sunlight.\n\n3. Start composting: Add organic matter to your compost container, such as food scraps, yard waste or leaves. You can also add coffee grounds and filters, tea bags or eggshells.\n\n4. Add water: Make sure to keep the compost moist by adding water from time to time.\n\n5. Turn the compost: Regularly turn your compost to allow air to circulate, which promotes the breakdown process.\n\n6. Monitor the compost: Monitor your compost to make sure it's breaking down properly. If it's too wet, add dry material like leaves. If it's too dry, add some water.\n\nWith these tips, you should be able to easily start and maintain a compost pile.
