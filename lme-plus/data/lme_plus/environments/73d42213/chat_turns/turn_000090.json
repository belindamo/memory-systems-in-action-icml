The compliance monitoring process is a comprehensive approach that includes auditing, investigation, and prosecution of non-compliant taxpayers. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive conceptual review of compliance monitoring in Sub-Saharan Africa and the factors that influence tax compliance. This paper will examine the challenges of tax compliance monitoring, the role of tax authorities in compliance monitoring, and the effect of non-compliance on tax revenue.\n\nOne significant challenge facing tax compliance monitoring in Sub-Saharan Africa is the lack of resources and capacity of tax authorities. Tax authorities in the region face challenges such as inadequate funding, limited technology, and a shortage of trained personnel. As a result, many tax authorities are unable to carry out adequate compliance monitoring activities, and non-compliant taxpayers are likely to evade paying taxes. In addition, the informal sector, which is prevalent in the region, is often difficult to monitor and control, making it challenging to ensure compliance.\n\nThe role of tax authorities in compliance monitoring is crucial. Tax authorities need to develop a comprehensive compliance monitoring strategy that includes the use of technology, risk assessment, and intelligence gathering. The use of technology in compliance monitoring can help overcome the challenges of inadequate resources and capacity. For example, electronic filing systems can help tax authorities to monitor taxpayers' compliance in real-time, identify potential risks, and flag non-compliant taxpayers. Risk assessment is also an important tool for tax authorities in compliance monitoring. By assessing taxpayers' risk profiles, tax authorities can target high-risk taxpayers for audit or investigation.\n\nMoreover, several factors influence tax compliance in Sub-Saharan Africa. Studies have shown that non-pecuniary factors such as trust in government, fairness of tax system, and the perception of tax authority's competence are critical in influencing tax compliance. Kamasa, Adu, and Oteng-Abayie (2019) found that trust in government and the perception of tax authority's competence significantly influence tax compliance in Ghana. Alabede (2018) also found that economic freedom has a positive effect on tax revenue performance in Sub-Saharan Africa. This suggests that tax authorities need to consider non-pecuniary factors in designing compliance monitoring strategies.\n\nNon-compliance with tax laws and regulations has a significant impact on tax revenue. Non-compliant taxpayers reduce the government's revenue and undermine the tax system's integrity, leading to a loss of confidence in the tax system. Abdu, Jibir, and Muhammad (2020) found that non-compliance is prevalent among firms in Nigeria, leading to a significant loss of revenue. Therefore, it is crucial for tax authorities to enforce compliance monitoring to ensure that taxpayers adhere to the tax laws and regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, compliance monitoring is an essential aspect of tax administration in Sub-Saharan Africa. Tax authorities need to develop a comprehensive compliance monitoring strategy that includes the use of technology, risk assessment, and intelligence gathering. Non-pecuniary factors such as trust in government, fairness of tax system, and the perception of tax authority's competence significantly influence tax compliance. The challenges of compliance monitoring, such as inadequate resources and capacity, need to be addressed to ensure effective compliance monitoring. Tax authorities need to enforce compliance monitoring to ensure that taxpayers adhere to the tax laws and regulations, leading to increased tax revenue and the integrity of the tax system.\n\nReferences:\n\nAbdu, M., Jibir, A., & Muhammad, T.
