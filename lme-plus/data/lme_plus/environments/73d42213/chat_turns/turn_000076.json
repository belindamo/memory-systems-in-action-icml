  "content": "I had about 3-4 slices of pepperoni pizza, and they were regular-sized. We ordered from a popular pizza place, so I'm assuming they were around 12-14 inches in diameter. As for the wings, I had around 5-6 bone-in buffalo wings. We had blue cheese dressing as a dip. Oh, and I also had 5 beers throughout the game, which I'm pretty sure adds a lot to the calorie count. Can you estimate the total calories for me?",
