  "content": "I haven't had a specific moment where I felt especially connected to God through music, but I do feel like singing in the choir helps me connect with my faith on a deeper level. When I'm singing, I feel like I'm able to express my emotions and thoughts in a way that's hard to do with just words. Plus, being part of the choir has helped me feel more connected to the St. Mary's community, which has been really enriching for me.",
