Here are some tips to help you resist the temptation of screens before bed:\n\n1. **Designate a \"no-phone zone\"**: Make your bedroom a phone-free zone to associate it with sleep and relaxation. Charge your phone in another room or use a phone dock outside your bedroom.\n2. **Use screen time tracking and app blockers**: Tools like Freedom, SelfControl, or Moment can track your screen time and block distracting apps during your designated bedtime routine.\n3. **Implement a \"screen curfew\"**: Set a specific time to put away your phone and other screens, e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour before bedtime.\n4. **Replace phone time with a relaxing activity**: Engage in a calming activity, like reading, listening to calming music, or doing some light stretching, to fill the time you'd normally spend on your phone.\n5. **Use physical books or e-readers**: Instead of reading on your phone or tablet, switch to physical books or e-readers that don't emit blue light.\n6. **Remove social media and email notifications**: Turn off notifications for social media, email, and other distracting apps during your bedtime routine.\n7. **Use blue light filtering glasses or apps**: Blue light filtering glasses, apps, or software can reduce the stimulating effects of screens. However, it's still important to avoid screens altogether before bed.\n8. **Create a phone-free routine with a friend or family member**: Share your goals with a friend or family member and hold each other accountable. This can provide an added motivation to stick to your screen-free routine.\n9. **Find alternative ways to wind down**: Instead of reaching for your phone, try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation.\n10. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for yourself when you successfully avoid screens before bed. This could be something as simple as a nice breakfast the next morning or a short break from a task you've been putting off.\n11. **Make it inconvenient**: Charge your phone in a hard-to-reach place or use a phone case that makes it difficult to access your phone quickly. This can help break the habit of mindless scrolling.\n12. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it takes time to develop new habits. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Instead, acknowledge the setback and try to do better the next day.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a consistent bedtime routine that signals your body that it's time to sleep. With time and practice, you'll find it easier to resist the temptation of screens before bed.",
