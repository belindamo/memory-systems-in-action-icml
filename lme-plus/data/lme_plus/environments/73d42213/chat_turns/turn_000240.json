  "content": "Age regression refers to a psychological phenomenon where an individual mentally regresses to an earlier age, usually as a coping mechanism to deal with stress or trauma. This can occur consciously or unconsciously, and the individual may temporarily adopt behaviors, attitudes, and thought patterns associated with an earlier age.\n\nAge regression can take different forms, including regression to a specific age or developmental stage, such as childhood or adolescence. Some people also engage in age regression as a form of therapeutic technique, often within the context of a therapeutic relationship with a trained mental health professional. In this case, age regression is used to access and explore unresolved issues or traumas from the past that may be impacting the individual's current mental and emotional well-being.",
