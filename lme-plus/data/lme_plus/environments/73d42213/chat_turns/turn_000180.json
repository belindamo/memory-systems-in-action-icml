Make sure you listen to John and have fun!\" said their father.\n\n\"We will, and we'll miss you!\" Samantha said, giving them one last hug before they left.\n\nJohn led them to their cabin, where they would be staying for the week. \"This is where you'll be sleeping, it's a cabin for children your age.\" he said, opening the door to reveal a room with bunk beds and a small living area.\n\nSamantha and Jack looked around the room, taking in the details. \"Wow, this is really nice!\" Samantha said, her eyes sparkling with wonder.\n\n\"Yeah, it's perfect!\" Jack added, a big grin on his face.\n\nJohn smiled, \"Glad you like it. I'll leave you two to settle in and get comfortable. Dinner is at 6pm, so make sure you're back here by then. And remember, clothing is optional here, but always be respectful of others.\"\n\nSamantha and Jack nodded, understanding the rules of the camp. They thanked John and he left, giving them privacy.\n\nAs they unpacked and settled in, they couldn't help but feel a little nervous. But they were excited to experience something new and explore this nudist camp. They knew it would be a week filled with new adventures and memories.",
