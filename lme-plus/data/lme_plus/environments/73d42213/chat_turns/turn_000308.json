  "content": "I'd be happy to clarify the delivery fees and minimum order requirements for each service, with a focus on GrubHub and TasteBuddy.\n\n**GrubHub:**\n\n* **Delivery fees:** GrubHub charges a delivery fee, which varies by restaurant. This fee is typically between $2.99 and $7.99, but can be higher or lower depending on the restaurant and your location.\n* **Minimum order requirements:** GrubHub's minimum order requirements vary by restaurant, but are usually around $10-$15. This means you need to order at least $10-$15 worth of food to qualify for delivery.\n* **Service fees:** GrubHub also charges a service fee, which is a percentage of your order total. This fee is typically between 10%-15% of your order total, but can vary by restaurant.\n* **GrubHub+ subscription:** If you opt for GrubHub+'s subscription service, you'll get unlimited free delivery from participating restaurants, with no additional delivery fees or minimum order requirements. The subscription costs $9.99/month.\n\nHere's an example of how GrubHub's fees might work:\n\n* You order $20 worth of food from a restaurant with a $3.99 delivery fee and a 12% service fee.\n* Your total comes out to $20 (food) + $3.99 (delivery fee) + $2.40 (service fee) = $26.39\n\n**TasteBuddy:**\n\n* **Delivery fees:** TasteBuddy charges a flat delivery fee of $2.99 for all orders. However, if your order total is over $20, delivery is free.\n* **Minimum order requirements:** TasteBuddy's minimum order requirements vary by restaurant, but are usually around $10-$15. This means you need to order at least $10-$15 worth of food to qualify for delivery.\n* **Service fees:** TasteBuddy doesn't charge a service fee, so you won't see an additional percentage added to your order total.\n* **No subscription service:** TasteBuddy doesn't offer a subscription service, so you'll need to pay the delivery fee for each order, unless you meet the free delivery threshold.\n\nHere's an example of how TasteBuddy's fees might work:\n\n* You order $18 worth of food from a restaurant.\n* Your total comes out to $18 (food) + $2.99 (delivery fee) = $20.99\n* If you had ordered $22 worth of food, delivery would be free, and your total would be $22.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general examples, and fees may vary depending on your location, restaurant, and other factors. It's always a good idea to check the fees and minimum order requirements for each restaurant and service before placing an order.",
