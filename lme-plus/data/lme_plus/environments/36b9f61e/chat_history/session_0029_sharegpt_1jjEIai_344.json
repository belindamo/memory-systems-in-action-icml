      "content": "The HILL (Hydraulic Integrated Lifting Loader) exoskeleton is a versatile and advanced piece of machinery designed to support a wide range of tasks and operations. It comes with several built-in systems to provide maximum utility to its users:\n\n1. Pneumatic/Compressed Air System: This system allows the HILL to power and operate various pneumatic tools, such as impact wrenches, air hammers, and air drills, by supplying compressed air to the tools.\n2. Hydraulic System: The hydraulic system enables the HILL to perform powerful lifting and manipulation tasks with its strong, hydraulic-powered arms. This system can also power hydraulic tools like hydraulic cutters, spreaders, and rams.\n3. Power Takeoff (PTO): The PTO interface allows the HILL to transfer mechanical power from its engine to operate other machinery or equipment, such as generators, pumps, or winches.\n4. Vacuum System: The vacuum system enables the HILL to operate vacuum-based tools, like suction cups and vacuum grippers, for handling delicate or heavy objects.\n5. High and Low Voltage Systems: These systems provide electrical power to various tools and devices, such as lights, sensors, and electric-powered tools, ensuring that the HILL can handle any electrical needs during its operations.\n6. High-Pressure Water Pump: The built-in water pump can supply high-pressure water for various tasks, such as firefighting, cleaning, and cutting through certain materials.\n\nThese built-in systems make the HILL exoskeleton a highly adaptable and capable piece of equipment, allowing it to excel in a wide range of tasks and missions for the Frontier Rangers."
