      "content": "The speaker is discussing the lack of representation of minorities in the Israeli Supreme Court and how they don't see themselves represented. They talk about the privilege of being in the first or second Israel, and how they have no real savings apart from their pension. The speaker talks about their difficult childhood during the Holocaust and how their parents were not allowed to work or teach in Israel. They ask why they are considered the first Israel and not the second Israel.\nThe speaker is discussing the achievements of Aaron Bozgelo, a brilliant child of immigrants from Morocco, and how the committee for selecting judges was looking to have more Arabs and Easterners as well as religious and ultra-Orthodox judges. They were looking for the best out of 70 possible judges, but there were only 15 Spanish judges. There was no ill will or racism behind it, and they were searching for Spaniards.\nThe speaker is discussing the appointment of an expert to the Supreme Court and how it was prevented. They explain that the person was not worthy for appointment due to their journalistic writing in the press. The speaker then addresses mistakes made during their judicial revolution, which may have been too far-reaching, too inclusive and too liberal for the Israeli public. They acknowledge hearing these voices since 1995 when the verdict in the United Mizrahi Bank case was given.\nJudge Barak was warned that he was running too fast, but he argued that they needed more rights and he could not create them as a judge. He believes his position fits Israeli society, which is a society with a history of suffering and immigrants from different countries. He was given an instruction by the Knesset to recognize the right to human dignity and that any laws that violate human dignity should be considered unconstitutional.\nEber and the speaker discuss the possibility of a country where the people do not want rights or a constitution. Eber expresses his hope that the people will stand up for their rights, while the speaker believes that if the people want a dictatorship, there will be enough dictators willing to serve them. The speaker then talks about his own experiences in the Holocaust, and his desire to keep his family in their land and have a garden in Israel. He concludes that without a spirit of freedom and aspiration for rights, no court will be effective.\nA person recounts their experiences as a child in Europe during the Nazi invasion. They remember being pushed into a small neighborhood and living in a ghetto with constant hunger. They recall playing on the street, but also the fear of being harmed or killed by a German soldier.\nIn the ghetto, there was a central square called Democracy Square, where all the Jews were asked to enter. Families had to take their children under 9 out on the road and put them in tour cars to be murdered in a children's action. A Jewish boy of 8-9 years old was dressed up as an older person and taken to his father's workplace. A German officer asked him his age, and his answer determined if he would live or die.\nA 12-year-old was in the ghetto and was challenged by the rule of law. They had to find a Thai man willing to take them out, and they were put in a box with a German soldier sitting on top. The policeman was bribed and the box was opened, allowing them to escape to a safe place with their mother.\nA child and his mother were hiding inside a double wall in a Lithuanian village. The child was not a typical Lithuanian child and the double wall was made in one of the rooms. The mother taught him arithmetic, geography, and history while they were in the wall. The father didn't care to get them out, but the child did not seem to be mad at him. The mother however may have been mad at him for other issues.\nA person recounts a formative experience of their life in which they and their family had to flee their home and travel on top of a train to escape the Soviet regime. They describe how they had to learn to survive and evade robbers, and how they were seen as an academic and an elite by some people.\nThe conversation discusses the end of World War II, where the train stopped and horns began to blow. The speakers talk about the future and their experience of persecution without human rights. They remember a Jewish brigade symbol with the Star of David, and how a Jewish soldier saved them. They discuss their judicial philosophy of protecting both national security and human rights, and how these two can live together.\nThe speaker is discussing the importance of the state, the necessity of security procedures to protect human rights, and the Law of Return which grants Jews a \"golden key\" to enter the State of Israel. They then recall returning to Kovna and meeting the family that saved them during the Holocaust. The family's daughter explained that they took the risk because they were strict Catholics.\nA large demonstration was held in Israel in 1999 in response to a series of decisions made by the Supreme Court, including the question of who is a Jew. The demonstration was organized by ultra-Orthodox Jews from various factions and was attended by more than a quarter of a million people. The organizers insisted on emphasizing a short prayer and the banners they waved indicated their opposition to the judicial dictatorship. Today, security officials in the legal system continue to use the demonstration as an example of power.\nMr. Judge is asked how he feels when hundreds of thousands of Israelis demonstrate at his workplace. He states that he is not cold-hearted and that the leaders of the ultra-orthodox had come to him asking him not to interfere in matters of religion and state. He also notes that he has not sought psychological support in the face of the pressures he has faced. The lawyer Jacob Weinroth commented on Mr. Judge, saying that his mental structure is like that of a religious person, and that he dreams of living in a society that rules universal values.\nThe speaker is a soldier in the army of the law and comes from an ultra-Orthodox religious family. At family events, the ultra-orthodox faction sees the speaker as a demon and it hurts him. The Supreme Court is supposed to be both Jewish and democratic, and the speaker identifies more with the Democratic Party. He wishes he knew more about Jewish Hebrew law and Talmud, but does not think that democracy should have a heavier weight than Jewishness; they are equal."

      "content": "The speaker and his wife have been in love for 70 years and he has had the same attitude towards her since they first met. They see themselves as two parts of one whole, and do not see themselves living without each other. The speaker was very involved in the formation of their four children Avner, Esther, Michal, and Tamar. He has written a book about the fundamental law of human dignity and freedom which reflects Israeli law.\nA conversation between two people discussed a book that reflected the history of Israeli law. The speaker mentioned that they used to be in charge of the night and their son Avner when he would cry. Allegations of nepotism have been heard against the speaker and they admitted that it was wrong for the children of judges to intern with their fathers. The speaker concluded that it is better for judges not to take care of their children, as it can lead to criticism.\nThis conversation discusses Yitzhak Rabin's resignation as Prime Minister of Israel in 1977. It references a Treasury committee that recommended a ransom for Rabin's wife, but the legal advisor did not accept this recommendation. Rabin accepted the criticism and resigned without hiding behind his Knesset immunity. The speaker expresses their sadness at Rabin's passing, noting his honesty.\nThe speaker is discussing the resignation of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as a result of a mistake he made, and comparing it to the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's situation. He appreciates Netanyahu for his accomplishments as Prime Minister, but is critical of his current actions, which he believes are not in the best interest of Israel. He believes that Netanyahu should have resigned like Olmert did, and that Rabin's resignation was the right thing to do.\nThe speaker resigned after Yitzhak Rabin did not require a plea deal but with Netanyahu, who is accused of bribery, they agreed to a plea deal to prevent a rift in the nation. The speaker also said that if Netanyahu had agreed to the deal at the time, he would have had to confess and resign and leave political life. The speaker then discussed an old woman with whom they had difficulty.\nAlika is in old age and it is hard for the speaker to see her in this state. Despite the pain of old age, the speaker takes comfort in the fact that Alika had a wonderful life. They have four children and 11 grandchildren, which has brought them great wealth. The speaker believes changes should be made but they need to be done with agreement so that they can stand the test of time. They mention Judge Aharon Barak and thank him for having this conversation as well as Amir Ben David and Noa Myel who helped prepare this idea.\nThe speaker is thanking the other person for giving them the opportunity to participate in their programs, and expressing appreciation for the previous programs. They mention that a particular experience was particularly fascinating, and thank them again."

      "content": "Aharon Barak, the former President of the Supreme Court of Israel, is an advocate of judicial activism, the idea that the judiciary should have a significant role in interpreting the law and should intervene when the government fails to protect citizens' rights. While Barak's ideas may sound noble and just, they are a direct threat to democracy and the rule of law.\n\nBarak's philosophy is centered around the idea of a \"constitutional revolution,\" which he believes is necessary to secure the rights of citizens. However, this revolution is nothing more than an excuse for the judiciary to impose its will on the people and to disregard the elected officials who are accountable to the citizens. Barak believes that the courts should be the ultimate authority in the land, even above the legislature and the executive branches of government. This is a dangerous idea that undermines the basic principles of democracy.\n\nBarak's belief in the Fundamental Law of Human Dignity and Freedom is also a cause for concern. While it may sound good on paper, in practice, it has been used by the courts to strike down democratically-enacted laws that conflict with their personal views. This law gives the judiciary too much power to overturn laws passed by elected officials and undermines the democratic process. The courts should be limited to interpreting the law, not making it.\n\nFurthermore, Barak's idea that the courts should intervene in cases where the government fails to protect citizens' rights is problematic. It assumes that the judiciary knows best and that elected officials are incompetent or corrupt. This is an insult to the millions of citizens who elect their representatives to enact laws and govern the country. The judiciary's role is to interpret the law, not to act as a super-legislature. When the courts overstep their bounds, they undermine the legitimacy of the democratic process and erode the trust of the people in their government.\n\nBarak's belief in the need for a \"strong\" court is also concerning. A strong court is not one that oversteps its bounds and imposes its will on the people but one that upholds the rule of law and respects the separation of powers. When the courts become too powerful, they can become corrupt and biased, and their decisions can become political rather than legal. A strong court is one that respects the democratic process and the will of the people, not one that seeks to undermine it.\n\nFinally, Barak's idea that the Minister of Justice's recent statements about the court have caused a loss of public trust in the judiciary is misguided. The loss of public trust in the judiciary is a direct result of the courts' overreaching and their disregard for the will of the people. The judiciary must earn the trust of the people, not demand it. When the courts act as an unelected super-legislature, they undermine the democratic process and erode the trust of the people in their government.\n\nIn conclusion, Aharon Barak's philosophy of judicial activism is a direct threat to democracy and the rule of law. The courts must be limited to interpreting the law, not making it. The judiciary must respect the will of the people and the democratic process. The courts must earn the trust of the people, not demand it. The path to a just society is not through a \"constitutional revolution\" but through the rule of law and the respect for democratic institutions. As conservatives, we must stand up for these values and oppose any attempt to undermine them."
