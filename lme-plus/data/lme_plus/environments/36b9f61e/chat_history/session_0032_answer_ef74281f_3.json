For instance, I recently bought a pack of graphic tees from H&M for $20, which is a steal.

Recognizing your tendencies is the first step to making changes or adjustments.\n\nHere are some questions to consider:\n\n1. Are there any specific triggers or emotions that lead you to make luxury purchases? (e.g., feeling stressed, celebrating a special occasion, or trying to treat yourself)\n2. Do you feel like the luxury purchases bring you long-term satisfaction or happiness, or is it more of an instant gratification?\n3. Are there any areas in your life where you feel like you're overspending or could cut back on luxury items?\n4. Are there any budget-friendly alternatives to the luxury purchases that could still meet your needs or desires?\n\nReflecting on these questions can help you better understand your shopping habits and make more intentional purchasing decisions.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any other examples of your shopping habits you'd like to share or discuss?",
