      "content": "Lasagna is a great choice! I totally understand about the time constraint. Here are some shortcuts and tips to help you make a delicious lasagna quickly:\n\n**Shortcuts:**\n\n1. **Use store-bought pasta sauce**: Instead of making your own sauce from scratch, use a high-quality store-bought pasta sauce. This will save you about 30 minutes of cooking time.\n2. **Pre-cooked sausage or ground beef**: Use pre-cooked sausage or ground beef to save time on browning. Just thaw and crumble it into the sauce.\n3. **No-boil lasagna noodles**: Use no-boil lasagna noodles to skip the boiling step. These noodles are designed to cook in the oven with the sauce and cheese.\n4. **Pre-shredded cheese**: Use pre-shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheese to save time on grating.\n\n**Time-Saving Tips:**\n\n1. **Prepare ingredients in advance**: Chop onions, garlic, and parsley, and cook the sausage or ground beef a day in advance to save time during assembly.\n2. **Assemble in 20 minutes**: Use a simple layering technique to assemble the lasagna quickly. Start with a layer of sauce, then noodles, then cheese, and repeat.\n3. **Use a single layer of cheese**: Instead of layering multiple types of cheese, use a single layer of mozzarella and parmesan mixed together.\n4. **Bake at a higher temperature**: Bake the lasagna at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 30-40 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n**Quick Lasagna Recipe:**\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 package no-boil lasagna noodles\n* 1 jar store-bought pasta sauce\n* 1 cup pre-cooked sausage or ground beef\n* 1 cup pre-shredded mozzarella cheese\n* 1/2 cup pre-shredded parmesan cheese\n* 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
