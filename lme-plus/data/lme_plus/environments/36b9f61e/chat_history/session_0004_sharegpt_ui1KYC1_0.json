      "content": "Certainly! Here are some Science Fiction novels that explore the theme of extending lifespan or immortality:\n\n1. \"The Immortalists\" by Chloe Benjamin: This novel follows four siblings who, as children, visit a fortune teller who predicts the exact date of their deaths. The novel explores how this knowledge affects their lives, and how each of them tries to extend their lifespans in different ways.\n2. \"The Postmortal\" by Drew Magary: In this novel, a cure for aging has been discovered, allowing people to live indefinitely. The novel explores the societal and political ramifications of this development, as well as the personal consequences for the main character.\n3. \"Altered Carbon\" by Richard K. Morgan: This novel is set in a future where human consciousness can be transferred between bodies, allowing people to essentially live forever. The novel follows a former soldier who is brought back to life to solve a murder.\n4. \"Old Man's War\" by John Scalzi: In this novel, humanity has discovered a way to transfer consciousness into younger, stronger bodies. The novel follows a group of seniors who join the military and are given new bodies to fight in an interstellar war.\n5. \"The City and the Stars\" by Arthur C. Clarke: This novel is set a billion years in the future, in a city called Diaspar where people live indefinitely. The novel explores the themes of immortality and the meaning of life in a world where death is no longer a concern.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many more Science Fiction novels that deal with the theme of extending lifespan or immortality."
