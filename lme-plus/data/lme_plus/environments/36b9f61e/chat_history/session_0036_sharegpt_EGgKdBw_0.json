You should focus on all aspects of the writing, including the plot, characterization, pacing, style, grammar, sentence structure, consistency, dialogue, point of view, setting, description, pacing, exposition, and the four factors necessary for suspense: reader empathy, reader concern, impending danger, and escalating tension. Your goal is to help the author elevate their work to the highest level possible. Please provide detailed feedback and specific examples of how to improve the manuscript.\n\nFeedback output is formatted as a CSV file.\nThe columns are:\n- Category: Praise or Question or Suggestion (e.g. constructive feedback)\n- Impact: Low, Medium, High.\n- Text: The body of the feedback.\n\n####\n\nTitle: Born to be King\nGenre: Fiction, Fantasy\nTarget audience: Young Adult\nPage 1 of Manuscript:\n\nA fire roared in the fireplace of the Queen\u2019s personal library. Roran was curled up on the floor with a blanket and pillow as his mother read him fairytales. Her voice was soft and warm, like the fire, and it wrapped around Roran like a hug. He loved evenings like this. He loved listening to his mother tell stories and the scratching of his father\u2019s quill. He often joined them for stories and the three spent most of their evenings in this room before Roran was sent to bed.\nRoran was the only child of King Daris and Queen Jaelin. He knew they wished to give him siblings, but for reasons he didn\u2019t understand, they wouldn\u2019t. So they showered him in as much love as they had to give. And he was happy. Even at the young age of four years old, he knew how much they loved him and he loved them. Even though they were King and Queen, they spent as much time as they could with him, including times like this.\nBut this evening took a surprising turn. The door to the library burst open and Mage Kevala was standing in the doorway, a shocked look on her face.\n\u201cYour Majesties!\u201d\n\u201cKevala? What is the meaning of disrupting us at this hour?\u201d King Daris stood from the small desk where he had been writing, his voice angry.\nRoran sat up. Kevala looked like she was about to cry and it struck Roran as odd. She had always been so strict and controlled. It was weird to see her emotions so open. Roran, suddenly scared, ran over to his mother and she drew him up into her lap, comforting him with a hug.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Greschel.\u201d\nThe King\u2019s anger disappeared, \u201cGreschel? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nKevala looked back and forth between the King and Queen and she revealed a folded parchment. Roran pulled away a little from his mother\u2019s embrace, his curiosity winning out over his fear. The King took the parchment, and even in the dim light of the fire, Roran could see the colour drain from his face.\n\u201cGreschel is\u2026 dead!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The Queen\u2019s arms loosened around Roran and her mouth had dropped open.\nRoran\u2019s father turned around, his face blank with grief, \u201cHe had decided to travel north alone, before his company was ready to travel with him. He got sick and died before the healer could get there. I don\u2019t understand. How could this happen?\u201d\nThe room went quiet. Greschel had been the High Mage of Ascai and advisor to their majesties. Roran didn\u2019t really know Greschel. The few times he had met the man, it had been brief, rather scary encounters. Greschel was tall and wore a scowl like his father wore a smile; all the time. Roran hadn\u2019t liked him too much and always felt that Greschel had been watching him, disappointment and displeasure surrounding him like a cloud.\nBut Roran knew that his parents had liked him and their grief filled the room.\nRoran looked at Kevala. She looked back at him, fear in her eyes. As the King walked back over to the Queen, Kevala raised a hand like she was going to say something, but seemed to decide not to and stayed quiet. Her eyes lingered on Roran and he shifted uncomfortably in his mother\u2019s lap, her frightened gaze igniting a new fear in Roran, though he couldn\u2019t understand why. He turned back to his mother, who now had silent tears running down her face. He leaned into her and let her wrap her arms around him as she cried.\n\n####\n\nFeedback in CSV format:"

      "content": "Category,Impact,Text\nPraise,Medium,\"The opening scene is very atmospheric and sets a cozy tone. The image of Roran snuggled up with a blanket and pillow while his mother reads him fairytales is heartwarming and relatable. It's a great way to introduce the characters and the setting.\"\nQuestion,Low,\"It's not immediately clear what the story is about or where it's going. The scene with Mage Kevala bursting in and delivering the news about Greschel is a good hook, but more context about the world and the characters would be helpful.\"\nSuggestion,High,\"Consider adding more exposition to help readers understand the political and magical systems at play in the story. It's also important to establish early on what Roran's journey or conflict will be, and what's at stake for him. Additionally, try to vary sentence structure and length to keep the writing engaging and avoid monotony.\"\nSuggestion,High,\"Consider showing more of Roran's personality and thoughts through his actions and dialogue. This will make him more relatable and give readers a reason to root for him. Also, try to vary dialogue tags and avoid using \"\"said\"\" too much.\"\nSuggestion,Medium,\"Consider introducing more description of the setting and the characters, as it will help readers visualize the scene and get a sense of the atmosphere. This will also make the characters more memorable.\"\nSuggestion,High,\"Try to create more tension and suspense by using the four factors: reader empathy, reader concern, impending danger, and escalating tension. This will keep readers engaged and invested in the story. Consider adding more conflict and obstacles for Roran to overcome, as well as raising the stakes.\""
