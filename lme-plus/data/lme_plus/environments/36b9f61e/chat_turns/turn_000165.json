This will give you a better idea of where your money is going and help you identify areas where you can cut back.\n\nRegarding your splurging habits, it's great that you're aware of your triggers (stress and celebrations). To avoid overspending, you might consider setting a \"treat yourself\" budget for each month. This way, you can still indulge in luxury items, but within a predetermined limit.\n\nFor example, you could allocate $200-300 per month for discretionary spending on fashion or luxury items. This will help you enjoy your treats without breaking the bank.\n\nHow does that sound?",
