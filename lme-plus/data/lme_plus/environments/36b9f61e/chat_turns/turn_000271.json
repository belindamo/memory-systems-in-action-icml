Since you'll be reading while on your elliptical, I'll suggest some engaging and easy-to-follow books that can help distract you from your workout and make the time fly by:\n\n1. **Mystery/Thrillers**: These genres are perfect for elliptical reading, as they're often fast-paced and suspenseful. Try authors like:\n\t* Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl, Sharp Objects)\n\t* Tana French (Dublin Murder Squad series)\n\t* David Baldacci (King & Maxwell series)\n2. **Non-fiction**: If you prefer non-fiction, consider books that are informative, yet easy to digest in short intervals. Some popular options include:\n\t* Malcolm Gladwell (The Tipping Point, Blink)\n\t* Yuval Noah Harari (Sapiens, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century)\n\t* Bill Bryson (A Short History of Nearly Everything)\n3. **Light-hearted Fiction**: If you want something more relaxing, try:\n\t* Sophie Kinsella (Shopaholic series)\n\t* Jennifer Weiner (Good in Bed, In Her Shoes)\n\t* Emily Giffin (Something Borrowed, Where We Belong)\n4. **Audiobooks**: If you prefer to listen instead of read, audiobooks can be a great option. You can find many popular titles on platforms like Audible or your local library's digital collection.\n\nRemember to choose books that interest you, and don't be afraid to switch to something else if you get bored. The goal is to make your elliptical time enjoyable and engaging!\n\nNow, get comfortable, grab a book, and get moving!",
