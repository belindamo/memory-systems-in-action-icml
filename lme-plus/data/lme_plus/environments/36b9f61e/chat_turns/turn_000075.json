A team can bring diverse skill sets and perspectives, help with decision-making, and contribute to the overall success of the business. That being said, some successful businesses have been started and run by solo entrepreneurs who have been able to succeed through hard work, innovative ideas, and smart business strategies.

Ultimately, whether or not to start a business alone or with a team depends on the specific circumstances, industry, and business idea.",
