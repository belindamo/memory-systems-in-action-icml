  "content": "That's a great idea! It's completely understandable that you want to make sure you'll be comfortable in the class, especially given your recent experiences with social anxiety.\n\nBy asking about the class size and dynamic, you can get a better sense of what to expect and whether it'll be a good fit for you. Here are some follow-up questions you might consider asking based on the instructor's response:\n\n* If the class size is small (e.g., 5-10 students), you might ask: \"How does the class dynamic work in a small group setting? Are there opportunities for one-on-one instruction or feedback?\"\n* If the class size is medium to large (e.g., 15-25 students), you might ask: \"How do you manage the class dynamic with a larger group? Are there opportunities for small group work or discussions?\"\n* If the instructor mentions that the class is very interactive or collaborative, you might ask: \"Can you give me some examples of how students interact with each other in the class? Are there any group projects or activities that I should be prepared for?\"\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask questions and advocate for yourself. You're taking a big step by signing up for a class, and it's important to make sure you're comfortable and set up for success.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that it's normal to feel some level of anxiety when trying something new, especially if you've been avoiding social situations. But by taking small steps and being open with the instructor, you're taking a huge step towards overcoming your anxiety and pursuing your interests.\n\nYou got this!",
