  "content": "State of the Art (SOTA) on Nearly Zero Energy Ports\n\nAccording to the latest scientific articles available, nearly zero energy ports have become a significant area of interest and research as the maritime industry moves towards sustainability and reducing emissions. The concept of nearly Zero Energy Ports (nZEP) has been explored in various studies, focusing on different aspects of port operations and the implementation of alternative energy sources.\n\nA comprehensive review of available measures, techniques, technologies, and port decision-makers' perception of sustainability has been presented in a paper by Sifakis et al. [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620354949)]. This paper aims to identify crucial research opportunities and challenges in achieving the nearly Zero Energy Port concept [[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347428172_Planning_zero-emissions_ports_through_the_nearly_Zero_Energy_Port_concept), [3](https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/7200652)].\n\nIn a case study by Tsoutsos et al., the authors investigate, analyze, and evaluate various energy-related data of the Port of Rethymno to propose a hypothetical model for achieving the nZEP concept [[4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338812067_Nearly_Zero_Energy_Ports_A_necessity_or_a_green_upgrade), [5](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/410/1/012037)]. The study highlights the criteria that need to be fulfilled to accomplish such an innovative purpose.\n\nThe nZEP concept has been proven to be a viable and feasible solution for ports working towards sustainability [[6](https://typeset.io/papers/planning-zero-emissions-ports-through-the-nearly-zero-energy-2h7yskip64)]. Another study explores the challenges of integrating hydrogen energy storage systems into nearly zero-energy ports, achieving zero carbon footprint emissions for the port's operation, and reducing the Levelised Cost of Energy [[7](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357023096_Challenges_of_integrating_hydrogen_energy_storage_systems_into_nearly_zero-energy_ports)].\n\nThe Getting to Zero Coalition has launched a Strategy for the Transition to Zero-Emission Shipping, emphasizing the importance of policy-making at the national, regional, and global levels to facilitate the transition towards net-zero emissions [[8](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/10/net-zero-shipping-decarbonisation-new-strategy/)]. Additionally, research by Yarova et al. focuses on the economic assessment of implementing alternative energy sources for port enterprises [[9](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Planning-zero-emissions-ports-through-the-nearly-Sifakis-Tsoutsos/3a5279e17b8924f3fc9efcadf273a3200492a79f)].\n\nOverall, the state of the art in nearly zero energy ports highlights the importance of innovative energy solutions, the integration of alternative energy sources, and policy-making to achieve sustainable port operations and reduce emissions.",
