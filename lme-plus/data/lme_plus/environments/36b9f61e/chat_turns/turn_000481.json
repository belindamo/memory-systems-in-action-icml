Here are some benefits of keeping a journal or taking notes:\n\n1. **Character tracking:** Writing down character motivations, relationships, and backstories can help you keep track of who's who and what's happening.\n2. **Plot development:** Jotting down key events, plot twists, and revelations can help you remember important details and connections between episodes.\n3. **Themes and symbolism:** Noting recurring themes, symbols, and motifs can enhance your understanding of the shows' deeper meanings and messages.\n4. **Theories and predictions:** Writing down your theories and predictions can be a fun way to engage with the shows and see how your thoughts evolve over time.\n\nYou can use a physical notebook, a note-taking app on your phone or tablet, or even create a spreadsheet to organize your thoughts. Some popular note-taking apps for TV shows include:\n\n1. TV Time: A dedicated app for tracking TV shows, with features like episode summaries, character guides, and discussion forums.\n2.
