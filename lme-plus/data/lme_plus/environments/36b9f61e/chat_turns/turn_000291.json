Boiling water: Boil the water for at least one minute and let it cool before using it for drinking, cooking, or brushing teeth.\n\n2. Water filtration: Use water filtration systems such as ceramic filters, UV filters, or reverse osmosis systems to remove contaminants from the water.\n\n3. Chemical treatment: Chemical treatment with disinfectants like chlorine, iodine, or other water purification tablets can help to kill bacteria and viruses.\n\n4. Disinfecting water storage facilities: Thoroughly clean and disinfect water storage tanks, reservoirs, and pipelines to get rid of harmful microorganisms.\n\n5. Use bottled water: Use bottled water as an alternative until the contamination is fixed.\n\n6. Enhance water supply: Provide a clean and safe water supply through tankers or by building new clean water sources.\n\n7. Provide medical attention: People who have already been exposed to contaminated water and are showing signs of infection such as diarrhea, fever, vomiting should seek medical attention immediately.\n\nThese measures can help to prevent the spread of water-borne infectious diseases even if the water supply is already contaminated.",
