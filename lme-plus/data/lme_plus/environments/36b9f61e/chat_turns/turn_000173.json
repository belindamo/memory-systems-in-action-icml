  "content": "You can definitely roll over any unused \"treat yourself\" budget to the next month. This approach is called a \"flexible budgeting\" approach.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Set your \"treat yourself\" budget for the month, let's say $225.\n2. If you don't use up the entire $225, the remaining amount carries over to the next month.\n3. The carried-over amount is added to the next month's \"treat yourself\" budget.\n\nFor example, let's say you only spend $150 in the current month, leaving $75 remaining. In the next month, your \"treat yourself\" budget would be $225 (new month's allocation) + $75 (carried over from previous month) = $300.\n\nThis approach allows you to:\n\n* Avoid feeling pressured to spend the entire budget just because it's available\n* Build up a buffer for future months when you might need it more\n* Make more intentional purchasing decisions, rather than impulsive ones\n\nHowever, it's essential to set some boundaries to avoid accumulating a large surplus. You might consider setting a \"cap\" on the carried-over amount, such as 2-3 months' worth of allocations. This will prevent your \"treat yourself\" budget from growing too large and potentially leading to overspending.\n\nHow does this sound? Are you comfortable with the idea of rolling over your \"treat yourself\" budget, or do you have any concerns?",
