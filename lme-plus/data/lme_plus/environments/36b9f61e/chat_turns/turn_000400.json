Here are the course formats and schedules to help you plan:\n\n**Course Formats:**\n\n1. **Live Online (LIVE)**: This format features live, interactive sessions with an instructor, allowing for real-time Q&A and discussions. You'll need to attend scheduled sessions at a specific time.\n2. **Simulcast (SIMU)**: This format is similar to Live Online, but you can attend the live sessions at a later time, within a specific window (e.g., 24 hours).\n3. **OnDemand (OND)**: This self-paced format allows you to access recorded sessions and complete the course at your own pace, within a specific time frame (e.g., 30 days).\n4. **In-Person (INP)**: Attend the course in person, at a designated location, with a live instructor.\n\n**Schedule:**\n\nFor the Live Online (LIVE) and Simulcast (SIMU) formats, you'll need to attend scheduled sessions, which typically follow this structure:\n\n* 6 days of instruction, with 2-3 hours of live sessions per day\n* Sessions are usually held in the morning or afternoon, depending on the time zone\n* You'll have breaks throughout the day, as well as time for lunch and dinner\n\nFor the OnDemand (OND) format, you can complete the course at your own pace, within the designated time frame.
