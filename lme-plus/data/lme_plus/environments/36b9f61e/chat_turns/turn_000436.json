That's definitely a labor of love.\n\nWeathering is a fantastic way to add realism to your models, and there are many products and techniques to choose from. I'd be happy to help you navigate the options.\n\nTo get started, let's break down the weathering process into three main categories:\n\n1. **Dirt and grime**: This includes adding subtle dirt, dust, and grime to the model's surface to give it a worn, used look. Products used for this step include:\n\t* Pigment powders (e.g., Vallejo, Mig Productions, or AK Interactive)\n\t* Washes (e.g., Citadel Shade, Vallejo Wash, or AK Interactive Wash)\n\t* Drybrushing with acrylic paints or pigments\n2. **Fading and wear**: This involves creating a sense of wear and tear on the model's surface, including fading, chipping, and scratches. Products used for this step include:\n\t* Acrylic paints (e.g., Vallejo, Tamiya, or Mr. Hobby)\n\t* Enamel paints (e.g., Tamiya or Testors)\n\t* Chipping mediums (e.g., Vallejo Chipping Medium or AK Interactive Chipping Fluid)\n3. **Rust and corrosion**: This adds a more extreme level of wear, with rust, corrosion, and decay. Products used for this step include:\n\t* Rust-colored pigments or paints (e.g., Vallejo, AK Interactive, or Mig Productions)\n\t* Rust effects products (e.g., Vallejo Rust Effect or AK Interactive Rust)\n\nSome popular weathering products and brands include:\n\n* Vallejo: Known for their wide range of weathering products, including pigments, washes, and effects.\n* AK Interactive: Offers a variety of weathering products, including pigments, washes, and chipping mediums.\n* Mig Productions: Specializes in weathering products, including pigments, washes, and rust effects.\n* Citadel: Games Workshop's Citadel brand offers a range of washes and paints suitable for weathering.\n\nWhen choosing products, consider the following:\n\n* Start with a smaller, more subtle effect and build up gradually. It's easier to add more weathering than it is to remove excess.\n* Experiment with different products and techniques on a test model or a small area before applying them to your main model.\n* Practice, practice, practice! Weathering is an art that requires patience and experimentation to achieve a realistic look.\n\nRemember, the key to realistic weathering is subtlety. Avoid overdoing it, as this can make your model look unrealistic or even comical.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your weathering journey!
