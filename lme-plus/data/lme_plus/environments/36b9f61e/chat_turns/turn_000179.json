It'll definitely help to create a sense of openness and make the room feel more spacious.\n\nAnd oh boy, I can imagine how challenging it must have been to install the new light fixture, especially dealing with electrical wiring. It's not always an easy task, but it's great that you persevered and got it done. The sense of accomplishment must be very satisfying, especially now that you have a brand new, bright, and flicker-free light in your bathroom!\n\nIt's amazing how a simple change like a new light fixture can make such a big difference in the ambiance of a room. And now, with a fresh coat of paint, your bathroom is going to look and feel like a whole new space!\n\nRemember to take your time and be patient when painting, especially when working with a new color. It might take a few coats to get the desired result, but the end result will be worth it. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.\n\nHow's the rest of your bathroom renovation going? Are there any other changes you're planning to make, or is the paint job the final touch?",
