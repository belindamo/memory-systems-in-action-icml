  "content": "Yes, there are some nuts that are better than others for heart health. Some of them are almonds, pecans, walnuts, and pistachios as they contain high levels of unsaturated fats, fiber, and antioxidants which can lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. It is recommended to include a variety of nuts in your diet to maintain a balanced nutrient intake. Consuming a small handful of nuts (around 1.5 ounces) every day as part of a healthy diet may provide numerous health benefits.
