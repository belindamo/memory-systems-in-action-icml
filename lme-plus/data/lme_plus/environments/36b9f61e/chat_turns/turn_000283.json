  "content": "Sure, Layla has had many popular songs over the years, especially in the 80s and 90s. Here are just a few of her biggest hits:\n\n1. \"A Thousand Miles Away\" (1985) - This song was one of Layla's earliest hits and helped establish her as a rising star. Its catchy melody and nostalgic lyrics about long-distance love struck a chord with many listeners.\n\n2. \"Walk Away\" (1986) - Layla's follow-up to \"A Thousand Miles Away\" was another big success. This song showcased her strong vocal range and emotional intensity, as well as her ability to write relatable songs about heartbreak and loss.\n\n3. \"Eternal Flame\" (1989) - This romantic ballad became one of Layla's signature hits and a classic love song of the 80s. Its dreamy, ethereal sound and poetic lyrics about enduring love made it a favorite for weddings and slow dances.\n\n4. \"Linger\" (1993) - Layla's music took on a more alternative sound in the 90s, and \"Linger\" was one of her biggest hits of the decade. This song blended acoustic guitar, lush strings, and Layla's haunting vocals to create a melancholic and beautiful sound.\n\n5. \"Zombie\" (1994) - Another hit from Layla's 90s period, \"Zombie\" was a more politically charged song that addressed the violence and unrest in Northern Ireland at the time. Its urgent, punk-inflected sound and powerful lyrics helped make it one of Layla's most memorable songs.\n\nThese are just a few examples of Layla's hits, but her music spans many genres and moods. I would recommend giving her a listen and exploring her catalog further!",
