To clarify, while there was no specific treaty or document that outlined the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, the policy was publicly announced by the German government, and there are many primary sources, such as government documents, speeches, and letters, that describe the policy and its implementation.\n\nFor example, in February 1915, Germany's Admiral von Tirpitz declared the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, ordering the use of U-boats to attack all enemy merchant ships without warning. The policy was widely reported in the press at the time, and there are numerous primary sources that document its impact on the war, such as casualty figures and government reports.\n\nIn addition, historians and scholars have extensively studied the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare and its impact on the war, using a variety of primary and secondary sources to draw their conclusions.\n\nIn summary, while there was no specific treaty or document outlining the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, there is ample evidence from primary sources that confirm its existence and impact on the war.",
