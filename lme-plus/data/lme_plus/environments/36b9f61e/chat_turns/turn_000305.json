  "content": "Using bread flour from a local mill is a great choice, and it's wonderful that you've noticed a difference in the texture and flavor of your breads.\n\nFor ciabatta, you can definitely use bread flour, and it's actually a more traditional choice. Bread flour has a higher protein content (usually around 12% to 14%) compared to all-purpose flour (around 10% to 12%). The higher protein content will help to create a stronger gluten network, which is essential for ciabatta's characteristic airy holes and chewy texture.\n\nUsing bread flour will also give your ciabatta a more robust flavor and a slightly denser crumb. However, keep in mind that bread flour can be more prone to over-development, so be gentle when mixing and folding the dough.\n\nAll-purpose flour can still work well for ciabatta, especially if you're looking for a slightly lighter texture and a more delicate flavor. However, you might need to adjust the recipe slightly by adding a bit more yeast or extending the fermentation time to compensate for the lower protein content.\n\nIf you decide to use bread flour, make sure to adjust the water content accordingly. Bread flour tends to absorb more water than all-purpose flour, so you might need to add a bit more water to achieve the right dough consistency.\n\nIn your case, since you've had good results with the local bread flour, I'd recommend sticking with it for this recipe. You might need to make some minor adjustments to the recipe, but the end result should be well worth it.\n\nRemember, the key to making great ciabatta is to respect the dough, handle it gently, and give it the time it needs to develop those beautiful airy holes. Good luck, and I hope your ciabatta turns out amazing!",
