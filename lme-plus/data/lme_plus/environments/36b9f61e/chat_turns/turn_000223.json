  "content": "The speaker is discussing the lack of representation of minorities in the Israeli Supreme Court and how they don't see themselves represented. They talk about the privilege of being in the first or second Israel, and how they have no real savings apart from their pension. The speaker talks about their difficult childhood during the Holocaust and how their parents were not allowed to work or teach in Israel. They ask why they are considered the first Israel and not the second Israel.\nThe speaker is discussing the achievements of Aaron Bozgelo, a brilliant child of immigrants from Morocco, and how the committee for selecting judges was looking to have more Arabs and Easterners as well as religious and ultra-Orthodox judges. They were looking for the best out of 70 possible judges, but there were only 15 Spanish judges. There was no ill will or racism behind it, and they were searching for Spaniards.\nThe speaker is discussing the appointment of an expert to the Supreme Court and how it was prevented. They explain that the person was not worthy for appointment due to their journalistic writing in the press. The speaker then addresses mistakes made during their judicial revolution, which may have been too far-reaching, too inclusive and too liberal for the Israeli public. They acknowledge hearing these voices since 1995 when the verdict in the United Mizrahi Bank case was given.\nJudge Barak was warned that he was running too fast, but he argued that they needed more rights and he could not create them as a judge. He believes his position fits Israeli society, which is a society with a history of suffering and immigrants from different countries. He was given an instruction by the Knesset to recognize the right to human dignity and that any laws that violate human dignity should be considered unconstitutional.\nEber and the speaker discuss the possibility of a country where the people do not want rights or a constitution. Eber expresses his hope that the people will stand up for their rights, while the speaker believes that if the people want a dictatorship, there will be enough dictators willing to serve them. The speaker then talks about his own experiences in the Holocaust, and his desire to keep his family in their land and have a garden in Israel. He concludes that without a spirit of freedom and aspiration for rights, no court will be effective.\nA person recounts their experiences as a child in Europe during the Nazi invasion. They remember being pushed into a small neighborhood and living in a ghetto with constant hunger. They recall playing on the street, but also the fear of being harmed or killed by a German soldier.\nIn the ghetto, there was a central square called Democracy Square, where all the Jews were asked to enter. Families had to take their children under 9 out on the road and put them in tour cars to be murdered in a children's action. A Jewish boy of 8-9 years old was dressed up as an older person and taken to his father's workplace. A German officer asked him his age, and his answer determined if he would live or die.\nA 12-year-old was in the ghetto and was challenged by the rule of law. They had to find a Thai man willing to take them out, and they were put in a box with a German soldier sitting on top. The policeman was bribed and the box was opened, allowing them to escape to a safe place with their mother.\nA child and his mother were hiding inside a double wall in a Lithuanian village. The child was not a typical Lithuanian child and the double wall was made in one of the rooms. The mother taught him arithmetic, geography, and history while they were in the wall. The father didn't care to get them out, but the child did not seem to be mad at him. The mother however may have been mad at him for other issues.\nA person recounts a formative experience of their life in which they and their family had to flee their home and travel on top of a train to escape the Soviet regime. They describe how they had to learn to survive and evade robbers, and how they were seen as an academic and an elite by some people.\nThe conversation discusses the end of World War II, where the train stopped and horns began to blow. The speakers talk about the future and their experience of persecution without human rights. They remember a Jewish brigade symbol with the Star of David, and how a Jewish soldier saved them. They discuss their judicial philosophy of protecting both national security and human rights, and how these two can live together.\nThe speaker is discussing the importance of the state, the necessity of security procedures to protect human rights, and the Law of Return which grants Jews a \"golden key\" to enter the State of Israel. They then recall returning to Kovna and meeting the family that saved them during the Holocaust. The family's daughter explained that they took the risk because they were strict Catholics.\nA large demonstration was held in Israel in 1999 in response to a series of decisions made by the Supreme Court, including the question of who is a Jew. The demonstration was organized by ultra-Orthodox Jews from various factions and was attended by more than a quarter of a million people. The organizers insisted on emphasizing a short prayer and the banners they waved indicated their opposition to the judicial dictatorship. Today, security officials in the legal system continue to use the demonstration as an example of power.\nMr. Judge is asked how he feels when hundreds of thousands of Israelis demonstrate at his workplace. He states that he is not cold-hearted and that the leaders of the ultra-orthodox had come to him asking him not to interfere in matters of religion and state. He also notes that he has not sought psychological support in the face of the pressures he has faced. The lawyer Jacob Weinroth commented on Mr. Judge, saying that his mental structure is like that of a religious person, and that he dreams of living in a society that rules universal values.\nThe speaker is a soldier in the army of the law and comes from an ultra-Orthodox religious family. At family events, the ultra-orthodox faction sees the speaker as a demon and it hurts him. The Supreme Court is supposed to be both Jewish and democratic, and the speaker identifies more with the Democratic Party. He wishes he knew more about Jewish Hebrew law and Talmud, but does not think that democracy should have a heavier weight than Jewishness; they are equal.",
