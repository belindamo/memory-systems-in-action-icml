  "content": "Yes, some nuts are good for improving brain function as they contain nutrients like vitamin E, antioxidants, and healthy fats that support brain health. Some nuts that are particularly beneficial in this regard include walnuts, almond, hazelnuts, and peanuts.\n\nWalnuts contain omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and antioxidants that have been shown to improve cognitive function and memory. Almonds are rich in vitamin E, which can protect the brain from damage caused by oxidative stress. Hazelnuts contain folate, which can enhance cognitive function, while peanuts are rich in niacin, which aids in brain function.\n\nIt is recommended to consume a small handful of nuts (around 1.5 ounces) daily as part of a healthy and balanced diet to see a positive impact on brain function. However, it is important to remember that nuts are high in calories, so it is important to consume them in moderation to maintain a healthy weight.",
