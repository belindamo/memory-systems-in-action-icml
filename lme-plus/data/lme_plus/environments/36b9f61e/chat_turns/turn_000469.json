  "content": "Germany declared war on France and Russia in August 1914, at the beginning of World War I. The immediate cause of Germany's declaration of war was the activation of military alliances between European powers.\n\nAt the time, Europe was divided into two main alliances: the Triple Entente, consisting of France, Russia, and Britain, and the Central Powers, consisting of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy (which later switched sides). When Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 1914, it triggered a series of events that led to the activation of these alliances.\n\nRussia, as Serbia's ally, mobilized its army to defend Serbia, which Germany saw as a threat to its own interests. In response, Germany declared war on Russia on August 1, 1914. France, as Russia's ally, then mobilized its army to defend itself, and Germany declared war on France on August 3, 1914.\n\nGermany's decision to declare war on France and Russia was also influenced by its desire to gain territory and assert its dominance in Europe. Germany's leaders believed that a quick victory over France and Russia would allow them to consolidate their power and secure their position as a leading European power.\n\nIn summary, Germany declared war on France and Russia in August 1914 as a result of the activation of military alliances and its desire to gain territory and assert its dominance in Europe.",
