  "content": "The policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was declared by Germany as a government policy rather than being formally written down in a specific document or treaty. The German government made public statements announcing the policy and its intentions, and it was widely understood by both the German Navy and its opponents.\n\nThe policy was first declared in February 1915 by Germany's Admiral von Tirpitz, who ordered the unrestricted use of U-boats to attack all enemy merchant ships. This decision was made in response to the British naval blockade that was strangling the German economy.\n\nThe policy was later suspended in response to diplomatic pressure, but was resumed in February 1917 when Germany believed it could win the war before the United States could enter on the side of the Allies. This decision ultimately contributed to the entry of the United States into the war in April 1917.\n\nIn summary, while the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was not formally written down in a specific document or treaty, it was declared as a government policy by Germany and widely understood by both the German Navy and its opponents.",
