  "content": "With those dimensions, let's calculate the surface area of your raised bed.\n\nSince you're interested in the area for your garden party, we'll focus on the top surface area of the raised bed, which is a rectangle. The formula to calculate the area of a rectangle is:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n\nIn your case, the length is 8 feet and the width is 4 feet, so:\n\nArea = 8 ft x 4 ft = 32 square feet\n\nSo, the surface area of your raised bed is 32 square feet.\n\nNow, considering your garden party, you might want to think about the space needed for your guests to move around comfortably. A general rule of thumb is to allocate at least 10-15 square feet per guest. This will give them enough room to stand, move around, and socialize.\n\nHow many guests do you plan to invite to your garden party?",
