  "content": "The policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was a naval warfare strategy used by Germany during World War I. The policy involved German submarines, known as U-boats, attacking any and all ships, including civilian vessels, that entered waters around Britain and other parts of Europe. This was in contrast to the previously used \"cruiser rules,\" which required submarines to surface and allow crew and passengers to abandon ship before being sunk.\n\nThe German government declared unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1915, in response to the British naval blockade that was strangling the German economy. The goal of the policy was to disrupt the flow of supplies to Britain and its allies and to force them to negotiate a peace settlement.\n\nUnrestricted submarine warfare led to a significant increase in the number of ships sunk, including many neutral vessels. The sinking of the British passenger liner RMS Lusitania in May 1915, which resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people, including 128 Americans, led to widespread international outrage and pressure on Germany to change its policy.\n\nIn response to diplomatic pressure, Germany suspended unrestricted submarine warfare in September 1915, but resumed it in February 1917, hoping to win the war before the United States could enter on the side of the Allies. However, this decision ultimately contributed to the United States entering the war in April 1917.\n\nIn summary, the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was a naval warfare strategy used by Germany during World War I. It involved attacking any and all ships, including civilian vessels, in an attempt to disrupt the flow of supplies to Britain and its allies. The policy had significant consequences, including the sinking of neutral vessels and the eventual entry of the United States into the war.",
