  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on ergonomic chairs. I've been experiencing back problems from my old desk chair, and I'm considering splurging on a high-end one. By the way, I just set up my new queen-sized bed frame yesterday, and it's been a game-changer for my sleep - I got rid of my old college-era futon and replaced it with this new one, and it's made a huge difference. Do you have any recommendations for ergonomic chairs that would be good for back support?",
