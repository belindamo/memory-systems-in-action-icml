  "content": "Page 91: Common Math Misconceptions\n\nMisconceptions can hinder your progress in math and lead to incorrect solutions. Here are some common math misconceptions to avoid:\n\n1. Division is the opposite of multiplication - While it is true that division and multiplication are inverse operations, subtraction is actually the opposite of addition. Division can be thought of as repeated subtraction.\n2. You should always simplify fractions - While simplifying fractions can make them easier to work with, it is not always necessary. In some cases, leaving a fraction unsimplified can actually make it easier to work with.\n3. Decimals are always less than fractions - This is not always true. Decimals and fractions can represent the same value, and whether one is greater than the other depends on the specific numbers involved.\n4. Negative numbers can't have square roots - This is also not true. While the square root of a negative number is not a real number, it is possible to work with complex numbers that include a square root of -1.\n5. The order of operations is always \"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally\" - While this is a common mnemonic device for remembering the order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right), other mnemonics or simply remembering the acronym PEMDAS (or BODMAS in some countries) can also work.\n\nBy avoiding these and other common misconceptions, you can improve your understanding of math and avoid mistakes in your work.",
