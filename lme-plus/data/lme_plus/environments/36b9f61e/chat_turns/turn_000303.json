Here's a recipe and some tips to help you achieve that characteristic ciabatta texture:\n\n**Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup warm water (around 90\u00b0F to 100\u00b0F)\n* 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast\n* 3 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n\nBiga (preferment):\n\n* 1/2 cup warm water\n* 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast\n* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Make the biga:** In a small bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and 1/2 cup of flour. Mix until smooth, cover, and let it rest at room temperature (around 70\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F) for 12 to 24 hours. The biga should be bubbly, frothy, and almost double in size.\n2. **Mix the dough:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour. Mix until shaggy, then add the biga and mix until fully incorporated.\n3. **Knead the dough:** Using a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or by hand, knead the dough for 10 to 15 minutes, until it becomes smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky.\n4. **First fermentation:** Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it rest at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n5. **Fold and shape:** Gently fold the dough over itself 3 to 4 times, then shape it into a long, thin rectangle. Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface or a silicone mat.\n6. **Second fermentation:** Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rest for another 1 to 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size again.\n7. **Shape and proof:** Gently shape the dough into a ciabatta shape (a long, thin rectangle with a slight curve). Place it onto a baking sheet or proofing basket lined with parchment paper, cover with plastic wrap or a clean towel, and let it proof for 1 to 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size again.\n8. **Bake:** Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) with a baking stone or baking steel inside. Place the ciabatta onto the preheated stone or steel and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.\n\n**Tips for getting airy holes:**\n\n1. **Use a preferment:** The biga helps to develop the gluten and creates a more complex flavor profile, which contributes to the airy holes.\n2. **Use a high-protein flour:** All-purpose flour with a high protein content (around 12% to 14%) will help to create a stronger gluten network, leading to better hole structure.\n3. **Keep the dough gentle:** Avoid over-mixing or over-kneading the dough, as this can develop the gluten too much and lead to a dense bread.\n4. **Use a gentle folding technique:** When folding the dough, use a gentle, gentle touch to avoid developing the gluten too much.\n5. **Respect the fermentation times:** Give the dough enough time to ferment and develop the necessary air pockets. Rushing the process can lead to a dense bread.\n6. **Score the bread:** Before baking, use a lame or a sharp knife to make a few shallow cuts on the surface of the bread. This will help the bread to expand and create more airy holes during baking.\n7. **Steam during baking:** Create steam in your oven",
