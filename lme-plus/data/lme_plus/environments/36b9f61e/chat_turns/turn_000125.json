  "content": "The Canon EF 35mm f/2 IS USM is an excellent lens for street photography, and it's a great choice for a prime lens. The 35mm focal length is wide enough to capture the scene, but still allows for a decent working distance, and the f/2 aperture creates a beautiful bokeh. The image stabilization (IS) will also help you to take sharp photos in low-light conditions.\n\nIt's great to hear that you're enjoying editing your photos in Lightroom! It's an incredibly powerful tool, and the online communities can be super helpful in learning new techniques and getting feedback on your work. Lightroom is an excellent choice for editing, especially for beginners, as it's user-friendly and offers a wide range of tools and presets to help you achieve the look you want.\n\nIf you're new to Lightroom, I recommend checking out some online tutorials and YouTube channels, such as Tony & Chelsea Northrup, Peter McKinnon, or Phlearn. They offer a wealth of information on how to use Lightroom, as well as tips and tricks for editing your photos.\n\nAlso, it's great that you're getting feedback on your work from online communities! Feedback is an essential part of improving your photography skills, and it's excellent that you're taking the time to share your work and learn from others.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and keep practicing! The more you shoot and edit, the better you'll become. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need any further recommendations.\n\nNow, get out there and take some amazing photos with your new lens!",
