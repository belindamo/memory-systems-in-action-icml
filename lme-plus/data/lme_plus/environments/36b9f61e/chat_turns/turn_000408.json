Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Online Classes:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Convenience: You can attend from the comfort of your own home, at any time that suits you.\n* Flexibility: Online classes often offer flexible scheduling, which can be ideal if you have a busy schedule.\n* Accessibility: You can access online classes from anywhere, which is great if you live in a rural area or have mobility issues.\n\nCons:\n\n* Lack of hands-on practice: You might not get to practice with your camera as much as you would in an in-person class.\n* Limited feedback: You might not receive immediate feedback on your work, which can be helpful for improvement.\n* Social isolation: You might not get to interact with others as much, which could limit your opportunities to make connections.\n\n**In-Person Classes:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Hands-on practice: You'll get to practice with your camera and receive feedback from the instructor and peers.\n* Immediate feedback: You'll receive instant feedback on your work, which can help you improve faster.\n* Social interaction: You'll have the opportunity to meet and interact with like-minded people, which can lead to new connections and friendships.\n\nCons:\n\n* Limited scheduling: In-person classes often have fixed schedules, which might not fit your busy schedule.\n* Location constraints: You need to travel to the class location, which can be a challenge if you live far away.\n\nConsidering your goal of meeting new people and making friends, I'd recommend starting with an in-person class. This will give you the opportunity to interact with others who share your interest in photography, which can lead to meaningful connections.\n\nHowever, if you're shy or prefer to start with a more comfortable setting, an online class can be a great way to dip your toes into photography and get a feel for the subject matter. You can always transition to an in-person class later on.\n\nSome popular online platforms for photography classes include:\n\n* Udemy\n* Skillshare\n* Coursera\n* CreativeLive\n\nFor in-person classes, you can search online for photography classes in your area, check with local community colleges, or look for photography stores that offer workshops and classes.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to take that first step and sign up for a class that excites you!",
