Simply toss your chosen veggies with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven until tender and caramelized.\n3. **Green Salad**: A simple mixed green salad with a light vinaigrette dressing provides a refreshing contrast to the rich, comforting pasta.\n4. **Grilled Chicken or Shrimp**: Adding some protein to the dish can make it more substantial.
