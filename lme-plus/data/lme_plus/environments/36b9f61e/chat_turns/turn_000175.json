Here are some suggestions that would work beautifully:\n\n1. **Soft Whites and Creams**: These classic shades will reflect light and make the room feel even brighter. Consider warm whites like Sherwin-Williams' \"Comfort Gray\" or Valspar's \"Creamy White.\"\n2. **Pastel Hues**: Soft, gentle colors like pale pink, baby blue, or mint green can add a touch of serenity to your bathroom. These shades will also help to create a calming atmosphere.\n3. **Light Grays**: A light gray can help to balance out the brightness of the natural light. Look for a shade with a slight warm undertone, like Benjamin Moore's \"Sand Dune\" or Behr's \"Soft Chamois.\"\n4. **Warm Neutrals**: Colors like beige, champagne, or soft taupe can complement the natural light and create a cozy feel in the bathroom. Try Farrow & Ball's \"Elephant's Breath\" or Behr's \"Soft Mocha.\"\n5. **Blues and Greens**: If you want to emphasize the natural light, consider a pale blue or green shade. These colors can make the room feel fresher and more calming. Look at options like Sherwin-Williams' \"Sea Salt\" or Valspar's \"Fresh Mint.\"\n\nRemember to always test the paint colors on your bathroom walls with a sample swatch before committing to a specific shade.
