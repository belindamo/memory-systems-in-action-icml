Here are some tips to help you create a visually appealing display:\n\n1. **Start with a theme**: Choose a theme or style that resonates with your personal taste and the overall aesthetic of your living room. This will help guide your selection of decorative items.\n2. **Balance and symmetry**: Create balance by distributing items of varying heights, textures, and shapes. Symmetry can add visual appeal, but feel free to experiment with asymmetry for a more eclectic look.\n3. **Grouping**: Group similar items together, like a collection of vases or a set of books, to create a cohesive look.\n4. **Visual hierarchy**: Place larger or more striking items in the center, with smaller items radiating outward. This creates a sense of visual flow.\n5. **Texture and material variety**: Mix different textures, such as glass, wood, metal, and fabric, to add depth and interest.\n6. **Add a focal point**: Designate a statement piece, like a beautiful vase or a sculptural object, to draw the eye.\n7. **Keep it edited**: Don't overcrowd the table.
