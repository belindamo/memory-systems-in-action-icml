She carries a sleek, high-tech rifle that she is extremely skilled in using.\n\nPassive: Supportive Fire - When Faith's support takes a kill that was meant for Faith, the kill is credited to Faith and she gains a significant amount of bonus gold. This passive encourages Faith to coordinate with her support and ensures that she is rewarded for her contributions to the team.\n\nAbilities:\n\n* Precision Shot: Faith charges up a powerful shot that deals increased damage based on the target's missing health.\n* Rapid Fire: Faith unleashes a rapid burst of shots that deal damage to all enemies in a cone in front of her.\n* Covering Fire: Faith sets up a defensive position and begins firing at enemies, dealing damage and slowing them.\n* Ultimate: True Aim: Faith enters a state of heightened focus, greatly increasing her attack speed and critical hit chance for a short duration.\n\nOverall, Faith is a powerful ADC with a unique passive that rewards her for working closely with her support.
