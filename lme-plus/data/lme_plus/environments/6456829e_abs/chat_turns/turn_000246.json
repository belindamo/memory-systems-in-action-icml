When it comes to pairing herbs with pasta, olive oil, and garlic, here are some classic combinations that you might enjoy:\n\n1. **Basil**: A classic Italian herb, basil pairs beautifully with olive oil, garlic, and pasta. Try using fresh basil leaves, either chopped or torn, to add a bright, summery flavor to your Spaghetti Aglio e Olio.\n2. **Parsley**: Similar to basil, parsley adds a fresh, green flavor to pasta dishes. Use curly-leaf or flat-leaf parsley, and chop it finely to sprinkle over your pasta.\n3. **Oregano**: Oregano has a pungent, earthy flavor that complements olive oil and garlic nicely. Use fresh or dried oregano leaves to add depth to your pasta dishes, especially those with tomato-based sauces.\n4. **Thyme**: Thyme has a slightly minty, herbaceous flavor that pairs well with olive oil and garlic. Use fresh or dried thyme leaves to add a subtle, savory flavor to your pasta dishes.\n5. **Rosemary**: Rosemary has a piney, herbaceous flavor that pairs well with olive oil and garlic. Use fresh or dried rosemary leaves to add a fragrant, savory flavor to your pasta dishes, especially those with meat or vegetables.\n6. **Sage**: Sage has a slightly bitter, earthy flavor that pairs well with olive oil and garlic.
