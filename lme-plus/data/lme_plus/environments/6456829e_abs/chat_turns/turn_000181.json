  "content": "Rewritten:\n\nRetention Clause in Contracts\n\nA retention clause in a construction contract specifies the amount of money that will be retained and outlines the terms for when and how it will be paid back, as agreed upon by both parties. The percentage of retention money that is withheld can vary depending on the terms of the contract.\n\nIn Queensland, a typical construction contract will have 5% of the contract value held as retention money. Alternatively, it could be a 10% deduction for each progress payment you receive. It's important that the amount of retention money is clearly stated on your payment invoice.\n\nRemember: The percentage of retention money can vary depending on what is agreed upon in the contract.\n\nFor construction projects worth over $20 million, the retention money must be placed in a trust fund. The head contractor is responsible for maintaining the trust fund and must provide annual account statements to Fair Trading. The head contractor is also responsible for withdrawing money from the trust fund as agreed upon in the contract, meaning that the terms of the retention clause will dictate how and when you receive the funds.\n\nIf you have trouble claiming your retention money, don't hesitate to contact Contracts Specialist Brisbane for expert advice. We offer a free initial consultation to help you get the payment you deserve without any stress or hassle.",
