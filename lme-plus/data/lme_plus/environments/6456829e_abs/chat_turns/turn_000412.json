  "content": "revise: System 2 SC \u2013 Interoperable, Generative, and Intervenable SK Communication: Towards unleashing the full potential of SC by overcoming the limitation of System 1 SC, in the next several years, I will form the theme of my research by putting forward to \u201cAI-Native and Knowledge-Driven System 2 SC.\u201d As Fig. X illustrates, System 2 SC is built upon System 1 SC in the sense that System 2 SC communicates the semantic knowledge (SK) through background communication, which is extracted from the NN trained during System 1 SC communicating SRs via foreground communication. \n\nWhile System 1 SC is in pursuit of communicating minimal, invariant, and sufficient SRs, System 2 SC focuses on communicating and exploiting interoperable, generative, and intervenable SKs. \nTo pioneer this new research area while mitigating high risks, as Fig. X illustrates, I plan to tackle the three desiderata of System 2 SC through work packages (WPs) 1-3 that are delineated in the following section.",
