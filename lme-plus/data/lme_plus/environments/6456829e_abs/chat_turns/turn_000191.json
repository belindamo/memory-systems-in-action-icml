  "content": "Sure, here's an updated version of Havoc's passive:\n\nPassive: Scavenger's Instinct - When Havoc's support takes a kill that was meant for Havoc, Havoc is credited with the kill and gains a small bonus of attack damage. If Pyke is Havoc's support, Havoc instead gains a moderate bonus of attack damage. This passive encourages Havoc to coordinate with his support and ensures that he is rewarded for his contributions to the team.\n\nOverall, Havoc is a formidable ADC with a passive that rewards him for coordinating with his support, especially when Pyke is his support. He excels at taking out enemy champions from a distance and can provide sustained damage in team fights with his abilities.",
