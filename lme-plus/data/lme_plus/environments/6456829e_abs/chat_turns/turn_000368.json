  "content": "I actually have been experimenting with Korean recipes at home, and I've had some successes and failures. I mentioned earlier that I bought a Korean cookbook and started trying out recipes. The kimchi stew turned out great, but the spicy rice cakes were a bit of a disaster, as I added too much gochujang. But I'm eager to continue learning and improving my Korean cooking skills. Do you have any recommendations for Korean BBQ-style recipes that I could try at home? Specifically, I'd love to recreate those delicious beef short ribs I've been having at my favorite restaurant.",
