Fortunately, there are alternative methods for bending and shaping PE parts that don't involve heat. Here are a few options:\n\n**1. Gentle bending**\n\n* Use a PE bending tool or a similar tool to gently bend the part. Apply gentle, consistent pressure to avoid breaking the part.\n* Use a flat surface, like a credit card or a similar tool, to help bend the part.\n\n**2. Shaping with a file or sandpaper**\n\n* Use a fine-grit file or sandpaper to shape and smooth out the part. This method works well for small, intricate details.\n* Be cautious not to apply too much pressure, as this can cause the part to bend or break.\n\n**3. Using a PE bending jig or template**\n\n* Create or purchase a bending jig or template specifically designed for the part. This will help you achieve accurate bends and shapes.\n* Use a PE bending tool or a similar tool to bend the part along the jig or template.\n\n**4. Shaping with a metal forming tool**\n\n* Use a metal forming tool, like a stake set or a forming pliers, to shape and bend the part. These tools are designed to shape metal without applying excessive pressure.\n* Be gentle and patient when using these tools to avoid breaking the part.\n\n**5. Using a rubber or plastic bending pad**\n\n* Place the PE part on a rubber or plastic bending pad, which will help distribute the pressure evenly and prevent breakage.\n* Use a PE bending tool or a similar tool to bend the part while it's on the pad.\n\n**Tips and tricks**\n\n* Always work slowly and patiently when bending or shaping PE parts to avoid breaking them.\n* Use a magnifying glass or a loupe to inspect the part and ensure you're not applying too much pressure.\n* If you do break a part, don't worry! You can often repair it by applying a small amount of adhesive and re-shaping the part.\n\nBy using these alternative methods, you can shape and bend your PE parts without the risks associated with annealing. Remember to always prioritize safety and take your time when working with these delicate parts.",
