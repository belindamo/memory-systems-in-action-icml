Dryness at the ends is a common issue, especially when transitioning to a new hair care routine. Don't worry, I've got some fantastic eco-friendly hair mask and deep conditioning treatment recommendations for you:\n\n**Hair Masks:**\n\n1. **Coconut Oil Mask**: Coconut oil is an excellent moisturizer that can help nourish and hydrate your hair. Apply a generous amount of coconut oil to your hair, from roots to ends, and leave it on for at least an hour or overnight. Shampoo and condition as usual.\n2. **Avocado and Banana Mask**: Mash ripe avocado and banana together, then mix in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of honey. Apply to your hair and leave on for 15-30 minutes. Rinse with warm water and shampoo as usual.\n3. **Argan Oil and Aloe Vera Mask**: Mix equal parts argan oil and aloe vera gel. Apply to your hair, focusing on the ends, and leave on for 30 minutes to an hour. Shampoo and condition as usual.\n\n**Deep Conditioning Treatments:**\n\n1. **Green Earth Deep Conditioning Treatment**: Since you're already using Green Earth products, you might want to try their deep conditioning treatment. It's likely formulated to work well with their shampoo and conditioner.\n2. **Acure Deep Conditioning Mask**: Acure is a popular eco-friendly hair care brand that offers a range of deep conditioning masks. Look for their argan stem cell + argan oil mask or their burdock root + quinoa protein mask.\n3. **Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Mask**: Briogeo is another eco-friendly brand that offers a range of natural hair care products. Their deep conditioning mask is formulated with antioxidants and natural oils to nourish and repair damaged hair.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Always do a patch test before applying a new hair mask or deep conditioning treatment to ensure you're not allergic to any ingredients.\n* Apply the mask or treatment to your hair after shampooing, while your hair is still damp.\n* Use a wide-tooth comb or a detangling brush to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.\n* Leave the mask or treatment on for at least 15-30 minutes to allow the ingredients to penetrate your hair.\n* Shampoo and condition your hair as usual after the treatment.\n\nRemember to follow the instructions on the product label, and start with a small amount to ensure you're not over-treating your hair. You can always adjust the amount and frequency of use based on your hair's response.\n\nI hope these recommendations help you find the perfect hydrating hair mask or deep conditioning treatment to complement your Green Earth shampoo and conditioner!",
