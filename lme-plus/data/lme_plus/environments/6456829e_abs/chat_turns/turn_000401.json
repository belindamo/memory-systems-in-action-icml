  "content": "Motivations and Goals for Semantic Communication (SC) in 6G:\n\nSemantic Communication (SC) has the potential to revolutionize communication architectures and algorithms in 6G systems by enabling intelligent and sustainable communication. While traditional communication systems focus on accurately reproducing source data in bits, SC pre-processes the bits to extract and deliver the meaning of the bits, i.e., semantics, and post-processes the received semantics to maximize their effectiveness in a given application-specific task. By leveraging the invariant property of semantics, SC enables data-type transformation, greatly reducing communication payload sizes and latency.\n\nThe goal of System 1 SC is to implement semantic pre/post-processing through the autoencoder (AE) architecture, a neural network comprising an encoder and a decoder. The success of System 1 SC rests on learning semantic representations (SRs) that are minimal, invariant, and sufficient to carry out a given task. While existing works have shown the feasibility of System 1 SC in complex real data in vision, audio, and other high-stake applications, its fundamental limitations arise from its data-driven nature, making it biased towards the data, channels, and tasks considered during training. Additionally, the AE architecture is ill-suited for tasks other than reconstruction and requires re-training for any changes in the system.\n\nThe motivation for advancing SC in 6G is to overcome the limitations of System 1 SC and explore new avenues for semantic communication. This includes developing new SC methods that are task-specific, flexible, and scalable, and integrating SC with other emerging technologies such as edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). The goal is to enable SC to support a wide range of applications and use cases, including virtual and augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and healthcare, to name a few. By achieving this goal, SC can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of communication in 6G systems.",
