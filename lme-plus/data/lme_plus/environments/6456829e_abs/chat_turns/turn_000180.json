  "content": "Part 3:\n\nRetention Clause in Contracts\n\nThe retention clause in a contract describes the amount of money to be retained. It also describes when and how will this amount be paid back, as agreed by both parties. The percentage of retention money withheld could be different from contract to contract.\n\nHow much can a principal hold as Retention Money?\nA usual construction contract will have 5% of the contract\u2019s value as the amount of retention money. It can also be a 10% deduction for the payment you have recieved each progress payment. The amount of retention money should also reflect on your payment invoice.\n\nRemember: The percentages will still vary depending what you have agreed in the contract regarding retentions.\n\nBut, for construction projects valuing over $20 million, the retention money should be put in a trust fund. The head contractor is responsible for maintaining the trust fund and is obligated to give out annual account statements to Fair Trading.\n\nThe head contractor is also responsible for withdrawing money to the trust fund as agreed in the contract. Meaning, what you and the head contractor agreed on the retention clause will stand in terms of getting these funds.\n\nInstruction Reminders:\n\nEnsure to apply the relevant laws and legislation in Queensland, Australia during the rewriting process and target to Home Owners as the persona.
