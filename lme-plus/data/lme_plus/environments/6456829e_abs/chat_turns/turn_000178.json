  "content": "Part 2:\n\nConstruction Retention\nBasically, retention in construction is the act of holding off an amount of money until the construction project gets completed. This \u2018retained\u2019 money serves as a security that the subcontractor will do their job well and on schedule.\n\nThis also safeguards the principal contractor from paying extra for delays and defects. Time frames apply on the exact time when a subcontractor could claim this retained money. Usually, this money can be claimed after the actual building\u2019s completion and/or after the defects liability period.\n\nBut, if they are giving you a bad time in getting this money back, then you can file for adjudication. As mandated by law, the money retention can also happen while undergoing adjudication. This can happen when you have filed for adjudication and would receive the money as an adjudicated amount.\n\nIf you want to enforce your right on retention money, call Contracts Specialist. With the right advice, you can get fully paid stress-free. The first consultation is free too.\n\nInstruction Reminders:\n\nEnsure to apply the relevant laws and legislation in Queensland, Australia during the rewriting process and target to Home Owners as the persona.
