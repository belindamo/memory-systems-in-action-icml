  "content": "Excellent goals! Being more mindful of your travel schedule and pacing yourself will definitely help reduce burnout. Grouping trips together and leaving buffer time between them can make a big difference. And kudos to you for considering alternative modes of transportation to reduce your carbon footprint! \n\nRegarding your portable power bank charger, don't worry! You should be able to find one at the Denver airport. Most airports have electronics stores or kiosks that sell phone accessories, including portable power bank chargers. If you're short on time, you can try checking the airport's website or mobile app to see if they have any stores that sell chargers.\n\nIf you have time before your flight, you could also try picking one up at a nearby electronics store or a convenience store that sells phone accessories. However, if you're running low on time, it's likely you'll be able to find one at the airport.\n\nRemember to double-check the compatibility of the charger with your portable power bank before making a purchase, just in case.\n\nSafe travels to Denver, and I hope you have a great time with your family!",
