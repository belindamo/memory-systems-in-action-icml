  "content": "Sure, here's a revised version of the champion:\n\nName: Havoc\n\nAppearance: Havoc is a rugged, seasoned marksman with a rugged beard and piercing green eyes. He carries a heavy, old-fashioned rifle that he has mastered through years of experience.\n\nPassive: Scavenger's Instinct - When Havoc's support takes a kill that was meant for Havoc, Havoc is credited with the kill and gains a small bonus of attack damage. This passive does not trigger if Pyke is Havoc's support.\n\nAbilities:\n\n* Precise Strike: Havoc takes careful aim and fires a powerful shot that deals increased damage based on the target's missing health.\n* Volley: Havoc unleashes a flurry of shots that deal damage to all enemies in a cone in front of him.\n* Suppressive Fire: Havoc sets up a defensive position and begins firing at enemies, dealing damage and slowing them.\n* Ultimate: Sniper's Focus: Havoc enters a state of heightened focus, greatly increasing his attack speed and critical hit chance for a short duration.\n\nOverall, Havoc is a formidable ADC with a passive that rewards him for coordinating with his support. He excels at taking out enemy champions from a distance and can provide sustained damage in team fights with his abilities.",
