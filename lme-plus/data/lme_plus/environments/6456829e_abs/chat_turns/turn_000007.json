  "content": "I apologize for the misunderstanding. Based on my knowledge, I am still not familiar with Vance and Parskey or any measurement theories or models that they have developed. It is possible that Vance and Parskey are individuals who have worked in the field of customer education or training, but without more information, I am unable to provide any additional information about their contributions to the field.\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous response, there are many different approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of customer education programs, and different organizations and experts may have their own theories, models, and guidelines for measuring the impact of training. It is always a good idea to consider multiple perspectives and approaches when evaluating the effectiveness of customer education programs, and to choose measurement methods and approaches that are appropriate for the specific goals and needs of the organization and its customers.",
