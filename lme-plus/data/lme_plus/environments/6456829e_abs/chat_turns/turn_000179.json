  "content": "Part 2:\n\nUnderstanding Retention in Residential Construction Projects in Brisbane\n\nRetention in construction is a common practice where a certain amount of money is held back until the completion of the project. This retained amount serves as a security that the subcontractor will complete their work as per the agreed schedule and to the expected standards.\n\nRetention also protects the principal contractor from having to pay extra for any delays or defects that may occur during the construction process. In Brisbane, retention money can be claimed by the subcontractor after the completion of the actual building, and sometimes even after the defects liability period has passed.\n\nHowever, if you are having difficulty in claiming your retention money, you have the right to file for adjudication. The law mandates that the money retention can still occur while the adjudication process is ongoing, and you may receive the money as an adjudicated amount.\n\nIf you are a homeowner in Brisbane and want to enforce your right to claim retention money, seek the advice of Contracts Specialist Brisbane.
