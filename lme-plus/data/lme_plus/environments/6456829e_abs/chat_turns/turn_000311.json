It's made from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the same yeast used in baking, but it's grown on sugarcane or beet molasses and then harvested, washed, and dried.\n\n**What does Nutritional Yeast taste like?**\n\nNutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy, and slightly umami flavor, which is often described as similar to grated Parmesan cheese. This unique flavor profile makes it an excellent addition to many dishes, especially those where you want to add depth and richness.\n\n**How to use Nutritional Yeast in your cooking**\n\n1. **Cheesy flavor**: Sprinkle nutritional yeast over pasta dishes, soups, or salads to add a cheesy flavor without the dairy.\n2. **Savory seasonings**: Use it as a seasoning in place of salt or other spices to add depth to soups, stews, and casseroles.\n3. **Vegan cheese**: Blend nutritional yeast with other ingredients like cashews, lemon juice, and water to create a vegan cheese sauce.\n4. **Meat substitutes**: Add nutritional yeast to vegan meat alternatives like veggie burgers or meatballs for added flavor and nutrition.\n5. **Snacks**: Sprinkle it over popcorn or use it as a topping for roasted vegetables for a savory, cheesy flavor.\n\n**Tips for incorporating Nutritional Yeast into your recipes**\n\n1. **Start with small amounts**: Begin with a small amount (about 1/2 teaspoon) and adjust to taste, as nutritional yeast can be quite strong.\n2. **Mix with other ingredients**: Combine nutritional yeast with other spices, herbs, or seasonings to balance out its flavor.\n3. **Store it properly**: Keep nutritional yeast in an airtight container in the fridge or freezer to preserve its flavor and nutritional content.\n\nNow, let's get back to the recipes!\n\n**Vegan Lentil Soup with Nutritional Yeast**\n\nAdd 1-2 teaspoons of nutritional yeast to the pot during the last 10 minutes of cooking to give the soup a cheesy, savory flavor.\n\n**Vegan Quesadilla with Nutritional Yeast**\n\nSprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of nutritional yeast over the filling ingredients (e.g., beans, onions, bell peppers) before adding the vegan cheese and folding the tortilla. This will give the quesadilla a cheesy, slightly nutty flavor.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with nutritional yeast! Do you have any other questions about this ingredient or the recipes?",
