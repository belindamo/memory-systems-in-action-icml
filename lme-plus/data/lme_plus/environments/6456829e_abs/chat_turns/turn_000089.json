  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future plans of Viacom or any other company. However, it does seem to be a common trend in the media industry for companies to prioritize digital platforms over traditional media. This is due to the increasing popularity of streaming services, social media, and other digital distribution channels. Additionally, digital platforms offer advantages such as more targeted advertising, greater audience engagement, and the ability to measure and analyze audience behavior. However, traditional media still has a place in the market and reaches a large audience. Viacom's strategy of focusing on both digital platforms and traditional media could be a way to appeal to a wider range of consumers while still keeping up with the rapidly changing media landscape. Ultimately, the balance between digital and traditional media may depend on Viacom's specific goals and the needs and preferences of their audience.",
