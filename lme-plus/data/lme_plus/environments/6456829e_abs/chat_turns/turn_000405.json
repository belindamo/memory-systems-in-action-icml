  "content": "The revised sentence can be: By leveraging the invariant property of semantics, SC enables data-type transformation to send only task-sufficient semantics (e.g., from a \u2018cat\u2019 image to a word \u201ccat\u201d), minimizing communication payload sizes and latency. This approach ensures that only the semantic information necessary to perform a particular task is transmitted, making communication more efficient.",
