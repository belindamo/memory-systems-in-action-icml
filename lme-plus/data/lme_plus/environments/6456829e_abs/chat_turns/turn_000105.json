  "content": "Modern dance emphasizes the expressiveness and individuality of the dancer, often including improvisation and a focus on emotions and personal experiences. It also breaks away from traditional ballet techniques and movements, including a more grounded approach and a greater emphasis on the use of the spine and torso. Salsa, on the other hand, is a partner dance style that originates from Latin America and typically involves energetic footwork and rhythmic hip movements. It is characterized by a strong connection between the dancers and a heavy influence from Cuban and African music.",
