  "content": "Great question! There are efforts to bring AI solutions for sustainability to developing countries as well. In fact, in some cases, AI solutions are particularly relevant for developing countries, where there may be less infrastructure and resources available for managing energy and natural resources.\n\nFor example, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is working with developing countries to use AI to improve energy planning and forecasting, reduce energy costs, and improve access to energy. IRENA is also working on a project called \"REmap\", which uses AI to identify the most cost-effective renewable energy options for different countries and regions.\n\nAnother example is the Open AI for Development Initiative, a project launched by the United Nations Development Programme and the Global Pulse initiative. This project aims to use AI to address global challenges related to sustainability, including climate change, energy access, and food security.\n\nThere are also many smaller organizations and startups working on AI solutions for sustainability in developing countries. For example, a startup called SunCulture is using AI to optimize irrigation for small-scale farmers in Africa, reducing water waste and improving crop yields.\n\nOverall, there is a growing recognition that AI solutions can be useful for sustainability challenges in both developed and developing countries, and efforts are being made to make these solutions available to everyone who needs them.",
