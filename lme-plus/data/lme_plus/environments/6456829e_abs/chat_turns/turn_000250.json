Cumin and chili powder are great staples, but there are many other spices and herbs that can add depth and complexity to your dishes. Here are some recommendations that pair well with chicken tacos and beef stew:\n\n**For Chicken Tacos:**\n\n1. **Smoked paprika**: Adds a smoky, slightly sweet flavor that complements the chicken and spices.\n2. **Ground coriander**: Similar to cumin, but with a slightly sweet and citrusy flavor.\n3. **Dried oregano**: A classic Mexican herb that adds a pungent, earthy flavor.\n4. **Cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes**: Add a spicy kick to your tacos.\n5. **Lime juice or zest**: Add a bright, citrusy flavor to balance out the richness of the chicken and spices.\n\n**For Beef Stew:**\n\n1. **Thyme**: A classic herb that pairs well with beef and adds a savory, slightly minty flavor.\n2. **Rosemary**: Another herb that complements beef nicely, with a piney, fragrant flavor.\n3. **Bay leaves**: Mild, slightly bitter flavor that adds depth to the stew.\n4. **Ground allspice**: Warm, sweet, and spicy flavor that pairs well with beef and vegetables.\n5. **Worcestershire sauce**: A savory, umami-rich condiment that adds depth to the stew.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n1. **Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce**: Smoky, spicy flavor that adds depth to both chicken and beef dishes.\n2. **Ancho chili powder**: Mild, slightly sweet flavor that adds depth to both chicken and beef dishes.\n3. **Garam masala**: A blend of Indian spices that adds a warm, aromatic flavor to both chicken and beef dishes.\n\nRemember, the key to using spices and herbs effectively is to taste as you go and adjust the seasoning to your liking. Start with small amounts and add more to taste, as different spices and herbs can have varying levels of potency. Also, don't be afraid to experiment and combine different spices and herbs to create unique flavor profiles!",
