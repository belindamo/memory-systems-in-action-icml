Write a compelling opening: Your manuscript should grab the reader's attention from the very first sentence. Make sure your opening is strong and memorable. 2. Develop your characters: Flesh out your characters and make them relatable and interesting. Give them goals, motivations, and flaws. 3. Focus on storytelling: Publishers and agents are looking for books with a compelling story that engages readers from beginning to end. Make sure your plot is well-paced, with plenty of tension and conflict. 4. Show, don't tell: Use descriptive language and vivid imagery to show the reader what's happening, rather than telling them. 5. Revise and edit: Make sure your manuscript is well-edited and polished. Eliminate typos and grammatical errors, and make sure your prose is clear and concise. 6. Have a unique voice: Make sure your voice is distinct and memorable. A unique voice can set your manuscript apart from others in the same genre. 7. Follow submission guidelines: Make sure to follow publisher and agent submission guidelines carefully. This shows that you are a professional and that you respect their time and processes. Remember that the publishing industry is competitive, so it's important to make your manuscript as strong and compelling as possible. Keep honing your craft, and don't be afraid to seek feedback from other writers, writing groups, or professional editors. Good luck!",
