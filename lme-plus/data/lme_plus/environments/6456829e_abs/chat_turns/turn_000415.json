  "content": "This code is written in C++ and is using the Arduino environment. It appears to be for a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system, as it defines variables and constants related to GPR such as the band width, maximum FFT module value, sample number, and horizontal step size. The code also imports several libraries such as `Wire.h`, `arduinoFFT.h`, `TFT_HX8357.h`, `Free_Fonts.h`, and `SD.h` which are commonly used for communication with other devices, FFT calculations, and display capabilities.\n\nThe code uses the TFT\\_HX8357 library to control a TFT display, and the arduinoFFT library to perform FFT calculations. It also uses the SD library to read and write data to a SD card.\n\nAdditionally, it defines several global variables, constants and arrays such as `nivele_bat`, `medii_propagare`, `viteze`, `adancimi`, `pasi_adanc`, `zecimale_pasi_adanc`, `distante` and `corectie` that are used in the GPR system or for displaying the data on the TFT display, and defined `buton_sus, buton_OK, buton_jos, senzor_pas, SDC_CS` for button inputs.\n\nIt also define pin\\_ADC, pin\\_BAT, and Adresa\\_MCP4725, that might be used for ADC, Battery voltage, and DAC communication.\n\nOverall, this code appears to be for a GPR system that uses a TFT display to show the data, and communicates with other devices through I2C and possibly serial communication. The code uses various libraries and defines several global variables and constants to perform the required calculations and display the data on the TFT display.",
