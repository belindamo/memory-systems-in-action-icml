Overwatering is a common mistake, especially when we're eager to give our plants plenty of love and attention. But, as you've learned, too much water can be detrimental to their health.\n\nYellowing leaves and wilting are often signs of overwatering, as the roots start to rot and the plant becomes waterlogged. By reducing the watering frequency, you've given your tomato plants a chance to recover and regain their health.\n\nNow that you've adjusted your watering schedule, keep an eye on your plants' progress and make further adjustments as needed. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and underwater slightly than to overwater and risk root rot.\n\nSome additional tips to prevent overwatering in the future:\n\n1. **Check the soil moisture**: Before watering, stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. If it's already moist, wait another day or two before watering again.\n2. **Water deeply but infrequently**: Instead of watering your tomato plants every day, water them deeply once or twice a week. This encourages deep root growth and makes them more resilient to drought.\n3. **Monitor weather conditions**: Adjust your watering schedule according to weather conditions. If it's been raining or extremely humid, you may not need to water as frequently.\n\nBy being mindful of your watering habits and monitoring your plants' responses, you'll become more attuned to their needs and better equipped to provide the right amount of moisture.\n\nHow's your harvest been so far? Are you enjoying the fruits of your labor?",
