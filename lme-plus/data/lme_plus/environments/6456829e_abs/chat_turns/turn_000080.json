  "content": "I've actually been trying to reduce my use of single-use plastics in other areas of my life as well. I recently started using reusable beeswax wraps instead of plastic wrap to cover my leftovers, and I've been trying to avoid buying products with excessive packaging. I've also been thinking about reducing my fashion waste by shopping more second-hand and buying higher-quality, sustainable clothing. Do you have any tips or recommendations for making more sustainable fashion choices?",
