  "content": "It's difficult to say for certain whether Viacom's influencer marketing strategy is helping them reach a wider audience or if it's simply appealing to their existing fan base without knowing their specific goals, metrics, and data. However, influencer marketing can be an effective way to expand the reach of content, generate buzz, and engage with new audiences. Influencers often have large and dedicated followings, and partnering with them can help companies tap into these audiences and promote their content to new people. Additionally, influencer marketing can often be more organic and authentic than traditional advertising, which may help companies build better relationships with their audience. However, it's also possible that influencer marketing may primarily appeal to existing fans of a particular influencer or Viacom's existing audience. Ultimately, like any marketing strategy, the effectiveness of influencer marketing may depend on its execution and Viacom's specific goals.",
