Oregano and thyme are a classic combination in many Mediterranean and Italian dishes, and they pair beautifully with the rich flavors of olive oil and garlic.\n\nFor your slow cooker recipes, I'd be happy to suggest some herbs and spices that might add new dimensions to your chicken tacos and beef stew. Here are a few ideas:\n\n**For Chicken Tacos:**\n\n1. **Cumin**: A staple in many Mexican and Southwestern dishes, cumin adds a warm, earthy flavor that pairs well with chicken, onions, and bell peppers.\n2. **Chili powder**: A blend of spices, including chili peppers, garlic, and cumin, chili powder adds a bold, spicy flavor to your chicken tacos.\n3. **Smoked paprika**: This sweet and smoky spice adds a deep, complex flavor to chicken, especially when paired with cumin and chili powder.\n4. **Fresh cilantro**: Add some fresh cilantro leaves towards the end of cooking to add a bright, fresh flavor to your chicken tacos.\n\n**For Beef Stew:**\n\n1. **Bay leaves**: These mild, slightly bitter leaves add a depth of flavor to beef stew, especially when combined with thyme and rosemary.\n2. **Rosemary**: As I mentioned earlier, rosemary pairs well with beef and adds a fragrant, herbaceous flavor to your stew.\n3. **Thyme**: Thyme is a classic addition to beef stew, and its slightly minty flavor complements the rich flavors of beef and vegetables.\n4. **Ground cloves**: A small amount of ground cloves can add a warm, slightly sweet flavor to your beef stew, especially when combined with thyme and rosemary.\n\n**Other Herbs and Spices to Consider:**\n\n1. **Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce**: These smoky, spicy peppers add a bold flavor to chicken or beef dishes, especially when combined with cumin and chili powder.\n2. **Ground coriander**: This warm, earthy spice pairs well with cumin and chili powder, and adds a unique flavor to chicken or beef dishes.\n3. **Paprika**: A mild, sweet spice that adds depth and color to chicken or beef dishes, especially when combined with garlic and onions.\n\nRemember, the key to using herbs and spices effectively is to taste as you go and adjust the seasoning to your liking. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new combinations to find the perfect flavor profile for your slow cooker recipes!",
