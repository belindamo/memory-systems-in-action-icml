I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have the capability to retrieve your social media metrics.\n\nBut I can help you understand what metrics you should be looking at and how to access them!\n\nTo get a summary of your recent engagement metrics, you'll need to log in to each of your social media platforms and access their built-in analytics tools. Here's a brief overview of where to find the metrics on each platform:\n\n1. **Facebook**:\n\t* Facebook Insights (built-in analytics tool): Accessible from your Facebook Page's admin panel.\n\t* Look for metrics like Page Likes, Reach, Engagement Rate, and Post Engagement.\n2. **Instagram**:\n\t* Instagram Insights (built-in analytics tool): Accessible from your Instagram Profile's settings.\n\t* Look for metrics like Account Reach, Engagement Rate, Profile Visits, and Top Posts.\n3. **Twitter**:\n\t* Twitter Analytics (built-in analytics tool): Accessible from your Twitter Profile's settings.\n\t* Look for metrics like Tweet Impressions, Engagements, Engagement Rate, and Top Tweets.\n4. **LinkedIn**:\n\t* LinkedIn Analytics (built-in analytics tool): Accessible from your LinkedIn Page's admin panel.\n\t* Look for metrics like Page Views, Engagement Rate, and Post Engagement.\n5. **YouTube**:\n\t* YouTube Analytics (built-in analytics tool): Accessible from your YouTube Studio's dashboard.\n\t* Look for metrics like Views, Watch Time, Engagement, and Earnings.\n\nOnce you access each platform's analytics tool, you can review the metrics and identify areas of improvement. You can also use third-party tools or social media management platforms like Hootsuite, Buffer, or Sprout Social to track your performance across multiple platforms.\n\nRemember to focus on the metrics that matter most to your goals and target audience. If you have any specific questions about interpreting your metrics or need help with social media strategy, feel free to ask!",
