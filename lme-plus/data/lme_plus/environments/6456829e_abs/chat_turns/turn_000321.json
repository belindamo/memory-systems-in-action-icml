Theravada Buddhism: Also known as the \"School of the Elders,\" this is the oldest surviving school of Buddhism. It is based on the Pali Canon, which contains the teachings of the Buddha in the language of Pali. Theravada emphasizes the individual's path to enlightenment and the importance of meditation.\n\n2. Mahayana Buddhism: \"The Great Vehicle\" is a form of Buddhism that developed around the 1st century BCE. Mahayana emphasizes the bodhisattva ideal \u2013 that is, the idea that one should strive to attain enlightenment not just for oneself, but for the benefit of all beings. It also emphasizes the use of compassion and skillful means in one's practice.\n\n3. Vajrayana Buddhism: Also known as Tantric Buddhism or the \"Diamond Vehicle,\" Vajrayana developed in India around the 6th century CE. It emphasizes the use of certain practices and rituals, such as mantra recitation and visualization, to attain enlightenment in one lifetime. Vajrayana is often associated with Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n4. Pure Land Buddhism: This form of Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the role of Amitabha Buddha, who is said to preside over a pure land or paradise where beings can be reborn and attain enlightenment more easily. Pure Land practitioners typically recite Amitabha's name as a form of devotion.\n\n5. Zen Buddhism: Originating in China in the 6th century CE, Zen (or Chan) emphasizes the practice of meditation and direct transmission of enlightenment from teacher to student. Zen emphasizes \"the realization of the Buddha-nature\" (the inherent nature of all beings) over study of scriptures and philosophy.\n\nThese are just a few of the many schools of Buddhism that have developed over the centuries \u2013 there are countless other variations and sub-schools as well!",
