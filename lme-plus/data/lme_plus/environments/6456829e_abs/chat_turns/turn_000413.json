  "content": "Revised: To overcome the limitations of System 1 SC and unlock the full potential of SC, my research theme over the next several years will be centered on the proposal of \"AI-Native and Knowledge-Driven System 2 SC.\" As depicted in Fig. X, System 2 SC builds upon System 1 SC by utilizing background communication to transmit semantic knowledge (SK), which is extracted from the NN trained during System 1 SC, while SRs are communicated via foreground communication.\n\nWhereas System 1 SC aims to transmit minimal, invariant, and sufficient SRs, System 2 SC prioritizes the communication and utilization of interoperable, generative, and intervenable SKs. To pave the way for this new research area while minimizing potential risks, my approach will involve tackling the three key objectives of System 2 SC through three work packages (WPs) outlined in the following section.",
