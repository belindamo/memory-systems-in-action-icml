  "content": "Yes, I can provide some historical background on how the bulldog became Fresno State's mascot.\n\nIn 1921, Fresno State's baseball team adopted a live bulldog named \"Bully\" as their unofficial mascot. Bully was owned by one of the team's players, and soon became a fixture at Fresno State's athletic events.\n\nThen, in 1931, Fresno State's student body officially adopted the English bulldog as the school's official mascot. The first mascot costume was created in the 1940s, and since then, there have been several bulldog mascots at Fresno State, with Victor E. Bulldog III being the current mascot.\n\nOver the years, the bulldog has come to represent not just Fresno State's athletic programs, but also the university's values of strength, determination, and perseverance. Bulldogs are known for their tenacity, and these qualities are seen as representative of Fresno State's student body, faculty, and alumni.\n\nOverall, the bulldog has become an integral part of Fresno State's identity and a beloved symbol of the university's spirit and values.",
