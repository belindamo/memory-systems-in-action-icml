And don't worry, it's common to encounter spiciness issues when working with Korean chili paste (gochujang) \u2013 it can be quite potent!\n\nBalancing spiciness in Korean dishes is an art, and it may take some trial and error to get it right. Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect level of heat:\n\n1. **Start with a small amount**: When using gochujang or other spicy ingredients, start with a small amount and taste as you go. You can always add more heat, but it's harder to remove excess spiciness.\n2. **Understand the Scoville scale**: Gochujang typically ranges from 1,000 to 3,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU). For comparison, jalape\u00f1os are around 2,500-8,000 SHU. This will help you gauge the level of heat you're working with.\n3. **Use gochujang wisely**: Gochujang is a concentrated paste, so a little goes a long way. Mix it with other ingredients, like soy sauce, garlic, and sugar, to dilute the heat and create a balanced flavor.\n4. **Balance with sweetness and acidity**: Korean cuisine often pairs spiciness with sweetness and acidity to create harmony. Add a bit of sugar, honey, or fruit (like Asian pear) to counterbalance the heat. Acidity from ingredients like vinegar, citrus, or kimchi can also help.\n5. **Consider your audience**: If you're cooking for people with different spice tolerance, prepare multiple versions or offer a \"mild\" option. You can always add more heat, but it's harder to remove it once it's added.\n6. **Taste and adjust**: Taste your dish regularly as you cook and adjust the seasoning accordingly. This will help you catch any spiciness issues before they become overwhelming.\n7. **Have a \"spice rescue\" plan**: If your dish becomes too spicy, try adding dairy (like milk or yogurt), starch (like rice or noodles), or a bit of oil to help neutralize the heat.\n8. **Experiment with different types of chili peppers**: Korean chili peppers, like gochugaru or cheongyang, have varying levels of heat. Experiment with different types to find the one that suits your taste.\n9. **Store gochujang properly**: Keep gochujang in the refrigerator to slow down its fermentation process, which can increase its heat over time.\n10. **Practice makes perfect**: The more you cook with Korean chili paste, the more you'll develop a sense of its heat level and how to balance it in your dishes.\n\nFor your Tteokbokki, you can try adding more sugar, soy sauce, or starch (like cornstarch or flour) to dilute the heat. If it's still too spicy, consider starting over with a new batch, using less gochujang and adjusting to taste.\n\nRemember, spiciness is a matter of personal preference, so don't be discouraged if it takes some trial and error to find the perfect balance. Keep experimenting, and soon you'll be a master of Korean cuisine's signature heat!",
