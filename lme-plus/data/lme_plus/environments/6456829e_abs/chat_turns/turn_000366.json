  "content": "I've been obsessed with Korean BBQ lately and have been trying out different Korean restaurants in the city. I think it all started when I watched a Korean drama series last month, and the characters kept eating delicious-looking BBQ dishes. Since then, I've been to at least five different Korean restaurants, trying out their bulgogi, galbi, and bibimbap. My favorite so far is a small family-owned restaurant near my apartment, which serves the most tender and flavorful beef short ribs I've ever had.",
