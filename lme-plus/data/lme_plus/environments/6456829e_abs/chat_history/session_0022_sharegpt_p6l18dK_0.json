      "content": "Here's an idea for a new ADC champion with a unique passive:\n\nName: Faith\n\nAppearance: Faith is a youthful, determined marksman with short, spiky hair and piercing blue eyes. She carries a sleek, high-tech rifle that she is extremely skilled in using.\n\nPassive: Supportive Fire - When Faith's support takes a kill that was meant for Faith, the kill is credited to Faith and she gains a significant amount of bonus gold. This passive encourages Faith to coordinate with her support and ensures that she is rewarded for her contributions to the team.\n\nAbilities:\n\n* Precision Shot: Faith charges up a powerful shot that deals increased damage based on the target's missing health.\n* Rapid Fire: Faith unleashes a rapid burst of shots that deal damage to all enemies in a cone in front of her.\n* Covering Fire: Faith sets up a defensive position and begins firing at enemies, dealing damage and slowing them.\n* Ultimate: True Aim: Faith enters a state of heightened focus, greatly increasing her attack speed and critical hit chance for a short duration.\n\nOverall, Faith is a powerful ADC with a unique passive that rewards her for working closely with her support. She excels at taking out enemy champions and can provide sustained damage in team fights with her abilities."

      "content": "Sure, here's an updated version of Havoc's passive:\n\nPassive: Scavenger's Instinct - When Havoc's support takes a kill that was meant for Havoc, Havoc is credited with the kill and gains a small bonus of attack damage. If Pyke is Havoc's support, Havoc instead gains a moderate bonus of attack damage. This passive encourages Havoc to coordinate with his support and ensures that he is rewarded for his contributions to the team.\n\nOverall, Havoc is a formidable ADC with a passive that rewards him for coordinating with his support, especially when Pyke is his support. He excels at taking out enemy champions from a distance and can provide sustained damage in team fights with his abilities."
