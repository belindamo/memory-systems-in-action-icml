      "content": "Part 2:\n\nConstruction Retention\nBasically, retention in construction is the act of holding off an amount of money until the construction project gets completed. This \u2018retained\u2019 money serves as a security that the subcontractor will do their job well and on schedule.\n\nThis also safeguards the principal contractor from paying extra for delays and defects. Time frames apply on the exact time when a subcontractor could claim this retained money. Usually, this money can be claimed after the actual building\u2019s completion and/or after the defects liability period.\n\nBut, if they are giving you a bad time in getting this money back, then you can file for adjudication. As mandated by law, the money retention can also happen while undergoing adjudication. This can happen when you have filed for adjudication and would receive the money as an adjudicated amount.\n\nIf you want to enforce your right on retention money, call Contracts Specialist. With the right advice, you can get fully paid stress-free. The first consultation is free too.\n\nInstruction Reminders:\n\nEnsure to apply the relevant laws and legislation in Queensland, Australia during the rewriting process and target to Home Owners as the persona. Replace all information, laws, and governing bodies relevant to Sydney or New South Wales, Australia with information, laws, and governing bodies relevant only to Queensland, Australia.\n\nChange Contracts Specialist to Contracts Specialist Brisbane\n\nPlease rewrite the above considering the information given and providing unique content that is applicable for the target location, Queensland, Australia.\n\nDo not change the POV."

      "content": "Part 2:\n\nUnderstanding Retention in Residential Construction Projects in Brisbane\n\nRetention in construction is a common practice where a certain amount of money is held back until the completion of the project. This retained amount serves as a security that the subcontractor will complete their work as per the agreed schedule and to the expected standards.\n\nRetention also protects the principal contractor from having to pay extra for any delays or defects that may occur during the construction process. In Brisbane, retention money can be claimed by the subcontractor after the completion of the actual building, and sometimes even after the defects liability period has passed.\n\nHowever, if you are having difficulty in claiming your retention money, you have the right to file for adjudication. The law mandates that the money retention can still occur while the adjudication process is ongoing, and you may receive the money as an adjudicated amount.\n\nIf you are a homeowner in Brisbane and want to enforce your right to claim retention money, seek the advice of Contracts Specialist Brisbane. Our team of experienced construction lawyers can provide you with the right guidance to help you claim your retention money without any unnecessary stress. We understand the importance of this money for homeowners and can help you navigate the complex laws and regulations surrounding retention in residential construction projects in Brisbane.

      "content": "Part 3:\n\nRetention Clause in Contracts\n\nThe retention clause in a contract describes the amount of money to be retained. It also describes when and how will this amount be paid back, as agreed by both parties. The percentage of retention money withheld could be different from contract to contract.\n\nHow much can a principal hold as Retention Money?\nA usual construction contract will have 5% of the contract\u2019s value as the amount of retention money. It can also be a 10% deduction for the payment you have recieved each progress payment. The amount of retention money should also reflect on your payment invoice.\n\nRemember: The percentages will still vary depending what you have agreed in the contract regarding retentions.\n\nBut, for construction projects valuing over $20 million, the retention money should be put in a trust fund. The head contractor is responsible for maintaining the trust fund and is obligated to give out annual account statements to Fair Trading.\n\nThe head contractor is also responsible for withdrawing money to the trust fund as agreed in the contract. Meaning, what you and the head contractor agreed on the retention clause will stand in terms of getting these funds.\n\nInstruction Reminders:\n\nEnsure to apply the relevant laws and legislation in Queensland, Australia during the rewriting process and target to Home Owners as the persona.

      "content": "Rewritten:\n\nRetention Clause in Contracts\n\nA retention clause in a construction contract specifies the amount of money that will be retained and outlines the terms for when and how it will be paid back, as agreed upon by both parties. The percentage of retention money that is withheld can vary depending on the terms of the contract.\n\nIn Queensland, a typical construction contract will have 5% of the contract value held as retention money. Alternatively, it could be a 10% deduction for each progress payment you receive. It's important that the amount of retention money is clearly stated on your payment invoice.\n\nRemember: The percentage of retention money can vary depending on what is agreed upon in the contract.\n\nFor construction projects worth over $20 million, the retention money must be placed in a trust fund. The head contractor is responsible for maintaining the trust fund and must provide annual account statements to Fair Trading. The head contractor is also responsible for withdrawing money from the trust fund as agreed upon in the contract, meaning that the terms of the retention clause will dictate how and when you receive the funds.\n\nIf you have trouble claiming your retention money, don't hesitate to contact Contracts Specialist Brisbane for expert advice.
