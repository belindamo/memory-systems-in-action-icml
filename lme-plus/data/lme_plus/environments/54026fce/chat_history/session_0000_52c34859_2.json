      "content": "Congratulations on the great deal on Luna's pet bed!\n\nNow, let's get to hands-free leashes for Max! Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Running Leashes**: Designed for joggers and runners, these leashes have a waist belt and a bungee cord that absorbs shock, reducing the impact on your arm and shoulder.\n\t* Example: Stunt Puppy Hands-Free Leash ($25-$35)\n2. **Hiking Leashes**: Ideal for outdoor adventures, these leashes often have a waist pack or belt with storage for treats, poop bags, and other essentials.\n\t* Example: Ruffwear Roamer Leash ($30-$40)\n3. **Belt Leashes**: Simple and comfortable, these leashes have a wide belt that distributes the force of the leash across your waist.\n\t* Example: Pawfect Pets Hands-Free Leash ($15-$25)\n4. **Convertible Leashes**: These leashes can be worn as a belt or used as a traditional leash, offering versatility and convenience.\n\t* Example: Road Runner Pet Hands-Free Leash ($20-$30)\n5. **Bungee Leashes**: These leashes have an elastic section that absorbs sudden jerks, making them suitable for dogs that pull.\n\t* Example: Coastal Pet Products Bungee Leash ($15-$25)\n\nWhen choosing a hands-free leash, consider factors like your dog's size, breed, and pulling strength, as well as your personal comfort and activity level.\n\nNow, about that pet bed deal... If you paid 80% of the original price, that means you saved 20% of the original price. If you want to know the original price, you can set up an equation:\n\nLet x be the original price.\nYou paid 80% of x, which is 0.8x.\nSince you paid 20% less, the amount you saved is 0.2x.\n\nIf you know the amount you paid, you can solve for x to find the original price."

You mentioned you got 20% off, which means you paid 80% of the original price. If you'd like to know the original price, we can set up a simple equation:\n\nLet x be the original price.\nYou paid 80% of x, which is 0.8x.\nSince you got 20% off, the amount you saved is 0.2x.\n\nIf you know the amount you paid (let's call it y), you can set up the equation:\n\n0.8x = y\n\nTo find the original price (x), you can divide both sides by 0.8:\n\nx = y / 0.8\n\nSo, if you tell me the amount you paid (y), I can help you calculate the original price of Luna's pet bed!"
