      "content": "The amount of money you need for a 14-day trip to Bali, Indonesia can vary widely depending on your travel style, the level of luxury you prefer, and the types of activities you want to do. However, I can provide you with an estimate of the average daily expenses for a budget traveler in Bali, based on the assumption that you will stay in mid-range accommodations, eat at local restaurants, and participate in a variety of activities.\n\nAccommodation:\nFor a mid-range hotel or guesthouse, you can expect to spend around $25 to $50 per night. For a 14-day trip, this would amount to around $350 to $700.\n\nFood and Drink:\nLocal restaurants and street food in Bali can be very affordable. A meal at a local restaurant can cost around $3 to $5 per person, while street food can be even cheaper. Assuming an average of $10 per day for food and drink, the total cost for 14 days would be $140.\n\nTransportation:\nTaxis and ride-hailing services such as Grab are widely available in Bali and are reasonably priced. Local buses and bemos are also an option but can be less reliable. Assuming you use a combination of transportation methods and spend around $10 per day, the total cost for 14 days would be $140.\n\nActivities:\nThere are plenty of free activities in Bali, such as visiting temples, exploring the countryside, and lounging on the beach. However, if you want to do more expensive activities like surfing lessons, visiting water parks, or taking a yoga class, the costs can add up. Assuming an average of $20 per day for activities, the total cost for 14 days would be $280.\n\nTotal:\nAdding up these costs, the estimated total cost for a 14-day trip to Bali for a budget traveler would be around $910 to $1,260. However, this is just an estimate, and your actual costs may vary depending on your travel style and preferences. Additionally, it's always a good idea to have some extra money set aside for emergencies or unexpected expenses."
