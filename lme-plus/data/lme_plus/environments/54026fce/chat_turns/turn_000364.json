I'll make sure to dedicate a specific area for my project, cover my work surface, and organize my tools in a logical order. I'll also gather all the necessary tools, sharpen them, and calibrate them properly. Additionally, I'll prepare my sandpaper and have spare blades and bits on hand. I'll remember to wear protective gear, keep loose clothing and long hair tied back, and follow tool instructions. Thanks for the helpful tips!",
