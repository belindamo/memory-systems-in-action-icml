  "content": "Focusing solely on academic instruction can lead to missed opportunities to support students who may be struggling with challenges outside of school. Poverty and trauma can significantly impact a student's ability to learn and lead to poor academic performance, and it is important to address these effects.\n\nImplementing social-emotional learning and trauma-informed practices can help students build resilience, manage stress, and develop the interpersonal and cognitive skills necessary for academic success. These practices not only benefit student learning and well-being but can also create a safe and inclusive learning environment that can be maintained by school staff.\n\nMoreover, research has shown that focusing solely on academics may not lead to long-term success. Many students wish to continue their education past high school, undertake challenging careers, express themselves artistically, or be productive members of their communities. Traits such as perseverance, self-direction, and creative problem solving all require a student's ability to effectively manage stress and relate to others.\n\nTeaching students resiliency will help them respond positively to life stresses, build trust, and cultivate relationships with caring adults who will support them. These practices help students develop into well-rounded individuals who are reliant adults and a positive influence among those around them.\n\nIn conclusion, implementing strategies that address the non-academic needs of students is essential for student success, well-being, and future prospects. Although academic instruction is critical, it is essential to provide students with additional support that enables them to be well-rounded and successful individuals.",
