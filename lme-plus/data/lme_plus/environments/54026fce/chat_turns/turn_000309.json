That way, you always have them with you, and you won't forget them at home.\n\n2. Write a reminder note: If you're prone to forgetting, try writing yourself a reminder note and sticking it somewhere where you'll see it, like on your fridge or front door.\n\n3. Put them in a visible spot: Keep your reusable bags in a spot where you'll see them, like near your front door or by your shoes. That way, you'll see them when you're leaving the house and remember to bring them with you.\n\n4. Establish a routine: Make it a habit to grab your reusable bags before you leave the house. Eventually, it will become like second nature, and you won't even have to think about it.\n\n5. Use compact reusable bags: If you don't have a lot of space to store large reusable bags, consider using compact ones that can easily fit into a purse, backpack, or pocket.\n\nRemember, every little bit helps!
