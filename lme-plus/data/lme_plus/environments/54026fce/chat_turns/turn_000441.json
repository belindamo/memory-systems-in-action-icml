  "content": "The University of Melbourne's academic calendar varies from year to year, but typically, the semester dates are as follows:\n\n* Semester 1: Late February to late May ( Orientation Week usually takes place in the last week of February, and classes start in early March)\n* Semester 2: Late July to late October ( Orientation Week usually takes place in the last week of July, and classes start in early August)\n\nI'd recommend checking the University of Melbourne's website for the most up-to-date information on semester dates, as they may be subject to change. You can also reach out to the university's student services or your faculty's administration to confirm the exact dates.\n\nIt's great that you're planning ahead and wanting to get settled in before classes begin. Make sure to also sort out your accommodation, student ID, and any other necessary administrative tasks before the semester starts. Good luck with your preparations, and I hope you have a fantastic time at UniMelb!",
