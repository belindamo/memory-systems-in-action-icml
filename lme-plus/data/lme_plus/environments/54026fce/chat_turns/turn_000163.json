Dip a clean cloth into the solution, blot the stain gently, and then wipe clean with a damp cloth.\n* For tougher stains, you can use a stain remover like Shout or OxiClean. Follow the product instructions and test on an inconspicuous area first.\n\n**Method 2: Deep cleaning**\n\n* For more thorough cleaning, you can use a gentle cleaning product specifically designed for canvas or sneakers. Follow the product instructions and make sure to read the label carefully.\n* Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to create a paste. Apply the paste to the stained area using a soft-bristled toothbrush. Let it sit for about 30 minutes, then rinse with cold water and wipe clean with a damp cloth.\n\n**Drying and maintenance:**\n\n* Allow your Converse to air dry completely. Avoid using heat to speed up the drying process, as it can cause the material to shrink or become misshapen.\n* To prevent stains and make future cleaning easier, consider applying a fabric protector or waterproofing spray to your Converse.\n\n**Tips and tricks:**\n\n* To remove stubborn stains, try using a hair dryer on a low setting to gently heat the area. This can help loosen the stain and make it easier to remove.\n* For tough scuff marks, use a gentle scrubber like a Magic Eraser or a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently buff the area.\n* To keep your Converse looking fresh, consider cleaning them regularly and storing them in a cool, dry place when not in use.\n\nI hope these tips help you get your Converse looking like new again!",
