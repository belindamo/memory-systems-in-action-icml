  "content": "While parents and guardians play a significant role in supporting their children's emotional needs, many students come to school facing significant challenges such as poverty, trauma, and mental health issues. It is essential that schools are equipped to meet the needs of all students, regardless of their backgrounds, to create safe and supportive learning environments.\n\nSchools have the unique opportunity to support the whole child through comprehensive programming that addresses students' academic, social, and emotional needs. In doing this, they can help students build skills such as resilience, self-esteem, responsibility, confidence, and social skills that will positively impact academic and future success.\n\nMoreover, some students may not have access to resources and support from their families or communities. Providing a safe and supportive learning environment can help students feel valued while addressing their social-emotional growth.\n\nIt's essential to note that schools and families share the responsibility for supporting children and youth. Schools must partner with parents or guardians to create holistically supportive learning environments in which children and youth can thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, for students to grow into well-rounded individuals who will contribute positively to society, schools must support their social and emotional well-being in addition to their academic goals. Teachers can serve as role models, as well as caring adults for students and have the requisite tools that required to help support students' social and emotional development.",
