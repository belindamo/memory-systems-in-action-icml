The exact process varies depending on the game and tournament, but some common steps include:\n\n1. Competing in local or regional tournaments: Players usually start by competing in smaller tournaments in their region or country. These tournaments can be organized by professional teams, game developers, or third-party organizations.\n\n2. Qualifying for larger regional tournaments: The winners or top performers from local tournaments might progress to larger regional tournaments that include teams from multiple countries or regions.\n\n3. Securing a spot in the global event: Depending on the tournament, teams may need to pass through additional qualifying rounds to earn a spot in the global event. For example, in the League of Legends World Championship, teams must either win their regional league or earn enough circuit points throughout the year to qualify.\n\n4. Meeting eligibility and other requirements: Players and teams may need to meet age, residency, or other eligibility requirements to compete in international events. They may also need to register with the tournament organizers and provide documentation, such as proof of identity and travel documents.\n\nOverall, qualifying for international esports events requires a combination of skill, experience, and persistence. Players and teams must demonstrate their ability to compete at the highest level and navigate the complex tournament structures that lead to the global stage.",
