I'm happy to help!\n\nOver-fertilizing can be detrimental to your plants, so it's essential to be mindful of your fertilization schedule. Here are some tips to help you avoid over-fertilizing your plants:\n\n1. **Read the label**: Always read the instructions on the fertilizer packaging and follow the recommended dosage. It's better to err on the side of caution and start with a smaller amount than to overdo it.\n2. **Fertilize sparingly**: Fertilize your plants only during the growing season (spring and summer). During the dormant season (fall and winter), your plants don't need as many nutrients, so you can reduce or skip fertilizing altogether.\n3. **Soil testing**: Get your soil tested to determine its pH level and nutrient content. This will help you choose the right fertilizer and avoid over-fertilizing.\n4. **Start with a weak solution**: If you're new to fertilizing or unsure about the fertilizer's strength, start with a weak solution (half the recommended dose) and gradually increase as needed.\n5. **Monitor plant response**: Observe your plant's response to fertilization. If you notice any adverse effects like yellowing leaves, burnt tips, or stunted growth, stop fertilizing and reassess your approach.\n6. **Don't fertilize when stressed**: Avoid fertilizing your plants when they're stressed, diseased, or experiencing pests. This can exacerbate the issue and cause more harm.\n7. **Flush the soil**: If you suspect over-fertilization, flush the soil with water to remove excess nutrients. This can help prevent further damage.\n\nRegarding your peace lily, it's possible that it was over-fertilized, leading to nutrient toxicity. Peace lilies are sensitive to excessive fertilizer, so it's essential to be cautious when fertilizing them.\n\nTo help your peace lily recover:\n\n* Stop fertilizing immediately.\n* Flush the soil with water to remove excess nutrients.\n* Prune any damaged or yellowing leaves to prevent the spread of disease.\n* Monitor your plant's response and adjust your fertilization schedule accordingly.\n\nRemember, it's always better to under-fertilize than over-fertilize. If you're unsure about the best fertilization schedule for your plants, consider consulting with a local nursery or gardening expert for personalized advice.\n\nDo you have any other questions about fertilizing or plant care in general?",
