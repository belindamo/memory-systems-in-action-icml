Here are some tips to help you facilitate a collaborative conversation and avoid dominating the discussion:\n\n1. **Pause and ask open-ended questions**: After introducing the idea, pause and ask open-ended questions that encourage others to share their thoughts. For example:\n\t* \"What do you think about this idea?\"\n\t* \"How do you think this could work for our team?\"\n\t* \"What are some potential benefits or challenges you see with this approach?\"\n2. **Use non-verbal cues**: Make eye contact with team members, nod your head, and use non-verbal cues to show you're actively listening and encouraging them to share their thoughts.\n3. **Avoid interrupting**: Let team members finish their thoughts before responding or adding your own comments. Avoid interrupting, even if you think you know what they're going to say.\n4. **Paraphrase and summarize**: Repeat back what you've heard to ensure understanding and show that you value their input. For example:\n\t* \"Just to make sure I understand, you're saying that [paraphrase their comment]?\"\n\t* \"So, it sounds like there are a few concerns around [summarize the discussion]?\"\n5. **Encourage others to contribute**: Specifically ask quieter team members for their thoughts or opinions. You can say something like:\n\t* \"Hey, [team member's name], I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. What do you think?\"\n\t* \"Are there any other perspectives on this that we haven't considered yet?\"\n6. **Set a timer (optional)**: Consider setting a timer for a certain amount of time, say 5-7 minutes, and ask team members to share their thoughts within that timeframe. This can help prevent one person from dominating the conversation.\n7. **Take notes**: Take notes during the discussion to help you remember key points and ideas. This can also help you avoid repeating yourself or dominating the conversation.\n8. **Be willing to adapt**: Show that you're open to feedback and willing to adapt the idea based on the team's input. This will help create a sense of ownership and encourage others to share their thoughts.\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a collaborative and inclusive conversation that allows everyone to share their thoughts and opinions. Remember, the goal is to facilitate a discussion, not to dictate the outcome. \ud83d\ude0a",
