  "content": "The Ruffwear Palisades Pack is a fantastic choice for longer hikes with Max!\n\nNow, let's get back to Luna's pet bed deal. You mentioned you got 20% off, which means you paid 80% of the original price. If you'd like to know the original price, we can set up a simple equation:\n\nLet x be the original price.\nYou paid 80% of x, which is 0.8x.\nSince you got 20% off, the amount you saved is 0.2x.\n\nIf you know the amount you paid (let's call it y), you can set up the equation:\n\n0.8x = y\n\nTo find the original price (x), you can divide both sides by 0.8:\n\nx = y / 0.8\n\nSo, if you tell me the amount you paid (y), I can help you calculate the original price of Luna's pet bed!",
