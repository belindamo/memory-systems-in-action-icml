Here's a step-by-step guide on how to propagate a snake plant:\n\n**Method 1: Leaf Cuttings**\n\n1. Choose a healthy leaf with a long petiole (stem). Cut the leaf from the plant about 1-2 inches from the base, using a clean, sharp knife or pruning shears.\n2. Remove lower leaves, leaving only a few at the top. This will help prevent the cutting from rotting and promote rooting.\n3. Allow the cut end to dry for 1-2 days to form a callus. This will reduce the risk of root rot.\n4. Plant the cutting in a pot filled with a well-draining mix, burying it up to the node (where the leaf meets the stem). Water gently.\n5. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Roots should develop within 2-4 weeks.\n\n**Method 2: Rhizome Division**\n\n1. Carefully remove the plant from its pot, gently washing away some of the soil to expose the rhizome (thick, underground stem).\n2. Identify the natural divisions or offsets (small plants) growing from the rhizome. Separate these offsets, making sure each division has at least one growing point (eye).\n3. Replant the separated divisions in individual pots, using a well-draining mix. Water well.\n4. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. The new plants should establish themselves within a few weeks.\n\nNow that your snake plant is in a bigger pot, here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Watering**: With more soil, your snake plant will require more water. However, be cautious not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. Water only when the soil feels dry.\n* **Fertilization**: You can start fertilizing your snake plant more frequently, as it will have more room to grow. Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).\n* **Pruning**: Prune your snake plant regularly to maintain its shape and encourage new growth. Remove any dead or damaged leaves, and cut back tall stems to encourage branching.\n* **Lighting**: Snake plants can tolerate low light, but they'll thrive in bright, indirect light. If possible, move your plant to a brighter location or consider using grow lights.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to successfully propagate your snake plant and enjoy its beautiful, upright foliage.\n\nDo you have any other questions about snake plant care or propagation?",
