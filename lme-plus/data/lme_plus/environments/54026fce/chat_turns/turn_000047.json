However, the all-female cast can have a significant effect on the audience's viewing experience and emotional response in various ways. It can create a sense of empowerment and representation for women in film, providing a rare opportunity to see female characters take center stage and showcase their talents in leading roles. This can lead to increased identification and empathy towards the characters, especially for female viewers, who might feel more connected and invested in the story's outcome. Additionally, an all-female cast can subvert traditional gender roles seen in mainstream media, bringing a new perspective to storytelling and challenging societal norms.
