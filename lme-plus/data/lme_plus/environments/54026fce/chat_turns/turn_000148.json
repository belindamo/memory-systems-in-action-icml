  "content": "I'm currently leaning towards a mix of modern minimalism and coastal. I love the clean lines and functionality of modern minimalism, but I also want to incorporate some coastal elements like blues and whites to give my living room a lighter, airier feel. Speaking of coastal, I'm thinking of getting a new rug to replace the one I recently bought from the antique store. Do you know any good places to find affordable coastal-style rugs?",
