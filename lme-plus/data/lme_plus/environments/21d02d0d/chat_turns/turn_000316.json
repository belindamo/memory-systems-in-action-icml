  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on how to recover from a marathon. I just completed my first full marathon on April 10th and I'm feeling a bit sore. I've been doing yoga twice a week, which has been helping with my flexibility and recovery, but I'm wondering if there are any other tips you can share. By the way, I've been active in the running community and was able to attend most of the weekly 5K fun runs at the local park, except for the run on March 5th when I had to miss due to work commitments.",
