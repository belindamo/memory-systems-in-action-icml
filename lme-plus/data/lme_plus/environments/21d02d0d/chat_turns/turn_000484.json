Infants and young children: Infants and young children have an immature immune system, which makes them more susceptible to infections. They require multiple vaccinations during their first few years of life to develop immunity against various diseases.\n\n2. Elderly: As people age, their immune system becomes weaker, making them more susceptible to infections. They may require additional booster vaccinations to maintain immunity against certain diseases.\n\n3. Immunocompromised individuals: People with weakened immune systems such as those with HIV/AIDS or receiving chemotherapy may require more frequent vaccinations to protect against infections.\n\n4. Travelers: People traveling to certain parts of the world may require additional vaccinations to protect against diseases that are not prevalent in their home country.\n\n5.
