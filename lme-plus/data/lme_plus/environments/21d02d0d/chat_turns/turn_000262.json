  "content": "I've actually tried out hickory and apple wood chips recently, and they both turned out great! The hickory gave my chicken thighs a strong, savory flavor, while the apple wood added a bit of sweetness. I'm looking to try out some other types of wood chips soon, maybe cherry or pecan. Do you have any recommendations for using wood chips with specific meats or recipes?",
