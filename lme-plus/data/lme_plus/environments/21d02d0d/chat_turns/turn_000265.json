  "content": "BBQ chicken with pecan wood chips and a honey-mustard marinade sounds like a fantastic combination!\n\nGrilling chicken breasts can be a bit tricky, but with some tips and tricks, you can achieve juicy and delicious results. Here are some tips to help you grill chicken breasts to perfection:\n\n1. **Brine the chicken**: Before marinating, brine the chicken breasts in a mixture of salt, sugar, and spices for 30 minutes to an hour. This helps to keep the chicken moist and adds flavor.\n2. **Don't over-marinate**: While marinating is essential, don't overdo it. 2-4 hours is usually sufficient for chicken breasts. Over-marinating can make the chicken too salty or mushy.\n3. **Preheat the grill**: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F). This will help sear the chicken quickly and prevent it from cooking too slowly.\n4. **Grill with indirect heat**: Grill the chicken breasts over indirect heat, meaning the heat source is not directly under the chicken. This helps to cook the chicken evenly and prevents burning.\n5. **Don't press down**: Resist the temptation to press down on the chicken with your spatula. This can squeeze out juices and make the chicken dry.\n6. **Flip frequently**: Flip the chicken breasts every 5-7 minutes to ensure even cooking. You can use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature (165\u00b0F for breast meat).\n7. **Let it rest**: Once the chicken is cooked, let it rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken more tender and juicy.\n\nFor your BBQ chicken recipe, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Brine the chicken breasts in a mixture of salt, sugar, and spices for 30 minutes.\n2. Marinate the chicken in a honey-mustard marinade for 2-4 hours.\n3. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.\n4. Grill the chicken breasts over indirect heat for 20-25 minutes, flipping every 5-7 minutes.\n5. Let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve deliciously grilled chicken breasts with a beautiful smoky flavor from the pecan wood chips!\n\nRemember to keep an eye on the temperature and adjust the grilling time as needed. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.\n\nGood luck, and I hope your BBQ chicken turns out amazing!",
