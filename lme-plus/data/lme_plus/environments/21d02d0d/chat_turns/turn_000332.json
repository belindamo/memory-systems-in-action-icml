It's essential to prioritize your well-being and find a balance between your project work and personal life.\n\nI'd like to explore your current morning routine a bit more. You mentioned you've been waking up at 7:30 am, but you're not feeling refreshed and energized. Can you tell me more about what you do immediately after waking up? Do you check your phone, scroll through social media, or jump straight into your morning meditation session?",
