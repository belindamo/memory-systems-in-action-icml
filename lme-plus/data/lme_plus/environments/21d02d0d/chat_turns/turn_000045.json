  "content": "A bike fitting is an excellent investment for any triathlete!\n\nBased on my research, I highly recommend **RIDE Cyclery** for a triathlon bike fitting. They have a dedicated bike fitting studio with a certified fitter who specializes in triathlon and time trial bikes. They use a combination of advanced tools, including a dynamic fitting system, to ensure a precise and comfortable fit.\n\nRIDE Cyclery's bike fitting process typically includes:\n\n1. A thorough consultation to discuss your cycling goals, riding style, and any discomfort or pain you're experiencing.\n2. A physical assessment to identify any flexibility or strength limitations that may impact your riding position.\n3. A dynamic fitting session using their advanced equipment to analyze your riding position and make adjustments in real-time.\n4. A detailed report outlining the optimal fit coordinates and recommendations for your bike.\n\nAs for your question about when to get a bike fitting, I recommend getting it done sooner rather than later. Here's why:\n\n1. **Prevents injuries**: A proper bike fit can help prevent discomfort, pain, and injuries that may occur due to an ill-fitting bike.\n2. **Improves efficiency**: A well-fitted bike can help you maintain a more aerodynamic position, reducing air resistance and improving your overall performance.\n3. **Enhances comfort**: A comfortable bike fit can help you stay focused and enjoy your rides, even during longer training sessions.\n4. **Streamlines training**: By getting a bike fitting early on, you can focus on your training and make adjustments to your riding technique, rather than struggling with an uncomfortable bike.\n\nThat being said, it's still a good idea to get a few rides under your belt to get a feel for your bike and identify any initial discomfort or issues. This will also give you a better understanding of your riding style and preferences, which can be helpful during the bike fitting process.\n\nSchedule your bike fitting appointment at RIDE Cyclery, and be sure to mention your triathlon goals and any specific concerns you may have. They'll take care of the rest!",
