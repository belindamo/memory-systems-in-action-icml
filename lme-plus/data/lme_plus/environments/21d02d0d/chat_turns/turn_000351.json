  "content": "Affectations refer to mannerisms, behaviors, or speech patterns that deviate from the norm and are used to express oneself or to fit in. They can manifest in different ways such as in speech, gestures, diction, dress/appearance, interactions, and vocabulary. Everyone has some form of affectations, whether intentional or natural. They can be adopted naturally, due to environment, family, culture, or education. Affectations can cause tension in both political relations and day-to-day life and they can change over the course of a marriage as the couple develops a shared identity. Affectations may grow shared more quickly between a boyfriend and girlfriend depending on the length of the relationship, dynamics of the relationship, personalities and backgrounds of the individuals involved and context in which they interact. Businesses can have common affectations among their employees as a result of company culture, professional norms, and training. Within a homogenous group of people, differing affectations can manifest due to personal experiences, personality, education and profession, gender, social status, or external influences.",
