  "content": "I was going to suggest that you consider building in some time for a relaxing activity, such as reading, journaling, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee or tea in peace. Even 15-20 minutes of quiet time can make a big difference in how you feel throughout the day.\n\nTo make the \"no phone zone\" habit stick, you could try setting a reminder on your phone (ironically!) to remind you to put it away for the first 30 minutes after waking up. You could also try placing your phone in a designated spot outside of your bedroom, so it's not the first thing you reach for when you wake up.\n\nAdditionally, you might consider establishing a consistent wake-up routine that signals to your brain that it's time to start the day. This could be as simple as making your bed, stretching, or doing a quick 5-minute yoga routine. Having a consistent routine can help train your brain to wake up feeling more refreshed and alert.\n\nWhat do you think?",
