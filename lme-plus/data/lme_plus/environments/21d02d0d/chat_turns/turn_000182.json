  "content": "I do have a favorite movie that I've shared with my friends that holds a special place in my heart. It's actually the one I mentioned earlier - Spider-Man: No Way Home. We booked the tickets a week in advance to ensure we got the best seats, and the excitement leading up to it was palpable. The experience of watching it together in the cinema, cheering and gasping at the same moments, is something I'll always treasure.",
