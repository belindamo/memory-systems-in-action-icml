That way, I can get a second opinion and maybe even find a new home for some of the items. Speaking of family, my cousin's wife Rachel was really helpful when she came over to assist with the cleaning. We ended up talking for hours, sharing stories about grandma and laughing about some of the funny moments we had with her. Do you have any advice on how to preserve those memories and stories about grandma?",
