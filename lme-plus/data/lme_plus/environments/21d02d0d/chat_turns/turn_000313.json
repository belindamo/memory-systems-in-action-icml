Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Room Storage:**\n\n* Each room in Totem Park residence has a closet with a shelving unit and a closet rod for hanging clothes.\n* There's also a dresser or wardrobe unit with drawers for storing clothes, linens, and personal items.\n* Under-bed storage is available in some rooms, but it's limited, so it's best to check with the residence life team to confirm.\n\n**Additional Storage Options:**\n\n* **Totem Park Storage Lockers:** You can rent a storage locker on a first-come, first-served basis for a fee (around $20-$30 per month). These lockers are located in the residence and can be used to store items like luggage, seasonal clothing, or other personal belongings.\n* **Campus Storage Facilities:** UBC offers storage facilities for students, including the UBC Storage Facility and the Student Union Building (SUB) Storage Lockers. These facilities are located in different areas of campus and offer varying storage options, including lockers, cages, and containers. You can rent storage space for a semester or academic year, and prices vary depending on the location and size of the storage unit.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Measure your luggage and storage containers to ensure they fit in the room's closet and under-bed space.\n* Consider packing clothing and items that can be easily mixed and matched to minimize storage needs.\n* If you have bulky items like winter sports equipment or musical instruments, you may want to explore off-campus storage options or ship them to yourself later in the semester.\n* Label your storage containers and luggage clearly with your name, room number, and contact information to avoid mix-ups.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check with the Totem Park residence life team or UBC's student housing website for the most up-to-date information on storage options and prices.
