  "content": "Yosemite is a fantastic destination! Renting a car can be a great idea, especially if you're concerned about putting miles on your own vehicle. When it comes to navigating Yosemite's roads, you'll want a vehicle that can handle the mountainous terrain and potentially rough roads. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **SUV or Crossover**: A mid-size or full-size SUV or crossover would be an excellent choice for Yosemite. These vehicles typically offer a higher ground clearance, which will help you navigate rough roads and steep inclines. They also often come equipped with features like four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, which can provide better traction on slippery or unpaved roads.\n2. **4WD or AWD capability**: If you plan to explore Yosemite's more rugged areas, such as Tioga Road or Glacier Point, a 4WD or AWD vehicle is highly recommended. This will give you more confidence on steep inclines and rough terrain.\n3. **Good ground clearance**: A minimum of 7-8 inches of ground clearance is recommended to navigate Yosemite's rough roads and parking areas. This will also help you avoid scraping the underside of the vehicle on steep inclines.\n4. **High-clearance tires**: Make sure the rental vehicle has good, sturdy tires with a decent tread depth. This will help with traction and stability on wet or slippery roads.\n\nSome popular rental options that fit these criteria include:\n\n* Toyota 4Runner or RAV4\n* Honda CR-V or Pilot\n* Subaru Outback or Forester\n* Jeep Grand Cherokee or Renegade\n* Ford Escape or Explorer\n\nBefore renting, be sure to check the vehicle's specifications and reviews to ensure it meets your needs. You may also want to consider renting a vehicle with features like a backup camera, parking sensors, and a navigation system, which can be helpful in Yosemite's scenic but sometimes narrow roads.\n\nAs for your new job, congratulations on the new role! It's great that you're thinking ahead and considering the wear and tear on your personal vehicle. Renting a car for your Yosemite trip can be a great way to minimize the mileage and reduce the overall maintenance costs for your own vehicle.\n\nRemember to also plan ahead for parking, as some areas in Yosemite can be limited. Enjoy your trip!",
