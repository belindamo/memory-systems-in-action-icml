I'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to use Google Keyword Planner and Ahrefs to identify relevant keywords with decent search volume and analyze competition.\n\n**Google Keyword Planner**\n\n1. **Accessing Keyword Planner**: Sign in to your Google Ads account (create one if you don't have one). Go to the Tools & Settings icon () and select Keyword Planner.\n2. **Getting started**: Click on \"Discover new keywords\" and enter a seed keyword related to your content (e.g., \"machine learning tutorials\"). You can also upload a list of keywords or a webpage URL.\n3. **Keyword ideas**: Keyword Planner will generate a list of keywords related to your seed keyword. You can filter the results by:\n\t* Relevance: How closely the keyword is related to your seed keyword.\n\t* Search volume: The average monthly searches for the keyword.\n\t* Competition: The number of advertisers bidding on the keyword.\n\t* Cost-per-click (CPC): The average cost of a click on an ad for that keyword.\n4. **Analyzing results**: Look for keywords with:\n\t* Decent search volume (at least 100-200 searches per month).\n\t* Medium to low competition (less competition means it's easier to rank).\n\t* Relevant CPC (if you plan to run ads, a higher CPC indicates higher commercial intent).\n\n**Ahrefs**\n\n1. **Accessing Ahrefs**: Sign up for an Ahrefs account (they offer a 7-day trial). Log in and navigate to the Keyword Explorer tool.\n2. **Entering keywords**: Type in a seed keyword or upload a list of keywords. You can also use the \"Content gap\" feature to find keywords related to a specific webpage or domain.\n3. **Keyword ideas**: Ahrefs will generate a list of keywords, including:\n\t* Search volume: Average monthly searches.\n\t* Competition: Ahrefs' proprietary competition score (lower is better).\n\t* Keyword difficulty: Ahrefs' estimate of how hard it is to rank for the keyword (lower is better).\n\t* Cost-per-click (CPC): Average cost of a click on an ad for that keyword.\n4. **Analyzing results**: Look for keywords with:\n\t* Decent search volume (at least 100-200 searches per month).\n\t* Low to medium competition (Ahrefs' competition score below 0.5).\n\t* Low keyword difficulty (Ahrefs' difficulty score below 60).\n\n**Tips and tricks**\n\n* Use both tools to get a comprehensive view of your keywords.\n* Focus on long-tail keywords (more specific phrases with lower competition).\n* Analyze the search intent behind each keyword (informational, navigational, or transactional).\n* Consider using negative keywords to exclude irrelevant searches.\n* Prioritize keywords with higher search volume and lower competition.\n\nNow that you know how to use these tools, take some time to research and identify relevant keywords for your website. Create a list of 10-20 keywords that you think are most relevant to your content and target audience.\n\nDo you have any questions about using these tools or need further guidance on analyzing the results?",
