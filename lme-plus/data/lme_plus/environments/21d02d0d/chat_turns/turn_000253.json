Here are some hot springs trails to consider:\n\n1. Fairy Falls Trail: The Fairy Falls hike passes by Grand Prismatic hot springs. It is the park's largest hot spring and known for its rainbow colors. While you can see its vivid colors from the boardwalk as well, the trail offers unique perspectives from above.\n\n2. Observation Point Trail: This hiking trail is an extension of the Grand Prismatic Spring hike. After passing the vividly-colored hot spring, you can continue onto the Observation Point Trail. This trail climbs up to an overlook that offers panoramic views of Grand Prismatic and other nearby geothermal features.\n\n3. Lone Star Geyser Trail: This hiking trail leads to Lone Star Geyser, a cone geyser nestled among the trees. The geyser is known to erupt at regular intervals of around three hours, shooting water over 30 feet into the air.\n\n4. Upper Geyser Basin Trail: This hiking trail passes by several geysers, hot springs, and other geothermal features, including Old Faithful. You can watch the famous geyser erupt from a nearby platform.\n\nThese are just a few of the hiking trails that take you to hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. As mentioned earlier, be mindful of the hazards associated with geothermal activity. Stick to the marked trails, and observe safety guidelines when exploring the park.",
