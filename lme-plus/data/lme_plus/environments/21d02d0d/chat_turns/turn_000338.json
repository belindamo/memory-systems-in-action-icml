I've already chosen a provider, but I'm wondering what kind of questions I should ask during the final walk-through of the property to ensure everything is in order. By the way, I'm really glad I got pre-approved for a mortgage, it gave me a sense of security when making an offer on the house - my initial offer was $320,000, but the seller countered with $330,000.",
