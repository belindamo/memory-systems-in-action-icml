  "content": "I'm training for a local triathlon in July, so I want to focus on building up my endurance for swimming, running, and cycling. I can dedicate around 5-6 days a week for training, with one or two rest days in between. For running, I prefer Saturday mornings and Wednesday evenings. For yoga, I'd like to stick to my current schedule of Tuesdays and Thursdays. And for swimming, I'd like to add an extra session on Fridays, in addition to my existing Wednesday evening sessions.",
