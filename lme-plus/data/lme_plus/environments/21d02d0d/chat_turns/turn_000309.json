  "content": "Congratulations on your decision to study at UBC!\n\nWelcome to the UBC community! Moving to a new place can be overwhelming, but UBC's student housing team is there to help you settle in smoothly. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Move-In Day:**\nThe move-in day for UBC student housing usually takes place in late August or early September, depending on the residence and your assigned move-in time. You'll receive an email with specific details about your move-in date and time.\n\n**Check-In Process:**\nWhen you arrive at your assigned residence, you'll need to check in with the residence life team. This process typically takes around 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of students checking in at the same time.\n\n**Room Assignment and Key Pickup:**\nDuring check-in, you'll receive your room assignment and pick up your keys. Make sure to bring a government-issued ID and your UBC student ID (if you've already received it).\n\n**Unpacking and Settling In:**\nAfter checking in, you can start unpacking and settling into your new space. You'll have the rest of the day to get familiar with your surroundings, meet your roommates (if you have any), and explore the residence and campus.\n\n**Residence Orientation:**\nIn the days following your move-in, you'll have a residence orientation, which will cover important information about your residence, campus resources, and student life at UBC. This is a great opportunity to meet other students, ask questions, and get familiar with the UBC community.\n\n**Timeline:**\nHere's a rough estimate of how long it takes to get settled into student housing at UBC:\n\n* Check-in process: 30 minutes to 1 hour\n* Unpacking and settling in: 2-3 hours (depending on how much you need to unpack)\n* Residence orientation: 1-2 hours (usually held in the first few days after move-in)\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Arrive during your assigned move-in time to avoid delays.\n* Bring a laptop or tablet to complete any necessary paperwork or online forms during check-in.\n* Pack lightly, as you can always purchase essential items in Vancouver or have them shipped to you later.\n* Take some time to explore your residence, campus, and surrounding neighborhoods to get familiar with your new surroundings.\n* Don't hesitate to reach out to the residence life team or UBC student services if you need any assistance or have questions.\n\nRemember, the UBC student housing team is there to support you throughout your transition. If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to reach out to them directly.",
