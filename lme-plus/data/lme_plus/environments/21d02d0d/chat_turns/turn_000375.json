  "content": "Yes, many of the restaurants in Le Havre offer vegetarian options on their menus. Here are some vegetarian-friendly options at the restaurants I recommended:\n\n1. Les Enfants Sages - offers a vegetarian burger made with chickpeas and tofu, and a vegetable risotto. 2. Le Bouchon Normand - has a vegetable quiche made with mushrooms, spinach, and blue cheese, and a vegetable gratin. 3. La Civette - offers vegetarian options such as a stuffed zucchini and a vegetable curry. 4. Le Chat Bleu - has a vegetarian plate, which includes roasted vegetables and potatoes, as well as a risotto primavera. 5. L'\u00c9cailler - offers a mixed green salad, various types of vegetable soups and a risotto recipe topping with Portobello mushrooms. Just keep in mind that menus may change from time to time, so it's always best to check directly with the restaurant about the availability and seasonal nature of vegetarian options.",
