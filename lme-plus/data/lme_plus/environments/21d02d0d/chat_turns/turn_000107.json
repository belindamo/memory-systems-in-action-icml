It's good to know that it's a more gentle, non-irritating product that can help with hydration and soothing dry skin. I'll also keep in mind that it might not have the same anti-aging benefits as La Mer, but it's a good option for maintenance and everyday use. Thanks for the tips on how to get the most out of Cetaphil!",
