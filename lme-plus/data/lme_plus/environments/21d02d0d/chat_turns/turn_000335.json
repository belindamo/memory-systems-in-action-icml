I'm interested in hearing more about how I can prioritize self-care and relaxation in my morning routine. What are some simple yet effective ways to incorporate more relaxation and calm into my morning?\n\nAlso, I like the idea of a \"no phone zone\" in the morning. I can see how it would help me start the day more mindfully. Do you have any tips on how to make this habit stick?",
