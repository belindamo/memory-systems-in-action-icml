As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences like attending music festivals or events, but I'm always happy to chat about them with you!\n\nGovernors Ball is an incredible festival, and I've heard great things about the atmosphere, lineup, and overall experience. It's fantastic that you got to enjoy it with your friends and explore the city together. Music festivals are a great way to create unforgettable memories with friends and discover new artists and music.\n\nIf you're interested in more music festivals or events in the NYC area, I'd be happy to provide recommendations or information. There are plenty of amazing events throughout the summer, from smaller concerts to larger festivals like Panorama or Electric Zoo.\n\nFeel free to share more about your Governors Ball experience or ask about other events in the city. I'm always here to help and chat about music, festivals, and NYC adventures!",
