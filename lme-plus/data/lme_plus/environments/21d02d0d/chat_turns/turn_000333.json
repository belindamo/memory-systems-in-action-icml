  "content": "I'd be happy to dive deeper into my current morning routine.\n\nAfter waking up at 7:30 am, I usually reach for my phone to check the time and then scroll through social media or my email notifications. I know it's not the best habit, but it's become a mindless routine for me. Sometimes I'll spend around 15-20 minutes scrolling through my feeds before I even get out of bed.\n\nAfter that, I'll try to do a 10-15 minute morning meditation session, but it's been challenging lately. My mind is often preoccupied with thoughts about my project, and I find myself getting distracted or feeling anxious during the meditation session.\n\nI don't really have a consistent morning routine beyond that. Sometimes I'll grab a quick breakfast, but I often rush out the door to get started on my project work.\n\nI realize that my current morning routine isn't setting me up for success, and I'd like to make some changes to prioritize my well-being and energy levels. Do you have any suggestions for how I can improve my morning routine and create a more sustainable and energizing start to my day?",
