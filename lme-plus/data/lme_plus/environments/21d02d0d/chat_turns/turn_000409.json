It's great to hear that you've been sticking to your daily routine during the week, and that it's helping you feel more energized and focused.\n\nSleeping in a bit later on Sunday is completely understandable, especially if you need to recharge after a busy week. However, it's impressive that you're making an effort to establish a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends.\n\nRemember that it's normal to have some flexibility in your sleep schedule, especially on weekends or days off. The important thing is that you're not drastically changing your sleep habits, which can disrupt your body's internal clock.\n\nTo further solidify your consistent sleep schedule, you might consider establishing a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down. This could include activities like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches.\n\nHow do you feel about your energy levels and focus during the week? Have you noticed any improvements since sticking to your daily routine?",
