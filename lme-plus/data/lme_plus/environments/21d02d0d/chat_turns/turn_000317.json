That's an incredible achievement! \n\nRecovery is a crucial part of the marathon training process, and it's great that you're already incorporating yoga into your routine. Here are some additional tips to help you recover and get back to your normal running routine:\n\n1. **Rest and recovery days**: Allow your body time to recover. Take 1-2 weeks off from running or any high-impact activities. This will give your muscles, tendons, and joints time to repair and rebuild.\n2. **Gradual return to running**: When you do start running again, begin with short, easy runs (20-30 minutes) and gradually increase your duration and intensity over time.\n3. **Stretching and foam rolling**: In addition to yoga, make sure to stretch your major muscle groups, including your calves, quads, hamstrings, glutes, and hip flexors. Foam rolling can also help reduce muscle soreness and improve circulation.\n4. **Compression gear**: Wear compression socks, sleeves, or tights to help improve blood flow and reduce swelling in your legs.\n5. **Ice baths**: Take an ice bath (10-15 minutes) 1-2 times a week to reduce inflammation and muscle soreness. The cold water helps constrict blood vessels, which can reduce swelling and promote recovery.\n6. **Proper nutrition**: Focus on consuming a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. These nutrients will help your body repair and rebuild muscle tissue.\n7. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water or sports drinks to replenish lost electrolytes and fluids. Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.\n8. **Elevate your legs**: Whenever possible, elevate your legs above the level of your heart to reduce swelling and promote blood flow back to your heart.\n9. **Massage**: Consider getting a post-marathon massage to help loosen tight muscles and promote recovery.\n10. **Listen to your body**: Pay attention to any pain or discomfort. If you experience persistent pain or discomfort, take an extra day off or modify your activities to avoid exacerbating the issue.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've been active in the running community and have been attending the weekly 5K fun runs. Once you've recovered, you can gradually start incorporating more intense and frequent runs back into your routine.\n\nRemember, recovery is just as important as training. Be patient, and your body will thank you.\n\nHow's your soreness level right now? Are there any specific areas that are causing you discomfort?",
