  "content": "Bath & Body Works is a great choice! They're known for their wide range of fragrances and affordable prices. It's wonderful that your mom loves their candles! Getting her more candles from the same brand is a thoughtful idea, as she's already familiar with their products and enjoys them.\n\nYou can consider getting her a few candles in different fragrances to create a nice collection or to complement the vase you're planning to get her. Bath & Body Works often has seasonal collections and limited-edition fragrances, so you might find some new and exciting scents to add to her collection.\n\nIf you want to make it an extra-special gift, you could also consider getting her a candle holder or a decorative plate to go along with the vase and candles. This will create a beautiful and cohesive look, and she can display her candles and vase proudly in her home.\n\nRemember, the thought and effort you put into the gift are what truly matter. Your mom will appreciate the fact that you're thinking of her and wanting to bring a smile to her face.",
