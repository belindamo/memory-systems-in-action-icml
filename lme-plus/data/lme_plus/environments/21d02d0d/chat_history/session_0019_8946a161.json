I'm glad you stocked up on winter squashes and apples from the harvest festival - they're perfect for hearty soups and delicious pies.\n\nIt's understandable that you're still adjusting to the cooler mornings and darker evenings of autumn. The change in daylight hours can take some time to get used to, but it's a great excuse to slow down and enjoy the cozier aspects of the season.
