Here are some valuable bike maintenance tips, specifically tailored for hybrid bikes like your Trek FX 3:\n\n**Regular Checks**\n\n1. **Tire pressure**: Check tire pressure at least once a week, and before long rides. Proper pressure can improve efficiency, comfort, and safety. Use a pressure gauge to ensure the recommended pressure (usually between 60-80 PSI for hybrid bikes).\n2. **Quick releases and bolts**: Check that all quick releases (QRs) and bolts are securely tightened, especially the stem, handlebars, and seatpost.\n3. **Brake pads**: Inspect brake pads regularly for wear. Replace them when they're worn down to 1-2 mm or when you notice a significant decrease in braking performance.\n4. **Chain lubrication**: Lubricate your chain regularly to reduce wear and prevent corrosion. Use a chain lube specifically designed for bicycles.\n\n**Cleaning**\n\n1. **Clean the bike regularly**: Use a soft-bristled brush or a dedicated bike cleaning brush to remove dirt and debris from the frame, wheels, and components. Avoid using high-pressure hoses or harsh chemicals.\n2. **Chain cleaning**: Use a chain cleaner and a brush to remove grime and dirt from the chain. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and lubricating the chain.\n3. **Wheel cleaning**: Clean the wheels and tires with a mild soap and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can damage the wheels or tires.\n\n**Maintenance Tasks**\n\n1. **Chain maintenance**: Check the chain for wear and stretch. If it's worn or stretched, consider replacing it. Clean and lubricate the chain regularly to prevent corrosion.\n2. **Cable adjustments**: Check and adjust the brake and gear cables as needed. Make sure they're not too loose or too tight, as this can affect performance and safety.\n3. **Gear tuning**: If your Trek FX 3 has a derailleur system, check and adjust the derailleurs to ensure smooth shifting. Refer to your owner's manual or consult a professional if you're unsure.\n4. **Bolt torque**: Check the torque on bolts, especially the stem, handlebars, and seatpost, to ensure they're securely tightened.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. **Store your bike properly**: Store your bike in a dry, clean area away from direct sunlight. Hang it by the wheels or use a bike stand to prevent flat spots on the tires.\n2. **Take your bike for a check-up**: Schedule regular tune-ups with a professional mechanic to catch any potential issues before they become major problems.\n3. **Keep a maintenance log**: Record your maintenance activities to track your bike's history and identify potential issues early.\n\n**Specific Tips for Trek FX 3**\n\n1. **Check the suspension**: If your Trek FX 3 has a suspension fork, check the air pressure and rebound damping regularly. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for maintenance and adjustments.\n2. **Inspect the disc brakes**: If your bike has disc brakes, inspect the rotors and pads regularly for wear. Clean the rotors and pads with a soft brush and mild soap.\n\nBy following these bike maintenance tips, you'll be able to keep your Trek FX 3 running smoothly, efficiently, and safely. Happy riding!"
