Satan - Fire\n\t* Satan, also known as the devil or Lucifer, is often associated with the element of fire because of his association with temptation, destruction, and chaos.\n\t* Fire can be both creative and destructive, and Satan is often seen as a force that can inspire passion and creativity but also lead to destruction and damnation.\n3. Saint Francis of Assisi - Earth\n\t* Saint Francis of Assisi is often associated with the element of earth because of his love of nature and his dedication to living a simple, humble life close to the natural world.\n\t* Additionally, Saint Francis is often depicted with animals, which are a symbol of the natural world and the interconnectedness of all living things.\n4.
