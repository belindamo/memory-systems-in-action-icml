(price varies, but expect $300-$1,000 or more)\n\nWhen choosing a display case, consider the following factors:\n\n* The size of the case: Make sure it fits your baseball snugly.\n* The material: Acrylic, glass, wood, or metal \u2013 each has its own aesthetic and durability.\n* Engraving options: If you want to add a personal message or the player's name, check if the case allows for engravings.\n* UV protection: If you plan to display the case in a sunny area, look for cases with UV-resistant materials to prevent fading.\n\nGiven your budget and the value of your signed baseball, I'd recommend exploring the mid-range options. A wall-mounted display case or a shadow box would be a great way to showcase your prize while keeping it protected and visually appealing.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect display case for your treasured baseball!",
