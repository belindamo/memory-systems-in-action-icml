  "content": "Yes, that is correct. The phenomenon of quantum entanglement allows for multiple quantum states to be represented simultaneously, but when the state of a qubit is measured, the superposition collapses to a single, definite state, either 0 or 1. This is known as the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.\n\nSo, while entangled qubits allow for multiple states to be processed at the same time, the actual computation in a quantum computer is performed by making measurements on individual qubits, which collapse their superpositions and effectively reduce them to classical bits. The measurement problem in quantum mechanics can introduce errors into the computation, so quantum error correction techniques are used to minimize these errors and ensure the accuracy of quantum computations.\n\nThis means that the quantum parallelism offered by entangled qubits is a useful resource for quantum computers, but the actual computation is still performed by making measurements on individual qubits and collapsing their superpositions, effectively reducing them to classical bits.",
