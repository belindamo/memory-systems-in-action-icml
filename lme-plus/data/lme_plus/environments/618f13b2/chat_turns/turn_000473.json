  "content": "As a general rule, it's recommended that human food should make up no more than 10% of your dog's daily diet, with the remaining 90% being a complete and balanced commercial dog food. Remember that many human foods are not nutritionally complete for dogs and may contain ingredients that can be harmful to their health. So, if you do decide to give your dog human food, do so only in moderation, and always choose healthy, safe options that won't upset their stomach or cause health problems. You should also talk to your veterinarian about what, when, and how much human food to give your dog, as they can help you determine what is a safe and healthy amount for your dog based on their age, weight, and other health factors.",
