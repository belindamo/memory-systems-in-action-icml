Here's a step-by-step guide to help you clean and preserve your baseball:\n\n**Cleaning the Baseball**\n\n1. **Gently dust the baseball**: Use a soft, dry cloth to remove any loose dirt or debris from the surface of the baseball. Avoid using compressed air or blowing on the baseball, as this can push dirt and debris further into the seams.\n2. **Inspect the baseball**: Examine the baseball for any stubborn stains, dirt, or grime. If you find any, proceed with caution, as you don't want to damage the signature or the baseball's finish.\n3. **Use a gentle cleaning solution**: Mix a small amount of mild soap, such as diluted dish soap, with distilled water. Dip a clean, soft cloth into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and gently wipe down the baseball. Avoid getting the baseball too wet, as this can cause the signature to run or the leather to become discolored.\n4. **Remove any stubborn stains**: If you find a particularly stubborn stain, you can use a gentle cleaning product specifically designed for cleaning baseballs, such as Baseball Cleaning Solution or a similar product. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, and test the product on a small, inconspicuous area first.\n5. **Dry the baseball**: Use a clean, dry cloth to gently pat the baseball dry. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing, as this can damage the signature or the leather.\n\n**Preserving the Baseball**\n\n1. **Avoid direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause the signature to fade, the leather to dry out, or the baseball to become discolored. If possible, display your baseball in a room with filtered or indirect sunlight.\n2. **Maintain a consistent temperature**: Extreme temperatures can cause the baseball to expand and contract, which can lead to cracking or damage. Keep your display case in a room with a consistent temperature between 60\u00b0F to 70\u00b0F (15\u00b0C to 21\u00b0C).\n3. **Monitor humidity**: High humidity can cause mold or mildew to grow on the baseball. Keep your display case in a room with a relative humidity between 40% to 60%.\n4. **Avoid handling the baseball**: Oils from your skin can damage the baseball or cause the signature to fade. If you need to handle the baseball, wear gloves or use a soft, clean cloth to handle it.\n5. **Consider using a conservation-grade storage material**: If you plan to store the baseball in a display case for an extended period, consider using a conservation-grade storage material, such as acid-free tissue paper or a polyester film, to separate the baseball from the display case's interior.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to clean and preserve your signed baseball, ensuring it remains in excellent condition for years to come.\n\nOnce you've cleaned and preserved your baseball, you can confidently display it in your chosen display case, knowing it's protected and showcased in a way that honors your local sports hero's signature.",
