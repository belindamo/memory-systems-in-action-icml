  "content": "Tele-rehabilitation can be an effective alternative to in-person rehabilitation services in many cases, but it may not be suitable for everyone or all conditions.\n\nMultiple studies have found that tele-rehabilitation can be as effective as in-person care in improving functional outcomes and quality of life for patients with various conditions, including stroke, spinal cord injury, and musculoskeletal disorders. Tele-rehabilitation has also been shown to reduce healthcare costs by eliminating travel time and expenses for patients and minimizing hospital readmissions.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to tele-rehabilitation. For some conditions or procedures, such as post-operative rehabilitation or manual therapy, hands-on techniques may be necessary and difficult to achieve remotely. The lack of the sensory feedback that can be gained from in-person rehabilitation may also be a limitation.\n\nOverall, tele-rehabilitation can be an effective alternative for those unable to access in-person services due to distance, mobility limitations, or social distancing measures. However, decisions about the best treatment approach should be made based on individual needs, and a healthcare provider's expert advice.",
