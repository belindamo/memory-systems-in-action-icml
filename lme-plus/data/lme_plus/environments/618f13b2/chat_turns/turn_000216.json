Remind yourself that it's okay to take risks and step out of your comfort zone.\n4. **What's the best that could happen?** Think about the positive outcomes, such as reconnecting with old friends, making new connections, or finding closure.\n\nTake your time to weigh the pros and cons, and trust your instincts. If you do decide to attend, I'd be happy to provide more tips and advice to help you prepare and make the most of your experience!",
