Praia do Barranco - This secluded beach is located near Albufeira and is accessible only by boat or a short hike. It is surrounded by cliffs and has a small restaurant and bar.\n\n3. Praia da Cordoama - This remote beach is located near Sagres and is known for its golden sand and clear water. It is surrounded by cliffs and dunes, making it a great spot for a peaceful day at the beach.\n\n4.
