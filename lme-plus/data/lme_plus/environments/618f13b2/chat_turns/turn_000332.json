This allows you to:\n\n1. Gradually transition from your active day to a relaxing evening.\n2. Disconnect from stimulating activities, like screens and electronics.\n3. Engage in calming activities, such as reading, meditation, or a warm bath.\n4. Get ready for bed at a reasonable hour, ensuring you get 7-9 hours of sleep.\n\nBy setting this reminder, you'll be more likely to:\n\n* Avoid late-night scrolling or binge-watching.\n* Reduce exposure to blue light, which can interfere with your sleep.\n* Create a relaxing bedtime routine that signals your body it's time to sleep.\n* Improve the quality of your sleep, which can have positive effects on your physical and mental well-being.\n\nRemember, consistency is key. Try to stick to this routine even on weekends or days off, to regulate your body's internal clock and maintain a healthy sleep schedule.\n\nHow do you plan to spend your wind-down time? Will you try reading, meditation, or something else to relax?",
