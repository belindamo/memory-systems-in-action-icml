  "content": "Yes, throughout history, the Alcazaba of M\u00e1laga was used for various purposes besides serving as a fortress and palace.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the fortress was utilized as a military barracks, and the Torre del Homenaje served as a prison. Later on, in the 18th century, the Royal Artillery Workshop was established within the fortress.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Alcazaba underwent a significant transformation when the provincial prison was established in the fortress. The prison remained in operation for over 100 years until the 1970s when it was finally closed. After the closure of the prison, the fortress was transformed into a museum and tourist attraction.\n\nToday, the Alcazaba serves as a major tourist attraction and important cultural and historical landmark. It is recognized as a National Monument and is visited by thousands of tourists each year who come to see the beautifully preserved architecture and learn about its rich history.",
