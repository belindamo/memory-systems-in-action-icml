  "content": "You can access tele-rehabilitation services from your mobile phone, as long as you have a smartphone with a camera, microphone, and internet connection. However, accessing services on a computer or tablet may offer a better experience due to the larger screen size and more stable connection.\n\nTo ensure a good tele-rehabilitation session, you will also need:\n\n1. A stable internet connection: A high-speed internet connection is necessary to ensure a smooth video call and clear communication with your healthcare provider.\n\n2. A quiet and well-lit environment: Find a quiet space to carry out your session where you can focus and reduce distractions. The area should be well-lit to allow your therapist to see your movements clearly.\n\n3. Camera and microphone: Ensure that the camera and microphone on your phone or computer are functioning correctly, positioned appropriately, and in good working condition.\n\n4. Relevant equipment: Depending on the type of rehabilitation program you are participating in, you may also require specific equipment, such as exercise bands, weights or a stationary rehabilitation machine. Your rehabilitation specialist will advise you on the type of equipment and how to use it effectively during sessions.\n\nOverall, the key to a successful tele-rehabilitation session is to prepare and be mindful of your surroundings. By doing so, you will help ensure that the session runs smoothly and that you can focus on achieving your rehabilitation goals.",
