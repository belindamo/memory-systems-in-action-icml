  "content": "Sorry to hear that Rachel returned your Cannondale Synapse with a flat tire! Hopefully, it's an easy fix.\n\nAs for your Trek FX 2, setting the tire pressure to around 65 PSI should provide a good balance between comfort and traction on rough trails. Just remember to check the pressure before you head out, as it can fluctuate depending on temperature changes and other factors.\n\nAlso, don't forget to check the tire's sidewalls for any signs of wear or damage before hitting the trails. You might also want to consider carrying a basic tool kit, a spare tube, and a pump or CO2 cartridges with you, just in case you need to make any repairs on the go.\n\nHave a great ride this weekend, and good luck with fixing that flat tire on your Cannondale Synapse!",
