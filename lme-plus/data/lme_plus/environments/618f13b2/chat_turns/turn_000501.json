  "content": "Quantum entanglement enables quantum computers to perform certain operations faster than classical computers. In a quantum computer, entangled qubits can be correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit affects the state of another, even if they are separated by a large distance. This property, known as quantum non-locality, enables quantum computers to perform certain tasks in a parallel and efficient manner that would be difficult or impossible with classical computers. For example, entangled qubits can be used to perform quantum teleportation, which is a crucial component of many quantum algorithms, including quantum error correction and quantum optimization.",
