Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create collections and add photos to them:\n\n**Creating Collections in Lightroom**\n\n1. **Switch to the Library module**: Make sure you're in the Library module by clicking on the \"Library\" tab at the top of the Lightroom window.\n2. **Access the Collections panel**: In the left-hand sidebar, click on the \"Collections\" tab to access the Collections panel.\n3. **Create a new collection**: Click the \"+\" icon at the top right corner of the Collections panel and select \"Collection\" from the dropdown menu.\n4. **Name your collection**: Enter a name for your collection, such as \"Landscapes\", \"Wildlife\", or \"Flora\".\n5. **Set the collection type**: Choose \"Collection\" as the collection type. You can also create a \"Smart Collection\" which is a collection that automatically updates based on specific criteria, but for now, let's stick with a regular collection.\n6. **Create additional collections**: Repeat steps 3-5 to create separate collections for each type of photo, such as \"Landscapes\", \"Wildlife\", \"Flora\", etc.\n\n**Adding Photos to Collections in Lightroom**\n\n1. **Select the photos**: In the Grid view, select the photos you want to add to a collection by clicking on them while holding down the Ctrl key (Windows) or Command key (Mac). You can also use the \"Select All\" button to select all photos in the current view.\n2. **Drag and drop**: Drag the selected photos to the desired collection in the Collections panel. You can also right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) on the selected photos and select \"Add to Collection\" > \"Choose Collection\" to add them to a specific collection.\n3. **Use the \"Add to Collection\" button**: Alternatively, you can select the photos and click the \"Add to Collection\" button at the bottom right corner of the Lightroom window. Then, select the desired collection from the dropdown menu.\n4. **Verify the collection contents**: Go to the Collections panel and click on the collection you just added photos to. Verify that the photos are indeed added to the collection.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* **Use the \"Include\" and \"Exclude\" filters**: In the Collections panel, you can use the \"Include\" and \"Exclude\" filters to refine the contents of a collection based on specific criteria, such as camera, lens, date, or rating.\n* **Create a collection set**: If you have multiple collections that are related to each other, you can create a collection set to group them together. To do this, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) on a collection and select \"Create Collection Set\".\n* **Use Smart Collections**: As mentioned earlier, Smart Collections can automatically update based on specific criteria. For example, you can create a Smart Collection that includes all photos taken with a specific camera or lens.\n\nBy following these steps, you should now have separate collections for each type of photo from your outing, making it easier to manage and edit your photos in Lightroom.",
