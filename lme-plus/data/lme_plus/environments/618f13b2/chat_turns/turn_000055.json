Yes, you can create a Smart Collection that includes all photos from a specific date range and location. Here's how:\n\n**Creating a Smart Collection in Lightroom**\n\n1. **Access the Collections panel**: In the Library module, click on the \"Collections\" tab in the left-hand sidebar.\n2. **Click on the \"+\" icon**: Click on the \"+\" icon at the top right corner of the Collections panel and select \"Smart Collection\" from the dropdown menu.\n3. **Name your Smart Collection**: Enter a name for your Smart Collection, such as \"Beach Vacation 2023\".\n4. **Define the rules**: In the \"Rule\" section, click on the \"plus\" icon to add a new rule. Select \"Capture Date\" from the dropdown menu, and then choose \"Is in range\" from the operator dropdown menu.\n5. **Set the date range**: Enter the start and end dates of your beach vacation in the \"Value\" field. You can use the calendar picker to select the dates.\n6. **Add a location rule**: Click on the \"plus\" icon again to add another rule. Select \"Location\" from the dropdown menu, and then choose \"Contains\" from the operator dropdown menu.\n7. **Enter the location**: Enter the location of your beach vacation in the \"Value\" field. You can type in the name of the location, such as \"Beach City, USA\" or \"Coastal Area, State\".\n8. **Save the Smart Collection**: Click \"Create\" to save the Smart Collection.\n\n**How it works**\n\nLightroom will now automatically include all photos that match the rules you defined in the Smart Collection. In this case, any photo taken during the specified date range and at the specified location will be included in the Smart Collection.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* **Use multiple rules**: You can add multiple rules to a Smart Collection to refine the criteria. For example, you could add a rule to include only photos taken during a specific time of day (e.g., sunrise or sunset).\n* **Use keywords and tags**: You can also use keywords and tags to define the rules for your Smart Collection. For example, you could create a Smart Collection that includes all photos with a specific keyword or tag.\n* **Use the \"Match\" operator**: Instead of using the \"Is in range\" operator, you can use the \"Match\" operator to specify an exact date or date range.\n* **Use the \"Any\" operator**: If you want to include photos from multiple locations, you can use the \"Any\" operator to specify multiple locations.\n\nBy creating a Smart Collection with these rules, you'll be able to easily find and view all your beach vacation photos, including those taken during sunrise and sunset, in one convenient collection.",
