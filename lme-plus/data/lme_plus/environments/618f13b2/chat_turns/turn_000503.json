  "content": "I apologize if I was not clear enough.\n\nQuantum entanglement allows quantum computers to perform certain operations that classical computers cannot, because entangled qubits can represent and process multiple states simultaneously. This property is known as quantum parallelism and enables quantum computers to perform certain operations much faster than classical computers.\n\nFor example, in a classical computer, each bit can be either 0 or 1, so it takes 2^n operations to sort n bits. However, in a quantum computer, multiple entangled qubits can represent all possible combinations of 0 and 1 at the same time, allowing the quantum computer to sort n qubits in just O(n log n) operations, which is a significant speedup over classical computers for large n.\n\nSimilarly, quantum computers can perform other operations, such as quantum simulation and quantum cryptography, much faster than classical computers, due to the ability to process information in a highly parallel and quantum manner.\n\nThis is the basic idea behind how quantum entanglement improves the processing ability of a quantum computer.",
