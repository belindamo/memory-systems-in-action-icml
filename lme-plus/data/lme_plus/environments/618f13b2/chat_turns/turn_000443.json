Chickpea and spinach curry: saut\u00e9 chickpeas, spinach, and onions in a spicy tomato-based sauce (such as tomato paste, garlic, ginger, curry powder, and garam masala).\n\n2. Tofu stir-fry: pan-fry tofu and mixed vegetables in a teriyaki or soy-free sauce (such as sesame oil, low-sodium soy sauce, minced garlic, and minced ginger).\n\n3. Lentil soup: simmer lentils, onions, garlic, carrots, celery, and vegetable broth until tender, and then pur\u00e9e for a smooth consistency.\n\n4. Quinoa salad: toss cooked quinoa with a variety of vegetables, such as crisp lettuce, sweet cherry tomatoes, grated carrots, sliced cucumbers, and diced avocado. Top with a lemon-olive oil dressing.\n\n5. Black bean tacos: saut\u00e9 black beans with onion and garlic, and then serve in warm tortillas with your choice of toppings, such as crumbled queso fresco, diced red pepper, chopped cilantro, and sliced jalape\u00f1o.\n\n6. Spinach and feta stuffed portobella mushrooms: remove the stems from large portobello mushrooms, spoon in a mix of saut\u00e9ed spinach and crumbled feta cheese, and then bake until tender.\n\n7. Seitan fajitas: slice seitan into strips and saut\u00e9 with onion and peppers. Serve with warm tortillas or over rice.\n\nHope these ideas are helpful!",
