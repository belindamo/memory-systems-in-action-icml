  "content": "I've been trying to incorporate street photography into my daily routine, especially after attending the workshop on May 1st and 2nd. I've been taking my camera with me to work and snapping photos of people on their morning commute. I've been experimenting with different angles and compositions, and I've been trying to anticipate moments and gestures. Do you have any tips on how to capture the perfect expression or gesture in a candid shot, especially when it comes to capturing candid shots of people in public places?",
