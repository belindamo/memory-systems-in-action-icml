This can include conducting thorough background checks, checking references, and asking behavioral interview questions to gauge how candidates would handle certain workplace scenarios.\n\nHowever, screening potential employees for problematic behavior can be challenging, as it's not always easy to predict how someone will behave in a specific work environment or how they'll interact with coworkers. What may seem like problematic behavior in one context might be acceptable behavior in another context.\n\nInstead of trying to entirely mitigate difficult behavior from coworkers through pre-employment screenings, it is essential to create a positive and inclusive workplace culture that not only fosters positive behavior but catches and addresses problems before they become too challenging. Regular interventions in workplace culture and behavior should be a top priority for managers to keep the work environment safe and healthy.",
