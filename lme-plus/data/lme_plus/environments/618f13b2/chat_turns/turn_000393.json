  "content": "Fueling and hydration are crucial aspects of endurance cycling events! Bonking, or hitting the wall, can be a miserable experience, but with a solid plan, you can minimize the risk. Here's a breakdown of what to eat and drink before, during, and after the event:\n\n**Before the Event (2-3 days to 1 hour before):**\n\n1. **Carb loading**: Focus on complex carbohydrates (60-70% of your daily calories) from sources like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Good options include:\n\t* Whole-grain pasta with marinara sauce and vegetables\n\t* Brown rice with grilled chicken and steamed vegetables\n\t* Oatmeal with banana and honey\n2. **Hydrate**: Drink plenty of water (at least 8-10 glasses) to ensure you're well-hydrated. You can also consume electrolyte-rich drinks like coconut water or sports drinks.\n3. **Avoid heavy meals**: Steer clear of heavy, greasy, or high-fiber meals that can cause digestive issues during the event.\n4. **Caffeine and sugar**: Limit or avoid caffeine and sugary foods/drinks 24 hours before the event to minimize jitters and energy crashes.\n5. **Electrolyte intake**: Consider taking an electrolyte supplement or consuming electrolyte-rich foods like bananas (potassium), dates (potassium), and avocados (potassium).\n\n**During the Event:**\n\n1. **Water and electrolyte drinks**: Drink water and electrolyte-rich drinks (like sports drinks or coconut water) regularly to replenish lost fluids and electrolytes. Aim for 1-2 bottles (16-32 oz) per hour.\n2. **Energy gels and chews**: Consume energy gels or chews every 30-60 minutes to maintain energy levels. Look for products with a mix of simple and complex carbohydrates.\n3. **Real food**: If you prefer solid food, opt for easy-to-digest options like energy bars, bananas, or dried fruits.\n4. **Caffeine**: Consider consuming a small amount of caffeine (e.g., in energy gels or chews) to help with fatigue, but be mindful of your sensitivity.\n\n**After the Event:**\n\n1. **Rehydrate**: Drink water and electrolyte-rich drinks within 30 minutes of finishing to replenish lost fluids and electrolytes.\n2. **Refuel**: Consume a balanced meal or snack with carbohydrates and protein within 30-60 minutes of finishing. Examples include:\n\t* Chocolate milk and a banana\n\t* Energy bar with nuts and dried fruits\n\t* Sandwich with turkey, avocado, and whole-grain bread\n3. **Replenish electrolytes**: Continue to drink electrolyte-rich drinks or consume electrolyte-rich foods to replenish lost stores.\n4. **Stretch and recover**: Take time to stretch and recover to aid in muscle repair and reduce soreness.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Experiment during training**: Test your fueling and hydration plan during training rides to ensure it works for you and make adjustments as needed.\n2. **Listen to your body**: Pay attention to your body's hunger and thirst cues, and adjust your fueling and hydration plan accordingly.\n3. **Avoid new foods**: Stick to familiar foods and drinks during the event to minimize the risk of gastrointestinal issues.\n4. **Pack extra**: Bring extra food, drinks, and electrolyte supplements in case you need them during the event.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well-prepared to fuel and hydrate your way to a successful charity cycling event!",
