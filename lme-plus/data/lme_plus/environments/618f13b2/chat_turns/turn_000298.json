  "content": "A safe is a great investment for protecting your valuable documents!\n\nFor a small number of documents, I'd recommend a compact, fire-resistant safe that's specifically designed for document protection. Here are some features to look for:\n\n**Size:**\n\n* Look for a safe with an internal capacity of around 0.5-1.5 cubic feet (15-40 liters). This will provide enough space for your documents, but not so large that it's cumbersome.\n\n**Fire Resistance:**\n\n* Ensure the safe is rated for fire protection by a reputable testing organization, such as UL (Underwriters Laboratories) or ETL (Intertek).\n* Look for a safe with a minimum 30-minute fire rating at 1550\u00b0F (843\u00b0C) to protect your documents from heat and flames.\n\n**Security Features:**\n\n* **Combination lock:** A combination lock is a good option for a small safe, as it eliminates the need for keys. Look for a lock with a minimum of 3-number combination.\n* **Key lock:** If you prefer a key lock, make sure it's a high-security key with a limited number of duplicates.\n* **Dual-locking mechanism:** Consider a safe with a dual-locking mechanism, which requires both the combination and key to open the safe.\n\n**Additional Features:**\n\n* **Water resistance:** If you live in an area prone to flooding or water damage, look for a safe with water-resistant seals or a waterproof rating.\n* **Pry-resistant doors:** A safe with a pry-resistant door will make it more difficult for thieves to gain access.\n* **Anchoring:** Consider a safe with anchoring options (e.g., bolts or screws) to secure it to the floor or wall, making it harder to move or remove.\n\n**Recommended Safes:**\n\n* **SentrySafe SFW123GDC:** A compact, fire-resistant safe with a 30-minute fire rating and a combination lock.\n* **First Alert 2087F-BD:** A small, fire-resistant safe with a 30-minute fire rating and a key lock.\n* **Liberty Safe HDX-250:** A compact, fire-resistant safe with a 30-minute fire rating and a dual-locking mechanism.\n\nWhen choosing a safe, be sure to read reviews, check the warranty, and consider the manufacturer's reputation.\n\nDo you have any other questions about safes or document protection?",
