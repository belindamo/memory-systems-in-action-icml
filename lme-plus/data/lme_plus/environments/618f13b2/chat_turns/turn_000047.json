  "content": "I'm so glad you found the ideas helpful! Planning a game night or potluck dinner with friends can be a great way to create meaningful connections and memories.\n\nI'm also happy to hear that you found the suggestion to set an intention before meeting up helpful. It can really make a big difference in creating a sense of direction and making the conversation more meaningful.\n\nRegarding your experience at your friend's birthday party, it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed or relieved to leave early, especially if you're an introvert or prefer smaller gatherings. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and take care of yourself. It's great that you recognized your limits and took action to take care of yourself.\n\nRemember, it's not about being antisocial or not wanting to spend time with friends, but about being mindful of your own energy and boundaries. By taking care of yourself, you'll be able to show up more fully and authentically in your relationships.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what did you do when you got home after leaving the party? Did you do something that helped you relax or recharge?",
