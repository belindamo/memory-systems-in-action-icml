Here are some tips to help you improve your chances of getting the perfect expression or gesture:\n\n1. **Know your equipment**: Familiarize yourself with your camera's settings and features, so you can quickly adjust to changing situations.\n2. **Observe and anticipate**: Study the behavior and body language of people in public places. Anticipate where they might move, what they might do, and how you can capture interesting moments.\n3. **Look for telltale signs**: Pay attention to people's facial expressions, hand movements, and posture. These can give you clues about their emotions and intentions.\n4. **Wait for the decisive moment**: Henri Cartier-Bresson's concept of the \"decisive moment\" refers to the peak moment of action or expression. Wait for that moment when the subject's expression or gesture is most revealing.\n5. **Shoot in burst mode**: When you see an interesting moment unfolding, shoot in burst mode to increase your chances of capturing the perfect expression or gesture.\n6. **Focus on the eyes**: The eyes are the windows to the soul. Focus on capturing expressive eyes to add depth and emotion to your candid shots.\n7. **Pay attention to lighting**: Soft, natural light can help bring out the subtleties of facial expressions. Avoid harsh mid-day sun, which can create unflattering shadows and highlights.\n8. **Experiment with angles**: Don't be afraid to experiment with unusual angles, such as shooting from low or high vantage points, to add variety to your candid shots.\n9. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with anticipating and capturing candid moments.\n10. **Stay alert and flexible**: Be prepared to adapt to changing situations and lighting conditions. Stay alert and focused, and be ready to pivot when opportunities arise.\n\nAdditional tips for capturing candid shots during your morning commute:\n\n* **Take advantage of peak hours**: Peak commute hours can provide a wealth of opportunities for interesting candid shots. Just be mindful of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings.\n* **Look for interesting vantage points**: Find unique vantage points, such as staircases, escalators, or bridges, to add variety to your candid shots.\n* **Capture the mundane**: Don't just focus on extraordinary moments. Capture the everyday, mundane aspects of commuting, like people checking their phones or reading books.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll increase your chances of capturing the perfect expression or gesture in a candid shot. Remember to stay patient, observant, and flexible, and don't be afraid to experiment and try new things!",
