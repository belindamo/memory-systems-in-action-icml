  "content": "Yes, there are some human foods that dogs can safely eat in moderation. However, it's important to note that dogs have different digestive systems than humans, and some foods that are safe for humans can be toxic to dogs. Here are some human foods that dogs can safely eat in moderation:\n\n1. Cooked lean meats such as chicken, turkey, and beef\n2. Certain fruits such as apples, bananas, and berries\n3. Vegetables such as carrots, green beans and pumpkin\n4. Plain white rice and cooked pasta\n5. Cottage cheese, plain yogurt and eggs\n\nHowever, it's important to make sure that these foods are thoroughly cooked, and that any fruits and vegetables are cut into small, bite-size pieces. And always avoid feeding your dog foods that are toxic to dogs, such as chocolate, caffeine, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, and anything containing xylitol. Also, it's important to remember that treats should generally make up no more than 10% of your dog's daily diet, and that a balanced and complete commercial dog food is typically the best choice for providing your dog with all the nutrients they need.",
