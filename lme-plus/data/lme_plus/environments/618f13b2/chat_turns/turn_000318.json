  "content": "The celebration of Dia de los Muertos has evolved over time, blending the ancient traditions of Aztec culture with the customs brought by Spanish colonizers. Initially, the holiday was celebrated in the summer, but it was later moved to November 1 and 2 to coincide with the Catholic holidays of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day.\n\nSome of the traditional customs associated with Dia de los Muertos include building of altars with offerings of food, flowers, and candles to welcome the souls of deceased loved ones back to the world of the living. People also visit cemeteries to clean and decorate the graves of their relatives, often spending the night there and sharing food and stories. Parades, music, and dances are also an important part of the celebration.\n\nIn modern times, the celebration of Dia de los Muertos has become more widespread, with events taking place not only in Mexico but in other parts of the world as well. Some modern customs associated with the holiday include elaborate face painting, making and sharing of sugar skulls, and creating of altars in public spaces as well as in homes.
