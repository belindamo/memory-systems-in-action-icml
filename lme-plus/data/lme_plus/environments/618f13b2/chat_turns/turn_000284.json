  "content": "Yes, Orthodox and Reform Jews have different beliefs about the afterlife.\n\nOrthodox Judaism believes in an afterlife where the soul is judged for its actions during life, and its fate is determined by God. Those who have followed Jewish law and performed mitzvot (good deeds) are believed to go to heaven, called Olam Habah (the World to Come), while those who have not may go to Gehenna, a place of punishment. The timing and nature of the afterlife are not described in definitive detail in Orthodox Jewish beliefs.\n\nIn contrast, Reform Judaism does not have a uniform or absolute belief in the afterlife. Reform Jews tend to view the concept of the afterlife as more symbolic and less literal, and may focus more on the impact of one's actions in this life rather than what happens after death. Some Reform Jews may believe in an afterlife, while others may not. The movement as a whole tends to emphasize the importance of leading a life of ethical and moral behavior in the present, rather than worrying about the afterlife.\n\nIt's important to note that both Orthodox and Reform Jews share the belief in rewarding good deeds and punishing evil deeds, but differ in their understanding of the specific nature of the afterlife.",
