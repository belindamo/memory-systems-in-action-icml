  "content": "Yes, there are specific criteria for a language to be classified as endangered. The criteria typically include:\n\n1. The number of remaining speakers: A language with a low number of speakers is at risk of becoming extinct.\n\n2. Age of the speakers: If most speakers of a language are elderly, and there are few young speakers, then the language is at risk of being lost.\n\n3. Intergenerational transmission: If parents are not passing the language down to their children, then the language may be at risk.\n\n4. Language prestige: If a language is not valued by the speakers of a dominant language, it may be at risk of being replaced.\n\n5. Political and economic factors: War, displacement, and globalization can all contribute to the decline of a language.\n\nThe exact criteria may vary depending on the organization or individual using them, but the above factors are typically considered when classifying a language as endangered.",
