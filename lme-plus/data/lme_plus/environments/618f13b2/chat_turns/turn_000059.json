And recovering details in the shadows can help bring out more depth and dimension in your image.\n\n**Adjusting Exposure and Contrast**\n\n1. **Exposure**: Move the \"Exposure\" slider to the right to brighten the image or to the left to darken it. You can also use the \"Exposure\" slider in the \"Basic\" panel to make global adjustments to the image.\n2. **Contrast**: Move the \"Contrast\" slider to the right to increase the contrast between light and dark areas of the image or to the left to decrease it.\n\n**Recovering Details in Shadows**\n\n1. **Shadows**: Move the \"Shadows\" slider to the right to recover details in the shadows. This will help bring out more detail in the darker areas of the image.\n2. ** Blacks**: Move the \"Blacks\" slider to the right to darken the blacks in the image and help separate them from the shadows.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* **Be careful not to overdo it**: Adjusting the exposure and contrast can quickly lead to an over-exposed or over-contrasted image. Make subtle adjustments and check the image regularly to avoid going too far.\n* **Use the histogram**: The histogram is a great tool to help you adjust the exposure and contrast of your image. It shows the distribution of tones in your image, with black on the left and white on the right. Adjust the exposure and contrast to optimize the histogram.\n* **Local adjustments**: If you want to make adjustments to specific areas of the image, use the \"Gradient Filter\" or \"Adjustment Brush\" tools to make local adjustments.\n\nRemember, the key to editing is to make subtle adjustments and check the image regularly to ensure you're not overdoing it. Take your time, and don't be afraid to experiment and try different things.",
