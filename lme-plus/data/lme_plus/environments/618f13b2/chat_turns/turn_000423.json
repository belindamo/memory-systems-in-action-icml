  "content": "It's understandable to have concerns about whether tele-rehabilitation sessions can be as beneficial as in-person sessions in terms of building rapport with your therapist. However, many patients and healthcare providers report that they feel connected and comfortable with the remote therapy sessions.\n\nTele-rehabilitation technology and platforms have evolved to provide a more interactive and engaging experience. For instance, video conferencing platforms are now equipped with functionalities, such as screen sharing, interactive whiteboards, and chat functionalities, which can be used to facilitate communication and information exchange between patients and their therapists.\n\nMoreover, there is evidence that patients feel more comfortable and may open up more about their health concerns, mental health, and social issues through tele-rehabilitation sessions. Patients may feel less scrutinized, and healthcare providers can observe their daily routines, and see the environment where they live and work. The lower stress environment of a remote session can sometimes lead to more relaxation and communication.\n\nIt's essential to remember that tele-rehabilitation sessions might take a little getting used to but, as with any new experience, it can become more comfortable over time.  As with in-person sessions, building a good patient-provider relationship, communicating well, and having a shared understanding of the goals of the rehabilitation plan is crucial.",
