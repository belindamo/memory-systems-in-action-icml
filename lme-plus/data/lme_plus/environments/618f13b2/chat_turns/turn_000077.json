Here are some tips to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Blend in**: Wear casual, neutral clothing that helps you blend in with the crowd. Avoid drawing attention to yourself or your camera.\n2. **Know your equipment**: Familiarize yourself with your camera's settings and features, so you can quickly adjust to changing situations without drawing attention to yourself.\n3. **Be aware of your surroundings**: Keep an eye on your environment and the people around you. Look for interesting backgrounds, lighting, and potential subjects.\n4. **Anticipate moments**: Expect the unexpected. Anticipate where people might move, what they might do, and how you can capture interesting moments.\n5. **Shoot from the hip or chest**: Hold your camera at hip or chest level, rather than bringing it up to your eye. This helps you capture more candid moments and avoid drawing attention to yourself.\n6. **Use a small camera or lens**: A smaller camera or lens can be less intimidating and help you blend in. Consider using a prime lens like your 50mm f/1.8, which is compact and discreet.\n7. **Shoot in good light**: Overcast or soft, natural light can help you capture more flattering and candid portraits. Avoid harsh mid-day sun, which can create unflattering shadows and highlights.\n8. **Look for gestures and interactions**: Focus on capturing interesting gestures, interactions, or moments of human connection. These can be more compelling than straightforward portraits.\n9. **Be respectful and discreet**: Remember that you're photographing people in public, not in a controlled environment. Be respectful of your subjects' privacy and personal space. Avoid taking photos of people who are clearly uncomfortable or unaware.\n10. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with capturing candid moments while keeping a low profile.\n\nAdditional tips for commuting photography:\n\n* **Take advantage of peak hours**: Peak commute hours can provide a wealth of opportunities for interesting photos. Just be mindful of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings.\n* **Look for interesting vantage points**: Find unique vantage points, such as staircases, escalators, or bridges, to add variety to your photos.\n* **Capture the mundane**: Don't just focus on extraordinary moments. Capture the everyday, mundane aspects of commuting, like people checking their phones or reading books.\n\nBy following these tips, you can increase your chances of capturing interesting moments and gestures while keeping a low profile. Happy shooting!",
