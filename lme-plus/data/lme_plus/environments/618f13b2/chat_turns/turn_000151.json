They're both excellent resources for bird identification.\n\nIncluding sketches or drawings of the birds you see in your journal is an EXCELLENT idea! Here's why:\n\n1. **Improved observation skills**: Sketching birds forces you to observe them more closely, paying attention to details like plumage patterns, beak shape, and wing structure. This can help you develop your observation skills and become a better birder.\n2. **Better retention**: When you draw a bird, you're more likely to remember its appearance and characteristics. This can help you recall details about the bird later on, even if you don't have a photo or reference image.\n3. **Enhanced journaling experience**: Sketches can add a creative and personal touch to your journal, making it more engaging and enjoyable to review. You might even discover new patterns or habits in your bird sightings over time.\n4. **Development of artistic skills**: Who knows, you might discover a hidden talent for art! Even if you don't consider yourself an artist, sketching birds can help you develop your drawing skills and appreciation for bird anatomy.\n5. **Unique record of your experiences**: Your sketches will become a unique and personal record of your birding experiences, allowing you to relive the thrill of each sighting and share your adventures with others.\n\nTips for including sketches in your journal:\n\n* Start simple: Don't worry if your drawings aren't perfect. Focus on capturing the bird's overall shape, proportions, and key features.\n* Use a variety of media: Experiment with different drawing tools, like pencils, pens, or watercolors, to find what works best for you.\n* Practice regularly: Try to sketch at least one bird per outing, or set aside time each week to practice drawing birds from memory or reference images.\n* Include notes and annotations: Add notes about the bird's behavior, habitat, and any interesting observations you made during the sighting.\n\nRemember, the goal is to have fun and enhance your birding experience, not to create a masterpiece. By including sketches in your journal, you'll create a unique and personalized record of your birding adventures that will become a treasured keepsake over time.",
