  "content": "I think I'll take some photos of my vintage Millennium Falcon toy and 1978 Luke Skywalker action figure to showcase them in the listing. I'll make sure to use a tripod and softbox to get good lighting, and I'll take photos from multiple angles to show off all the details. I'll also highlight any imperfections, like the minor scratches on the Falcon's hull, to be transparent with potential buyers. Thanks for the tips!",
