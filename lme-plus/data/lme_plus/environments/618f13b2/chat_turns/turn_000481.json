However, restoration efforts on historic landmarks, such as the Alcazaba in M\u00e1laga, follow strict principles and guidelines to ensure that the original architectural design and cultural significance are preserved. This often involves using traditional materials and techniques to match and recreate the original structure and design.\n\nThese efforts are also typically informed by extensive research into the history and cultural significance of the site, as well as consultations with experts in relevant fields.\n\nIt's worth noting that restoration work is an ongoing process, and as new information and technologies become available, efforts can be made to further refine and improve upon earlier restoration efforts.",
