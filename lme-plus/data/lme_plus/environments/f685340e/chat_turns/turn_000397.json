  "content": "Implementing calculation tools is an important step in implementing the features of your web-based commercial appraisal report writing application. Here are some steps you can follow to implement calculation tools for calculating key metrics such as the value of the property, the cost approach, and the sales comparison approach:\n\n1. Define the calculations: Define the calculations that need to be performed for each key metric. For example, the value of the property can be calculated by taking the sum of the income approach, the cost approach, and the sales comparison approach.\n2. Implement the calculations: Implement the calculations in PHP using industry-standard methods such as the income approach, the cost approach, and the sales comparison approach. Here is an example of implementing the income approach in PHP:\n```bash\n $net_operating_income = $gross_income - $vacancy_rate * $gross_income - $operating_expenses;\n $property_value_income = $net_operating_income / $capitalization_rate;\n```\n3. Customize the calculations: Customize the calculations based on the user's preferences. For example, the user can specify the capitalization rate used in the income approach, the land value used in the cost approach, or the comparable sales used in the sales comparison approach.\n4. Test the calculations: Test the calculations by entering sample data and comparing the results with industry-standard calculations. If the results match, the calculations are working as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, you can implement calculation tools for calculating key metrics such as the value of the property, the cost approach, and the sales comparison approach in your web-based commercial appraisal report writing application.
