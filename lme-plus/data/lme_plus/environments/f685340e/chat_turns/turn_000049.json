  "content": "The Tennessee River watershed is composed of a diverse geological makeup, including sedimentary rocks like limestone, sandstone, and shale, as well as metamorphic rocks like gneiss and schist. There are also significant areas with igneous rocks such as granite and diabase. The valley and ridge region of the watershed consists of folded and faulted sedimentary rocks, while the Appalachian Mountains are primarily composed of metamorphic rocks resulting from ancient mountain-building processes. In addition to these rock types, there are also significant deposits of coal, oil, and natural gas in the Tennessee River watershed.",
