  "content": "That's a great plan! Researching your competition and calculating your costs will give you a solid foundation for pricing your products. Tiering your pricing and offering bundles or promotions will provide customers with options and incentivize them to buy more.\n\nThe \"Limited Edition\" bundle idea is a fantastic way to create a sense of urgency and exclusivity around your new scents and colors. By offering a discounted price for a limited time, you'll encourage customers to make a purchase sooner rather than later. This can also help you clear out inventory and make room for new products.\n\nHere are a few more ideas to consider:\n\n* **Create a sense of scarcity**: Emphasize that the \"Limited Edition\" bundle is only available for a short time or in limited quantities to create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out).\n* **Use attention-grabbing language**: Use language like \"Exclusive Offer\" or \"Limited Time Only\" to draw attention to the bundle and create a sense of urgency.\n* **Offer a special discount**: Consider offering a special discount code or promo code for customers who purchase the \"Limited Edition\" bundle to make it feel like an even better deal.\n* **Create a sense of value**: Make sure customers understand the value they're getting with the \"Limited Edition\" bundle. Highlight the unique features of each product and how they work together to create a cohesive gift or self-care routine.\n\nBy offering a \"Limited Edition\" bundle, you'll not only drive sales but also create buzz around your new products and build excitement for future releases.\n\nWhat do you think about offering a loyalty program or rewards scheme to encourage repeat customers and build a loyal following?",
