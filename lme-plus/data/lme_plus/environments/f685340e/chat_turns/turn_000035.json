  "content": "Fiona Barton and Clare Mackintosh are both fantastic authors, and their writing styles do share some similarities with Alex Michaelides'.\n\nAs for Libby, yes, many of their books are available as e-books through the app. You can follow the same steps I mentioned earlier to search for their books on Libby:\n\n1. Open the Libby app and sign in with your library card or student ID.\n2. Tap on the \"Search\" icon (magnifying glass) at the bottom of the screen.\n3. Type the author's name (e.g., \"Fiona Barton\" or \"Clare Mackintosh\") or the title of the book you're interested in.\n4. If the book is available, you'll see it in the search results. You can then tap on the book to see its details, including the availability of the e-book.\n5. If the e-book is available, you can borrow it and download it to your device.\n\nHere are some specific titles to look for:\n\n* Fiona Barton:\n\t+ \"The Widow\" (her debut novel)\n\t+ \"The Child\"\n\t+ \"The Suspect\"\n* Clare Mackintosh:\n\t+ \"I Let You Go\" (her debut novel)\n\t+ \"The Farm\"\n\t+ \"The Lie of You\"\n\t+ \"The Other Mrs. Miller\"\n\nIf the books are not available on Libby, you can also try searching for them on OverDrive or requesting that your library purchase the e-book.\n\nRemember, Libby is constantly updating its catalog, so even if a book isn't available now, it might be added in the future. You can also set up notifications on Libby to alert you when a book becomes available.\n\nHappy reading, and I hope you enjoy Fiona Barton and Clare Mackintosh's books!",
