  "content": "Preparing the chicken for Yakitori is a crucial step to achieve tender, juicy, and flavorful skewers. Here's a traditional approach to prepare chicken for Yakitori:\n\n**Traditional Yakitori Chicken Preparation**\n\n1. **Cutting the Chicken**: Cut the chicken into small, bite-sized pieces, typically 1-1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) in size. You can use various chicken parts, such as:\n\t* Thigh meat ( motsu ): Cut into small cubes or thin strips.\n\t* Breast meat ( sasami ): Cut into thin strips or small cubes.\n\t* Skin ( kawa ): Cut into small pieces or strips.\n2. **Yakitori-Style Marinating**: Marinate the chicken pieces in a mixture of:\n\t* Salt: 1-2% of the chicken's weight (e.g., 10g salt for 1 kg chicken)\n\t* Sugar: 0.5-1% of the chicken's weight (e.g., 5g sugar for 1 kg chicken)\n\t* Sake or mirin: 1-2 tablespoons (optional, but recommended for added flavor)\n\nMix the marinade ingredients in a bowl, then add the chicken pieces. Massage the marinade into the meat, making sure each piece is coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n\n**Why this marinade?**: The salt helps to enhance the natural flavors of the chicken, while the sugar adds a touch of sweetness. The sake or mirin (a sweet Japanese cooking wine) adds depth and a hint of sweetness. This marinade is lighter than traditional Western-style marinades, as Yakitori emphasizes the natural flavors of the ingredients.\n\n**Seasoning before Grilling**: After marinating, remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour before grilling. Just before grilling, gently pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps the chicken cook more evenly and prevents flare-ups.\n\n**No additional seasoning is needed** before grilling, as the marinade and natural flavors of the chicken will shine through. However, you can brush the chicken with a small amount of oil or sake during grilling to add extra flavor and moisture.\n\nBy following this traditional approach, you'll achieve tender, juicy, and flavorful chicken Yakitori skewers that will impress your dinner party guests!",
