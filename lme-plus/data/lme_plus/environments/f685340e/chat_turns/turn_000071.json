That's great to hear.\n\nImproving your product displays at events can definitely make a big difference in attracting customers and increasing sales. Here are some tips to help you take your displays to the next level:\n\n1. **Create a visually appealing layout**: Consider the overall aesthetic you want to create. Use a mix of heights, textures, and colors to add visual interest. Group similar products together, and balance the display to guide the customer's eye through your products.\n2. **Use effective signage**: Clearly display your brand name, product names, prices, and any relevant information about your products. Make sure your signs are easy to read from a distance and are visually appealing.\n3. **Showcase your products at their best**: Use risers, shelves, or pedestals to display your products at eye level or slightly above. This will help them stand out and make them more appealing to customers.\n4. **Highlight your unique selling points**: Emphasize what sets your products apart from others. For example, if your candles are made with all-natural ingredients, highlight that on your signage or product labels.\n5. **Create a focal point**: Designate a central area of your display as a focal point, such as a statement piece or a special promotion. This will draw customers in and encourage them to explore your products further.\n6. **Keep it tidy and organized**: Make sure your display is well-organized, clean, and clutter-free. This will help customers easily find what they're looking for and make your products more appealing.\n7. **Use lighting to your advantage**: Consider using spotlights or string lights to highlight specific products or areas of your display. This can help draw attention to your products and create a warm, inviting atmosphere.\n8. **Make it interactive**: Encourage customers to engage with your products by providing samples, demonstrations, or hands-on experiences. This can help build connections with customers and increase sales.\n9. **Be prepared for sales**: Have a clear and efficient system in place for handling transactions, such as a credit card reader, a sales pad, and plenty of change on hand.\n10. **Take photos and evaluate**: Take photos of your display before and during the event to identify areas for improvement. Analyze what works well and what doesn't, and make adjustments for future events.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if it takes some trial and error to find the right display strategy for your products. Keep experimenting, and you'll eventually find a setup that showcases your products in the best possible way.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any specific areas you're struggling with or would like more advice on?",
