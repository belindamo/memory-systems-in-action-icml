It's not easy to establish a consistent routine, especially when it involves waking up early.\n\nIt's normal to struggle at first, but it sounds like you're getting into a groove. Consistency is key, and it's great that you're committing to it even on weekends. This will help regulate your body's internal clock and make it easier to wake up at the same time every day.\n\nRemember to be patient with yourself, and don't get discouraged if you miss a day or two. Life can be unpredictable, and it's okay to adjust your routine as needed. The important thing is that you're making progress and moving forward.\n\nHere are a few additional tips to help you continue to solidify your morning routine:\n\n1. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, even if it's just making it out of bed on time. This will help motivate you to continue your routine.\n2. **Make it enjoyable**: Find ways to make your morning routine enjoyable, whether it's listening to music, reading, or practicing yoga. This will make it something to look forward to, rather than a chore.\n3. **Be flexible**: Don't be too hard on yourself if you need to adjust your routine slightly. Life can be unpredictable, and it's okay to make changes as needed.\n4. **Use visual reminders**: Place reminders around your home, such as on your fridge or mirror, to help you stay on track and remember your goals.\n5. **Reward yourself**: Consider setting small rewards for yourself when you reach certain milestones, such as a week or a month of consistent wake-up times.\n\nKeep up the good work, and remember that it takes time to develop a habit. You're doing great, and with continued effort, your morning routine will become second nature!",
