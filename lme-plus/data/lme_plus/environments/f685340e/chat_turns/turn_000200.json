I also do a load of laundry every Sunday evening and try to vacuum or sweep the floors at least every other day. I've been doing pretty well, but last week I skipped my morning tidying routine for two days and it made a big difference in how cluttered my living room felt. I'm trying to avoid that from happening again.",
