Here are some tips to help you marinate like a pro:\n\n**Marinating Tofu for Kung Pao Tofu**\n\n1. **Press the tofu**: Remove excess liquid from the tofu by wrapping it in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and pressing it between two plates for at least 30 minutes. This helps the marinade penetrate deeper.\n2. **Use a mixture of acid and oil**: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, and cornstarch to create a marinade that will help tenderize the tofu and create a crispy exterior. Add some oil (e.g., peanut or vegetable oil) to balance the flavors.\n3. **Add aromatics**: Include minced garlic, ginger, and scallions in the marinade to infuse the tofu with aromatics.\n4. **Don't over-marinate**: Tofu can become too salty and mushy if marinated for too long. Limit the marinating time to 30 minutes to 1 hour.\n5. **Use a flavorful oil for frying**: After marinating, pat the tofu dry and fry it in a hot wok or skillet with a flavorful oil, such as peanut or avocado oil, to add depth to the dish.\n\n**Marinating Tempeh for Tempeh \"Fish\" Tacos**\n\n1. **Crumb and soak**: Crumble the tempeh into small pieces and soak it in a flavorful liquid, such as a mixture of lime juice, chili powder, cumin, and smoked paprika, for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.\n2. **Use a citrus-based marinade**: The acidity in citrus juices (like lime or lemon) helps break down the tempeh's bitterness and adds brightness to the dish.\n3. **Add umami flavor**: Include a small amount of nutritional yeast or miso paste in the marinade to give the tempeh a savory, umami flavor.\n4. **Don't over-soak**: Tempeh can become too soggy if soaked for too long. Limit the soaking time to 1-2 hours, depending on the desired texture.\n5. **Pat dry and crisp up**: After marinating, pat the tempeh dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Then, pan-fry or bake the tempeh until crispy and golden.\n\n**General Marinating Tips**\n\n1. **Use a ziplock bag or shallow dish**: Marinate the tofu or tempeh in a ziplock bag or a shallow dish, making sure the pieces are coated evenly.\n2. **Massage the marinade**: Gently massage the marinade into the tofu or tempeh to help it absorb the flavors.\n3. **Refrigerate**: Marinate in the refrigerator, not at room temperature, to prevent bacterial growth.\n4. **Experiment with flavors**: Don't be afraid to try different marinade combinations to find your favorite flavors.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to achieve that perfect balance of flavor and texture in your Kung Pao Tofu and Tempeh \"Fish\" Tacos. Happy marinating!",
