Don't worry, I've got some healthier sweet snack options that might just do the trick:\n\n1. **Fresh Fruit**: While you mentioned dried fruits, fresh fruits like apples, bananas, or berries are naturally sweet and packed with fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants.\n2. **Energy Balls**: Made with rolled oats, nuts, seeds, and dried fruits, these no-bake bites are sweet, healthy, and filling. You can customize the ingredients to your taste preferences.\n3. **Roasted Sweet Potato**: Sweet potatoes are a great source of natural sweetness. Simply slice them up, toss with cinnamon or nutmeg, and roast in the oven until caramelized.\n4. **Yogurt Parfait**: Combine Greek yogurt with fresh berries, honey, and a sprinkle of granola for a sweet and satisfying snack.\n5. **Homemade Granola Bars**: Make your own granola bars with rolled oats, nuts, seeds, and a hint of honey or maple syrup. This way, you can control the amount of sugar that goes into them.\n6. **Cinnamon Apple Slices**: Dip apple slices in a mixture of almond butter and cinnamon for a sweet and crunchy snack.\n7. **No-Bake Energy Chews**: Made with dates, nuts, and coconut flakes, these bite-sized chews are sweet, healthy, and easy to make.\n8. **Banana \"Nice\" Cream**: Freeze bananas and blend them into a creamy, sweet treat. You can also add in cocoa powder or peanut butter for a chocolatey or nutty flavor.\n9. **Honey-Glazed Nuts**: Mix honey with a pinch of salt and brush it over your favorite nuts (like almonds or cashews) for a sweet and crunchy snack.\n10. **Chia Seed Pudding**: Mix chia seeds with almond milk, honey, and vanilla extract, then refrigerate until thickened. Top with fresh fruit for a sweet and nutritious snack.\n\nNow, about that spicy Korean-inspired popcorn... That sounds AMAZING! Gochujang and soy sauce are a great combo. Have you considered experimenting with other flavors like furikake, garlic, or sesame oil?\n\nWhich of these sweet snack ideas resonates with you, or do you have any other dietary restrictions I can take into account?",
