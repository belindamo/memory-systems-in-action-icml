  "content": "Yes, it is frustrating for players when opponents intentionally lose matches to lower their skill rating and manipulate the matchmaking system. As AI-based matchmaking systems become more prevalent in online games, game developers are conscious about preventing such behavior and often put measures in place to prevent it.\n\nIn addition to the measures mentioned earlier, some games may also require a certain number of matches played before players are ranked in the matchmaking system. This helps to prevent players from tanking their skill rating deliberately before they even get started.\n\nFinally, players need to be vigilant and report players who engage in unfair behavior to help promote a level playing field. By working together, game developers and players can help prevent intentional losing and support a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for everyone involved.",
