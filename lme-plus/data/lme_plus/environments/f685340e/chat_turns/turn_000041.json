Let me dive into its benefits and how it affects the flavor of your dishes:\n\n**What is nutritional yeast?**\n\nNutritional yeast is a type of yeast that's grown on sugarcane or beet molasses and then harvested, washed, and dried. It's a popular vegan ingredient because it's naturally rich in protein, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals.\n\n**Nutritional benefits:**\n\n1. **High in protein**: Nutritional yeast is a good source of protein, making it an excellent addition to vegan diets.\n2. **Rich in B vitamins**: It's a natural source of several B vitamins, including vitamin B12, which is often lacking in plant-based diets.\n3. **Good source of fiber**: Nutritional yeast contains both soluble and insoluble fiber, supporting healthy digestion.\n4. **Mineral-rich**: It's a good source of minerals like selenium, zinc, and copper.\n\n**Umami flavor and uses:**\n\nNutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy, and slightly sweet flavor, which is often described as umami. This makes it an excellent addition to various dishes, including:\n\n1. **Cheese substitutes**: Nutritional yeast is often used to give vegan cheese alternatives a cheesy flavor.\n2. **Savory dishes**: Add it to soups, stews, and sauces for a depth of flavor.\n3. **Vegan \"meat\" dishes**: Use it to enhance the flavor of vegan meat alternatives, like tempeh, tofu, or seitan.\n4. **Snacks**: Sprinkle it on popcorn, vegan pizza, or crackers for a flavor boost.\n\n**How it affects the flavor in the tempeh marinade:**\n\nIn the Tempeh \"Fish\" Tacos recipe, the nutritional yeast adds a savory, umami flavor that complements the citrus and spices. It helps to:\n\n1. **Enhance the \"fishy\" flavor**: The umami taste of nutritional yeast contributes to the \"fishy\" flavor profile, making the tempeh more convincing as a fish substitute.\n2. **Balance the acidity**: The savory flavor of nutritional yeast balances the brightness of the lime juice, creating a well-rounded flavor profile.\n3. **Add depth**: It adds a richness and complexity to the dish, making it more engaging and satisfying.\n\nWhen using nutritional yeast, start with a small amount (about 1/2 teaspoon) and adjust to taste, as it can be quite potent. You can also blend it with other spices and herbs to create a custom flavor profile.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the benefits and uses of nutritional yeast!",
