  "content": "That's really helpful, thank you! I think my nephew and niece would love playing Candy Land and Go Fish. My brother and his wife just got back from their honeymoon, and they brought us some amazing chocolates from Paris. We had a nice dinner together last night and looked at their photos from the trip. Anyway, back to the game night, do you have any suggestions for some healthy snack options that we can have during the game night? My mom has been trying to reduce her salt intake, so I want to make sure the snacks are low-sodium.",
