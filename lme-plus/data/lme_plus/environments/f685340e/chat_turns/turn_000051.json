  "content": "As you pointed out, the diverse geological makeup of the Tennessee River watershed plays an important role in shaping the ecosystem and supporting its wildlife. The different types of rocks and minerals in the area influence the soils, water quality, and vegetation that are critical components of the ecosystem.\n\nFor example, areas with metamorphic rocks tend to have nutrient-rich soils that support a diverse range of plant species, which, in turn, provide habitat and forage for a variety of wildlife. The presence of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, can affect water pH levels and increase the abundance of aquatic species, including fish and other aquatic organisms.\n\nThe region's mineral deposits such as coal, oil, and natural gas may also have an impact on the ecosystem depending on how they are extracted and managed. Mining activities, for instance, can have significant impacts on water quality, soil stability, and wildlife habitats.\n\nOverall, the geological makeup of the Tennessee River watershed is an essential component of its ecological health, and understanding it is key to managing and preserving the area's biodiversity and natural resources.",
