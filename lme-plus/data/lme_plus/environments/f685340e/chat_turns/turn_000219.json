Bring a pot: You'll need a pot to heat the milk or water and cocoa powder. Make sure to choose a pot that is large enough to hold the amount of hot cocoa you want to make.\n\n2. Use a whisk: Whisk the cocoa powder and sugar together before adding liquid. The whisk will help to break up any lumps that may have formed in the cocoa powder.\n\n3. Heat the liquid: Heat the milk or water in a pot over the fire. Be careful not to let it boil or scorch the bottom of the pot.\n\n4. Add the cocoa mixture: Once the liquid is heated, add the cocoa mixture to the pot and whisk until everything is well combined.\n\n5. Add extras: You can add extras like vanilla extract, cinnamon, and whipped cream to your hot cocoa. Marshmallows are a classic addition for camping hot cocoa!\n\n6. Enjoy your cup: Once the hot cocoa is ready, pour it into a cup or a mug and enjoy! \n\nRemember that cocoa powder tends to settle to the bottom of your drinking cup, so be sure to have a spoon handy to give it a quick stir before each sip. Enjoy the delicious combination of the hot cocoa and Dutch Oven Peach Cobbler!",
