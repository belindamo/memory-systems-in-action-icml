  "content": "Sure, one example of a game that uses AI-based matchmaking systems is Overwatch. In Overwatch, the matchmaking system uses skill ratings to determine the skill level of each player. These skill ratings are based on the player's performance in previous matches, including wins and losses, as well as other in-game metrics like damage dealt, healing done, and objective time.\n\nUsing AI algorithms, Overwatch's matchmaking system is able to analyze these data points to identify the players' skill levels and match them with players of similar skill levels. The algorithm also considers other factors like group sizes, queuing time, and ping while creating a match. \n\nOver time, as players improve or decrease in skill level, the matchmaking system adjusts their ratings accordingly to ensure a fair and competitive match. Consequently, Overwatch's AI-based matchmaking system ensures that players are matched with opponents of equivalent skill levels and provides a satisfying gaming experience for players of different skill levels.",
