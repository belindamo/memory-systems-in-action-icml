Here are some tips to help you improve your arm movements:\n\n1. **Relaxation is key**: Tension in your arms can make your movements look stiff and unnatural. Try to relax your shoulders and arms, and let the music guide your movements.\n2. **Keep your elbows soft**: Avoid locking your elbows, as this can make your arms look stiff and robotic. Instead, keep them slightly bent and relaxed.\n3. **Use your entire arm**: Don't just move your hands or forearms; use your entire arm, from shoulder to finger, to create fluid movements.\n4. **Practice arm waves and circles**: Arm waves and circles are common movements in hip hop. Practice these in front of a mirror to get a feel for how your arms move.\n5. **Focus on your core engagement**: Your core muscles (abs and lower back) help stabilize your body and generate power for your arm movements. Engage your core by drawing your belly button towards your spine.\n6. **Watch and learn from others**: Observe how professional dancers or your instructor, Rachel, move their arms. Analyze their technique, and try to incorporate it into your own dancing.\n7. **Break down the movement**: When learning a new routine, break down the arm movements into smaller parts. Practice each part until you feel comfortable before putting it all together.\n8. **Practice in front of a mirror**: Practice your arm movements in front of a mirror to get a sense of how they look. Make adjustments as needed.\n9. **Stretch and condition**: Incorporate exercises that improve your flexibility and strength, such as arm circles, shoulder rolls, and push-ups.\n10. **Have fun and be patient**: Remember, it takes time and practice to develop muscle memory and confidence in your arm movements. Don't be too hard on yourself, and enjoy the process of learning and improving.\n\nIt's great that you have a supportive instructor like Rachel who provides helpful feedback. Don't hesitate to ask her for tips or guidance on improving your arm movements.\n\nGood luck with learning the routine to \"Thank U, Next\"! Have fun and show off those arm movements!",
