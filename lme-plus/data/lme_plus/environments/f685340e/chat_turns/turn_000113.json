Here are some tips to help you price your candles:\n\n1. **Calculate your costs**: Start by calculating the cost of materials, labor, and overheads. Make sure to include the cost of the wax, essential oils, fragrances, containers, labels, and any other materials you use.\n2. **Research the market**: Research your competition and similar artisanal candle makers to determine the average price range for similar products. Look at online marketplaces, craft fairs, and local boutiques to get an idea of what customers are willing to pay.\n3. **Consider the size and complexity**: Price your candles based on their size, complexity, and the amount of time it takes to make each one. Larger or more intricate candles may require more materials and labor, so price them accordingly.\n4. **Factor in your brand and unique selling points**: If your candles have unique features, such as eco-friendly materials, handcrafted designs, or bespoke fragrances, you may be able to charge a premium.\n5. **Start with a base price and adjust**: Start with a base price and adjust it based on the factors mentioned above. You can also offer different pricing tiers or bundles to appeal to different customer segments.\n6. **Test and adjust**: Test your prices at craft fairs, online, or in local boutiques and adjust them based on customer feedback and sales data.\n7. **Consider the psychology of pricing**: Prices that end in .95 or .99 can make your candles appear more affordable, while round numbers can make them seem more premium.\n8. **Be transparent about your pricing**: Consider including a pricing guide or FAQ section on your website or social media to explain how you price your candles and what makes them unique.\n\nFor your lavender and lemon candles, you might consider pricing them similarly to your existing candles, with some adjustments based on the unique features and materials used. For example:\n\n* Small candles (8-10 oz): $15-$20\n* Medium candles (12-14 oz): $20-$25\n* Large candles (16-18 oz): $25-$30\n* Specialty candles (unique fragrances or ingredients): $30-$40\n\nRemember, pricing is an ongoing process, and you may need to adjust your prices as your business grows and evolves. Stay flexible, and don't be afraid to experiment and try new things!",
