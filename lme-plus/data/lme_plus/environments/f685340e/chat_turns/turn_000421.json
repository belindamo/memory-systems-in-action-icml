  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can certainly provide some insights into how technology has impacted the preservation and evolution of Serbo-Croatian.\n\nTechnology has played a significant role in both preserving and changing the language over time. On the one hand, the use of technology has allowed for easier access to resources such as dictionaries, textbooks, and online language courses, which can help to preserve the language and make it more widely accessible. Additionally, the use of technology can aid in the documentation and preservation of historical documents and texts written in Serbo-Croatian, making them more widely available to researchers and scholars.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of technology and social media has also led to the introduction of new vocabulary, slang and changes in the way the language is used in general. People frequently use Memes, GIFs, slang and other casual expressions online, which can lead to the creation of new expressions and even the development of new dialects.\n\nOverall, while technology has helped to preserve the language in many ways, it has also contributed to its evolution by introducing new expressions, vocabulary and changing the way it is used in everyday communications.",
