Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Flexibility-focused classes:**\n\n1. **Hatha Yoga**: A traditional and gentle style of yoga that focuses on physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama) to increase flexibility and balance.\n2. **Yin Yoga**: A slow-paced, meditative practice that targets the deeper tissues of the body (connective tissues) to increase flexibility and range of motion.\n3. **Vinyasa Flow with a focus on forward bends**: This style of yoga links movement with breath, and a focus on forward bends can help increase flexibility in the hamstrings, hips, and spine.\n4. **Restorative Yoga**: A gentle, therapeutic practice that uses props to support the body in relaxing postures, allowing for deep relaxation and increased flexibility.\n\n**Balance-focused classes:**\n\n1. **Vinyasa Flow with a focus on standing balances**: This style of yoga can help improve balance and stability by incorporating standing postures that challenge your balance and engage your core.\n2. **Power Yoga**: A faster-paced, dynamic practice that builds internal heat, strength, and balance.\n3. **Iyengar Yoga**: A style of yoga that emphasizes precise alignment, the use of props, and the development of strength, balance, and flexibility.\n4. **Bikram Yoga**: A style of yoga that involves a set sequence of postures in a heated room, which can help improve balance, strength, and flexibility.\n\n**Classes that combine flexibility and balance:**\n\n1. **Anusara-Inspired Yoga**: A style of yoga that emphasizes positive thinking, self-acceptance, and a set of principles called the \"Universal Principles of Alignment\" to promote flexibility, balance, and inner awareness.\n2. **Kundalini Yoga**: A spiritual style of yoga that combines postures, breathing techniques, and meditation to awaken the energy in the body, promoting flexibility, balance, and overall well-being.\n3. **Sivananda Yoga**: A classical style of yoga that emphasizes the Five Points of Yoga: proper exercise, proper breathing, proper relaxation, proper diet, and positive thinking and meditation, to promote flexibility, balance, and overall health.\n\nRemember to always listen to your body and modify or come out of the pose if you experience any discomfort or pain. It's also a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or yoga therapist before starting a new exercise routine.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect class to improve your flexibility and balance!",
