  "content": "I've been using an air popper to make my popcorn, and I usually season it with a bit of oil and salt. I've also been experimenting with different seasonings like paprika, garlic powder, and chili powder to give it a bit of flavor. But I have to say, the lemon-herb flavor I tried recently was a game-changer! The brightness of the lemon zest really added a nice depth to the popcorn. I'm definitely going to try out more herbal flavors in the future.",
