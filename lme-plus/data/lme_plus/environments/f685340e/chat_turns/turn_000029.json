  "content": "\"The Last Mrs. Parrish\" and \"The Silent Patient\" do share some similarities in terms of their dark and twisted characters. Here are a few ways in which they're similar:\n\n* **Morally ambiguous characters**: Both novels feature characters who are complex, flawed, and often unlikeable. They're not your typical heroes or villains, but rather characters who exist in the gray areas. In \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\", Amber Patterson is a master manipulator who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, while in \"The Silent Patient\", Alicia Berenson is a famous painter who shoots her husband and then remains silent, refusing to explain her actions.\n* **Psychological gamesmanship**: Both novels are filled with psychological mind games, where characters manipulate and deceive each other to get what they want. In \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\", Amber plays a cat-and-mouse game with the Parrish family, while in \"The Silent Patient\", Alicia's silence is a form of psychological warfare against her husband and the people around her.\n* **Dark, twisted, and obsessive relationships**: Both novels explore dark, twisted, and obsessive relationships. In \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\", Amber becomes obsessed with the Parrish family and will do anything to become a part of their lives, while in \"The Silent Patient\", Alicia's relationship with her husband is marked by obsession, control, and manipulation.\n* **Atmosphere of tension and unease**: Both novels create an atmosphere of tension and unease, keeping readers on edge as they try to unravel the mysteries and secrets surrounding the characters.\n\nThat being said, the two novels are not identical, and \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\" has a more contemporary, satirical tone that critiques the excesses of the wealthy elite. \"The Silent Patient\", on the other hand, has a more atmospheric, introspective tone that explores the complexities of the human psyche.\n\nIf you enjoyed the dark, twisted characters and psychological mind games in \"The Silent Patient\", you'll likely find similar themes and elements in \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\". However, be prepared for a slightly different tone and style, as the two novels have distinct voices and approaches to storytelling.",
