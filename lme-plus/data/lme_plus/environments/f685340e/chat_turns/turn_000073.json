Here are some tips to help you arrange your candles and knitted scarves in a way that catches people's attention:\n\n**Group similar products together**: Organize your candles by scent, color, or type (e.g., all the lavender candles together, all the autumn-themed candles together, etc.). This creates a sense of cohesion and makes it easier for customers to find what they're looking for.\n\n**Create a rainbow effect**: Arrange your candles and scarves in a way that creates a gradient of colors. For example, you could place your candles in a row, with the brightest colors on one end and the more muted colors on the other. This creates a visually appealing spectrum of colors that draws the eye.\n\n**Use symmetry and asymmetry**: Balance your display by using symmetry (e.g., identical candles on either side of a centerpiece) and asymmetry (e.g., a larger candle or scarf on one side, balanced by a smaller one on the other). This creates visual interest and keeps the eye moving.\n\n**Play with heights and depths**: Use risers, pedestals, or stacked crates to create different levels and depths in your display. This adds visual interest and makes your products more engaging.\n\n**Create a focal point**: Designate a central area of your display as a focal point, such as a large, show-stopping candle or a beautifully arranged selection of scarves. This draws the customer's eye and encourages them to explore your products further.\n\n**Leave some empty space**: Don't overcrowd your display. Leave some empty space between products to create a sense of breathability and make each item stand out.\n\n**Consider a theme**: Create a themed display that tells a story or evokes a particular feeling. For example, you could create a \"Cozy Winter\" display with candles in warm, seasonal scents and scarves in rich, autumnal colors.\n\n**Experiment and adjust**: Don't be afraid to try out different arrangements and adjust as needed. Take photos of your display and evaluate what's working and what's not.\n\nRegarding your plans to expand your product line, that's exciting! Consider how you can incorporate your new scents and colors into your display. You could create a separate section for your new products or integrate them into your existing display in a way that creates a sense of cohesion.\n\nHere's an idea: you could create a \"New Arrivals\" section that showcases your latest scents and colors. This could be a smaller, designated area within your larger display that highlights the newest additions to your product line.\n\nI hope these tips help you create a visually appealing layout that showcases your beautiful products!",
