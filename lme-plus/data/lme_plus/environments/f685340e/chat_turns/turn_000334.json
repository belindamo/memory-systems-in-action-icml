  "content": "The Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is an iconic Chicago landmark and a must-visit attraction.\n\nThe Willis Tower is located in the Loop area of downtown Chicago, so it's easily accessible on foot or by public transportation. You don't need to take a taxi or ride-share, unless you're short on time or prefer a door-to-door service.\n\n**Walking:** The Willis Tower is about a 10-15 minute walk from many downtown hotels and attractions. You can walk west on Adams Street or Jackson Boulevard from the Loop area to reach the tower.\n\n**Public Transportation:** You can take the 'L' train (Red, Orange, Brown, or Purple Line) to the Quincy/Wells stop, which is just a block away from the Willis Tower. From there, walk east on Quincy Street to reach the tower.\n\n**Address:** 233 S. Wacker Drive, Chicago, IL 60606\n\nOnce you arrive, be prepared for security checks before entering the building. You'll take the elevator to the Skydeck on the 103rd floor, which offers breathtaking views of the city and Lake Michigan.\n\nTip: Try to visit the Willis Tower on a clear day for the best views, and consider booking your tickets in advance to avoid long lines.\n\nEnjoy your visit to the Willis Tower!",
