Can you please break down your $120 purchase into categories? For example:\n\n* Produce (fresh fruits and vegetables)\n* Meat/Seafood\n* Dairy/Eggs\n* Canned Goods/Pantry Items\n* Snacks\n* Beverages\n* Household Essentials (cleaning supplies, paper products, etc.)\n* Personal Care Items (toiletries, etc.)\n\nTry to estimate the amount you spent in each category. This will help us identify areas where you might be able to cut back.\n\nAdditionally, can you tell me:\n\n* What was your original budget for this trip to Walmart?\n* Do you have a regular grocery budget per week/month?\n* Do you plan your meals and make a shopping list before you go to the store, or do you tend to shop on impulse?\n\nOnce we have this information, we can work together to:\n\n* Identify areas for improvement\n* Create a plan to stay within your budget\n* Develop strategies to avoid overspending in the future\n\nRemember, tracking your spending is a great first step in taking control of your finances. You got this!",
