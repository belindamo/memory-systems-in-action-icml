Hot Cocoa: Hot cocoa is a classic camping drink that pairs well with sweet and fruity desserts. You can make it by heating milk or water in a pot over the fire, adding cocoa powder and sugar, and stirring until everything is well combined. 2. Hot Apple Cider: Hot apple cider is another classic camping drink that pairs well with peach cobbler. You can make it by heating apple cider and spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a pot over the fire. 3. Sweet Iced Tea: Sweet iced tea is a refreshing drink that pairs well with fruity desserts. You can make it by brewing tea and adding sugar until it's sweet enough for your liking. 4. White Wine: If you're looking for an alcoholic drink to pair with your peach cobbler, a crisp, fruity white wine like Riesling or Pinot Grigio would be a good choice. 5. Lemonade: Lemonade is another refreshing drink that pairs well with fruit-based desserts. You can make it by mixing lemon juice, water, and sugar to taste. 6. Coffee: A hot cup of coffee is a great way to end a meal, and it can also help to balance out the sweetness of the peach cobbler. 7. Hopped Cider: For those looking for a bit more of a kick, hopped cider or beer can be a great pairing. An amber ale can complement the sweetness of the cobbler and its peachy essence. Remember to always drink responsibly and never drink and drive.",
