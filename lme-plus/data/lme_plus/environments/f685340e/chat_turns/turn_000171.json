It's wonderful that you're already taking ballet classes and seeing the benefits of it in your posture, balance, flexibility, and technique.\n\nMadame Dupont sounds like a great instructor, and her strictness is likely a testament to her high standards and dedication to helping her students improve. It's not always easy to find an instructor who can strike the right balance between being supportive and pushing you to do your best, but it sounds like Madame Dupont is doing just that.\n\nBallet is an excellent foundation for any style of dance, and it's fantastic that you're seeing improvements in your flexibility and technique. As you continue to take classes, you may find that you're able to execute movements with more ease, control, and precision.\n\nRemember to keep practicing regularly, even if it's just a few times a week. Consistency is key when it comes to improving your technique, and I'm sure Madame Dupont would agree.\n\nIt's also great that you're noticing improvements in your posture and balance. Ballet can do wonders for your overall physical awareness and coordination, which can benefit many areas of your life, not just dancing.\n\nKeep up the fantastic work, and I'm sure you'll continue to see progress and growth in your dancing.
