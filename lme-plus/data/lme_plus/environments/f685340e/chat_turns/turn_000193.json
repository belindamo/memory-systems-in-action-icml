That's a great score!\n\nWhen it comes to selling your vintage Barbie dolls, including the 1960s-era one, you have a few options:\n\n**Listing separately:**\n\n1. **Highlight its rarity**: By listing the 1960s-era Barbie doll separately, you can highlight its rarity and unique features, which might attract collectors who are specifically looking for that era or model.\n2. **Get a higher price**: You might be able to get a higher price for the doll if you list it separately, as collectors may be willing to pay a premium for a rare or hard-to-find item.\n3. **Targeted marketing**: You can target your marketing efforts specifically to collectors who are interested in vintage Barbie dolls from the 1960s, which could result in a faster sale.\n\n**Bundling with other vintage Barbie dolls:**\n\n1. **Convenience**: Bundling your vintage Barbie dolls together can be more convenient for buyers who are looking to purchase multiple items at once.\n2. **Discounted price**: You could offer a discounted price for the bundle, which might attract buyers who are looking for a good deal.\n3. **Increased visibility**: A bundle listing can attract more views, as buyers searching for vintage Barbie dolls might stumble upon your listing while browsing for individual dolls.\n\nConsider the following factors to decide whether to list your 1960s-era Barbie doll separately or bundle it with your other vintage Barbie dolls:\n\n1. **Rarity and condition**: If the 1960s-era Barbie doll is in excellent condition and extremely rare, it might be worth listing separately to attract collectors who are willing to pay a premium.\n2. **Your target audience**: If you're targeting collectors who are specifically looking for vintage Barbie dolls from the 1960s, listing the doll separately might be a better option. If you're targeting buyers who are looking for a collection of vintage Barbie dolls, bundling might be a better choice.\n3. **Your pricing strategy**: If you're willing to offer a discounted price for the bundle, bundling might be a good option. If you want to get a higher price for the 1960s-era Barbie doll, listing it separately might be a better choice.\n4. **Your time and resources**: If you have the time and resources to create separate listings and market each doll individually, listing separately might be a good option. If you're short on time, bundling might be a more efficient choice.\n\nYou could also consider a hybrid approach:\n\n1. **List the 1960s-era Barbie doll separately**: Create a separate listing for the 1960s-era Barbie doll, highlighting its rarity and unique features.\n2. **Offer a bundle option**: In the listing, offer a bundle option that includes the 1960s-era Barbie doll and your other vintage Barbie dolls at a discounted price.\n\nThis way, you can appeal to both collectors who are looking for a rare item and buyers who are looking for a collection of vintage Barbie dolls.",
