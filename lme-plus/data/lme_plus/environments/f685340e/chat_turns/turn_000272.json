I've also bookmarked some guided meditations on Insight Timer that focus on anxiety and stress relief. I'm a bit concerned about finding a quiet space to meditate, as I live with family members who can be noisy. Do you have any suggestions on how to deal with distractions or background noise during meditation?",
