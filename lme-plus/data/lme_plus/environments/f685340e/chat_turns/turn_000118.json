  "content": "I think I spent around $30 on produce, $20 on dairy products (mainly that Greek yogurt I mentioned), and $40 on canned goods and pantry items. The rest was probably household essentials and some miscellaneous items. My original budget was $80, so I definitely overspent. I don't really have a regular grocery budget, but I'm trying to aim for around $100 per week. I usually make a list, but I tend to add some impulse buys, like those non-perishable items that were on sale.",
