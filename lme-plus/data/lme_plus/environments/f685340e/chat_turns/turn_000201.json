To help you stay on track, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Anchor your routine to a habit**: Since you mentioned you tidy up after breakfast, try to make it a non-negotiable part of your morning routine, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. This way, you'll be more likely to stick to it.\n2. **Create a 'reset' rule**: If you miss a day or two, don't let it derail your entire routine. Instead, commit to doing an extra 10-15 minutes of tidying the next day to get back on track. This will help you quickly recover from any clutter buildup.\n3. **Make it a mindful activity**: Instead of just going through the motions, try to make your daily tidying routine a mindful activity. Put on some music, enjoy the quiet morning time, and focus on the task at hand. This might make it more enjoyable and increase your chances of sticking to it.\n4. **Identify your ' clutter hotspots'**: Take note of the areas in your living room that tend to get cluttered the most. Focus on those areas during your daily tidying routine, so you can stay on top of them.\n5. **Leave a reminder**: Place a sticky note or a reminder on your phone to tidy up every morning. This will help you remember and stay committed to your routine.\n6. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, like completing your daily tidying routine for a week straight. This will help motivate you to continue the habit.\n\nFor your Sunday laundry and vacuuming schedule, you might want to consider:\n\n1. **Batch similar tasks together**: Since you're doing laundry on Sundays, you could also use this time to quickly tidy up your bedroom or change your sheets. This will help you stay on top of your cleaning tasks and make the most of your time.\n2. **Schedule it in your calendar**: Treat your Sunday laundry and vacuuming tasks as non-negotiable appointments and schedule them in your calendar. This will help you remember and prioritize these tasks.\n\nRemember, consistency is key, and it's okay to have off days. The important thing is that you're aware of the impact it has on your space and are committed to getting back on track.\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions? Is there anything else you'd like to add or change about your current routine?",
