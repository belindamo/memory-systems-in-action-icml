  "content": "Implementing report templates is an important step in implementing the features of your web-based commercial appraisal report writing application. Here are some steps you can follow to implement report templates for generating the final appraisal reports:\n\n1. Define the report structure: Define the structure of the appraisal reports, including the common elements such as the property description, market analysis, and conclusions. Decide on the format for the report, such as a Microsoft Word document or a PDF.\n2. Create a template file: Create a template file for the appraisal report. The template file should include placeholders for the information that will be generated from the database, such as the property location, size, and condition. Here is an example of a report template in HTML format:\n\n <h1>Appraisal Report</h1>\n <h2>Property Description</h2>\n <p>Location: {location}</p>\n <p>Size: {size}</p>\n <p>Age: {age}</p>\n <p>Condition: {condition}</p>\n <h2>Market Analysis</h2>\n <p>Market analysis goes here.</p>\n <h2>Conclusions</h2>\n <p>Conclusions go here.</p>\n3. Generate the reports: Use the template file to generate the final appraisal reports by replacing the placeholders in the template with information from the database. In PHP, you can use the str\\_replace function to replace the placeholders with the actual data from the database. Here is an example of generating a report in PHP:\n\n <?php\n try {\n $pdo = new PDO(\"mysql:host=<hostname>;dbname=<database\\_name>\", \"<username>\", \"<password>\");\n $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR\\_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE\\_EXCEPTION);\n\n $stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"SELECT \\* FROM properties WHERE id = ?\");\n $stmt->execute([$property\\_id]);\n $property = $stmt->fetch();\n\n $report = file\\_get\\_contents('template.html');\n $report = str\\_replace('{location}', $property['location'], $report);\n $report = str\\_replace('{size}', $property['size'], $report);\n $report = str\\_replace('{age}', $property['age'], $report);\n $report = str\\_replace('{condition}', $property['condition'], $report);\n\n header('Content-Type: text/html');\n echo $report;\n } catch (PDOException $e) {\n echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n }\n ?>\n\nBy following these steps, you can implement report templates for generating the final appraisal reports in your web-based commercial appraisal report writing application.
