      "content": "I do not have a personal opinion about the matter. however, based on trends and analysis, it's likely that libraries will continue to rely on social media for promotion even after the pandemic is over. the pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of many industries, including libraries. in-person events, programs, and services may return, but it's clear that many patrons enjoy being able to interact with libraries and access their resources online.\n\nsocial media has become an essential tool for libraries to reach and engage with patrons. it allows libraries to promote their services, collections and events to a wider audience, foster engagement and build a stronger sense of community. even before the pandemic, libraries were increasingly using social media to promote their resources and interact with patrons. with more people relying on digital services and social media, it's likely that libraries will continue to invest in their social media presence as part of their overall promotional strategy in the future."
