      "content": "**\"The Last Mrs. Parrish\" by Liv Constantine**:\n\nThis debut novel has been getting a lot of buzz in the psychological thriller community, and for good reason. Here's what sets it apart:\n\n* **Unique protagonist**: Amber Patterson is not your typical protagonist. She's a complex, morally ambiguous character who will stop at nothing to claim the life she feels she deserves. You'll love to hate her, and yet, you'll be drawn to her determination and cunning.\n* **Social commentary**: The novel explores themes of class, privilege, and the American Dream. It's a scathing critique of the wealthy elite and the lengths people will go to maintain their status.\n* **Twisty plot**: The story is full of surprises, with multiple twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end. Just when you think you know what's happening, the rug is pulled out from under you.\n* **Dark humor**: The writing is witty and darkly humorous, which adds to the novel's charm.\n\nThe story follows Amber as she sets her sights on the wealthy and glamorous Parrish family. She'll do whatever it takes to become the next Mrs. Parrish, even if it means destroying the current one.\n\n**\"The Wife Between Us\" by Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen**:\n\nThis novel is a masterclass in psychological manipulation, with a unique twist that sets it apart from other thrillers:\n\n* **Unreliable narrators**: The story is told through multiple perspectives, but beware: none of the narrators are entirely trustworthy. You'll be forced to question everything you think you know.\n* **Marriage as a facade**: The novel explores the secrets and lies that can exist in even the most seemingly perfect marriages. It's a commentary on the masks we wear in public and the truths we hide behind closed doors.\n* **The twist**: The big reveal is expertly handled, and it's not just a simple \"gotcha\" moment. The twist fundamentally changes the way you understand the story and the characters.\n* **Character-driven**: The novel focuses on the complex relationships between the characters, making it a character-driven thriller that's as much about the people as it is about the plot.\n\nThe story centers around Vanessa, who's obsessed with her ex-husband's new wife, Amelia. But as the narrative unfolds, you'll realize that nothing is as it seems, and the truth is far more sinister than you could have imagined.\n\nBoth of these novels offer something unique to the psychological thriller genre, and I think you'll find them engaging and thought-provoking."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "\"The Last Mrs. Parrish\" and \"The Silent Patient\" do share some similarities in terms of their dark and twisted characters. Here are a few ways in which they're similar:\n\n* **Morally ambiguous characters**: Both novels feature characters who are complex, flawed, and often unlikeable. They're not your typical heroes or villains, but rather characters who exist in the gray areas. In \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\", Amber Patterson is a master manipulator who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, while in \"The Silent Patient\", Alicia Berenson is a famous painter who shoots her husband and then remains silent, refusing to explain her actions.\n* **Psychological gamesmanship**: Both novels are filled with psychological mind games, where characters manipulate and deceive each other to get what they want. In \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\", Amber plays a cat-and-mouse game with the Parrish family, while in \"The Silent Patient\", Alicia's silence is a form of psychological warfare against her husband and the people around her.\n* **Dark, twisted, and obsessive relationships**: Both novels explore dark, twisted, and obsessive relationships. In \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\", Amber becomes obsessed with the Parrish family and will do anything to become a part of their lives, while in \"The Silent Patient\", Alicia's relationship with her husband is marked by obsession, control, and manipulation.\n* **Atmosphere of tension and unease**: Both novels create an atmosphere of tension and unease, keeping readers on edge as they try to unravel the mysteries and secrets surrounding the characters.\n\nThat being said, the two novels are not identical, and \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\" has a more contemporary, satirical tone that critiques the excesses of the wealthy elite. \"The Silent Patient\", on the other hand, has a more atmospheric, introspective tone that explores the complexities of the human psyche.\n\nIf you enjoyed the dark, twisted characters and psychological mind games in \"The Silent Patient\", you'll likely find similar themes and elements in \"The Last Mrs. Parrish\". However, be prepared for a slightly different tone and style, as the two novels have distinct voices and approaches to storytelling."
