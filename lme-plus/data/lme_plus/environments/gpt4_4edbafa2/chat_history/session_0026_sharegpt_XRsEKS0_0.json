Also, I did an internship as a consultant at Mercer Consulting, which, as you know, is a human resources management consulting firm.\nI'm more interested in performance management, compensation management."

      "content": "Well, when I was a recruiter at ByteDance, I had to screen resumes every day, identify candidates that matched the requirements of the position, call potential candidates and ask if they had any interest in applying for the position, and SELL our position to those quality candidates. If we meet suitable candidates, we will help them to arrange interviews with interviewers, and sometimes I will also interview them as interviewers. If they successfully pass the interview, I will arrange the onboarding process for them.\nI think performance management and compensation management are two very important parts of the HRM module to motivate employees to keep working in the right direction. However, I have not been involved in the actual work of performance management and compensation management."
