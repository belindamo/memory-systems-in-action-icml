  "content": "The Nature Scavenger Hunt and Outdoor Obstacle Course will definitely keep your niece engaged and active!\n\nFor group games with 4-5 kids, I've got some fantastic suggestions that are perfect for a fun-filled outdoor adventure:\n\n1. **Capture the Flag**: A classic team-based game where each team tries to capture the other team's flag and return it to their own base without getting caught.\n2. **Sardines**: A variation of hide-and-seek where only one person hides, and the others have to find them. When someone finds the hidden person, they hide with them until all players are hidden together.\n3. **Four Square**: Draw a large square on the ground with chalk and divide it into four quadrants. Players bounce a ball in their quadrant, trying to make it land in another player's quadrant.\n4. **Red Rover**: A classic team-based game where two teams hold hands in a line, and one team sends a player to try to break through the other team's held hands.\n5. **Nature Tag**: A variation of traditional tag, where one player is \"it\" and has to chase the other players, who are trying to reach designated \"safe zones\" in nature (e.g., a tree, a rock, or a specific landmark).\n6. **Group Nature Challenge**: Divide the group into teams and set up several nature-based challenges, such as:\n\t* Who can collect the most leaves of a specific color?\n\t* Who can find the largest pinecone?\n\t* Who can skip a rock the farthest across a body of water?\n7. **Follow the Leader**: Choose one player to be the leader, and they have to perform different actions (e.g., jumping jacks, spinning around, or crawling) while the other players follow their lead.\n\nThese games promote teamwork, social interaction, and physical activity, making them perfect for a fun day outdoors with your niece and her friends!\n\nRemember to set some basic rules and guidelines before starting the games, and make sure the kids understand the objectives and any safety precautions.\n\nHave a fantastic time on your outdoor adventure!",
