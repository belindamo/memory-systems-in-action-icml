It's more honest, right?\"\n\n**Concise Version:** \"OkCupid profile idea: 'Not a serial killer, just a lot of free time.' Swipe right for a maybe-murderer.\"\n\n**Changes:**\n\n* We removed the \"It's more honest, right?\" part to make the joke more concise.\n* We added \"Swipe right for a maybe-murderer\" to incorporate the dating app aspect and make the joke more punchy.\n* We used a more conversational tone to make the joke feel more natural and relatable.\n\nBy adding \"Swipe right for a maybe-murderer,\" we're incorporating the dating app aspect and making the joke more concise and punchy. The \"maybe-murderer\" part is a clever twist that adds to the humor.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to make the joke even more concise by removing the \"OkCupid profile idea\" part:\n\n**Concise Version:** \"Not a serial killer, just a lot of free time. Swipe right for a maybe-murderer.\"\n\nThis version is even more concise and punchy, but it might be a bit too concise. The \"OkCupid profile idea\" part helps to set up the joke and make it more relatable.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you want to try any other variations or do you like one of these options?",
