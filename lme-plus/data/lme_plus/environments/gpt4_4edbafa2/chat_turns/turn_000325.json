Can you discuss the available financing rates and incentives?\" This keeps your options open and encourages the salesperson to provide more information.\n8. **Do you have any other dealerships or offers to compare?**\n\t* Response: \"I've researched several dealerships, but I'm interested in working with you. Can you match or beat any competitor offers?\" This shows you're willing to do business with them, but you're also looking for the best deal.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Stay calm and confident during the negotiation process\n* Avoid making emotional decisions or impulsive offers\n* Take notes and ask questions to clarify any doubts\n* Be willing to walk away if the deal isn't right for you\n\nBy being prepared for these common questions, you'll be better equipped to navigate the negotiation process and get a great deal on your CR-V EX-L.",
