It's easy to get caught up in the moment and forget about cleaning, but with a reminder, you'll stay on track.\n\nIt's also awesome that you've been doing a good job of cleaning as you go while cooking. That's a huge part of maintaining a clean kitchen, and it's great that you're already making progress.\n\nRemember, the key is to make cleaning a habit, and with the \"5-Minute Rule\" and your existing cleaning-as-you-go habits, you're well on your way to creating a routine that will keep your kitchen tidy and organized.\n\nDon't forget to be kind to yourself if you miss a day or two. Life can get busy, and it's okay if you don't always meet your goals. Just get back on track as soon as you can, and celebrate your successes along the way.\n\nKeep me updated on your progress, and if you have any other questions or need any more tips, feel free to ask!",
