  "content": "Chicken parmesan is a classic! It's great that you're inspired by your aunt's family gathering. I'd be happy to help you come up with some delicious options to complement your famous dish.\n\nHere are some ideas that pair well with chicken parmesan:\n\n1. **Pasta**: A classic Italian-American combination! Choose a simple yet flavorful pasta dish like spaghetti aglio e olio, fettuccine Alfredo, or a light and refreshing pasta salad.\n2. **Roasted vegetables**: Roasted vegetables like broccoli, zucchini, bell peppers, or eggplant add a nice contrast in texture and flavor to the crispy, cheesy chicken. Simply toss the veggies with olive oil, salt, and your choice of herbs, and roast in the oven until tender.\n3. **Garlic bread**: A must-have for any Italian-inspired meal! You can make it from scratch or use store-bought bread and add some garlic butter for an easy win.\n4. **Green salad**: A simple mixed green salad with a light vinaigrette helps cut the richness of the chicken parmesan. Add some cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese for extra flavor.\n5. **Sauteed spinach**: Quickly cooking a handful of spinach with garlic and lemon juice can provide a nutritious and flavorful side dish that complements the chicken nicely.\n6. **Caprese salad**: A colorful and easy-to-make salad featuring fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil, dressed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\n7. **Grilled or roasted potatoes**: Thinly sliced potatoes, grilled or roasted in the oven with some olive oil and herbs, make a satisfying side dish that pairs well with the chicken.\n8. **Italian-style rice**: Cook up a pot of flavorful rice with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs like basil and oregano.\n\nChoose one or two of these options to serve alongside your chicken parmesan, and you'll have a well-rounded and delicious family dinner!\n\nDo any of these options stand out to you, or would you like more suggestions?",
