  "content": "Rome is a sprawling city, and while the historic center is relatively compact, the churches I mentioned are spread out across different areas. However, many of them are located in or near the city's historic center, making it a great area to stay.\n\nHere are some neighborhoods and areas that would be convenient for visiting the churches:\n\n1. **Vatican City and Prati**: Staying in or near Vatican City (which is an independent city-state within Rome) or the adjacent Prati neighborhood will put you close to St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums.\n2. **Centro Storico (Historic Center)**: This area includes the heart of Rome, with many famous landmarks like the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and Spanish Steps. You'll be within walking distance to Santa Maria Maggiore, San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, and Sant'Agnese in Agone.\n3. **Trastevere**: This charming neighborhood on the west bank of the Tiber River is home to Santa Maria in Trastevere and has a more laid-back, bohemian vibe.\n4. **Monti**: This historic neighborhood is located near the Roman Forum and is within walking distance to St. John Lateran Archbasilica.\n\nWhen choosing your accommodations, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Distance to the Vatican**: If you're interested in visiting the Vatican frequently, stay in Vatican City or Prati for easy access.\n* **Walking distance**: If you prefer to explore on foot, stay in the Centro Storico or Monti, which offer easy access to many churches and landmarks.\n* **Atmosphere**: Trastevere is a great choice if you want a more relaxed, neighborhood feel.\n\nKeep in mind that Rome has an excellent public transportation system, including buses, trams, and metro lines. You can easily reach most areas of the city with a short ride or walk.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some approximate walking distances between the churches:\n\n* St. Peter's Basilica to Santa Maria Maggiore: 20-25 minutes\n* Santa Maria Maggiore to San Giovanni dei Fiorentini: 10-15 minutes\n* San Giovanni dei Fiorentini to Sant'Agnese in Agone: 10-15 minutes\n* Trastevere to St. Peter's Basilica: 30-40 minutes (or a short bus ride)\n\nBook your accommodations according to your preferences, and don't hesitate to ask if you need more specific recommendations or have any other questions!",
