  "content": "Yes, Norway has continued to be a strong force in winter sports since the 1952 Winter Olympics. They have consistently placed near the top of the medal table in subsequent Olympic Games, particularly in events such as cross-country skiing and biathlon.\n\nOverall, Norway has won the most medals of any country in the history of the Winter Olympics, with a total of 368 medals as of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. They have also won the most gold medals, with 132 to their name.\n\nSo, it's fair to say that Norway's success at the 1952 Winter Olympics was just the beginning of a storied tradition of excellence in winter sports.",
