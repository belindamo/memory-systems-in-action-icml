You know your customers and market best, so don't be afraid to combine Rachel's insights with your own knowledge to create a well-rounded approach.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance as you work on your segment prioritization, feel free to reach out. I'm here to help. Good luck, and I hope you see positive results from your targeted marketing efforts!",
