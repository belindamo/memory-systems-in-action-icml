I'm happy to suggest some roasted vegetable combinations that would pair perfectly with cumin-spiced quinoa:\n\n**Option 1: Sweet Potato, Carrot, and Brussels Sprouts**\n\n* Sweet potatoes and carrots will caramelize beautifully with the cumin, while Brussels sprouts will add a nice crunch and bitterness to balance out the sweetness.\n\n**Option 2: Cauliflower, Red Onion, and Bell Peppers**\n\n* Cauliflower will absorb the cumin flavor nicely, while the red onion will add a sweet and savory element. Bell peppers will add a pop of color and a bit of sweetness.\n\n**Option 3: Broccoli, Butternut Squash, and Red Lentils**\n\n* Broccoli will roast nicely with the cumin, while butternut squash will add a comforting, sweet element. Red lentils will provide protein and fiber to make this bowl more filling.\n\n**Option 4: Eggplant, Zucchini, and Cherry Tomatoes**\n\n* Eggplant and zucchini will roast beautifully with the cumin, while cherry tomatoes will burst with juicy sweetness. This combination is perfect for a summer-inspired bowl.\n\n**Option 5: Parsnip, Beet, and Kale**\n\n* Parsnips and beets will add an earthy sweetness, while kale will provide a nice contrast in texture. This combination is perfect for a hearty, winter-inspired bowl.\n\nFeel free to mix and match these vegetables to create your own unique combinations! When roasting, be sure to toss the vegetables with olive oil, salt, and cumin (and any other desired spices) before roasting in the oven until tender and caramelized.\n\nTo take your quinoa bowls to the next level, consider adding some of the following toppings:\n\n* Chopped fresh herbs like parsley, cilantro, or dill\n* A dollop of tzatziki sauce or Greek yogurt\n* Sliced avocado or chopped nuts for added creaminess and crunch\n* A sprinkle of sumac or paprika for extra flavor\n* A squeeze of fresh lemon juice for brightness\n\nEnjoy your delicious and nutritious cumin-spiced quinoa bowls!",
