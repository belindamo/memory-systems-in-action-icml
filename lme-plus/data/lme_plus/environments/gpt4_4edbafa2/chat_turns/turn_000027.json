  "content": "Yoga is an excellent addition to your running routine! As a runner, you'll benefit from yoga's ability to improve flexibility, strength, balance, and overall running efficiency. Here are some yoga poses that can help with common running injuries and improve your performance:\n\n**Injury Prevention:**\n\n1. **Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)**: Stretches calves, hamstrings, and glutes, reducing the risk of shin splints and IT band issues.\n2. **Pigeon Pose (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana)**: Targets the piriformis muscle, which can contribute to IT band syndrome and sciatica.\n3. **Tree Pose (Vrksasana)**: Improves balance and stability, reducing the risk of ankle sprains and knee injuries.\n4. **Seated Forward Fold (Paschimottanasana)**: Stretches the entire back side of the body, from the calves to the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back.\n\n**Improved Performance:**\n\n1. **Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II)**: Strengthens the legs, hips, and core, improving running stability and efficiency.\n2. **Plank Pose (Phalakasana)**: Engages the core, shoulders, and arms, enhancing overall running posture and reducing the risk of shoulder and upper back strain.\n3. **Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)**: Strengthens the back muscles, improving running posture and reducing the risk of lower back strain.\n4. **Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana)**: Strengthens the glutes and hamstrings, improving running power and efficiency.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Focus on hip opening**: Many running injuries stem from tight hips and glutes. Incorporate poses like Pigeon, Downward-Facing Dog, and Tree Pose to improve hip mobility and strength.\n2. **Engage your core**: A strong core will help improve your running posture, reduce the risk of injuries, and enhance overall performance. Incorporate poses like Plank, Boat Pose (Paripurna Navasana), and Side Plank (Vasisthasana).\n3. **Incorporate dynamic movements**: Add dynamic movements like Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) or Vinyasa flows to your yoga practice to mimic the movement patterns of running and improve your overall running efficiency.\n4. **Listen to your body**: Honor your body's limitations and take regular breaks. If you're new to yoga, start with gentle flows and gradually increase intensity and duration as you become more comfortable.\n\nRemember to practice yoga regularly, ideally 2-3 times a week, to see consistent improvements in your running performance and injury prevention. Happy running and namaste!",
