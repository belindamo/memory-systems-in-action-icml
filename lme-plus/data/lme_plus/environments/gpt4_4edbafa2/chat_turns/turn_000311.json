  "content": "At the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, a surprising success story was the performance of the Netherlands in speed skating. Although the Netherlands has a strong tradition in speed skating, they had not performed particularly well in recent Winter Olympics prior to 2018.\n\nHowever, at the 2018 Games, the Dutch speed skating team won a total of 16 medals, including 8 golds, 6 silvers, and 2 bronzes. This was by far the most successful performance by any nation in a single sport at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe Netherlands' success was particularly notable because they achieved it with a relatively small team. The Dutch sent just 34 athletes to the Winter Olympics, but their performances in speed skating propelled them to fifth place in the overall medal table. \n\nSo, the Netherlands was a surprising nation in the sense that they punched above their weight and exceeded expectations in Pyeongchang by putting in an incredibly dominant performance in speed skating.",
