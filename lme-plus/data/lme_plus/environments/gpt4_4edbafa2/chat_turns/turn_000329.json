  "content": "Tofu scramble is a vegan breakfast staple, and it's incredibly versatile. Here's a basic recipe to get you started:\n\n**Tofu Scramble Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 block of extra-firm tofu, drained and crumbled\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* 1 small onion, diced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 bell pepper (any color), diced\n* 2 mushrooms, sliced\n* 1 teaspoon turmeric\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Optional: nutritional yeast, chili flakes, or other spices of your choice\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Choose the right tofu:** For a scramble, you want to use extra-firm tofu, which has a denser texture that will hold up to crumbling and cooking. You can also use firm tofu, but it might be a bit softer.\n2. **Crumble the tofu:** Drain and press the tofu to remove excess liquid. Crumbling it into small curds will help it cook more evenly and give it a scrambled egg-like texture.\n3. **Saut\u00e9 the aromatics:** Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion, minced garlic, bell pepper, and mushrooms. Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.\n4. **Add the tofu:** Add the crumbled tofu to the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes, breaking it up with a spatula as it cooks.\n5. **Add spices and seasonings:** Add the turmeric, paprika, salt, and pepper to the tofu mixture. Stir well to combine. If you want to add extra flavor, now's the time to add nutritional yeast (for a cheesy flavor), chili flakes (for a spicy kick), or other spices of your choice.\n6. **Scramble and cook:** Continue cooking the tofu mixture for another 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until it's lightly browned and scrambled. You can use a spatula to break up any large curds.\n7. **Serve:** Serve the tofu scramble hot, garnished with chopped fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro, if desired.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Use different spices:** Experiment with different spice blends, like Italian seasoning, curry powder, or smoked paprika, to give your scramble a unique flavor.\n* **Add some heat:** If you like a little heat, add diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers to the skillet with the aromatics.\n* **Get creative with veggies:** Add your favorite vegetables to the skillet, like diced zucchini, chopped broccoli, or sliced carrots.\n* **Make it a breakfast burrito:** Wrap the tofu scramble in a whole-grain tortilla with your favorite fillings, like saut\u00e9ed spinach, salsa, and avocado.\n* **Make it a breakfast bowl:** Serve the tofu scramble over a bed of greens, with roasted vegetables, and a dollop of hummus or guacamole.\n\nI hope this helps you create a delicious tofu scramble!",
