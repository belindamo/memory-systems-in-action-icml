In SEO, I have honed my skills in data-driven decision-making and have experience optimizing website elements for both search engine visibility and user experience.\n\nAs a Personalized Ads Evaluator, I understand the importance of ensuring that ads are relevant, useful, and non-intrusive for users. With my experience in QA testing, I can effectively evaluate the quality of ads and ensure that they meet the desired standards. Moreover, my experience in technical SEO gives me a unique understanding of how ads can impact user experience on a website.\n\nI'm also confident in my ability to work independently and as part of a team.
