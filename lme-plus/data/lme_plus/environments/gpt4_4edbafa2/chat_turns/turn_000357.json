You're already on the right track with the \"clean as you go\" approach, and adding the \"5-Minute Rule\" will help you stay consistent and ensure that your kitchen stays tidy.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a habit that becomes second nature, so don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Just get back on track as soon as you can, and celebrate your small wins along the way.\n\nTo make the \"5-Minute Rule\" even more effective, consider setting a reminder on your phone or placing a timer in a visible spot in your kitchen. This will help you stay accountable and make the task feel less daunting.\n\nAs you continue to work on your kitchen cleaning habits, keep in mind that it's all about progress, not perfection. Every small step you take towards maintaining a cleaner kitchen will make a significant difference in the long run.\n\nHow do you plan to incorporate the \"5-Minute Rule\" into your daily routine? Will you set a reminder, use a traditional timer, or find another way to stay on track?",
