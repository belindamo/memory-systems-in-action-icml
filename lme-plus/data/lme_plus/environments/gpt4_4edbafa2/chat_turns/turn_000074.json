Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Gather your materials**: Collect photos from the recent family gatherings, including the one at your aunt's house. You'll also need a photo album or scrapbook, adhesive (e.g., glue stick, tape runner, or spray adhesive), scissors, and any other embellishments you like (e.g., stickers, washi tape, journaling cards).\n2. **Choose a theme or style**: Decide on a theme or style for your album. This could be a chronological approach, a seasonal theme, or a specific color scheme. Having a clear direction will help you stay focused as you work on your project.\n3. **Organize your photos**: Sort your photos into categories or events. This will help you create a cohesive story within your album. You can organize by date, event, or even by person.\n4. **Design your pages**: Start creating your pages by arranging your photos and embellishments. Leave space for journaling or captions to add context and stories to your photos.\n5. **Journal and caption**: Write down the stories and memories associated with each photo. This will help bring the moments to life and make the album more personal.\n6. **Keep it simple**: Don't feel overwhelmed by the need to add too many embellishments. Simple designs can be just as beautiful and effective.\n7. **Make it a family effort**: Consider involving your family members in the process. Ask them to contribute their favorite photos, write captions, or even create their own pages.\n\nRemember, the most important aspect of creating a photo album or scrapbook is to have fun and enjoy the process of preserving your family's memories.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about getting started or design ideas?
