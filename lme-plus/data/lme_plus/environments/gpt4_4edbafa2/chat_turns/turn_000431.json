  "content": "I'd be happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal viewing history. But I can ask you some questions to get a sense of your taste in movies and provide recommendations based on that.\n\nPlease tell me:\n\n1. What genre(s) are you in the mood for? (e.g., action, comedy, romance, horror, etc.)\n2. Do you prefer classic films (pre-1980s), 80s-90s, or more recent releases (2000s-present)?\n3. Are you open to watching foreign films with subtitles, or do you prefer movies in English?\n4. Is there a particular actor or actress you enjoy watching?\n5. Do you have a specific theme or setting in mind (e.g., sci-fi, historical, fantasy, etc.)?\n6. How much time do you have available to commit to a movie? Are you looking for a quick 90-minute film or are you open to a longer, more epic movie?\n\nFeel free to answer any or all of these questions, and I'll do my best to suggest some movies that might interest you!",
