  "content": "Nutritional yeast is a fantastic addition to the scramble, and it's a popular vegan \"cheese\" ingredient for a reason. Here's how to use it:\n\n**What is nutritional yeast?**\nNutritional yeast is a type of yeast that's naturally rich in protein, fiber, and B vitamins. It has a nutty, slightly cheesy flavor and is often used to give vegan dishes a cheesy, umami taste.\n\n**How to use nutritional yeast in the scramble:**\n\n1. **Start with a small amount:** Begin with a small amount, about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of nutritional yeast per serving. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess.\n2. **Add it during cooking:** Add the nutritional yeast to the scramble when you're cooking the tofu mixture. This allows the flavors to meld together and the yeast to distribute evenly.\n3. **Mix well:** Make sure to stir the nutritional yeast into the scramble mixture thoroughly, so it's evenly distributed.\n4. **Taste and adjust:** As you cook, taste the scramble and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, or other spices to taste.\n\n**Some tips to keep in mind:**\n\n* **Use a high-quality nutritional yeast:** Look for a brand that's fresh and has a rich, nutty aroma.\n* **Store it properly:** Keep nutritional yeast in an airtight container in the fridge or freezer to preserve its flavor and nutritional properties.\n* **Don't overdo it:** While nutritional yeast is a great addition, too much can make the scramble taste bitter or overpowering. Start with a small amount and adjust to taste.\n* **Combine with other ingredients:** Nutritional yeast pairs well with other ingredients like garlic, onion, and paprika. Experiment with different combinations to find your favorite flavor.\n\n**Some popular brands:**\n\n* Bragg Nutritional Yeast\n* Bob's Red Mill Nutritional Yeast\n* Anthony's Nutritional Yeast\n\nRemember, the key to using nutritional yeast is to taste as you go and adjust the seasoning to your liking. Start with a small amount and add more to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess.\n\nI hope this helps you create a delicious, cheesy scramble with nutritional yeast!",
