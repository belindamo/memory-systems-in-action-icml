  "content": "Yes, it is possible that ammonites were at the mercy of the water currents and had little to no control over their buoyancy. This is a valid alternative theory that has been proposed by some researchers.\n\nHowever, anatomical evidence suggests that ammonites did have some control over the gas in their shells. For example, the position of the siphuncle, which connects the chambers of the shell and controls the amount of gas in each, varies significantly between different species of ammonites. This suggests that some species were better adapted to regulating their buoyancy than others.\n\nAdditionally, some studies have shown that seawater temperatures and salinity levels could impact the buoyancy of ammonites, further suggesting that these creatures were capable of regulating their buoyancy to some extent. \n\nWhile it is true that there is still much we don't know about ammonites and their behavior, current evidence suggests that these creatures were likely capable of regulating the gas in their shells to some extent, which would have allowed them to control their buoyancy and move through the water more efficiently.",
