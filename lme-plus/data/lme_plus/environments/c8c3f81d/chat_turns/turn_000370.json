  "content": "The scene opens with Andy sitting in a disabled toilet, making suspicious noises. He has been in there for hours, despite there being no obvious disability. Suddenly, the door bursts open and John storms in.\n\nJohn: \"Andy, what the hell are you doing in here? You've been in here for hours!\"\n\nAndy: (nervously) \"Uh, I was just, uh, practicing my presentation for the school talent show. You know, to make sure it's perfect.\"\n\nJohn: (skeptical) \"In the disabled toilet? And making those noises? That doesn't sound right, Andy.\"\n\nAndy: (defensively) \"I was just trying to add some extra drama to my presentation, okay? Don't judge me!\"\n\nJohn: (sighing) \"Andy, you can't just use the disabled toilet for your own personal gain. It's not right. And those noises you were making were disturbing.\"\n\nAndy: (sheepishly) \"Sorry, John. I didn't mean to cause any trouble.\"\n\nJohn: (frustrated) \"Just get out of here and try to be more considerate in the future.\"\n\nThe scene ends with Andy quickly gathering his things and rushing out of the disabled toilet, embarrassed.",
