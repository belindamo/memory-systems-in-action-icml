But I can suggest a few options to help you get the weather forecast for your state park:\n\n1. Check the park's website: Many state parks have their own websites that provide weather forecasts, trail conditions, and other important information for visitors.\n2. Use a weather app: You can download a weather app on your smartphone, such as Dark Sky or Weather Underground, which can provide you with current and forecasted weather conditions for your location.\n3. Check with a local news source: Look up the website or social media page of a local news station or newspaper that covers the area around your state park. They often provide weather forecasts and updates.\n4. Contact the park directly: You can try contacting the park's visitor center or ranger station directly to ask about the weather forecast and any other information you need to plan your hike.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check the National Weather Service (NWS) website, which provides weather forecasts, warnings, and conditions for locations all over the United States. You can enter the zip code or city and state of your park to get the latest forecast.\n\nRemember to always check the weather forecast before heading out on a hike and be prepared for changing conditions. Enjoy your hike!",
