  "content": "**Lures and Techniques for Smallmouth Bass and Walleye:**\n\nLake Michigan's smallmouth bass and walleye can be caught using a variety of lures and techniques. Here are some recommendations to complement your silver spinnerbait:\n\n**Smallmouth Bass:**\n\n1. **Soft Plastics:** Curly tail grubs (e.g., Gary Yamamoto's Senko) or soft jerkbaits (e.g., Zoom Super Fluke) on a jighead or weighted hook can be deadly for smallmouths.\n2. **Crankbaits:** Choose shallow-diving crankbaits (e.g., Rapala DT Series or Storm Arashi) in shad-imitating colors to target smallmouths in rocky areas.\n3. **Jigs:** A 1/8 to 1/4 oz. jig with a curly tail or swim bait trailer can be effective for smallmouths in structural areas.\n4. **Topwater:** Try using a popper or spoons (e.g., Rebel Pop-R or Acme Kastmaster) to target smallmouths in surface-oriented feeding frenzies.\n5. **Fly Fishing:** Streamers like a Woolly Bugger or a Leech Pattern can be effective for smallmouths, especially in areas with rocky structure.\n\n**Walleye:**\n\n1. **Jigs:** A 1/4 to 1/2 oz. jig with a curly tail or minnow-shaped trailer can be effective for walleyes in structural areas.\n2. **Crankbaits:** Choose deeper-diving crankbaits (e.g., Rapala Deep Tail Dancer or Storm Thunderstick) in shad-imitating colors to target walleyes in deeper waters.\n3. **Live Bait:** Live bait like minnows, leeches, or crawlers on a live bait rig or slip bobber can be effective for walleyes in areas with structure.\n4. **Spinners:** A slow-moving spinner like a Lindy Spinner or a crawler harness can be effective for walleyes in areas with weed growth or structure.\n5. **Bottom Bouncers:** Use a bottom bouncer with a live bait or soft plastic trailer to target walleyes in deeper waters.\n\n**Techniques:**\n\n1. **Structure-oriented fishing:** Focus on areas with rocky structure, weed beds, or drop-offs, as these tend to hold both smallmouth bass and walleye.\n2. **Slow and deliberate:** Use a slow, deliberate retrieve when fishing for smallmouth bass and walleye, as they often require a more subtle presentation.\n3. **Pay attention to water conditions:** Adjust your lure selection and presentation based on water temperature, clarity, and currents.\n4. **Vary your presentation:** Mix up your retrieve, pause, and movement to trigger strikes from both smallmouth bass and walleye.\n\nRemember to always check local fishing regulations and obtain any necessary permits before your trip. Good luck, and I hope you catch some nice fish on Lake Michigan!",
