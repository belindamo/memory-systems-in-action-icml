  "content": "Our guide, Rachel, did share some interesting stories about the artists and their works. One thing that stuck with me was when she talked about the artist's process and how some of the sculptures were created. It really helped me appreciate the amount of thought and effort that goes into creating these pieces.\n\nThe tour was focused on contemporary sculpture, and it covered a range of styles and materials. Rachel did a great job of highlighting the different techniques and themes used by the artists, and how they relate to the broader art world. It was a really engaging and informative tour!",
