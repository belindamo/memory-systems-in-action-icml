Here's a simple recipe to make 4 individual lava cakes:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 ounces high-quality dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa), broken into small pieces\n* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n* 1 cup granulated sugar\n* 4 large eggs\n* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n* 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preheat** your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n2. **Melt the chocolate**: In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring occasionally.\n3. **Whisk together**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Set aside.\n4. **Beat the butter and sugar**: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.\n5. **Add eggs one at a time**: Beat in each egg, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.\n6. **Combine flour mixture**: Gradually mix in the flour mixture, then the melted chocolate, until just combined.\n7. **Pour into ramekins**: Divide the batter evenly among 4 (6-ounce) ramekins or small cups.\n8. **Bake**: Place the ramekins on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are set, but the centers are still slightly jiggly.\n9. **Let cool**: Remove from the oven and let cool in the ramekins for 1 minute.\n10. **Invert and serve**: Run a knife around the edges of each cake to loosen, then invert onto plates. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use high-quality chocolate for the best flavor.\n* Don't overmix the batter, as this can lead to dense cakes.\n* Don't open the oven door during the baking time, or the cakes might collapse.\n* Serve immediately, as the lava cakes are best when warm and gooey.\n\nI hope your sister enjoys these rich, chocolatey treats!",
