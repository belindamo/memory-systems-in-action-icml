I'd be delighted to help you find a delicious dessert recipe for her special day.\n\n(And congratulations on scoring a beautiful Tiffany's necklace for your sister, by the way! That's sure to be a lovely gift. And the customized photo album from Shutterfly sounds like a thoughtful present for your mom's anniversary.)\n\nNow, let's get to dessert! What type of dessert is your sister fond of? Does she have a sweet tooth for classic treats like chocolate cake, cheesecake, or brownies? Or perhaps she prefers something fruity and refreshing, like a tart or a sorbet?\n\nHere are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Decadent Chocolate Lava Cake**: Rich, gooey chocolate cakes that are sure to impress.\n2. **Strawberry Shortcake**: Fresh strawberries, sweet biscuits, and whipped cream make for a light and lovely dessert.\n3. **Lemon Bars**: A tangy and sweet combination of lemon curd on a shortbread crust.\n4. **Raspberry Tiramisu**: Coffee-soaked ladyfingers layered with creamy mascarpone cheese and fresh raspberries.\n5. **Berry Sorbet**: A refreshing and fruity way to end the meal, with a mix of berries like raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries.\n\nLet me know if any of these options catch your eye (or taste buds)! Or feel free to give me more details about your sister's preferences, and I can suggest more tailored ideas.",
