I've been listening to a lot of musical theater soundtracks on my daily commute, including Hadestown and Dear Evan Hansen, and it's been really inspiring to hear the different ways that music can tell a story. Speaking of storytelling, I've also been reading a lot of interviews and articles about theater, particularly about the role of women in the industry and the challenges they face. It's really made me think about the importance of representation and diversity on stage and behind the scenes.",
