  "content": "Sure, here's the revised draft:\n\nI, Tan Chee Hui (NRIC No.:830518-14-6075), Director, Shareholder and CEO of Crave Asia Sdn Bhd (Company No.: 914475-H) (hereafter referred to as \"Crave Asia\"), make this police report against NG CHIAN WEN (NRIC No.: 861217-23-6415) with known addresses at 19, Jalan Sri Hartamas 4, Taman Sri Hartamas, 50480 Kuala Lumpur and at No. 172, Jalan Sutera, Taman Sentosa, 80150 Johor Bahru, Johor.\n\nI previously made two police reports against Ng Chian Wen. Report 1, made on 18 September 2019 at Damansara Utama Police Station, detailed his fraudulent and criminal activities, which include the following crimes:\n\n* Misappropriation of company funds belonging to Crave Asia Sdn Bhd\n* Forgery of company director, shareholder and CEO signatures\n* Breach of trust by abusing his positions in Crave Asia Sdn Bhd\n* The issuance of 20 cheques with forged signatures amounting to RM777,228.04 and an unauthorized transaction of RM25,030.60 from Crave Asia Sdn Bhd's Maybank bank account to Ng Chian Wen's personal bank account/personal usage and/or unknown payees/recipients.\n\nReport 2, made on 28 June 2020 at the same police station, revealed Ng Chian Wen's unauthorized purchase of an apartment using company funds. He also forged signatures in Sales & Purchases (S&P) related documents in order to pass through the purchases from his father in law.\n\nNew findings have since come to light, demonstrating the full extent of Ng Chian Wen's dishonesty and the harm caused to Crave Asia. These include the following:\n\n* After reviewing files with our Auditor, we discovered that Ng Chian Wen had hidden his fraudulent cheques by declaring them as project payments to a renovation company named BIG BRO DESIGN LANGKAWI PROJECT. However, he did not provide supporting receipts from the company. We attempted to contact BIG Bro DESIGN but were unable to do so as the company has closed and the person in charge is no longer contactable.\n* Ng Chian Wen hid this information from Crave Asia's management, accountant, auditor, and subsequently submitted falsified documents to LHDN. This resulted in LHDN imposing fines on the company and auditing the entire company. The total fines imposed by LHDN amounted to RM554,562.06.\n* As a result of the LHDN fines and blacklisting, Crave Asia suffered E-TRADE REFERENCE (ETR) degradation and was blacklisted from CTOS, which prevented the company from applying for loans, new applications, and even new phone lines from Maxis or Time Broadband.\n* Our main supplier of EPSON also stopped any credit facilities to the company, which forced us to pay 100% upfront before taking any equipment from them. This has caused significant issues for the company and future projects.\n* Our expansion plan to Singapore had to be cancelled, as the bank rejected our application due to Ng Chian Wen's fraudulent activities.\n\nCrimes committed by Ng Chian Wen in reports 1, 2, and 3 include:\n\n* Misappropriation of company funds\n* Forgery\n* Breach of trust\n* Unauthorized purchase of an apartment using company funds\n\nThese new findings demonstrate the severity of Ng Chian Wen's actions and the extent of the damages caused to Crave Asia. We request that legal action is taken against Ng Chian Wen to ensure that justice is served and to prevent",
