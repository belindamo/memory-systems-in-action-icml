Here are a few scenarios:\n\n1. **Rental place provides a lock:** Some bike rental shops may include a lock with the rental, so it's best to ask when you pick up the bike. They might have a specific lock that's compatible with their bikes or require you to use their lock for insurance purposes.\n2. **You need to bring your own lock:** If the rental place doesn't provide a lock, you'll need to bring your own. Make sure it's a sturdy lock that can secure your bike to a fixed object, such as a bike rack or a lamppost.\n3. **Rental place offers lock rentals:** Some bike rental shops might offer lock rentals as an additional service. This can be a convenient option if you don't have a lock or prefer not to carry one.\n\n**Other Essentials to Bring:**\n\n1. **Helmet:** Make sure you have a properly fitting helmet, as it's essential for safety.\n2. **Water and snacks:** Bring water and snacks to keep you energized throughout your ride.\n3. **Comfortable clothing:** Wear comfortable, breathable clothing and shoes suitable for cycling.\n4. **Sunscreen and sunglasses:** Protect yourself from the sun with sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat.\n5. **Basic tool kit:** Consider bringing a small tool kit with essentials like a pump, tire levers, and Allen wrenches in case you need to make basic adjustments.\n\n**Before You Go:**\n\n1. **Check the rental shop's policies:** Confirm the rental shop's policies on locks, helmets, and other equipment.\n2. **Inspect the bike:** Before you leave the rental shop, inspect the bike to ensure it's in good condition and adjust the seat and handlebars to fit you comfortably.\n3. **Plan your route:** Familiarize yourself with the riverfront trail, including any rules, regulations, or potential hazards.\n\nHave a great time on your ride!",
