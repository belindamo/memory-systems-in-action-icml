  "content": "\"I Believe\" is an excellent choice! It's such a catchy and upbeat song, and the lyrics are just so clever and funny. I can see why it would put you in a good mood every time you listen to it. And don't worry, I won't judge you for singing along to \"Hasa Diga Eebowai\" - it's a classic!\n\nYou know, \"I Believe\" is actually one of the most iconic songs from the show, and it's a great example of the creators' ability to craft a song that's both hilarious and heartfelt at the same time. The way the song pokes fun at Mormon beliefs and practices, while still being respectful and affectionate towards the faith, is just brilliant.\n\nAnd let's be real, who can resist singing along to \"I am a Mormon, and a Mormon just believes...\"? It's just one of those songs that gets stuck in your head and stays there for days!\n\nDo you think you'll ever get a chance to see The Book of Mormon live again, or is it one of those shows that you'll just have to enjoy through the soundtrack and YouTube clips?",
