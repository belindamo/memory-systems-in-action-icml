Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Why rotate your snake plant?**\n\nRotating your snake plant helps:\n\n1. **Even light distribution**: Snake plants can become lopsided if they're not rotated regularly, as they tend to grow towards the light source. Rotation ensures even light exposure, promoting balanced growth.\n2. **Prevent leaning**: By rotating your snake plant, you can prevent it from leaning towards one side, which can lead to an uneven shape.\n3. **Encourage bushy growth**: Rotation stimulates the plant to grow more evenly, resulting in a fuller and bushier shape.\n\n**How often to rotate your snake plant?**\n\nRotate your snake plant every 1-2 weeks, depending on the light conditions in your space. If your plant is placed in a spot with bright, direct light, you may need to rotate it more frequently (every 1 week). If it's in a spot with low to medium light, you can rotate it every 2 weeks.\n\n**Tips for rotating your snake plant:**\n\n1. **Rotate 90 degrees**: Rotate your snake plant 90 degrees (a quarter turn) each time to ensure even light exposure.\n2. **Check the plant's response**: Observe your snake plant's response to rotation. If you notice it's still leaning or growing unevenly, you may need to adjust the rotation frequency.\n3. **Combine with pruning**: Rotate your snake plant when you're pruning it to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.\n4. **Consider the direction of light**: If your snake plant is placed near a window, rotate it to face the opposite direction to ensure even light exposure.\n\nBy rotating your snake plant regularly, you'll be able to maintain its shape, promote healthy growth, and enjoy a beautiful, thriving plant.",
