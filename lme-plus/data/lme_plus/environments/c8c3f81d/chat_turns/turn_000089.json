  "content": "1. Hazard Identification Study (HIS): This method involves identifying all potential hazards in a construction project and assessing their likelihood and consequences. The HIS aims to raise awareness about hazards and identify strategies to prevent and mitigate their impacts.\n\n2. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA): FMEA is a structured approach to identifying and evaluating potential failure modes within a system. This method involves analyzing the causes and effects of each failure mode to develop risk control measures.\n\n3. Bowtie Analysis: This method is a visual representation of hazards, their causes, and potential consequences. It allows risk assessors to identify the potential causes and consequences of a hazard, and to develop strategies to prevent and mitigate the risks.\n\n4. Risk Matrix: A risk matrix involves scoring the likelihood and consequence of a risk to develop a risk score. This method allows risk assessors to prioritize the risks in a construction project and to determine the most appropriate risk control measures.\n\n5. Scenario Analysis: This method involves developing scenarios that illustrate potential hazards and their impacts. This approach allows risk assessors to understand the sequence of events leading up to a hazard and to develop strategies to prevent and mitigate the risks.",
