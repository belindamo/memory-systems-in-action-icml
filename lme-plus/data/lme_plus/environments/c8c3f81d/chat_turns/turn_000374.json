  "content": "The scene opens with Ruth sitting in her classroom, staring at a photo of a beautiful German landscape. She is lost in thought, trying to come to terms with her feelings for women. Suddenly, Andy bursts into the room, trying to impress her with another elaborate story.\n\nAndy: \"Hey, Ruth. You won't believe what happened to me at the bar last night. I met this amazing girl, and we hit it off right away. We were laughing and joking and having the best time. And then she leaned in and whispered in my ear, 'I think you're really cute.' And I was like, 'oh my god, she likes me!' It was awesome.\"\n\nRuth: (sighing) \"Andy, I'm glad you're having fun, but I'm not really in the mood for your stories right now.\"\n\nAndy: (confused) \"Oh, I'm sorry. Is everything okay, Ruth?\"\n\nRuth: (hesitantly) \"Well, I've been thinking a lot lately. About myself, and my feelings. And I've realized that I'm attracted to women.\"\n\nAndy: (surprised) \"Oh, wow. That's, uh, that's big news, Ruth. Are you okay?\"\n\nRuth: (nodding) \"I think so. It's been a lot to process, but I'm trying to be honest with myself and accept who I am.\"\n\nAndy: (smiling) \"That's great, Ruth. I'm here for you if you need to talk. And I'll try to be more respectful of your boundaries in the future.\"\n\nThe scene ends with Ruth smiling at Andy, appreciative of his support.",
