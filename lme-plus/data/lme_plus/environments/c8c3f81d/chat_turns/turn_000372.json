  "content": "The scene opens with Ruth sitting at her desk in her classroom, looking lost in thought. Suddenly, Andy bursts into the room, trying to impress her with one of his elaborate stories.\n\nAndy: \"Hey, Ruth. You won't believe what happened to me last night. I was out at the bar, and this guy starts hitting on me. And I'm like, 'sorry, buddy. I'm not interested.' And then he starts talking about how he's an expert in German culture and language. And I'm like, 'oh, you and Ruth should totally hit it off!' It was hilarious.\"\n\nRuth: (sighing) \"Andy, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not interested in dating anyone right now. And I would prefer if you didn't try to set me up with someone based on my love of the German language.\"\n\nAndy: (confused) \"Oh, I didn't realize. I'm sorry, Ruth. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\n\nRuth: (softening) \"It's okay, Andy. I know you were just trying to be friendly. But please just respect my boundaries and let me decide who I want to date.\"\n\nAndy: (nodding) \"Of course, Ruth. I'm sorry. I'll try to be more considerate in the future.\"\n\nThe scene ends with Ruth smiling at Andy, appreciative of his apology.",
