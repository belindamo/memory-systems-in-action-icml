This approach can help prevent burnout and allow each person to recharge in their own way.\n\n**Pros of splitting up:**\n\n1. **Personalized exploration**: Each person can pursue their own interests, whether it's visiting a specific museum, taking a cooking class, or simply relaxing in a park.\n2. **Reduced conflict**: With different interests and energy levels, splitting up can minimize conflicts and ensure everyone has a good time.\n3. **New experiences**: You might discover new hidden gems or meet fellow travelers with similar interests, just like you did in Bali.\n4. **Recharge and refresh**: A break from the group can help everyone recharge and come back together feeling more energized and refreshed.\n\n**Tips for splitting up:**\n\n1. **Set a meeting point and time**: Designate a specific location and time to meet up again, ensuring everyone knows where to find each other.\n2. **Establish a communication plan**: Make sure everyone has a working phone and a way to stay in touch, such as a WhatsApp group or a shared Google doc.\n3. **Plan ahead**: Discuss and agree on the splitting-up plan in advance, including the activities each person wants to do and the meeting point.\n4. **Respect boundaries**: Remember that some family members might not be comfortable splitting up, so be respectful of their wishes and prioritize their needs.\n5. **Stay flexible**: Be prepared for changes in plans or unexpected events.
