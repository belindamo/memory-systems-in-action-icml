  "content": "There are several other endangered or threatened species being worked on in the Aleutian Islands. One of them is the sea otter, which has been a focus of conservation efforts since the 1980s. The Aleutian Islands population of sea otters was largely wiped out due to hunting and oil spills, but efforts by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, along with other organizations, have helped the population rebound. The western population of Steller's eiders, a diving duck, is also endangered and is actively being managed through a conservation plan that includes monitoring, research, and habitat restoration. The Aleutian Islands are also home to several species of whales, including the endangered western stock of gray whales, and ongoing efforts are aimed at studying and protecting these amazing creatures.",
