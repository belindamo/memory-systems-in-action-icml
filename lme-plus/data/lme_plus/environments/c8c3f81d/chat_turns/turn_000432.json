It's made by drying fresh fenugreek leaves, which are a type of herb commonly used in Indian cooking. The dried leaves have a distinctive, slightly bitter, earthy flavor and aroma.\n\n**Flavor Profile:**\n\nKasoori methi has a unique, slightly bitter, and nutty flavor, which is often described as:\n\n* Earthy and herbaceous, similar to thyme or oregano\n* Slightly bitter, like dark chocolate or coffee\n* Nutty, with hints of maple syrup or caramel\n\n**How to Use Kasoori Methi in Palak Paneer:**\n\nYou can incorporate kasoori methi into the Palak Paneer recipe in a few ways:\n\n1. **Add it to the paneer sauce:** Sprinkle 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of kasoori methi powder (or 1-2 tablespoons of dried kasoori methi leaves) into the paneer sauce while it's simmering. This will infuse the sauce with the earthy, slightly bitter flavor of kasoori methi.\n2. **Use it in the palak puree:** Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of kasoori methi powder (or 1-2 tablespoons of dried kasoori methi leaves) to the spinach puree while blending. This will give the palak puree a deeper, more complex flavor.\n3. **Add it as a garnish:** Sprinkle a pinch of kasoori methi powder or a few dried leaves on top of the Palak Paneer as a garnish. This will add a burst of flavor and aroma to each bite.\n\n**Tips for Working with Kasoori Methi:**\n\n* Start with a small amount (1/2 teaspoon or 1 tablespoon) and adjust to taste, as kasoori methi can be quite potent.\n* Use high-quality, fresh kasoori methi for the best flavor.\n* Store kasoori methi in an airtight container to preserve its flavor and aroma.\n* You can also use kasoori methi in other Indian dishes, like curries, dahls, or even as a rub for meats or vegetables.\n\nI hope this helps you incorporate kasoori methi into your Palak Paneer recipe!",
