A decorative plate is a great way to present the gift, and arranging the lava cakes, gift card, and necklace on it will create a beautiful and visually appealing display. It'll definitely make the gift feel more special and thoughtful.\n\nRemember, it's the little details that count, and taking the time to present the gift nicely shows that you care about your sister's feelings and want to make her feel special. I'm sure she'll appreciate the effort you've put into creating a lovely gift.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need any more help, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you and your sister have a wonderful time celebrating her birthday, and I'm sure she'll love the gift!",
