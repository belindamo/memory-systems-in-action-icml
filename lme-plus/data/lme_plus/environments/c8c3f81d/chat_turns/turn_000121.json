  "content": "Sure! You can serve any type of crusty bread that you like with the spaghetti pomodoro. Here's a recipe for a homemade garlic bread that would go really well with this dish:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 loaf crusty Italian bread\n- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\n\n2. Cut the bread into slices, but don't cut all the way through the bottom, so the bread remains intact.\n\n3. In a small bowl, mix together melted butter, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper.\n\n4. Brush the garlic butter mixture onto the bread, making sure to get between the slices.\n\n5. Wrap the bread in foil and place it on a baking sheet.\n\n6. Bake the bread for 15-20 minutes or until the bread is heated through and the butter has melted.\n\n7. Remove from the oven, unwrap the bread, and serve it warm alongside the spaghetti.\n\nEnjoy your spaghetti pomodoro with homemade garlic bread!",
