  "content": "CDP's climate disclosure framework is a voluntary reporting framework that focuses specifically on climate-related risks and opportunities. It is not listed in the table above as it is not a framework developed or mandated by a regulatory body. However, CDP's framework can be used in conjunction with other reporting frameworks, such as GRI, SASB, TCFD, and IR, to provide more comprehensive reporting on an organization's climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities.\n\nCDP's climate disclosure framework is also aligned with the TCFD recommendations and can help organizations provide more detailed and standardized information on their climate risks and opportunities, which can be useful for investors, stakeholders, and decision-makers. In this sense, CDP's framework can be seen as complementary to the frameworks listed in the table above, as it provides a more focused approach to climate-related reporting.",
