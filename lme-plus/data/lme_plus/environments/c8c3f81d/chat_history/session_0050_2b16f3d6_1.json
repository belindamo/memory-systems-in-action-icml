      "content": "Many tailors can create a custom-made dress shirt from scratch, but it depends on their expertise and services offered. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Custom-made shirts from scratch**\n\n1. **Some tailors specialize in bespoke shirts**: These tailors have the skills and experience to create a custom-made shirt from scratch, using your measurements, fabric of choice, and style preferences.\n2. **They may have a pattern-making process**: They'll take your measurements, create a custom pattern, and then cut and sew the fabric to create a unique shirt tailored to your fit and style.\n3. **Higher-end tailors may offer bespoke services**: Luxury tailors or high-end menswear stores might offer bespoke shirt-making services, which can include multiple fittings and a more extensive consultation process.\n\n**Tailors who alter existing shirts**\n\n1. **Many tailors focus on alterations and repairs**: They might not offer bespoke shirt-making services, but they can still alter an existing shirt to fit you better or make minor changes to the design.\n2. **They might work with existing patterns or templates**: They'll use a standard pattern or template to alter an existing shirt, rather than creating a custom pattern from scratch.\n\n**How to find a tailor who can make a custom shirt from scratch**\n\n1. **Look for bespoke tailors or custom shirt-makers**: Search online for \"bespoke tailors\" or \"custom shirt-makers\" in your area.\n2. **Check their website or social media**: See if they showcase their bespoke shirt-making services, and if they have a portfolio of custom shirts they've created.\n3. **Ask about their process**: When you contact a tailor, ask about their custom shirt-making process, including how they take measurements, create patterns, and work with fabrics.\n4. **Check reviews and ask for referrals**: Research online reviews and ask for referrals from friends or colleagues who have had a good experience with a bespoke tailor.\n\nKeep in mind that bespoke shirt-making can be a more expensive and time-consuming process compared to altering an existing shirt. Be prepared to invest time and budget in creating a custom-made shirt that fits you perfectly.\n\nIf you're interested in a custom-made shirt, I recommend reaching out to a few tailors in your area to discuss your options and get a sense of their expertise and pricing."
