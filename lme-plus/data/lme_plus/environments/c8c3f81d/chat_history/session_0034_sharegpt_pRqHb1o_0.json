      "content": "It's difficult to say with certainty how ancient Egyptians walked, as we don't have direct evidence of their gait or walking style. However, it's possible that the way ancient Egyptians walked may have been different from the way more modern Egyptians walked, such as during the time of Cleopatra.\n\nOver time, cultural influences, lifestyle changes, and other factors can lead to changes in the way people move and walk. Additionally, the way people walk can be influenced by factors such as footwear, clothing, and social status, among other things.\n\nFor example, ancient Egyptian footwear often consisted of sandals or bare feet, which may have influenced the way people walked. In contrast, more modern Egyptians may wear different types of shoes that could affect their gait.\n\nIt's also important to note that ancient Egyptian culture spanned thousands of years and underwent many changes over that time. It's possible that the way people walked may have also changed over that time period.\n\nOverall, while we cannot say for certain how ancient Egyptians walked, it's possible that their gait may have been different from the way more modern Egyptians walked, such as during the time of Cleopatra."
