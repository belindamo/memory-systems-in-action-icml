What are some suggestions for what we could add to this next?\n\n# Overview\n\n\\_A sandbox to test units against each other\\_\n\nThis scene is for testing the design of RTS units. Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts, sensors, and behaviours. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).\n\n# File descriptions\n\n## Behaviours\n\n### SeekAndDestroy.cs\n\nThis behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.\n\n## Parts\n\\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.\n\\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.\n\\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.\n\n## Sensors\n\\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.\n\n## Designs\n\\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.\n\\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.\n\n## Other files\n\\* UnitManager.cs\n\\* Unit.cs\n\\* HealthBar.cs"

      "content": "Here are some suggestions for what you could add to this Unity feature:\n\n1. Additional Behaviors:\n\t* DefendArea.cs: A behavior that makes the unit defend a specific area, engaging enemies that come too close.\n\t* RepairAndSupport.cs: A behavior that enables the unit to repair or support friendly units within a defined radius.\n\t* Flee.cs: A behavior that makes the unit retreat if its health falls below a certain threshold.\n2. New Parts:\n\t* Shield.cs: A component that provides a regenerating energy shield to the unit, which can absorb a certain amount of damage before the armor or hit points are affected.\n\t* StealthSystem.cs: A part that allows the unit to become invisible or difficult to detect by enemy sensors.\n\t* ArtilleryWeapon.cs: A long-range weapon component with customizable attributes, such as projectile type, range, and splash damage.\n3. Improved Sensors:\n\t* Radar.cs: A component that extends the unit's detection range and allows it to detect enemies beyond its vision cone.\n\t* ProximitySensor.cs: A component that alerts the unit if an enemy is within a certain distance, even if the enemy is not within the vision cone.\n\t* TerrainScanner.cs: A sensor that provides the unit with information about the terrain, such as elevation or obstacles, to improve pathfinding.\n4. Advanced Designs:\n\t* Scout: A fast-moving unit with enhanced sensors for reconnaissance and intel gathering.\n\t* Engineer: A support unit that can repair, build, or upgrade other units and structures.\n\t* HeavyAssault: A heavily armored unit with multiple weapon systems for dealing with various types of enemy units.\n5. Utility Classes and Features:\n\t* FormationManager.cs: A system for managing unit formations, allowing the player to create and modify formations for better control of their units.\n\t* UnitUpgrade.cs: A system that allows the player to upgrade units with improved parts, sensors, or behaviors.\n\t* DynamicObstacles.cs: A script that enables the creation of dynamic obstacles, such as destructible terrain or moving hazards, to add complexity and challenge to the sandbox.\n6. UI Improvements:\n\t* UnitSelectionUI.cs: A user interface for selecting and controlling individual units or groups of units.\n\t* UnitInfoPanel.cs: A panel that displays detailed information about a selected unit, including its current parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\t* DesignBlueprintUI.cs: A user interface that allows the player to create, save, and load custom unit designs using available parts, sensors, and behaviors.\n\nThese suggestions can help enhance your RTS unit testing sandbox in Unity and provide more variety and depth in unit designs and gameplay scenarios."
