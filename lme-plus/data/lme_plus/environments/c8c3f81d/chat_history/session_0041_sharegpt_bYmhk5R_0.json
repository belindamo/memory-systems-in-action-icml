Suddenly, the door bursts open and John storms in.\n\nJohn: \"Andy, what the hell are you doing in here? You've been in here for hours!\"\n\nAndy: (nervously) \"Uh, I was just, uh, practicing my presentation for the school talent show. You know, to make sure it's perfect.\"\n\nJohn: (skeptical) \"In the disabled toilet? And making those noises? That doesn't sound right, Andy.\"\n\nAndy: (defensively) \"I was just trying to add some extra drama to my presentation, okay? Don't judge me!\"\n\nJohn: (sighing) \"Andy, you can't just use the disabled toilet for your own personal gain. It's not right. And those noises you were making were disturbing.\"\n\nAndy: (sheepishly) \"Sorry, John. I didn't mean to cause any trouble.\"\n\nJohn: (frustrated) \"Just get out of here and try to be more considerate in the future.\"\n\nThe scene ends with Andy quickly gathering his things and rushing out of the disabled toilet, embarrassed."

Suddenly, Andy bursts into the room, trying to impress her with one of his elaborate stories.\n\nAndy: \"Hey, Ruth. You won't believe what happened to me last night. I was out at the bar, and this guy starts hitting on me. And I'm like, 'sorry, buddy. I'm not interested.' And then he starts talking about how he's an expert in German culture and language. And I'm like, 'oh, you and Ruth should totally hit it off!' It was hilarious.\"\n\nRuth: (sighing) \"Andy, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not interested in dating anyone right now. And I would prefer if you didn't try to set me up with someone based on my love of the German language.\"\n\nAndy: (confused) \"Oh, I didn't realize. I'm sorry, Ruth. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\n\nRuth: (softening) \"It's okay, Andy. I know you were just trying to be friendly. But please just respect my boundaries and let me decide who I want to date.\"\n\nAndy: (nodding) \"Of course, Ruth. I'm sorry. I'll try to be more considerate in the future.\"\n\nThe scene ends with Ruth smiling at Andy, appreciative of his apology."

Suddenly, Andy bursts into the room, trying to impress her with another elaborate story.\n\nAndy: \"Hey, Ruth. You won't believe what happened to me at the bar last night. I met this amazing girl, and we hit it off right away. We were laughing and joking and having the best time. And then she leaned in and whispered in my ear, 'I think you're really cute.' And I was like, 'oh my god, she likes me!' It was awesome.\"\n\nRuth: (sighing) \"Andy, I'm glad you're having fun, but I'm not really in the mood for your stories right now.\"\n\nAndy: (confused) \"Oh, I'm sorry. Is everything okay, Ruth?\"\n\nRuth: (hesitantly) \"Well, I've been thinking a lot lately. About myself, and my feelings. And I've realized that I'm attracted to women.\"\n\nAndy: (surprised) \"Oh, wow. That's, uh, that's big news, Ruth. Are you okay?\"\n\nRuth: (nodding) \"I think so. It's been a lot to process, but I'm trying to be honest with myself and accept who I am.\"\n\nAndy: (smiling) \"That's great, Ruth. I'm here for you if you need to talk. And I'll try to be more respectful of your boundaries in the future.\"\n\nThe scene ends with Ruth smiling at Andy, appreciative of his support."
