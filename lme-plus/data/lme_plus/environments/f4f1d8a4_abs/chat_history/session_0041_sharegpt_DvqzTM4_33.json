These models are typically not as advanced as more complex models that are designed to generate more realistic video content, but they can be a cost-effective way to generate basic video content quickly and efficiently.\n\nTo use a text-to-video AI model to generate content for your mobile app, you will need to consider the following resources:\n\n1. AI model: You will need to select an appropriate text-to-video AI model for your needs. There are several commercial and open source models available, so you will need to research and compare options to find the best fit for your requirements.\n2. Development resources: You will need a team of developers with the technical skills and expertise needed to integrate the text-to-video AI model into your toolset. This may include machine learning engineers, data scientists, and software developers with expertise in building AI-based systems.\n3. Data and training resources: You may need to provide data to the text-to-video AI model in order to train it or fine-tune its output. This may include text descriptions of the video content you want to generate, as well as any other relevant data.\n4. Hardware resources: Depending on the complexity of your AI system, you may need to allocate resources for hardware such as servers, GPUs, or other specialized hardware.\n5.

In general, you can expect to pay more for a designer with more experience and specialized skills. In Eastern Europe, the cost of hiring a UI/UX designer may be lower compared to other regions, but this will depend on the specific market and job market in the region.\n\nIt is difficult for me to provide a more specific estimate for the cost of hiring a UI/UX designer in Eastern Europe, as there are many variables that can affect the cost. Some factors to consider when determining the budget for a UI/UX designer include:\n\n1. The designer's level of experience: More experienced designers may command higher rates due to their expertise and track record.\n2. The complexity of the project: If your project is more complex or requires specialized skills, you may need to pay more for a designer with the necessary expertise.\n3. The duration of the project: The cost of hiring a UI/UX designer may be higher if the project is longer in duration, as the designer will be working on the project for an extended period of time.\n4. The location of the designer: The cost of living in different regions can affect the rates that designers charge. In general, you may pay more for a designer located in a region with a higher cost of living.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!
