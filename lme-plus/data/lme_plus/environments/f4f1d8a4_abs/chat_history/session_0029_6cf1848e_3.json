However, I can suggest a few options to help you remember your online meetings:\n\n1. **Digital Calendars:** Add your online meetings to your digital calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook) and set reminders accordingly. You can set reminders for a specific time before the meeting, such as 15 minutes or 30 minutes.\n2. **Reminder Apps:** Use a reminder app like Any.do, Todoist, or Reminders (on iOS) to set reminders for your online meetings. You can customize the reminder time and frequency to suit your needs.\n3. **Alarms:** Set alarms on your phone or watch for the meeting times to ensure you don't miss them.\n4. **Physical Planner:** If you prefer a more analog approach, write down your online meetings in a physical planner or calendar and set a reminder for yourself to check your schedule regularly.\n\nRemember to set reminders for both Tuesdays and Thursdays, and make sure to include the meeting details, such as the time, topic, and login information.\n\nI hope this helps!"
