  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or preferences on specific movies or TV shows, but I can provide information and examples where background music was absent or used sparingly. \n\nThere have been instances where the absence of background music has been intentionally used as a creative choice to enhance the mood or atmosphere of a film or TV show. For example, in the opening sequence of the film There Will Be Blood, director Paul Thomas Anderson chose to forgo background music and allow only the sound of the wind and the drilling machines to set the tone for the scene. The effect is a stark and haunting beginning to the film that leaves a lasting impact on the viewer.\n\nSimilarly, in some documentaries, background music is often kept to a minimum, allowing the voices and sounds of the subject matter to take center stage. This can create a more immersive and engaging viewing experience for the audience, as they feel more connected to the real-world events being depicted.\n\nIn summary, while there are certainly occasions where a lack of background music can add to the viewing experience, it ultimately depends on the creative choices made by the filmmakers and how well they are able to use music (or the lack of it) to serve the story they are telling.",
