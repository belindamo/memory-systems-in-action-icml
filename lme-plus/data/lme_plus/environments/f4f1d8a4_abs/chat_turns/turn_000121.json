Adding a food that supports joint health can be a wonderful complement to her treatment. Here are some tips to consider when selecting a cat food for arthritis:\n\n1. **Look for foods with added joint supplements**: Glucosamine and chondroitin are two common supplements that can help reduce joint pain and inflammation. Some foods may also contain other ingredients like omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation.\n2. **Choose a food with a balanced fatty acid profile**: A balanced ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids can help reduce inflammation and promote joint health.\n3. **Consider a food with anti-inflammatory ingredients**: Some foods may contain ingredients like turmeric, green-lipped mussels, or boswellia, which have anti-inflammatory properties.\n4. **Opt for a food with a moderate protein level**: High-protein diets can exacerbate joint issues, so a moderate protein level (around 30-40% on a dry matter basis) may be beneficial.\n5. **Wet food or mixed feeding**: Feeding a combination of wet and dry food or switching to a wet food diet can help reduce inflammation and improve joint health.\n\nBased on these criteria, here are some cat food brands that might be suitable for Luna:\n\n1. **Hill's Science Diet Adult Indoor Cat Food with Joint Support**: This food contains glucosamine and chondroitin, as well as omega-3 fatty acids, to support joint health.\n2. **Royal Canin Adult Joint Support**: This food is specifically formulated to support joint health, with a unique blend of glucosamine, chondroitin, and omega-3 fatty acids.\n3. **Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets JM Joint Mobility**: This food contains a blend of glucosamine, chondroitin, and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as antioxidants to support overall health.\n4. **Wellness Core Grain-Free Adult Cat Food with Joint Support**: This food features a balanced fatty acid profile, glucosamine, and chondroitin, as well as turmeric for added anti-inflammatory benefits.\n5. **Orijen Senior Cat Food**: While not specifically formulated for joint support, Orijen's senior formula contains a balanced fatty acid profile, glucosamine, and chondroitin, making it a great option for older cats with joint issues.\n\nRemember to always transition your cat to a new food gradually to prevent digestive upset. Start by mixing a small amount of the new food with her current food and gradually increase the proportion over 7-10 days.\n\nAs for the new scratching post, it's great that you're providing Luna with a new outlet for exercise and stretching! It's normal for cats to take some time to get used to new scratching posts, so be patient and encourage her to use it with treats and toys.\n\nConsult with your vet before making any changes to Luna's diet, as they can provide personalized recommendations based on her specific needs and health status.",
