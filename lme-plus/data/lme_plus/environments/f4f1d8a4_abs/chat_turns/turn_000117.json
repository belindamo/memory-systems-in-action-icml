  "content": "I'm so glad to hear that you're excited about your new coffee table! It's amazing how a new piece of furniture can totally transform a room and make it more functional and inviting. And I completely understand about getting rid of old furniture that no longer fits with your style or needs. It's liberating to declutter and upgrade, isn't it?\n\nI think your idea of setting up stations on the coffee table with labels is a great way to make the snack and drink selection easy and accessible for your guests. It's also a thoughtful touch that shows you're considerate of their needs and want to make sure they feel comfortable and cared for.\n\nRemember to have fun and be flexible during the game night. Don't stress too much about the details, and be prepared for things to unfold in unexpected ways. The goal is to have a great time with your friends and create some wonderful memories, so enjoy the experience and go with the flow!\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have an amazing game night and make some wonderful memories with your friends!",
