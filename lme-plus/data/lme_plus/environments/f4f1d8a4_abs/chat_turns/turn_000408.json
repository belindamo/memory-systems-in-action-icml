  "content": "Fernet Branca can be a bit of an acquired taste, but it's definitely worth trying if you like bitter and herbal flavors. It may not be available at all liquor stores, but you can check online or call ahead to see if they have it in stock. The Hanky Panky is a great cocktail to try if you're new to Fernet Branca, as the gin and vermouth balance out the bitterness of the liqueur. Just remember to use it sparingly, as a little goes a long way. Enjoy!",
