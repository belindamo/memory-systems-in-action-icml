It's a unique and personalized item that shows you put effort into selecting a special gift. If you know her initials or can find out, it'll make it an even more meaningful gift.\n\nAnd what a wonderful idea to include the nice notecards from Amazon! Adding a set of beautiful notecards to the gift can make it feel more substantial and show that you're thinking about her future correspondence. It's a great way to encourage her to stay in touch and write to her new colleagues or friends.\n\nYou could pair the monogrammed notebook with the notecards and a heartfelt note expressing your appreciation for her time at the company and wishing her all the best in her new endeavors. This thoughtful gesture will surely be remembered and cherished.\n\nIf you want to add a little extra something, you could consider including a nice pen or a small packet of gourmet coffee or tea to complement the gift. But honestly, the notebook and notecards alone will make a lovely gift.\n\nWhat do you think about adding a small, heartfelt note to the gift? Would you like some suggestions on what to write?",
