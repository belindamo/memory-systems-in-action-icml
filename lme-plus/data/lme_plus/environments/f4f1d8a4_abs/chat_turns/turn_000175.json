And can I also request a table near the window if possible? I would love to have a nice view while dining.\"\n\nThis response provides the guest's name and also makes a request for a specific type of seating arrangement.\n\n1. \"My name is [Guest's name], and I'd like to request a high chair for my child, please. Do you have any available?\"\n\nThis response provides the guest's name and also makes a request for a high chair for their child. It is appropriate for a guest who is bringing a child to the restaurant and wants to ensure they are comfortable and safe while dining.\n\n1. \"My name is [Guest's name], and I just wanted to confirm the date and time of my reservation.\"\n\nThis response simply confirms the reservation details and provides the guest's name, making it appropriate for a guest who wants to ensure that the reservation details are correct.",
