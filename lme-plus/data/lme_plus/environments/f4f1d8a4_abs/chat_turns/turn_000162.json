  "content": "I think the Korean-Style BBQ Beef Tacos with Kimchi Slaw sounds amazing! I've never used Korean chili flakes before, but I'm excited to try it out. Also, I like the idea of using leftovers for tacos, salads, or rice bowls. Since I already have a big batch of chicken stir-fry that'll last me till Thursday, I'll have time to experiment with this recipe over the weekend.",
