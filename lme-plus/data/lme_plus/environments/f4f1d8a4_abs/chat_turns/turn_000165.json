Here are some tips to help you track them down:\n\n1. **Asian grocery stores:** If you have an Asian market or an international grocery store in your area, they'll likely carry a variety of Korean chili flakes and gochujang. These stores usually have a dedicated Korean or Asian food section.\n2. **Health food stores:** Many health food stores like Whole Foods, Sprouts, or Trader Joe's carry gochujang in their international or condiment section. They might not have Korean chili flakes, but you can try substituting with a similar type of chili flake or pepper.\n3. **Specialty food stores:** Gourmet or specialty food stores like Williams-Sonoma, Sur La Table, or Asian-focused stores like Mitsuwa Marketplace might carry Korean chili flakes and gochujang.\n4. **Online retailers:** If you can't find these ingredients in local stores, you can always turn to online retailers like Amazon, Walmart, or Asianfoodgrocer.com. They often carry a wide selection of Korean ingredients, including gochugaru and gochujang.\n5. **Substitutions:** If you can't find Korean chili flakes, you can try substituting with a similar type of chili flake or pepper, such as:\n\t* Crushed red pepper flakes (not as spicy, but similar flavor)\n\t* Szechuan pepper flakes (numbing and slightly spicy)\n\t* Ancho or guajillo chili powder (milder, slightly sweet)\n\nWhen shopping for gochujang, look for it in the condiment or international section. It usually comes in a red or brown paste form and might be labeled as \"Korean chili paste\" or \"gochujang sauce.\"\n\nIf you're still having trouble finding these ingredients, feel free to ask, and I can provide more guidance or suggest alternative recipes that use more easily accessible ingredients.",
