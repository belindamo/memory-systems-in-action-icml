Since you mentioned affordable options, I'll keep that in mind:\n\n1. **Personalized item**: A monogrammed notebook, pen, or keychain can make a thoughtful gift. You can find these at a reasonable price point at stores like Target or online at Etsy.\n2. **Gourmet food or coffee**: A nice bag of specialty coffee, artisanal tea, or gourmet snacks like chocolates or nuts are always appreciated.\n3. **Wine or champagne**: A nice bottle of wine or champagne is a classic farewell gift. You can even add a personalized note or card to make it extra special.\n4. **Desk accessory**: A fun mousepad, a paperweight, or a decorative paperclip holder can add some personality to their new workspace.\n5. **Book or magazine subscription**: If your coworker enjoys reading, consider gifting a book by their favorite author or a subscription to a magazine that aligns with their interests.\n6. **Customized water bottle**: A refillable water bottle with a personalized message or inside joke can be a unique and functional gift.\n7. **Relaxation and self-care**: A scented eye mask, a set of essential oils, or a gift certificate for a massage can help your coworker unwind and relax in their new adventure.\n8. **Fun experience**: Gift your coworker an experience, like tickets to a local event, a cooking class, or a wine tasting. This will create a memorable farewell gift.\n9. **Practical items**: A set of nice notecards, a small toolkit, or a portable power bank can be useful and appreciated in their new role.\n10. **Group gift**: Consider pooling funds with other coworkers to get a more substantial gift, like a gift card to their favorite store or restaurant.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your appreciation and gratitude for your coworker's time at the company.\n\nP.S. Great score on the scented candle for your mom!",
