I've also been trying to learn new things lately, and I think it's really important to apply what we learn to real-life situations. Speaking of which, I've been watching a lot of Crash Course videos myself, and I've been trying to use what I learn to better understand the news and current events. For example, I recently watched a Crash Course video on world history, and it really helped me understand the context behind a recent news article I read. Have you tried using what you learn from Crash Course to better understand current events or news?",
