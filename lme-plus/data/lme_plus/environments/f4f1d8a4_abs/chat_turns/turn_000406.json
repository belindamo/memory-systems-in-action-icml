  "content": "Fernet Branca is a popular Italian bitter liqueur that is made from a secret recipe of over 27 herbs and spices. It has a complex and intense flavor that is both bitter and herbal, with notes of mint, anise, and eucalyptus. \n\nFernet Branca is often used as a digestive after dinner, but it has also become a popular ingredient in cocktails. In the Hanky Panky, the bitter and herbaceous notes of the Fernet Branca pair well with the gin and sweet vermouth, creating a bold and complex cocktail. The drink was created by Ada Coleman, the head bartender at the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London in the 1920s, and it has remained a classic cocktail ever since.",
