In many cases, it can enhance the viewing experience by adding emotional depth, creating tension, or heightening the overall impact of the scene. This is particularly true with well-crafted scores that are specifically tailored to the story being told. \n\nOn the other hand, poorly chosen or used background music can be distracting and detract from the viewing experience. It can take away from the emotional content being conveyed on screen if the music is not seamlessly integrated with the visuals, or if it is too loud or jarring. \n\nUltimately, the role of background music in movies and TV shows is to accentuate the story being told and add an extra layer of emotion and meaning. When done well, it can greatly enhance the viewing experience and create a memorable, emotional connection with the audience.",
