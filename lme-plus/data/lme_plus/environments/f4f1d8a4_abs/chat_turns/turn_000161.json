Marinate thinly sliced beef in a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, ginger, brown sugar, and gochugaru, then grill or pan-fry it. Serve with kimchi slaw (made with Korean chili flakes, fish sauce, and lime juice), warm tortillas, and your favorite toppings. Leftovers can be used for tacos, salads, or as a topping for rice bowls.\n2. **Jamaican Jerk Chicken with Caribbean Rice and Peas**:\nThis recipe showcases the bold flavors of jerk seasoning, which typically includes scotch bonnet peppers. Marinate chicken thighs in a mixture of jerk seasoning, allspice, thyme, and lime juice, then grill or bake until cooked through. Serve with Caribbean rice and peas (coconut milk, onions, bell peppers, and scotch bonnet peppers) and steamed vegetables. Leftovers can be used for chicken salads, wraps, or as a topping for rice bowls.\n3. **Chili con Carne with Ancho and Habanero Peppers**:\nThis hearty, spicy stew is perfect for a weekend cook-up. Use ancho and habanero peppers to add depth and heat to your chili. Brown ground beef with onions, garlic, and peppers, then add canned tomatoes, beans, and a blend of spices. Simmer until thickened, and serve with crusty bread, cornbread, or over rice. Leftovers can be used for chili dogs, chili mac, or as a topping for baked potatoes.\n\nWhich of these recipes catches your attention? Do you have any questions or would you like more ideas?",
