  "content": "Yes, there are some specific examples of murals that incorporate animist beliefs in Bagan's temples. One of the most notable examples is in the Myinkaba Gu Byauk Gyi Temple, where murals depict scenes from the 13th-century Burmese fable of the \"Great Spider.\" In this fable, a giant spider is said to have woven a web across a river so that villagers could cross it safely. The spider later demands payment in the form of the villagers' firstborn sons, but a wise monk is able to outwit the spider and save the children.\n\nAnother example can be found in the Tayok Pye Temple, where murals depict the \"Four Guardian Kings,\" who are considered important figures in Burmese animist beliefs. The Four Guardian Kings are said to protect the kingdoms of the world from evil spirits and promote the Buddhist teachings.\n\nAdditionally, the Sulamani Temple contains murals that depict elements from Burmese folklore, including whimsical scenes of animals and mythical creatures such as the Naga, a snake-like spirit, and Garuda, a legendary bird-like creature from Hindu and Buddhist mythology.",
