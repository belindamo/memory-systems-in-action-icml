  "content": "My thesis deadline is in about 12 weeks, and I still need to complete my methodology, data collection, data analysis, and start writing the results and discussion sections. I can dedicate around 20-25 hours per week to work on my thesis. I'm usually more productive in the mornings, so I prefer to work on my thesis from 9 am to 1 pm, Monday to Friday. I also have a part-time job that requires me to work 10 hours a week, but I can adjust my schedule to accommodate my thesis work. Additionally, I need to meet with my supervisor in six weeks to discuss my progress, so that's a key milestone for me.",
