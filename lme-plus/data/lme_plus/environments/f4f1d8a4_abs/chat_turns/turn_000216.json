  "content": "The social system that existed before the manorial system in Europe was known as the tribal system. It was based on the organization of small communities or tribes, who lived together and shared a common culture, language, and beliefs. These tribes were typically organized around kinship ties and were led by a chief or a council of elders.\n\nThe tribal system was characterized by a relatively simple division of labor and a relatively equal distribution of resources among members of the tribe. The tribe would work together to provide for the basic needs of all its members, such as food, shelter, and protection. The tribe would also share resources and wealth among its members, and would provide mutual aid and support in times of need.\n\nThe tribal system was in place in Europe during the pre-Roman period, and it coexisted with the Roman Empire during the Roman period. However, as the Roman Empire fell, different tribes and communities start to form their own kingdoms and feudal systems with different social hierarchy and class distinctions.",
