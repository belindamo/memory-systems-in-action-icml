You'll typically receive a \"Temporary Visitor\" stamp in your passport upon arrival, which allows you to stay in Japan for up to 90 days.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to check the Japanese government's official website or consult with the Japanese embassy or consulate in your country to confirm visa requirements and any specific documentation needed for your trip.\n\nIf you do require a visa, it's generally recommended to apply well in advance of your trip to account for any potential processing delays. Processing times can vary depending on the embassy or consulate, but 2 weeks is a reasonable estimate.\n\nIn your case, since you're planning to travel soon, I would recommend applying for a visa (if required) as soon as possible to ensure you receive it in time. You can find more information on the visa application process and required documents on the Japanese government's website or by contacting the Japanese embassy or consulate in your country.\n\nRemember to also check the validity of your passport, as it should be valid for at least six months beyond your planned departure date from Japan.",
