Start small:** Begin with a short 5-10 minute meditation session and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.\n\n**4. Create a peaceful environment:** Set up a peaceful and calming environment for meditation and stretching, such as a quiet room or a peaceful outdoor spot.\n\n**5.

Be consistent:** Consistency is key when it comes to developing a meditation and stretching habit. Try to meditate and stretch at the same time every day, even on weekends.\n\n**9. Mix it up:** Mix up your meditation and stretching routine to avoid boredom and prevent plateaus.
