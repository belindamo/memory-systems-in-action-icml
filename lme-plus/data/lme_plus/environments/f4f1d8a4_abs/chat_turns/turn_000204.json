  "content": "Before 1962, the global superpowers were the United States and Soviet Union as well, but before World War II, the leading global superpowers were the United Kingdom, France and to some extent, Germany and Italy. These countries were colonial powers with vast territories, powerful militaries, and strong economies. They had significant influence over the world's political, economic, and cultural affairs. After the World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the two dominant superpowers, as the other countries were weakened by the war and their empires began to dissolve. The United States and the Soviet Union became the two main players in the Cold War, which lasted from the end of World War II until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.",
