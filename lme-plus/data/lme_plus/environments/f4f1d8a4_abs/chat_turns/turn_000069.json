There are several natural supplements and vitamins that may help increase testosterone levels in women, including:\n\n1. Vitamin D - Studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D are associated with lower testosterone levels in women. Taking a vitamin D supplement may help increase testosterone levels.\n\n2. Zinc - Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a key role in testosterone production. Taking a zinc supplement may help increase testosterone levels in women with low levels of zinc.\n\n3. DHEA - DHEA is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that can convert into testosterone. Taking a low dose of DHEA under the guidance of a healthcare provider may help increase testosterone levels in women.\n\n4. Tribulus Terrestris - This plant extract has been used in traditional medicine to enhance libido and increase testosterone levels. However, its effectiveness in increasing testosterone levels in women is not well-established.\n\nIt's important to note that while these supplements may help increase testosterone levels in some women, they may not be effective for everyone. It's important to work with a healthcare provider and have hormone levels monitored to ensure optimal health.",
