Barrier-Free Cars: As I mentioned earlier, some subway cars are designated as \"Barrier-Free Cars,\" which are equipped with priority seating, wheelchair spaces, and accessible toilets.\n\n4. Audio and visual announcements: All subway stations and buses in Seoul have audio and visual announcements that provide information about the stops and the next destination. This is especially important for people with hearing or visual impairments.\n\n5. Station facilities and signage: Seoul has made efforts to improve the facilities at subway stations, such as adding tactile tiles to guide visually impaired people and installing Braille maps and signs.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the measures that Seoul has taken to improve accessibility in their public transportation system.
