  "content": "That's a great setup for my Trello board! I think I'll also add a list for \"Resources\" where I can store relevant articles, books, and other materials I come across during my research. Additionally, I'll create a card for each chapter of my thesis and break down the tasks for each chapter into smaller, manageable chunks. This will help me stay focused on the bigger picture while still making progress on the smaller tasks. Now that I have a plan for my Trello board, I can start setting up my Toggl account for time tracking. Can you walk me through the process of setting up a Toggl account and creating a project for my thesis?",
