What type of cuisine are you in the mood for?\n\nHere are a few questions to help me narrow down some options:\n\n1. Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free)?\n2. What's your favorite protein: beef, pork, chicken, fish, or something else?\n3. Are you open to trying new ingredients or do you prefer sticking to familiar flavors?\n4. How much time do you have available to cook and prep on the weekend?\n5. Are you looking for something comforting and hearty or something light and refreshing?\n\nFeel free to answer any or all of these questions, and I'll suggest some recipe ideas for you to try!",
