  "content": "I've actually been to a Latin dance festival at the convention center downtown on March 4th, it was an amazing experience! I took a workshop on afro-cuban rhythms and even got to dance with one of the instructors, Carlos, during the social dance portion of the festival. Anyway, I'll definitely check out those resources to find more events like that. Can you recommend any dance socials or parties in my area?",
