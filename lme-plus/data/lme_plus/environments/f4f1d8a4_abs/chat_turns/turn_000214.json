  "content": "Before feudalism, the dominant social and political system in Europe was known as the manorial system. It was based on the ownership of land by a small group of wealthy individuals, known as landlords or lords, who controlled the land and the people living on it. These lords, who were typically members of the nobility or the Church, granted the use of their lands to tenants, who were usually small farmers or serfs, in exchange for labor and payment of taxes.\n\nThe manorial system was characterized by a strong dependence of the tenants on the lords, who had control over their lives and livelihoods. The tenants were expected to work on the lord's land and pay him a portion of their crops or other produce. The lords also had the power to impose fines, taxes, and other penalties on the tenants, and to control their movement and activities.\n\nThe manorial system was in place in Europe during the Dark Ages, but it evolved over time and eventually gave way to feudalism. Feudalism was characterized by a more formal and legalistic system of rights and obligations between lords and vassals, and by the emergence of a warrior class of vassals who were granted land in exchange for military service.",
