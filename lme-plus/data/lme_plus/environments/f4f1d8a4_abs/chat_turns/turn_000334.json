Instead, you'll need to ensure your credit card has enough available credit to cover the charge.\n\nRegarding your flight tickets, it's great that you're waiting for confirmation from Sakura Travel Agency. Once you receive the confirmation, you can review the details to ensure everything is in order.\n\nRemember to double-check the flight itinerary, including the departure and arrival dates, times, and any layovers. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to the travel agency for clarification.\n\nIn the meantime, you can continue preparing for your trip by researching Japan, learning some basic Japanese phrases, and getting excited for your adventure!",
