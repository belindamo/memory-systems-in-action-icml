Customizing her news feed to prioritize updates from family members and close friends is a great way to make her Facebook experience more enjoyable and meaningful. Here are some tips to help you do just that:\n\n**1. Prioritize Friends and Family**:\n\t* Go to your mom's Facebook profile and click on the \"Friends\" tab.\n\t* Click on \"See All Friends\" and then click on the three dots next to \"Friends\" at the top right corner of the page.\n\t* Select \"Prioritize who to see first\" from the dropdown menu.\n\t* Choose \"Close Friends\" and \"Family\" from the list to prioritize their updates.\n\n**2. Create a \"Close Friends\" List**:\n\t* Go to your mom's Facebook profile and click on the \"Friends\" tab.\n\t* Click on \"See All Friends\" and then click on \"Create List\" at the top right corner of the page.\n\t* Name the list \"Close Friends\" (or a name of your choice) and add the people she wants to see more updates from.\n\t* Once the list is created, go to the \"News Feed Preferences\" (see below) and select \"Close Friends\" as one of the priorities.\n\n**3. News Feed Preferences**:\n\t* Click on the three horizontal lines () at the top right corner of the Facebook page.\n\t* Scroll down and click on \"Settings\" and then \"News Feed Preferences.\"\n\t* Click on \"Prioritize who to see first\" and select the people and lists you want to prioritize (e.g., Close Friends, Family).\n\t* You can also choose to \"Unfollow\" or \"Snooze\" people or pages that she doesn't want to see updates from.\n\n**4. Customize News Feed Settings**:\n\t* Go to the \"News Feed Preferences\" page (as above).\n\t* Click on \"See First\" and select the types of posts she wants to see first in her news feed (e.g., photos, videos, links).\n\t* Click on \"Hide\" to hide posts from specific people or pages.\n\t* Click on \"Snooze\" to temporarily hide posts from someone for 30 days.\n\n**5. Use Facebook Groups**:\n\t* Encourage your mom to join Facebook Groups related to her interests or created by family members or close friends.\n\t* This way, she'll see updates from these groups in her news feed and can engage with others who share similar interests.\n\n**6. Teach Your Mom How to Use Facebook's Algorithm**:\n\t* Explain to your mom that Facebook's algorithm shows her posts from people she interacts with most.\n\t* Encourage her to like, comment, and share posts from family members and close friends to see more of their updates.\n\nBy following these steps, your mom's Facebook news feed should start showing more updates from family members and close friends. Remember to be patient and take the time to explain these steps to her, as it may take some time for her to get comfortable with these features.",
