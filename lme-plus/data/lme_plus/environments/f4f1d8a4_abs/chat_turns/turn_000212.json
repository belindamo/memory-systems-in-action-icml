  "content": "Feudalism is a social and political system that emerged in medieval Europe, in which society was divided into classes of lords and vassals. The lords, who were typically nobles or members of the nobility, owned and controlled large areas of land, known as fiefs. They granted the use of these lands to vassals, who were usually knights or other warriors, in exchange for their loyalty and military service.\n\nThe vassals, in turn, would provide the lords with soldiers for their armies, and would also collect taxes from the people living on the land. This relationship was based on a written or unwritten contract called a \"fief\" or \"feudal contract\". The vassals were also expected to provide the lords with counsel and support in political and legal matters, and were often required to attend the lords' courts and assemblies.\n\nUnder feudalism, society was also divided into three main classes: the lords, the vassals, and the serfs. The serfs were the lowest class, and were bound to the land, they were not allowed to leave the land without permission of their lords and had to work on the land and pay taxes to the lords.\n\nFeudalism was the dominant social and political system in Europe during the Middle Ages, and persisted in some form until the 18th century. It was based on the idea of mutual obligations and reciprocal rights, which was supported by the Church, which had a significant influence on the society.\n\nFeudalism was abolished in some European countries such as France, England, and Spain. But it still exists in some countries such as Japan, China, and India in a different form.",
