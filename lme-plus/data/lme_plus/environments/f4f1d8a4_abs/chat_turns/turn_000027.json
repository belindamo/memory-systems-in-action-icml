  "content": "Both Everlane and Cuyana are known for using high-quality leather in their bags, and they're transparent about the materials they use. Here's what I found out about the leather quality in their bags:\n\n**Everlane**\n\nEverlane uses a variety of leathers in their bags, depending on the specific style and collection. However, they're committed to using only high-quality, premium leathers that are durable, soft, and develop a beautiful patina over time. Here are some details about the leathers they use:\n\n* **Italian Leather**: Everlane sources their leather from top-tier Italian tanneries, known for their high-quality leather production. Italian leather is renowned for its softness, suppleness, and durability.\n* **Full-Grain Leather**: Everlane uses full-grain leather, which is the highest quality leather available. Full-grain leather is made from the strongest, most durable part of the hide, and it has not been sanded or buffed to remove imperfections. This means that the leather will develop a beautiful patina over time and retain its natural character.\n* **Vegetable-Tanned Leather**: Some Everlane bags feature vegetable-tanned leather, which is a more sustainable and eco-friendly option. Vegetable-tanned leather is tanned using natural tannins from plants and trees, rather than harsh chemicals.\n\n**Cuyana**\n\nCuyana is also committed to using high-quality leathers in their bags, and they're transparent about the materials they use. Here are some details about the leathers they use:\n\n* **Premium Leather**: Cuyana sources their leather from top-tier tanneries around the world, including Italy, France, and Argentina. They use premium leathers that are known for their softness, suppleness, and durability.\n* **Full-Grain Leather**: Like Everlane, Cuyana uses full-grain leather in many of their bags. This means that the leather is strong, durable, and will develop a beautiful patina over time.\n* **Top-Grain Leather**: Cuyana also uses top-grain leather, which is a high-quality leather that has been sanded and buffed to remove imperfections. Top-grain leather is still very durable and resistant to scratches and scuffs.\n\nIn general, both Everlane and Cuyana use high-quality leathers that are durable, soft, and develop a beautiful patina over time. However, if you're looking for a more sustainable option, Everlane's vegetable-tanned leather might be a better choice. If you're looking for a more affordable option, Cuyana's top-grain leather might be a better choice.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
