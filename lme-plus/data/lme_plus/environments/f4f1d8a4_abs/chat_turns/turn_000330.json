You can also check the latest rates on websites like XE.com, Oanda.com, or Bloomberg.com for the most up-to-date information.\n\nAs of now, the exchange rate is around 1 USD = 135-140 JPY. However, please note that exchange rates can change frequently, so I recommend checking the current rate before your trip or using a currency converter app to get the latest exchange rate.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider the following tips when managing your budget for your trip to Japan:\n\n1. **Check with your bank**: Inform your bank about your travel plans, so they don't flag your transactions as suspicious. Ask about their exchange rates, fees, and any travel-friendly debit/credit cards they offer.\n2. **Use a credit card**: Many credit cards don't charge foreign transaction fees, and you can earn rewards or points. Just be aware of your credit limit and interest rates.\n3. **Exchange some cash**: Having some local currency (JPY) upon arrival can be helpful for initial expenses, like transportation from the airport or buying snacks. You can exchange a small amount at a currency exchange office or use an ATM to withdraw cash.\n4. **Use an ATM**: Many Japanese ATMs accept international cards, and you can withdraw cash in JPY. Be aware of your bank's international withdrawal fees and exchange rates.\n5. **Mobile payments**: Japan is increasingly accepting mobile payments like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. You can also use these services to pay for some public transportation and purchases.\n\nRemember to factor in any additional fees associated with exchanging currency, using ATMs, or making international transactions with your credit/debit cards.\n\nHave a wonderful trip to Japan with Sakura Travel Agency!",
