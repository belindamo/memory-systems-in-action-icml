  "content": "I'm glad you mentioned the heartfelt note! It's a great way to express your gratitude and make the gift even more personal. Here are some suggestions to get you started:\n\n* \"Dear [Coworker's Name], I'll miss working with you, but I'm excited to see the amazing things you'll accomplish in your new role. Thank you for being an incredible colleague and friend. Best wishes, [Your Name]\"\n* \"Wishing you all the best in your new adventure! You'll be deeply missed here, but I know you'll thrive in your new role. Thanks for the memories and for being an inspiration to us all. [Your Name]\"\n* \"I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with you. Your [specific skill or quality] has been an invaluable asset to our team. I hope our paths cross again soon. Best regards, [Your Name]\"\n\nFeel free to modify these or add your own personal touch to make it more sincere and authentic.\n\nRegarding your mom's scented candle from Bath & Body Works, that's a great score! The free travel-sized hand sanitizer is a nice bonus too! It's always exciting to find deals on nice gifts. Bath & Body Works is known for their affordable prices and high-quality products, so I'm sure your mom will enjoy the candle.\n\nNow, back to your coworker's gift: do you think you'll add any other items to the gift, or will the monogrammed notebook, notecards, and heartfelt note be the perfect combination?",
