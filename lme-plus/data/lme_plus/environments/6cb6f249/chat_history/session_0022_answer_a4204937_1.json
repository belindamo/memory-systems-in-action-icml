Consider deleting or limiting your use of these apps.\n2. **Set app-specific goals:** Set daily time limits for specific apps, like social media or games, to help you stay within your goals.\n3. **Schedule app usage:** Use Moment's scheduling feature to limit your app usage to specific times of the day or week.\n4. **Replace bad habits:** Identify apps that are replacing more important activities, like reading or exercise, and make a plan to replace them with healthier habits.\n5. **Find alternative apps:** If you find yourself spending too much time in a particular app, look for alternative apps that can help you achieve the same goal in less time.\n6. **Set screen-free times:** Use Moment's screen-free mode to set times when you don't want to use your phone, like during meals or before bed.\n7. **Reflect and adjust:** Regularly review your app tracking data to reflect on your habits and make adjustments as needed.\n\nBy using Moment's app tracking feature, you'll gain a better understanding of your phone habits and be able to make informed decisions about how you spend your time.
