      "content": "This is the Step 2. I want you to remember this as part of our conversation. Do you understand? Step 2: Consider legal representation Before lodging an internal appeal, consider whether you want to present your own case to NCAT or have a lawyer or non-lawyer agent represent you. You will usually need to be present to give your instructions to your lawyer or agent. In an internal appeal you can be represented by another person if you were able to be represented in your original matter with NCAT, i.e. in the decision you are appealing against. In all other cases the Tribunal will need to give permission for you to be represented by another person. You should ask for this permission when you are notified to attend the Tribunal for a \u2018call over\u2019. If you want to be represented you will need to fill out a Notice of Representation by a Legal Practitioner or Agent and submit it to the NCAT registry in person or by post. If a non-lawyer agent is representing you, you also need to sign the Notice of Representation before it is submitted.\n\nPlease write in English language."

The option to present one's own case to the NCAT or to have a lawyer or non-lawyer agent represent the appellant should be carefully considered. The appellant will usually need to be present to provide instructions to their representative. If the appellant is seeking to be represented by another person, they should ensure that they have the necessary permission from the NCAT to do so. A Notice of Representation by a Legal Practitioner or Agent must be filled out and submitted to the NCAT registry in person or by post, and if a non-lawyer agent is representing the appellant, they must sign the Notice of Representation before submission."

Step 3: Complete the Notice of Appeal To apply for your matter to be heard by the Appeal Panel, you need to fill out a Notice of Appeal form. You will need to include the following information in your Notice of Appeal form: a copy of the orders made by NCAT and any written reasons of the Tribunal details of the NCAT decision you are appealing against \u2013 refer to the written reasons of the Tribunal and Orders you have received for these details your contact details and the details of your representative (if you have one) \u2013 you are named the appellant in this appeal the contact details of all respondents and the details of their representatives (if they have one) \u2013 refer to the written reasons of the Tribunal and Order in your original matter with NCAT for these details the orders you want the Appeal Panel to change an outline of why you consider the Tribunal\u2019s decision was wrong \u2013 seek legal advice on this if you can as this can be complicated the orders you say the Appeal Panel should make instead of the ones which have been made a copy of any other documents you are relying on in the appeal. On the Notice of Appeal form you will also be asked whether you are asking for leave to appeal. If you do not have legal representation and/or you are unsure whether you need to ask for leave: answer \u2018yes\u2019 that you are asking for leave give reasons why you consider your matter should be heard by the Appeal Panel.\n\nPlease write in English language."

      "content": "This is the Step 4. I want you to remember this as part of our conversation. Do you understand? Step 4: Lodge the Notice of Appeal form by the deadline and pay the fee The general rule is that you need to lodge your appeal to NCAT within 28 days from when you are notified of the Tribunal\u2019s original decision or from when the reasons for the decision are first given (either orally or in writing), whichever is later. In residential proceedings, this timeframe is 14 days instead of 28 days. You should also check the legislation which is relevant to your matter as it may state a shorter or longer timeframe for lodging an appeal. If you want to lodge the Notice of Appeal but the deadline has passed, you have to ask the Tribunal for an extension of time. You will need to give a good reason for not lodging the Notice of Appeal within the time allowed. It will be up to the Tribunal to decide whether or not to accept a late Notice of Appeal. You need to post or bring the Notice of Appeal and all attachments to NCAT registry. You cannot lodge it online or by email or fax. You will need to give the Tribunal: The original Notice of Appeal and the attachments Two (2) copies of the Notice of Appeal and attachments for the Appeal Panel One (1) copy of the Notice of Appeal and attachments for each respondent (which NCAT will send to the respondent) \u2013 e.g. if there are two respondents you will need to give the Tribunal the original Notice of Appeal and attachments plus four copies. Keep a copy of everything you lodge with the Tribunal for your own record. A significant fee applies to appeals heard by the Appeal Panel at NCAT. Check the fees and charges schedule to see the fee that applies and how you pay it. Also refer to the fees page for information on eligibility for a reduced fee or fee waiver. After the appeal is lodged correctly and the fee is paid, you will receive a Notice of the date, time and location you need to attend for the listing of your case. This listing is called a callover.\n\nPlease write in English language."
