      "content": "Seattle has a rich sports history, and a few of the most famous athletes to wear the #24 jersey in Seattle sports are:\n\n1. Ken Griffey Jr.: Known as \"The Kid,\" Griffey is arguably the most iconic #24 in Seattle sports history. He played for the Seattle Mariners (MLB) from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2009 to 2010. Griffey is a Hall of Famer and one of the greatest baseball players of all time, known for his smooth swing, incredible defensive skills, and charismatic personality.\n2. Marshawn Lynch: Nicknamed \"Beast Mode,\" Lynch is a legendary running back who played for the Seattle Seahawks (NFL) from 2010 to 2015 and briefly in 2019. Lynch was an instrumental part of the Seahawks' Super Bowl XLVIII victory and is remembered for his powerful running style, bruising runs, and memorable interviews.\n\nWhile these two athletes are the most well-known to wear the #24 jersey in Seattle sports, there may be other athletes who have worn the number in various sports and levels of competition."

In his rookie season (2005), Cano wore #22.\n2. From 2006 to 2013, he switched to #24.\n\nSo, during his tenure with the Yankees, Cano wore both #22 and #24."

      "content": "Ranking the best jersey numbers in Seattle sports history is subjective, and opinions may vary. However, considering the players' impact on their respective sports and their contributions to Seattle sports culture, here's a list of the top 5 jersey numbers:\n\n1. #24: Ken Griffey Jr. (MLB, Seattle Mariners) and Marshawn Lynch (NFL, Seattle Seahawks) are two of the most iconic athletes in Seattle sports history, both wearing #24. Their immense impact on their respective sports and the city of Seattle make this number a top choice.\n2. #34: Felix Hernandez (MLB, Seattle Mariners) was one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball during his prime and spent his entire MLB career with the Mariners. His perfect game, multiple All-Star appearances, and Cy Young Award make #34 a strong contender.\n3. #12: The \"12th Man\" (NFL, Seattle Seahawks) represents the passionate fan base of the Seahawks. The number 12 jersey is retired in their honor, making it an iconic symbol of the team's culture and a unique aspect of Seattle sports history.\n4. #96: Cortez Kennedy (NFL, Seattle Seahawks) was a standout defensive tackle who spent his entire career with the Seahawks. An eight-time Pro Bowler and Hall of Famer, Kennedy's #96 symbolizes the defensive prowess in the history of the franchise.\n5. #20: Gary Payton (NBA, Seattle SuperSonics) was a legendary point guard who played for the SuperSonics from 1990 to 2003. Known for his tenacious defense, Payton was a nine-time NBA All-Star, and his #20 jersey represents the golden era of the SuperSonics.\n\nPlease note that this ranking is not definitive, and individual opinions may vary. Other notable players and jersey numbers could be included depending on personal preferences."
