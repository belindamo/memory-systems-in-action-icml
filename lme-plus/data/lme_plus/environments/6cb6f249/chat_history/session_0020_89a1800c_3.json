Here's more information about each:\n\n**Once Upon a Time in Hollywood**\n\n**Plot:**\n\nSet in 1969 Los Angeles, the film takes place during the height of the counterculture movement. The story follows Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a faded television actor who starred in a popular Western series in the 1950s and 1960s, and his stunt double and close friend, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The two men are trying to find their place in the changing landscape of Hollywood.\n\nThe story is intertwined with the real-life events surrounding the infamous Manson Family murders, which took place in August 1969. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), a rising actress and wife of director Roman Polanski, becomes a neighbor and acquaintance of Rick and Cliff. The film explores the intersection of fiction and reality, as the lives of these characters converge on that fateful night.\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton\n* Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth\n* Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate\n* Al Pacino as Marvin Schwarz, a talent agent\n* Dakota Fanning as Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a Manson follower\n* Damon Herriman as Charles Manson\n* Bruce Dern as George Spahn, the owner of the ranch where the Manson Family lived\n* Timothy Olyphant as James Stacy, a TV actor\n* Kurt Russell as Randy Lloyd, a stunt coordinator\n* Zo\u00eb Bell as Janet, a stuntwoman and Cliff's friend\n\n**The Irishman**\n\n**Plot:**\n\nBased on the book \"I Heard You Paint Houses\" by Charles Brandt, the film tells the true story of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a World War II veteran who becomes a hitman for the Bufalino crime family. Sheeran claims to have been involved in the disappearance and murder of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the infamous leader of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters labor union.\n\nThe film spans several decades, from the 1950s to the 2000s, and explores Sheeran's relationships with Hoffa, mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), and other notable figures of the time. As Sheeran reflects on his life, he recounts his involvement in various crimes and the events leading up to Hoffa's disappearance.\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran\n* Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa\n* Joe Pesci as Russell Bufalino\n* Harvey Keitel as Angelo Bruno, a mob boss\n* Ray Romano as Bill Bufalino, Russell's cousin and a mob lawyer\n* Bobby Cannavale as Felix \"Skinny Razor\" DiTullio, a mobster\n* Anna Paquin as Peggy Sheeran, Frank's daughter\n* Jesse Plemons as Chuckie O'Brien, Hoffa's adopted son\n* Stephen Graham as Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano, a mobster\n\nBoth films boast impressive casts and crews, and they're expected to be major awards contenders. Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman\" has been in the works for years, and Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is his ninth film, marking a new chapter in his filmmaking career."

Robert Richardson, the cinematographer, worked closely with Tarantino to create a visually stunning and nostalgia-tinged film that pays homage to the classic Hollywood of the 1960s.\n\n**Shooting on 35mm film:**\n\nAs you mentioned, the film was shot on 35mm film, which was a deliberate choice to evoke the look and feel of films from the 1960s and 1970s. Tarantino and Richardson wanted to capture the texture, grain, and warmth of film stock from that era. Shooting on 35mm added a layer of authenticity to the production, making it feel more like a film from the 1960s rather than a modern digital production.\n\n**Camera and lenses:**\n\nThe film was shot using a combination of cameras, including the Arriflex 235 and the Panavision Panaflex Millennium XL2. Richardson opted for a range of lenses, including vintage anamorphic lenses, to achieve a distinct look. The anamorphic lenses, in particular, added a unique characteristic to the image, with a subtle flair and distortion that's reminiscent of classic Hollywood films.\n\n**Color palette and lighting:**\n\nThe color palette of the film is a key aspect of its nostalgic feel. Richardson and Tarantino chose a vibrant, sun-kissed color scheme that captures the essence of 1960s Los Angeles.

This approach creates a sense of realism and adds to the film's nostalgic charm.\n\n**Composition and camera movements:**\n\nThe composition of the film is carefully considered, with a focus on framing and blocking that evokes the style of classic Hollywood films. Richardson and Tarantino employed a range of camera movements, including dolly shots, crane shots, and handheld camerawork, to create a dynamic and engaging visual style. The camera often lingers on characters, allowing the audience to absorb the atmosphere and performances.\n\n**Contributing to the film's aesthetic:**\n\nThe cinematography of \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is integral to the film's overall aesthetic. It helps to:\n\n1. **Create a sense of nostalgia:** The 35mm film stock, vintage lenses, and classic camera movements all contribute to a nostalgic feel that transports the audience back to the 1960s.\n2. **Establish the tone:** The cinematography helps set the tone for the film, which is both playful and melancholic. The warm color palette and soft lighting create a sense of optimism, while the camera movements and composition add a sense of energy and tension.\n3. **Capture the essence of 1960s Hollywood:** The film's cinematography is a love letter to the classic Hollywood of the 1960s. It captures the glamour, the excitement, and the sense of possibility that defined the era.\n4. **Enhance the performances:** The cinematography is designed to showcase the performances of the cast, particularly DiCaprio and Pitt. The camera lingers on their faces, capturing every nuance and expression.\n\nOverall, the cinematography of \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a masterclass in evoking a specific time and place.

As someone who's already experienced the films \"The King\" and \"Judy\" at the Tribeca Film Festival, you'll likely appreciate the unique approach Tarantino takes with his film's music.\n\n**Comparison to \"The King\" and \"Judy\":**\n\nWhile all three films are period dramas, they differ significantly in their use of music. \"The King\" and \"Judy\" both employ more traditional, orchestral scores to evoke the grandeur and drama of their respective subjects. In contrast, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" takes a more eclectic approach, blending original compositions with period-specific songs to create a distinct, nostalgic vibe.\n\nTarantino's film is more focused on capturing the spirit of 1960s Los Angeles, whereas \"The King\" and \"Judy\" are more concerned with telling the stories of their titular characters.

In \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\", he's taken this approach to new heights, incorporating a wide range of songs that reflect the eclectic tastes of the 1960s.\n\nTarantino's use of music is often described as \"diegetic,\" meaning the songs are often played within the world of the film itself, rather than simply serving as background score. This approach adds to the film's sense of realism and immersion, making the audience feel like they're experiencing the story firsthand.\n\n**Expectations and Surprises:**\n\nGoing into \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\", you might expect a more traditional score, given the film's period setting and dramatic themes. However, Tarantino's use of music is always unpredictable, and he's likely to surprise you with his choices. Be prepared for a sonic journey that's both nostalgic and innovative, with a mix of familiar and obscure tracks that will transport you back to the 1960s.\n\nAs someone who's already experienced the films \"The King\" and \"Judy\", you'll likely appreciate the unique approach Tarantino takes with his film's music.
