  "content": "Acknowledged, I understand that Step 2 in the NCAT's guide on \"How to appeal an NCAT decision\" is to consider legal representation before lodging an internal appeal. The option to present one's own case to the NCAT or to have a lawyer or non-lawyer agent represent the appellant should be carefully considered. The appellant will usually need to be present to provide instructions to their representative. If the appellant is seeking to be represented by another person, they should ensure that they have the necessary permission from the NCAT to do so. A Notice of Representation by a Legal Practitioner or Agent must be filled out and submitted to the NCAT registry in person or by post, and if a non-lawyer agent is representing the appellant, they must sign the Notice of Representation before submission.",
