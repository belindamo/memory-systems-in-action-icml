For a spring-inspired theme, I'd recommend the following flowers that would complement the lemon blueberry cake perfectly:\n\n1. **Daffodils**: These bright yellow flowers are a classic spring choice and will match the sunny, citrusy flavor of the lemon. They're also a symbol of new beginnings and renewal, making them a perfect fit for a birthday celebration.\n2. **Tulips**: With their cup-shaped blooms in shades of yellow, pink, and white, tulips are a popular spring flower that will add a pop of color to your table setting. They'll also complement the sweetness of the blueberries and the brightness of the lemon.\n3. **Hyacinths**: These fragrant, bell-shaped flowers come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and blue. They're a symbol of spring and new life, and their sweet, floral scent will complement the citrusy aroma of the lemon.\n4. **Ranunculuses**: These small, delicate flowers come in a variety of colors, including yellow, pink, and white. They're a popular choice for spring arrangements and will add a touch of whimsy and romance to your table setting.\n5. **Fresh Greens**: If you want to keep things simple, consider adding some fresh eucalyptus, ferns, or lemon leaves to your arrangement. These will add a fresh, spring-inspired touch to your table setting and complement the citrusy flavors of the cake.\n\nRemember to choose flowers that are in season and combine them with some greenery like eucalyptus or ferns to create a beautiful, lush arrangement. You can also add some decorative elements like candles, vases, or table runners to complete the look.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you create a beautiful and festive table setting for your mom's birthday celebration!",
