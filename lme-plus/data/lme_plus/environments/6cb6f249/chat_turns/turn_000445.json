  "content": "Acknowledged, I understand that Step 4 in the NCAT's guide on \"How to appeal an NCAT decision\" is to lodge the Notice of Appeal form by the deadline and pay the fee. The general timeframe to lodge an appeal is within 28 days from when the appellant is notified of the original decision or when the reasons for the decision are first given, except in residential proceedings where the timeframe is 14 days. The appellant should check the relevant legislation for the specific timeframe applicable to their matter. If the deadline has passed, the appellant can request an extension of time, and it will be up to the Tribunal to decide whether to accept a late Notice of Appeal. The Notice of Appeal and all attachments must be posted or brought to the NCAT registry and include the original Notice of Appeal and attachments, two copies for the Appeal Panel, and one copy for each respondent. The appellant should keep a copy of everything lodged with the Tribunal. A significant fee applies to appeals heard by the Appeal Panel, and the appellant should refer to the fees and charges schedule to determine the fee and how to pay it, as well as eligibility for a reduced fee or fee waiver. After the appeal is lodged correctly and the fee is paid, the appellant will receive a Notice of the date, time, and location for the listing of their case, which is called a callover.",
