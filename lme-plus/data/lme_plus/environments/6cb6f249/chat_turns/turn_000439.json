  "content": "Acknowledged, I understand that Step 1 in the NCAT's guide on \"How to appeal an NCAT decision\" is to check if the NCAT Appeal Panel has the authority to decide the appeal, and that Section 32 of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 specifies which NCAT decisions can be appealed to the Appeal Panel. It is advised to refer to the NCAT Guideline 1 - Internal Appeals and the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 for more information. If it is not possible to appeal to the NCAT Appeal Panel, the option to appeal to the NSW Supreme Court may be available, but it is recommended to seek legal advice before pursuing this option.",
