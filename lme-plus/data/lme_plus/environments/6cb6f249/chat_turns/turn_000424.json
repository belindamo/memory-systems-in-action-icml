Here are some tips to help you prioritize reading over other activities:\n\n1. **Schedule it in**: Treat reading as a non-negotiable part of your daily routine, just like yoga and meditation. Allocate a specific time slot for reading, e.g., 30 minutes before breakfast or right after meditation. Write it down in your calendar or planner to make it official.\n2. **Make it a habit loop**: Attach reading to an existing habit, like right after meditation or while enjoying your morning coffee. This creates a mental association, making it easier to stick to your reading routine.\n3. **Start small**: If you're struggling to find time, begin with a manageable goal, like 10-15 minutes of reading per day. As you build the habit, you can gradually increase the duration.\n4. **Choose a convenient format**: If you're short on time, consider audiobooks or e-books, which can be easily consumed during your daily commute, while exercising, or during breaks.\n5. **Create a reading nook**: Designate a cozy, distraction-free space for reading. This will help you associate that area with relaxation and focus.\n6. **Remove distractions**: Identify common distractions (e.g., social media, email, or phone notifications) and remove them while you read. Use apps like Freedom, SelfControl, or website blockers to help you stay focused.\n7. **Track progress**: Keep a reading log or use an app like Goodreads to track your progress. Seeing your accomplishments will motivate you to continue.\n8. **Prioritize your why**: Remind yourself why reading is important to you. Is it for personal growth, relaxation, or entertainment? Connecting with your purpose will help you stay committed.\n9. **Make it enjoyable**: Choose books that genuinely interest you. If you're not enjoying a book, it's okay to put it down and pick up something else.\n10. **Be kind to yourself**: Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Get back on track as soon as possible, and remember that developing a habit takes time.\n\nConsidering your existing morning routine, you could try inserting reading into the following slots:\n\n* Immediately after meditation, before showering and getting dressed\n* While enjoying your morning coffee or tea\n* During your lunch break at work (if you have a quiet, distraction-free space)\n\nExperiment with different time slots and formats to find what works best for you. Good luck, and happy reading!",
