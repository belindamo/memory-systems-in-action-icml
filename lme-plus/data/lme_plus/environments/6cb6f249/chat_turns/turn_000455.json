  "content": "The Blueberry Lemon Glaze (Option 2) is a fantastic choice for your mom's birthday cake. The addition of blueberry puree or jam will not only give the glaze a beautiful purple color but also add a rich, fruity flavor that will complement the lemon and blueberry flavors in the cake perfectly.\n\nRemember to adjust the consistency and flavor of the glaze to your taste by adding more powdered sugar, lemon juice, or blueberry puree/jam as needed. You can also taste the glaze as you go and make adjustments until you're happy with the flavor.\n\nI'm thrilled that I could help, and I'm sure your mom will love the cake and the special touch of the homemade glaze. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further assistance.\n\nHere's to a wonderful birthday celebration for your mom!",
