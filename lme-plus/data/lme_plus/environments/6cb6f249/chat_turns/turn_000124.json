  "content": "I've been thinking about my friend Mike's BBQ party, and I realized I've been experimenting with different hot sauces at home. Speaking of Mike's party, I remember eating a lot of burgers that day - I think it was five burgers in total. Anyway, back to hot sauces, I recently bought a bottle from a local hot sauce company, and it's become my go-to. Do you have any recommendations for using hot sauce in BBQ sauces or marinades?",
