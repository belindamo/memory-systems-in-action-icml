I like the idea of being able to track my habits and journaling practice on my phone, and the reminders will definitely help me stay on track. I'll also consider using a physical planner or journal as a backup, just in case I need a break from screens or want to add some creativity to my tracking. Do you have any tips on how to set up my habit tracker effectively?",
