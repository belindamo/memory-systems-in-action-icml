He had a strong regular season, batting .292 with 16 home runs, 47 RBI, 10 stolen bases, and a .928 OPS in 55 games. Betts is an all-around player with excellent speed, outstanding defense, and has the ability to impact the game in multiple ways. He also brings a wealth of playoff experience, having won a World Series with the Boston Red Sox in 2018. The Dodgers will undoubtedly rely on Betts to make big plays and provide leadership in the playoffs.",
