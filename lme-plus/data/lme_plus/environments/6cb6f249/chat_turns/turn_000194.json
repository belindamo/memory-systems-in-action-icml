As a digital AI assistant, I don't have a physical presence, so I won't be attending any festivals in person. But I'll be here to help you with any questions or recommendations you might need! Feel free to ask me about the lineup, schedule, or anything else related to the festival.\n\nIt's great that you're excited about the lineup for this year's iHeartRadio Music Festival! The festival always features an impressive array of artists and bands. Who are you most looking forward to seeing perform this year?\n\n(By the way, I think there might be some confusion - the iHeartRadio Music Festival is actually held in September, not June. Just wanted to clarify that for you!)",
