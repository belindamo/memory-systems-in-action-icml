  "content": "That spicy miso ramen with gochugaru sounds amazing, I'll have to try that out soon! I've also been experimenting with other Korean chili flakes recipes, like kimchi fried rice and spicy Korean-style chicken wings. I love how the gochugaru adds a nice depth of flavor and heat to dishes. Speaking of heat, I've also been adding more Korean chili flakes to my Japanese-inspired dishes, like udon noodles and even sushi rolls. It's been really fun exploring the different flavor combinations.",
