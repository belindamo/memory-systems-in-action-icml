The Notice of Appeal form should include a copy of the NCAT orders, any written reasons provided by the Tribunal, details of the decision being appealed against, contact details of the appellant and their representative (if any), contact details of all respondents and their representatives (if any), the orders the appellant wants the Appeal Panel to change, an outline of why the Tribunal's decision was wrong, the orders the appellant suggests the Appeal Panel should make instead, and a copy of any other relevant documents. The Notice of Appeal form will also require the appellant to indicate whether they are asking for leave to appeal. If the appellant is unsure or does not have legal representation, they should answer 'yes' and provide reasons why their matter should be heard by the Appeal Panel.",
