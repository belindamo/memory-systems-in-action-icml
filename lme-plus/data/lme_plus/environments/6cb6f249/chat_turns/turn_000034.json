  "content": "Exploring data by aggregating can be compared to organizing a collection of toys by type and then counting how many of each type you have. Just like how categorizing toys makes it easier to understand what you have, aggregating data into groups can help you see patterns and make sense of large amounts of information. By summarizing data for each group, you can quickly identify trends and insights that may not have been noticeable if you looked at the data as a whole. So, just as categorizing toys helps you make sense of your toy collection, aggregating data helps you make sense of your marketing data.",
