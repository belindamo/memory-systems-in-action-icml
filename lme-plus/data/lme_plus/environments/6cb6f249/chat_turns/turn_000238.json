The story follows Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a faded television actor who starred in a popular Western series in the 1950s and 1960s, and his stunt double and close friend, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The two men are trying to find their place in the changing landscape of Hollywood.\n\nThe story is intertwined with the real-life events surrounding the infamous Manson Family murders, which took place in August 1969. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), a rising actress and wife of director Roman Polanski, becomes a neighbor and acquaintance of Rick and Cliff.
