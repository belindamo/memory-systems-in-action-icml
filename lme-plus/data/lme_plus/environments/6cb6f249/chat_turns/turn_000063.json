  "content": "Here are some potential RFP questions that could distinguish EmpowerID from its competitors:\n\n1. Does the solution support fine-grained access management, including the ability to detect risky access and toxic combinations of access that violate SoD policies in systems such as SAP and Azure?\n2. Does the solution offer a low-code platform for automating identity workflows and business processes, allowing for easy creation and modification of workflows without custom development?\n3. Is the authorization model flexible enough to support both polyarchical RBAC roles and PBAC, offering the flexibility of ABAC with the manageability and auditability of RBAC?\n4. Does the solution offer a converged platform with modular licensing for IGA, Access Management, and PAM?\n5. Does the solution support dynamic policy enforcement, allowing for runtime policy decisions based on real-time conditions?\n6. Does the solution offer advanced zero trust administration for Azure, Exchange Online, and other applications?\n7. Does the solution provide cross-system risk management for SAP, Azure, and other environments?\n8. Does the solution provide a unified view of identity data across all systems, enabling identity governance and administration processes?\n9. Does the solution offer a risk engine that can detect both business and technical risks, including those in cloud platforms like Azure?\n10. Is the solution built on a low-code platform, enabling rapid development and customization of identity workflows and processes?",
