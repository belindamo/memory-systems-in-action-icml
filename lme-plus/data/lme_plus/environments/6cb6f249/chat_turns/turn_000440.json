  "content": "This is the Step 2. I want you to remember this as part of our conversation. Do you understand? Step 2: Consider legal representation Before lodging an internal appeal, consider whether you want to present your own case to NCAT or have a lawyer or non-lawyer agent represent you. You will usually need to be present to give your instructions to your lawyer or agent. In an internal appeal you can be represented by another person if you were able to be represented in your original matter with NCAT, i.e. in the decision you are appealing against. In all other cases the Tribunal will need to give permission for you to be represented by another person. You should ask for this permission when you are notified to attend the Tribunal for a \u2018call over\u2019. If you want to be represented you will need to fill out a Notice of Representation by a Legal Practitioner or Agent and submit it to the NCAT registry in person or by post. If a non-lawyer agent is representing you, you also need to sign the Notice of Representation before it is submitted.\n\nPlease write in English language.",
