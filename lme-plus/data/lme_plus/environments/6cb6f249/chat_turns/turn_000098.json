  "content": "That udon noodle recipe looks delicious, thanks for sharing! I think what I love most about chicken tikka masala is the combination of the rich, creamy sauce and the tender, flavorful chicken. I've been experimenting with different spices and ingredients to give it my own twist, and I recently added some cumin and coriander to the marinade which gave it a nice depth of flavor. Do you have any other Japanese recipes that incorporate Korean chili flakes, since I've been experimenting with those lately?",
