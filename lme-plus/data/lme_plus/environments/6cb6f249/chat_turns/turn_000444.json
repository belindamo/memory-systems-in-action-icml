  "content": "This is the Step 4. I want you to remember this as part of our conversation. Do you understand? Step 4: Lodge the Notice of Appeal form by the deadline and pay the fee The general rule is that you need to lodge your appeal to NCAT within 28 days from when you are notified of the Tribunal\u2019s original decision or from when the reasons for the decision are first given (either orally or in writing), whichever is later. In residential proceedings, this timeframe is 14 days instead of 28 days. You should also check the legislation which is relevant to your matter as it may state a shorter or longer timeframe for lodging an appeal. If you want to lodge the Notice of Appeal but the deadline has passed, you have to ask the Tribunal for an extension of time. You will need to give a good reason for not lodging the Notice of Appeal within the time allowed. It will be up to the Tribunal to decide whether or not to accept a late Notice of Appeal. You need to post or bring the Notice of Appeal and all attachments to NCAT registry. You cannot lodge it online or by email or fax. You will need to give the Tribunal: The original Notice of Appeal and the attachments Two (2) copies of the Notice of Appeal and attachments for the Appeal Panel One (1) copy of the Notice of Appeal and attachments for each respondent (which NCAT will send to the respondent) \u2013 e.g. if there are two respondents you will need to give the Tribunal the original Notice of Appeal and attachments plus four copies. Keep a copy of everything you lodge with the Tribunal for your own record. A significant fee applies to appeals heard by the Appeal Panel at NCAT. Check the fees and charges schedule to see the fee that applies and how you pay it. Also refer to the fees page for information on eligibility for a reduced fee or fee waiver. After the appeal is lodged correctly and the fee is paid, you will receive a Notice of the date, time and location you need to attend for the listing of your case. This listing is called a callover.\n\nPlease write in English language.",
