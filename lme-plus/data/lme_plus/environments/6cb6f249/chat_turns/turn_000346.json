All-season tires will still provide a good balance of traction and handling on San Francisco's wet roads, and with your careful driving habits, you'll be well-equipped to handle the conditions.\n\nRemember to stay alert, keep a safe distance from other vehicles, and be patient with the traffic. It's also a good idea to:\n\n1. **Keep your windshield and windows clean:** Make sure your windshield wipers are in good condition, and keep your windshield and windows clean to maintain good visibility.\n2. **Use low gear:** If you're driving a manual transmission vehicle, use low gear when driving uphill or on steep grades to maintain control and reduce wheel spin.\n3. **Avoid sudden movements:** Sudden turns, braking, or acceleration can increase the risk of hydroplaning or losing traction. Make smooth, gradual inputs on the steering wheel and pedals.\n4. **Take regular breaks:** Fatigue can be a factor in wet weather driving. Take regular breaks to rest, stretch, and get some fresh air.\n\nBy being mindful of the road conditions and driving defensively, you'll be well-prepared to handle San Francisco's wet roads. Enjoy your trip and take in the beautiful scenery!\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Safe travels!",
