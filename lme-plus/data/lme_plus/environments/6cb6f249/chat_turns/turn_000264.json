Here's how it works and how you can use the information to make changes:\n\n**How Moment tracks apps:**\n\nMoment tracks which apps you use, how often, and for how long. It does this by monitoring your device's screen time and app usage in the background. When you open an app, Moment records the time you spend in that app, and when you switch to another app or close the app, it logs the time spent. This data is then used to provide insights into your app usage.\n\n**What kind of app tracking data does Moment provide?**\n\nMoment provides a wealth of data about your app usage, including:\n\n1. **App usage time:** The total time you spend in each app, including the number of minutes and hours.\n2. **App frequency:** How often you open each app, including the number of times you open it per day.\n3. **App duration:** The average time you spend in each app per session.\n4. **Time of day:** When you typically use each app, including morning, afternoon, or evening.\n5. **Day of the week:** Which days of the week you're most likely to use each app.\n6. **Top apps:** A list of your most-used apps, ranked by time spent or frequency.\n7. **App categories:** Moment categorizes your apps into groups like social media, games, productivity, and more, helping you understand how you spend your time.\n\n**How to use Moment's app tracking data to make changes:**\n\nNow that you have all this data, how can you use it to make changes to your phone habits? Here are some tips:\n\n1. **Identify time-wasting apps:** Look for apps that take up a disproportionate amount of your time. Consider deleting or limiting your use of these apps.\n2. **Set app-specific goals:** Set daily time limits for specific apps, like social media or games, to help you stay within your goals.\n3. **Schedule app usage:** Use Moment's scheduling feature to limit your app usage to specific times of the day or week.\n4. **Replace bad habits:** Identify apps that are replacing more important activities, like reading or exercise, and make a plan to replace them with healthier habits.\n5. **Find alternative apps:** If you find yourself spending too much time in a particular app, look for alternative apps that can help you achieve the same goal in less time.\n6. **Set screen-free times:** Use Moment's screen-free mode to set times when you don't want to use your phone, like during meals or before bed.\n7. **Reflect and adjust:** Regularly review your app tracking data to reflect on your habits and make adjustments as needed.\n\nBy using Moment's app tracking feature, you'll gain a better understanding of your phone habits and be able to make informed decisions about how you spend your time.
