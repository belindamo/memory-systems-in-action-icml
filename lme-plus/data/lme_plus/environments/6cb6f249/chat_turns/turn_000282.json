  "content": "Yes, media and popular culture can play an important role in perpetuating these outdated views on relationships. However, we can also use media and popular culture to challenge and change these views. We can demand to see more diversity in representation, and push back against harmful stereotypes when we see them. When we hold media and popular culture accountable for perpetuating these views, we can create a more inclusive and accepting society where everyone's relationship is respected and celebrated. Together, we can work towards creating a culture that values mutual respect and equality in all types of relationships.",
