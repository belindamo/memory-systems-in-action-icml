  "content": "Neapolitan-Style Pizza Dough is a classic choice, and using type \"00\" flour will definitely give you a unique texture and flavor.\n\nWhen it comes to type \"00\" flour, there are a few popular brands that are highly regarded by pizza enthusiasts. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Caputo**: This Italian brand is a popular choice among Neapolitan pizzaiolos (pizza makers). Caputo's \"00\" flour is finely milled and has a low protein content, which makes it ideal for creating a delicate, tender crust.\n2. **De Cecco**: Another Italian brand, De Cecco's \"00\" flour is known for its high-quality wheat and precise milling process. It's a bit more expensive than Caputo, but it's worth it for the exceptional results.\n3. **Antimo Caputo's \"00\" Chef's Flour**: This is a US-based brand that imports Italian wheat and mills it in the US. It's a popular choice among artisanal bakers and pizzaiolos, and it's known for its consistent quality.\n4. **All Trumps \"00\" Flour**: This is a US-based brand that offers a high-quality \"00\" flour at a slightly lower price point than the Italian brands. It's still a great choice for making Neapolitan-style pizza.\n\nYou can find these brands at most specialty food stores, Italian markets, or online retailers like Amazon. If you can't find type \"00\" flour in stores, you can also try substituting it with all-purpose flour that has a low protein content (around 10-11%). However, keep in mind that the results might not be exactly the same.\n\nWhen working with type \"00\" flour, remember to:\n\n* Use a gentle mixing and kneading technique to avoid developing the gluten too much.\n* Keep the dough at room temperature (around 75\u00b0F to 78\u00b0F) during fermentation.\n* Monitor the dough's hydration level, as type \"00\" flour can be more prone to drying out.\n\nHave fun experimenting with your Neapolitan-Style Pizza Dough, and I hope you enjoy the results!",
