  "content": "Yes, that's correct. Facebook faced a lot of scrutiny and criticism after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where personal data of millions of Facebook users were harvested without their consent. Since then, many people have become concerned about Facebook's handling of user data and privacy. There have been several high-profile data breaches, including the one where attackers exploited vulnerabilities to steal access tokens and gain unauthorized access to millions of users' accounts. These incidents raised significant concerns about Facebook's commitment to safeguarding user data.\n\nHowever, Facebook has since taken numerous steps to address these issues, including investing heavily in security and privacy, making product changes, and implementing stricter data controls. Facebook has implemented stricter data controls, allowing users greater control over the personal information they provide to the site. The company has also limited access to user data for third-party apps, conducted third-party audits of its data protection processes, and hired more staff to monitor user data and ensure its adequate protection. Despite these efforts, Facebook has a continuing battle to rebuild trust with users regarding the handling of their personal information.",
