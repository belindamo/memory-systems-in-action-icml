You mentioned that our guided tour guide did a great job explaining the art pieces, and I agree, she was very knowledgeable. She also told us about the abstract expressionist works, and I was impressed by the museum's collection. Speaking of the guided tour, I recall that our guide mentioned an interesting fact about the museum's architecture, but I forgot what it was. Can you tell me more about the building itself?",
