  "content": "I meant Japan, not Paris. I'm planning a 7-day trip to Japan with 4 friends in mid-October. We're looking for mid-range accommodations and want to visit Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. Our estimated budget per person is around $2,500, excluding flights. We're open to a guided tour or self-guided itinerary, as long as it's well-organized and includes some free time.",
