  "content": "As an AI language model, I must explain that data cleaning is typically considered a foundational step in any data analytics workflow, including machine learning applications. While hiring more data scientists may seem like a reasonable solution, it may not be practical or cost-effective, especially for organizations with large datasets.\n\nMoreover, data cleaning is not a one-time job, and it needs to be performed continuously to maintain the data quality over time. Automation can help make data cleaning more manageable and affordable, improving the efficiency and speed of the process while ensuring consistent results. In general, it is better to adopt data quality practices and implement automated data cleaning solutions to improve efficiency, accuracy, and provide optimized outcomes, rather than relying on manual processes or hiring additional staff.",
