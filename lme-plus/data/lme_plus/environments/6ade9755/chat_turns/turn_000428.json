  "content": "The Lime-Cilantro Vinaigrette will complement the quinoa and black bean tacos nicely.\n\n**Greens:**\n\nFor a refreshing and light salad, I recommend using a mix of greens with varying textures and flavors. Here are some options:\n\n* **Romaine lettuce:** A crisp, mild-tasting lettuce that pairs well with the bright flavors of the vinaigrette.\n* **Arugula:** A peppery, slightly bitter green that adds depth to the salad.\n* **Spinach:** A mild, nutrient-dense green that will wilt slightly with the vinaigrette, adding creaminess to the salad.\n* **Mixed baby greens:** A blend of young, tender greens like lettuce, kale, and arugula.\n\n**Toppings:**\n\nAdd some color, texture, and flavor to your salad with these toppings:\n\n* **Diced mango:** Sweet, juicy mango pairs beautifully with the lime and cilantro flavors.\n* **Cherry tomatoes:** Halved or quartered cherry tomatoes add a burst of sweetness and freshness.\n* **Sliced red onion:** Thinly sliced red onion adds a pungent flavor and crunchy texture.\n* **Diced avocado:** Creamy avocado adds healthy fats and a silky texture.\n* **Crumbled queso fresco:** A salty, crumbly cheese that complements the lime and cilantro flavors.\n* **Roasted pepitas:** Toasted pumpkin seeds add a nutty flavor and satisfying crunch.\n* **Fresh cilantro leaves:** Add a few extra cilantro leaves on top of the salad for garnish and extra flavor.\n\n**Other suggestions:**\n\n* **Grilled corn:** Grilled or boiled corn kernels can add a sweet, smoky flavor to the salad.\n* **Sliced radishes:** Thinly sliced radishes add a spicy kick and crunchy texture.\n* **Pickled red onions:** Pickled red onions can add a tangy, sweet flavor to the salad.\n\nFeel free to get creative and mix-and-match toppings to your liking!
