  "content": "I'm thinking of having a more relaxed, outdoor ceremony in the garden, with a mix of seated and standing guests. I want it to feel very intimate and personal, with a focus on our love and commitment to each other. For the tented reception, I'm thinking of a more formal, sit-down dinner with a few speeches and toasts. But I also want to make sure there's time for dancing and mingling later in the evening.\n\nI love the idea of incorporating some personal touches and meaningful elements into the ceremony and reception. For example, I'm thinking of using some of the same flowers and greenery from my cousin's wedding, as a nod to our family and our shared experiences. I'm also considering using some special music or readings that hold meaning for us as a couple.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any other ideas or suggestions you can offer to help make our wedding day feel even more special and meaningful?",
