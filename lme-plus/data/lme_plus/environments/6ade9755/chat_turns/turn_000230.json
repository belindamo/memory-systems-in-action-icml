  "content": "For creating a simple bar chart and line graph, I'd recommend using **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn**. Both are excellent choices, but I'll give you a brief comparison to help you decide:\n\n**Matplotlib**:\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Easy to use, even for beginners\n\t+ Highly customizable\n\t+ Fast and efficient\n\t+ Can create a wide range of plots, including bar charts and line graphs\n* Cons:\n\t+ Steeper learning curve for advanced features\n\t+ Default styles might not be as visually appealing as Seaborn\n\n**Seaborn**:\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Built on top of Matplotlib, so you can use Matplotlib's features if needed\n\t+ Provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics\n\t+ Default styles are visually appealing and easy to customize\n\t+ Integrates well with Pandas DataFrames\n* Cons:\n\t+ Might be overkill for very simple plots\n\t+ Less flexible than Matplotlib for highly customized plots\n\nFor your use case, I think **Seaborn** would be an excellent choice. It's easy to use, and its default styles will give your plots a professional look. Since you're comfortable with Python, you can quickly create a bar chart and line graph using Seaborn's high-level functions.\n\nHere's a simple example to get you started:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load your CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')\n\n# Create a bar chart\nsns.barplot(x='category', y='sales', data=df)\nplt.title('Sales by Category')\nplt.xlabel('Category')\nplt.ylabel('Sales')\nplt.show()\n\n# Create a line graph\nsns.lineplot(x='date', y='sales', data=df)\nplt.title('Sales Over Time')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Sales')\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code assumes your CSV file has columns named `category`, `date`, and `sales`. You can customize the plots as needed using Seaborn's various options.\n\nIf you prefer to use Matplotlib, you can use its `bar` and `plot` functions to create the same plots. The code would be slightly different, but still easy to use.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!",
