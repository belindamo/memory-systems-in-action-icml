Some of the significant steps taken by Facebook include:\n\n1. AI Technologies: Facebook utilizes its AI algorithms to identify and flag potential fake news. It has recently introduced a technology called 'Deep Text,' which can understand the context of a post and identify the potentially fraudulent content.\n\n2. Fact-Checking Partnerships: Facebook has partnered with independent fact-checking organizations to review and rate the accuracy of news articles. The fact-checker can rate a piece of content as 'true,' 'false,' or 'partially true/false.' If any article is rated false, it gets a warning label.\n\n3. Related Articles: Facebook has started providing related articles from verified sources that offer alternative views on the same topic.\n\n4. Reducing Financial Incentives: Facebook has implemented measures to limit the reach of click-bait sites and promote journalism of high standard.\n\n5. Community feedback: Facebook encourages community feedback to report misleading content or false information, which is then reviewed by its fact-checking partners or AI systems.\n\n6. Machine Learning: Facebook developed machine learning models to demote false news stories so they are shown to fewer people in the news feeds.\n\nThese measures are continuously evolving and growing, and Facebook is committed to cracking down on the spread of false information on its platform.",
