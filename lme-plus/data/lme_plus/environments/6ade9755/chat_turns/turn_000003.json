  "content": "You're on the right track by scaling back on watering. Cilantro prefers a slightly drier soil, so every other day should be a good starting point.\n\nEyeballing the water amount can be tricky, but a general rule of thumb is to water until you see a slight trickle coming out of the drainage holes. This ensures the soil is moist but not waterlogged.\n\nSince your kitchen windowsill gets plenty of indirect sunlight, that's not likely the issue. And with a comfortable soil temperature, that's also not the culprit.\n\nAs for fertilizing, it's a great idea! Herbs like cilantro are heavy feeders and can benefit from regular fertilization. However, you're correct that a general-purpose fertilizer might not be the best choice. Here's why:\n\n* General-purpose fertilizers are often formulated for flowers, shrubs, or vegetables, which have different nutrient requirements than herbs.\n* Herbs, especially cilantro, have a shorter growth cycle and need a more balanced fertilizer that promotes leaf growth and flavor.\n\nConsider using a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer specifically formulated for herbs (usually 10-10-10 NPK). You can also look for fertilizers that are labeled as \"high-phosphorus\" or \"blooming\" formulas, as these can promote healthy leaf growth.\n\nWhen fertilizing, start with a weak solution (half the recommended strength) and apply it once a week. You can also consider using a fertilizer specifically designed for herbs, which might contain additional micronutrients that promote flavor and aroma.\n\nKeep in mind that cilantro is a fast-growing crop, and it might be ready to harvest in as little as 2-3 weeks. Make sure to pinch off flower buds as they appear to encourage leaf growth and prevent the plant from going to seed.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. I'm rooting for your cilantro (and Slinky, of course!)",
