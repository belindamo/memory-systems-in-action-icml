However, if you are an adventurous traveler and enjoy outdoor activities, you may want to consider trying rafting on the Coruh River or trekking through the Zigana Mountains. If you prefer to relax and enjoy the scenery, then visiting Uzungol Lake, Ayder Plateau or Firtina Valley might be more suitable. Exploring the Sumela Monastery could be a mix of both adventure and relaxation since it involves a bit of hiking and offers scenic views. Ultimately, it's best to do some research and choose the activities that resonate most with you.",
