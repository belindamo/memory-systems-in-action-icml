  "content": "The cilantro is actually doing a bit better now. I've noticed that it's growing a bit taller and the leaves seem more vibrant. I think scaling back on watering was a good move, and the fertilizer is probably helping too. I'm still a bit concerned that it's not growing as fast as my basil and mint, but I'm hoping it'll catch up soon. Do you think I should be pruning my cilantro to encourage bushier growth?",
