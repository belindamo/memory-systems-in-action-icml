  "content": "Most species of sharks are solitary hunters and do not hunt in groups. However, there are some notable exceptions. For example, some species of hammerhead sharks and reef sharks have been observed hunting in groups to coordinate their attacks and increase their chances of success. Similarly, in certain areas of the world, tiger sharks have been observed patrolling the shallow waters near islands during the breeding season, where groups of pregnant female turtles swim in the area. So, in short, while most species of sharks hunt solo, some do hunt collaboratively in certain circumstances.",
