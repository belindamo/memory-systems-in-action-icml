  "content": "Adding nuts or seeds is a fantastic way to add texture and flavor to your roasted veggie quinoa salad. Here are some suggestions that would pair well with sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts:\n\n1. **Pumpkin seeds**: Pumpkin seeds have a nutty flavor that complements the sweetness of sweet potatoes and the earthiness of Brussels sprouts. They're also a great source of protein and magnesium.\n2. **Walnuts**: Walnuts have a rich, earthy flavor that pairs well with the roasted vegetables. They're also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants.\n3. **Pecans**: Pecans have a buttery, nutty flavor that works well with the sweetness of sweet potatoes. They're also a good source of antioxidants and healthy fats.\n4. **Almonds**: Sliced or slivered almonds can add a nice crunch to the salad. They're a good source of vitamin E, magnesium, and healthy fats.\n5. **Cashews**: Cashews have a creamy, nutty flavor that pairs well with the roasted vegetables. They're also a good source of magnesium, copper, and zinc.\n6. **Pistachios**: Pistachios have a nutty, slightly sweet flavor that works well with the sweetness of sweet potatoes. They're also a good source of vitamin B6, magnesium, and potassium.\n7. **Sunflower seeds**: Sunflower seeds have a nutty flavor and a satisfying crunch. They're a good source of vitamin E, selenium, and magnesium.\n8. **Chia seeds**: Chia seeds have a nutty flavor and a high nutritional profile, including omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and fiber. They can add a nice texture to the salad.\n\nWhen choosing nuts or seeds, consider the flavor profile you're aiming for:\n\n* If you want a more earthy flavor, opt for pumpkin seeds, walnuts, or pecans.\n* If you want a nuttier flavor, choose almonds, cashews, or pistachios.\n* If you want a crunchy texture, opt for sunflower seeds or chia seeds.\n\nRemember to toast the nuts or seeds lightly to bring out their flavors and textures. Simply spread them on a baking sheet and roast in a 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) oven for 5-10 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned.",
