However, it won't hurt to give them a boost, especially if you want to encourage more growth and flavor.\n\nHere's a brief rundown on each:\n\n* **Basil:** Basil loves nutrients, especially nitrogen, to promote leaf growth and flavor. If you're harvesting your basil regularly, it might benefit from a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10 NPK) to replace the nutrients you're removing. You can fertilize your basil every 1-2 weeks, but start with a weak solution (half the recommended strength) to avoid burning the roots.\n* **Mint:** Mint is a hardy, fast-growing herb that can thrive in a variety of conditions. While it might not need fertilization as urgently as basil, a balanced fertilizer can still promote healthy growth and flavor. You can fertilize your mint every 2-3 weeks, but be cautious not to overfertilize, as this can lead to weak growth and a decrease in flavor.\n\nWhen fertilizing your basil and mint, make sure to follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging and start with a weak solution. You can always increase the strength if needed, but it's harder to correct overfertilization.\n\nIf you decide to fertilize your basil and mint, you can use the same herb-specific fertilizer you'll be using for your cilantro. Just remember to adjust the frequency and strength based on each plant's needs.\n\nKeep in mind that fertilization is just one aspect of plant care. Make sure to also provide your herbs with adequate light, water, and pruning to encourage healthy growth and prevent pests.\n\nHow's Slinky, your snake plant, doing with the neem oil treatment?
