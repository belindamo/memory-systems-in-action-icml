  "content": "I've been watering my cilantro every day, but I'll try scaling back to every other day. I'm not sure how much water I'm giving it each time, I just kind of eyeball it. And yeah, the soil feels consistently moist, but not waterlogged. My kitchen windowsill gets plenty of indirect sunlight, so I don't think that's the issue. The soil temperature should be okay, my kitchen is usually around 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C). Do you think I should fertilize my cilantro? I've been using a general-purpose fertilizer on my other plants, but I'm not sure if that's suitable for herbs.",
