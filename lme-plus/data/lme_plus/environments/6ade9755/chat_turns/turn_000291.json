Here's how:\n\n1. Connect the USB-C dongle with the SD card inserted to your Mac.\n2. Once the dongle is connected, you should see it appear on your desktop or in the Finder under the \"Devices\" section.\n3. Double-click on the SD card to open it and view its contents. You can now copy, move, delete, or otherwise manage the files on the SD card just like you would with any other external drive.\n\nNote: If you're having trouble accessing the SD card, make sure that it is properly inserted into the dongle and that the dongle is properly connected to your Mac. Also, if the SD card is locked, you may need to unlock it before you can access its contents.",
