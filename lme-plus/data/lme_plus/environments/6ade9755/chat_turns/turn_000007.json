It's great to hear that the neem oil treatment is working, and the added step of wiping down the leaves with a damp cloth is a wonderful way to keep them clean and prevent re-infestation.\n\nNeem oil is a gentle, natural pesticide that can take some time to fully eliminate pests, so be patient and persistent. It's essential to continue the treatment as directed and monitor Slinky's progress closely.\n\nThe fact that you've noticed a significant decrease in the number of white bugs is a great sign, and with continued care, you should be able to get rid of them completely.
