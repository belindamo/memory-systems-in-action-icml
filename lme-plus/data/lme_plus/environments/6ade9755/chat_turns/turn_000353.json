  "content": "Yes, shark teeth can vary significantly between species based on their feeding habits and other factors. For example, some species of sharks have sharp, serrated teeth for tearing through tough prey (like the great white shark), while others have flattened teeth adapted for crushing shells and other hard prey (like the nurse shark). Some species even have multiple rows of teeth that rotate forward as the front row wears down. Depending on the species, shark teeth can range in size and shape, and can be straight, curved, pointed, or even resemble a saw.",
