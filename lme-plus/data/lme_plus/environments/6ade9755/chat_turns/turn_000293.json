Press the \"Control + F3\" keys on your keyboard. This will show the desktop and minimize all open windows.\n2. To restore your open windows, simply click on one of the minimized windows or press the \"Control + F3\" keys again.\n\nNote: If you're using a third-party keyboard that includes an \"F11\" key, you can use that key to show the desktop as you would on a Windows or Linux computer. The keyboard shortcut for showing the desktop may also vary depending on your Mac's settings and the type of keyboard you're using.",
