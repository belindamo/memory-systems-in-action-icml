  "content": "You are correct - while the \"Women in National Security\" initiative is a great example of promoting gender diversity, it is important to also include racial and ethnic diversity when promoting diversity and inclusion. This is because individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds bring unique perspectives and experiences that can enrich the idea generation process and lead to better outcomes.\n\nIn fact, many diversity and inclusion initiatives do focus on promoting both gender and racial/ethnic diversity. For example, organizations may partner with community groups and networks to recruit candidates from diverse backgrounds or provide training and mentorship programs to support the professional development of diverse employees.\n\nIn short, promoting diversity and inclusion goes beyond just gender, and it is important to incorporate diverse perspectives from all backgrounds to create more innovative and equitable outcomes.",
