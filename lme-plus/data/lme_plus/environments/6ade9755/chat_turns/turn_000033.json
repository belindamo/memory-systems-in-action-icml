  "content": "There was a mixed reaction to the Eiffel Tower when it was first unveiled. Some people were impressed by the engineering feat and the iconic design of the tower, while others were critical of its appearance and the fact that it dominated the Paris skyline. Some French artists and intellectuals even signed a petition in protest of the tower, calling it a \"giant black smokestack\" that was a blight on the city's beauty. However, its popularity soon grew and it became a symbol of Paris and France around the world. Today, it is one of the most visited landmarks in the world.",
