The Modern Art Museum's building is indeed a work of art in itself, and your guide likely shared some fascinating facts about its design and history.\n\n**The Museum's Architecture:**\n\nThe Modern Art Museum's building was designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando, who is known for his minimalist and geometric style. The museum's design is a perfect blend of functionality, sustainability, and aesthetic appeal.\n\nHere are some interesting facts about the building:\n\n1. **Natural Light:** The museum's design incorporates an abundance of natural light, with large windows and skylights that illuminate the galleries and public spaces. This allows visitors to experience the art in a more immersive and contemplative environment.\n2. **Concrete and Steel:** The building's structure is composed of exposed concrete and steel, which creates a sense of ruggedness and industrial chic. The raw materials also provide a striking contrast to the refined, high-tech art on display.\n3. **Water Feature:** The museum's atrium features a large, rectangular water feature that adds a sense of serenity and calm to the space. The water's gentle flow also creates a soothing background noise that complements the art viewing experience.\n4. **Sustainable Design:** The building was designed with sustainability in mind, featuring a green roof, rainwater harvesting, and energy-efficient systems. The museum's commitment to environmental responsibility reflects its dedication to preserving art for future generations.\n5. **Expansion and Renovation:** The museum has undergone several expansions and renovations since its original construction in the 1980s. The most recent expansion, completed in 2014, added over 30,000 square feet of gallery space and improved the overall visitor experience.\n\nYour guide might have mentioned one or more of these facts during the tour. If you're curious about the museum's architecture, I recommend exploring their website or attending a architecture-focused tour to learn more.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the museum's building or would you like more recommendations for exploring its architecture?",
