  "content": "While most shark attacks on humans are carried out by individual sharks, there have been some rare instances where groups of sharks have attacked humans. One example is the infamous 1916 Jersey Shore shark attacks, where several people were bitten by what is believed to have been a group of great white sharks. However, these instances are incredibly rare, and for the most part, sharks do not view humans as prey and will avoid contact if possible. It is important to note that while shark attacks do occur, they are extremely rare and represent only a small fraction of shark-human interactions.",
