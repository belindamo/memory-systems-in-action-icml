  "content": "The shift from B2B to B2(B2)C that you mention is an example of a shift pattern in \"The Invincible Company\" book. This shift pattern involves expanding the customer base beyond just direct B2B customers to include B2B2C or B2C customers as well.\n\nIn the case of the idea for Copenhagen Airports to create a new website for booking flights directly from and to the airport, this shift pattern could potentially be relevant. By creating a B2C channel for customers to book flights, Copenhagen Airports would be shifting from a purely B2B business model to a B2(B2)C model.\n\nIn a B2(B2)C model, the airport would still primarily serve B2B customers, such as airlines, but would also have a direct B2C channel for customers to book flights. This could potentially lead to additional revenue streams for the airport, as well as more direct feedback and relationships with end customers.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this shift would require significant changes in the airport's business model and operations, as they would need to develop and manage a B2C booking platform, and potentially change the way they interact with their B2B customers as well. So, while this shift pattern could potentially fit the idea, it would require careful consideration and planning to execute successfully.",
