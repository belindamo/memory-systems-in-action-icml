Here are some delicious meal prep ideas that are perfect for using your new wraps:\n\n1. **Salads in a Jar**: Prepare a week's worth of salad jars by layering mixed greens, veggies, proteins (like chicken, tuna, or tofu), and nuts in a jar. Cover with a beeswax wrap and store in the fridge for up to 5 days.\n2. **Portion-Controlled Rice or Quinoa Bowls**: Cook a large batch of rice or quinoa and divide it into individual portions.

Cover with a beeswax wrap and refrigerate or freeze for up to 5 days.\n4. **Grilled Chicken or Veggies**: Grill a large batch of chicken breasts or vegetables (like broccoli, bell peppers, or zucchini) and store them in individual containers. Cover with a beeswax wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\n5. **Overnight Oats**: Prepare individual servings of overnight oats in jars or containers. Layer rolled oats, milk, and your choice of nuts, seeds, or fruit.

Cover with a beeswax wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\n\nTips for using your beeswax wraps efficiently:\n\n* Make sure to press the wrap firmly onto the container to create a tight seal.\n* Use the wraps to cover containers in the fridge, but not for freezing, as they may not be suitable for freezer temperatures.\n* Clean and condition your wraps regularly to maintain their effectiveness and extend their lifespan.\n* Consider using reusable containers or glass jars with your beeswax wraps for a fully sustainable meal prep system.\n\nEnjoy your meal prep journey with your new beeswax wraps!"
