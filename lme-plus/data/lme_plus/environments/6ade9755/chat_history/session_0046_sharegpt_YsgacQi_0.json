Change the style so that it is similar to an article published in a leading academic journal. \"I think the stories we read in class show how women really had it bad in Japan, like everything they did had to be to serve the men around them and nobody cared about what they wanted, they were just forced to raise the kids and do all the chores around the house which is pretty unfair.\""

      "content": "As an esteemed academician, it is my utmost pleasure to share my insights on the intricacies of English writing. In the given statement, the author has tried to express their opinions on the gender roles prevalent in Japanese society. However, the sentence structure, language and tone adopted are quite informal and do not meet the standards of academic writing.\n\nThe author asserts that the stories studied in class have vividly illustrated the extent to which women in Japan have been oppressed and subjugated to a life of servitude to their male counterparts. The author further emphasizes that the societal construct has been such that women have been relegated to the position of a mere facilitator of the men\u2019s needs with little regard for their own desires. Women were burdened with the responsibility of rearing the children and managing all domestic chores, which the author rightly deems as grossly unfair.\n\nIn terms of grammar, the sentence can be revised for clarity and precision. For instance, the phrase \"had it bad\" could be replaced with \"faced innumerable hardships\" to convey a more nuanced understanding of the issue. Similarly, the use of \"pretty unfair\" can be substituted with \"egregiously unjust\" to add more gravitas to the argument. Moreover, it would be prudent to remove any contractions and replace them with the full form of the word for a more formal tone.\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial for academic writers to maintain a formal and objective tone in their writing while expressing their opinions. This can be achieved by adhering to the accepted norms of academic writing and utilizing grammatical constructions that convey clarity and precision."
