      "content": "Great choices! Roasting red peppers is a simple process that brings out their natural sweetness and adds a smoky flavor to your hummus. Here are some tips to help you roast red peppers like a pro:\n\n**Roasting Red Peppers:**\n\n1. **Choose the right peppers**: Look for red bell peppers or sweet peppers with a glossy skin. You can use any color pepper, but red peppers will give your hummus a deeper flavor and color.\n2. **Preheat your oven**: Set your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n3. **Place peppers on a baking sheet**: Put the peppers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n4. **Roast the peppers**: Roast the peppers in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the skin is blistered and charred.\n5. **Peel the peppers**: Remove the peppers from the oven and let them cool down. Once cool enough to handle, peel off the skin, discarding it. You can also place the peppers in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap to help loosen the skin.\n6. **Seed and chop**: Remove the seeds and chop the peppers into pieces.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can also roast peppers over an open flame on a gas stovetop or on a grill. This will give them a more charred flavor.\n* If you're short on time, you can use jarred roasted red peppers as a substitute.\n* Roasted red peppers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week or frozen for up to 6 months.\n\nAs for Foodora, I'm glad you're enjoying their service! As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or opinions, but I can tell you that food delivery services like Foodora are popular for their convenience and variety of options. It's great that you're finding healthy and vegan options that suit your dietary needs.\n\nNow, go ahead and roast those peppers, and enjoy your delicious Spicy Roasted Veggie Blend and Roasted Red Pepper Hummus!"
