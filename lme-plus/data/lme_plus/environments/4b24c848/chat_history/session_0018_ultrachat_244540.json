      "content": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. \"Windy\" is a song by The Association, released in 1967. It was written by two members of the band, Ruthann Friedman, and Jim Yester. The inspiration behind the song is said to have been a woman named Wendi Slaton, whom Friedman saw walking down the street. The song is written in a whimsical, cheerful tone and is said to be a tribute to the joy and happiness that Wendi brought to the songwriter. The lyrics are filled with images of sunshine, rainbows, and flowers, celebrating the carefree spirit of the era."

      "content": "Yes, thank you for the reminder. The Association was formed in California in 1965 and became known for their intricate vocal harmonies and diverse range of styles, including pop, folk, and rock. They had several hit songs, including \"Cherish,\" \"Never My Love,\" and \"Along Comes Mary,\" and were known for their use of unconventional instruments, such as the harpsichord and the trumpet, in their recordings. The band also became known for their political activism and support for various causes, including environmentalism and anti-war efforts. In 1968, they were one of the first American rock bands to perform in the Soviet Union, and in 1970 they performed at a benefit concert for the Chicano Moratorium against the Vietnam War."
