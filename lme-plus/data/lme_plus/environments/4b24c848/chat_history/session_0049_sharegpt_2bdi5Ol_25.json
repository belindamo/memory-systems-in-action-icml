      "content": "In case of a cyber security incident involving sensitive PII data exfiltration and extortion, an Australian company providing an online conveyancing platform would need to interact with law enforcement and relevant organizations in a timely and responsible manner. The specific approach would depend on the nature and scale of the incident, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. Contact law enforcement - In case of a cybercrime, such as extortion or data theft, the company should contact law enforcement as soon as possible. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is the primary law enforcement agency that investigates cybercrime in Australia.\n2. Notify relevant organizations - Depending on the nature and scale of the incident, the company may also need to notify relevant organizations such as the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).\n3. Cooperate with law enforcement - The company should cooperate with law enforcement in their investigation of the incident, providing any relevant information and access to systems as needed.\n4. Notify affected individuals - The company may be required to notify affected individuals in case of a data breach under the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme.\n5. Seek legal counsel - The company may want to seek legal counsel to determine their legal obligations and liabilities in case of a cyber security incident.\n\nIt is important for the company to act quickly and responsibly to minimize the impact of the incident and to comply with legal requirements. The specific organizations and authorities that the company needs to inform and work with would depend on the specific circumstances of the incident."

      "content": "Based on the recent Optus and Medibank PII cyber breaches, the following additional inject information should be included in the simulation to help the organization learn from the mistakes of these companies:\n\n1. Incident response planning - The company should have a well-documented incident response plan in place and should regularly review and test it to ensure that it is up-to-date and effective.\n2. Employee training - The company should provide regular training to employees on cybersecurity best practices, including how to identify and report potential threats.\n3. Data protection and privacy - The company should ensure that its data protection and privacy policies and procedures are up-to-date and that they have appropriate technical and organizational measures in place to protect sensitive personal information.\n4. Regular risk assessments - The company should conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities and to ensure that its security measures are adequate.\n5. Third-party risk management - The company should have a process in place for managing third-party risks, including regular assessments of the security measures of suppliers and contractors.\n6. Monitoring and logging - The company should have adequate monitoring and logging in place to detect potential threats and to provide evidence in the event of a breach.\n7. Customer communication - In the event of a breach, the company should have a plan in place for communicating with customers, including providing clear and timely information about the incident and what steps the company is taking to address it.\n8. Post-incident review - After a breach, the company should conduct a thorough post-incident review to identify lessons learned and to make improvements to its security measures.\n\nBy learning from the mistakes of companies like Optus and Medibank, the organization can improve its preparedness and response to a PII cyber breach. These injects can help test and evaluate the company's readiness to respond to such incidents and identify areas for improvement."

      "content": "Threat actors targeting Australian financial services organizations to steal PII and extort them can come from a variety of sources, including nation-state actors, criminal groups, and hacktivist groups. Some of the most active threat actors currently targeting the financial services industry in Australia include:\n\n1. APT10: A Chinese state-sponsored threat actor that has been active since at least 2009. APT10 has been known to target financial services organizations to steal sensitive information and to engage in intellectual property theft.\n2. Lazarus Group: A North Korean state-sponsored threat actor that has been active since at least 2009. Lazarus Group has been known to target financial services organizations to steal sensitive information and to engage in theft of funds.\n3. FIN7: A financially motivated criminal group that has been active since at least 2015. FIN7 has been known to target financial services organizations to steal sensitive information and to engage in payment card fraud.\n\nThe TTPs used by these threat actors are constantly evolving, but some of the most common tactics that they have been using recently include:\n\n1. Phishing and social engineering - sending emails or messages that appear to come from trusted sources to trick users into downloading malware or disclosing sensitive information.\n2. Malware - using malicious software, such as Trojans, to infect systems and steal sensitive information.\n3. Command and control infrastructure - using servers or other resources to control infected systems and to exfiltrate stolen data.\n4. Fileless malware - using malicious code that is executed directly in memory without being written to disk, making it more difficult to detect.\n5. Network reconnaissance - gathering information about the target's network and systems to identify vulnerabilities and to plan the attack.\n6. Lateral movement - moving from one system to another within the target network to gain access to sensitive information.\n7. Data exfiltration - stealing sensitive information and sending it back to the attacker's infrastructure.\n\nIt is important for organizations to be aware of the TTPs used by these and other threat actors and to implement appropriate security measures to protect their systems and data."

      "content": "Threat Brief:\n\nThe financial services industry in Australia is a prime target for cyber attacks due to the sensitive nature of the data they hold and the high value of the assets they manage. Threat actors ranging from nation-state actors to financially motivated criminal groups are actively targeting the industry to steal personal identifiable information (PII) and extort victims.\n\nThe most active threat actors currently targeting the financial services industry in Australia include APT10, Lazarus Group, and FIN7. These threat actors use a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to carry out their attacks, including phishing and social engineering, malware, command and control infrastructure, fileless malware, network reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.\n\nIt is essential for organizations in the financial services industry to be aware of these TTPs and the threat actors using them and to implement appropriate security measures to protect their systems and data. In this simulation, we will be simulating a cyber incident involving the theft of PII and extortion of an online conveyancing platform provider in Australia. The simulation will provide an opportunity for senior executives to test their response to a cyber crisis and to learn from recent PII breaches involving Australian companies such as Optus and Medibank.\n\nThis threat brief serves as an introduction to the simulation and provides an overview of the TTPs and threat actors that will be included. The simulation will cover the entire attacker lifecycle and will provide opportunities for senior executives to respond to different stages of the attack."
