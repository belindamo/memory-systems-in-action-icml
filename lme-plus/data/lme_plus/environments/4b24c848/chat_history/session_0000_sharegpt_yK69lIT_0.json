      "content": "With heavy hearts, we spoke of layoffs at work\nThe recent fun event now just a memory\nWe turned to happier subjects, books and quirks\nOf young adult novels, where love can be key\n\nBut even as we laughed, a tear did fall\nFor movies watched on planes that make us cry\nThe soaring heights and depths of it all\nCan bring us joy and sorrow by and by\n\nBut through it all, we find a way to cope\nTo keep on going, even when it's tough\nFor friendship's strength can help us find the hope\nTo rise above it all, and find our stuff\n\nSo here's to you, dear Maileen, and our chat\nA sonnet born of laughter, love, and tears."
