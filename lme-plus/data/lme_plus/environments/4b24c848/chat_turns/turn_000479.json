You can contact the county treasurer's office or the county assessor's office in the county where the farm is located to get the exact amount. They can provide you with the tax bill or a statement showing the outstanding balance.\n2. **Gather required documents**: You may need to provide proof of ownership or authorization to pay the taxes. This could include a copy of the deed, a power of attorney, or a letter from your grandparents granting you permission to pay the taxes.\n3. **Choose a payment method**: You can usually pay property taxes online, by mail, or in person at the county treasurer's office. You can check the county's website or contact the treasurer's office to see what payment options are available.\n4. **Make the payment**: Be sure to make the payment by the deadline to avoid additional penalties and interest. If you're mailing a payment, make sure to use certified mail with return receipt requested to prove the payment was sent on time.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Verify the tax bill**: Double-check the tax bill to ensure it's accurate and includes any exemptions or deductions your grandparents may have been eligible for.\n* **Check for delinquent taxes**: If the taxes have been delinquent for an extended period, you may need to pay penalties and interest in addition to the original tax amount.\n* **Consider setting up a payment plan**: If you're unable to pay the full amount at once, you may be able to set up a payment plan with the county treasurer's office.\n\nRegarding the storage units, it's great that you're taking the time to sort through the contents of the farm. You may want to consider the following:\n\n* **Organize and categorize**: Sort items into categories, such as tools, equipment, furniture, and personal items. This will make it easier to decide what to keep, sell, or donate.\n* **Keep important documents**: Be sure to keep any important documents, such as deeds, titles, and financial records, in a safe and secure location.\n* **Consider hiring a professional**: If you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure about what to do with certain items, consider hiring a professional organizer or estate liquidator to help you sort through the contents of the storage units.\n\nI hope this information helps you navigate the tax payment process and get your grandparents' farm in order. Good luck!",
