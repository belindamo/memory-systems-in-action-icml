  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future, but it's possible that future technology will continue to have a significant impact on the practices and traditions of the Afrikaner people.\n\nFor instance, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) may transform the agriculture industry and impact traditional farming methods. The rise of e-commerce, digital marketplaces, and online payment systems may also change the way Afrikaner people buy and sell goods and services, impacting traditional commerce practices.\n\nAdditionally, the continued development of virtual and augmented reality could bring about new opportunities for the preservation and promotion of Afrikaner culture and recreational activities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that the impact of future technologies on the traditions and practices of the Afrikaner people will depend on their adoption and integration into their cultural practices. Ultimately, the future impact of technology on Afrikaner traditions and practices remains to be seen, and it will be influenced by various factors such as access, affordability, cultural values, and preferences.",
