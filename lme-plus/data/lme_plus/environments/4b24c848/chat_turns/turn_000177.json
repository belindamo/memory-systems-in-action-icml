It's possible that you might be thinking of the Grand Californian Hotel, which is a Disney-owned hotel located near Disneyland Park, but not within Disney California Adventure Park.\n\nThat being said, I'd be happy to help you find great spots to watch the fireworks display at Disneyland! Here are some popular viewing areas:\n\n1. Main Street USA: Find a spot on Main Street USA, especially near the central hub in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. This area offers a great view of the fireworks and the projections on the castle.\n2. \"it's a small world\" Mall: This area is a great spot to watch the fireworks, and it's often less crowded than Main Street USA. You can also enjoy the music and lights of \"it's a small world\" while you wait for the show.\n3. Rivers of America: Find a spot along the Rivers of America, such as near the Mark Twain Riverboat or the Sailing Ship Columbia. This area offers a unique view of the fireworks reflected in the water.\n4. Mickey's Toontown: This area is a great spot for families with young kids, as it's often less crowded and offers a fun atmosphere. You can watch the fireworks from the Toontown Gadget's Go Coaster or near the Toontown City Hall.\n5. Disneyland Railroad: If you're looking for a more relaxed viewing experience, consider watching the fireworks from the Disneyland Railroad station on Main Street USA. You can sit on the platform and enjoy the show while waiting for the train to arrive.\n\nRemember to arrive early to secure a good spot, as popular viewing areas can fill up quickly. You can also consider watching the fireworks from a restaurant or bar with outdoor seating, such as the Plaza Inn or the Carthay Circle Lounge.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a magical time at Disneyland!",
