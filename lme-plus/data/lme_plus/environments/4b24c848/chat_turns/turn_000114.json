Since I'm already taking a Coursera specialization in Deep Learning from Stanford University, I was wondering if I can use some of the concepts I've learned in that course to supplement my understanding of NLP. Are there any specific deep learning concepts that I can apply to NLP, or any NLP concepts that can enhance my understanding of deep learning in general?",
