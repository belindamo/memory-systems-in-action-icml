  "content": "The values of respect for elders and authority figures, strong family ties, and loyalty to one's tribe influence the way the Fulani interact with others outside their tribe. They believe in respecting their elders, and this value reflects in their behavior towards others who are older than them. They also have strong family ties and are loyal to their tribe members, which means they often look out for the interests of their fellow tribesmen and may prioritize them over outsiders.\n\nHospitality and generosity are values that are integral to Fulani culture. In their daily lives, they are known to welcome strangers and share their resources with others. Even when they are on the move, they maintain their nomadic lifestyle, they show generosity towards people they encounter on their journeys.\n\nThe Fulani also value courage and bravery, and this reflects in their interactions with others outside their tribe. They have a reputation for being fierce fighters and are not easily intimidated by adversaries. They also have a strong work ethic and self-sufficiency, which means they are often able to provide for their communities without relying on outside assistance.\n\nOverall, the values upheld in traditional Fulani culture affect their daily lives and interactions with others outside of their tribe by shaping their behavior towards others and influencing their actions and decisions.",
