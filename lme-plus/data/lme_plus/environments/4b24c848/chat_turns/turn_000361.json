Here are some tips to help you roast red peppers like a pro:\n\n**Roasting Red Peppers:**\n\n1. **Choose the right peppers**: Look for red bell peppers or sweet peppers with a glossy skin. You can use any color pepper, but red peppers will give your hummus a deeper flavor and color.\n2. **Preheat your oven**: Set your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n3. **Place peppers on a baking sheet**: Put the peppers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n4. **Roast the peppers**: Roast the peppers in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the skin is blistered and charred.\n5. **Peel the peppers**: Remove the peppers from the oven and let them cool down.
