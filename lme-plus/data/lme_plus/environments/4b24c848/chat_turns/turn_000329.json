The baking soda and water paste is a gentle yet effective way to remove soap scum, and the bleach solution is a great option for tackling mildew.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you recently cleaned the grout between the tiles on the floor! It's amazing how a task like that can make such a big difference in the overall appearance of the bathroom. Grout can be a real pain to clean, but it's definitely worth the effort.\n\nAn hour and a half is a great investment of time to get the job done, and I'm sure it was satisfying to see the before-and-after results. Clean grout can make the entire bathroom look fresher and more well-maintained. Plus, it's a great feeling to tackle a task that's been bugging you and finally have it done!\n\nRemember to maintain your grout regularly to prevent dirt and grime from building up again. You can use a grout sealer to help protect it and make future cleanings easier.\n\nNow, go enjoy your clean bathroom and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with it!",
