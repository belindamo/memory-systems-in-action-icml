However, as per historical sources, there are several theories and speculations behind the disappearance of the Thule people:\n\n1. Environmental factors: It is believed that harsh climate conditions, such as harsh winters and decreasing food resources, could have led to the Thule people's disappearance.\n\n2. Disease: It is speculated that the Thule people may have been susceptible to infectious diseases brought by European explorers and traders, which could have devastated their populations.\n\n3. Conflicts with Inuit people: There is also a possibility that conflicts with neighboring Inuit groups could have played a role in the Thule people's disappearance.\n\n4. Economic and cultural factors: Economic changes, such as the shift away from hunting of marine mammals, and the adoption of new technologies, such as firearms, could have led to cultural changes that may have contributed to the Thule people's decline.\n\nIt is thought that a combination of these factors, rather than any one specific cause, may have contributed to the Thule people's disappearance.",
