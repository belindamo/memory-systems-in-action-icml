However, I have to say that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or opinions, and I don't have the ability to know the prices of specific menu items from restaurants. But I can definitely provide you with some delicious and creative ways to use up your roasted broccoli, sweet potatoes, and Brussels sprouts!\n\nHere are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Veggie Wrap**: Fill a whole wheat wrap with roasted broccoli, sweet potato, and Brussels sprouts, along with some hummus or tzatziki sauce for a tasty and healthy snack.\n2. **Veggie Soup**: Blend the roasted veggies with some chicken or veggie broth to create a creamy and comforting soup. You can also add some noodles or rice for a filling meal.\n3. **Roasted Veggie Salad**: Toss the roasted veggies with some mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and a citrus vinaigrette for a fresh and flavorful salad.\n4. **Stuffed Sweet Potatoes**: Fill baked sweet potatoes with a mixture of roasted broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and some crumbled feta cheese or black beans for a nutritious and filling meal.\n5. **Veggie Omelette**: Add diced roasted veggies to an omelette filled with eggs, cheese, and a sprinkle of herbs for a protein-packed breakfast or brunch.\n6. **Veggie Quesadilla**: Fill tortillas with roasted veggies, cheese, and beans for a veggie-packed quesadilla that's perfect for lunch or dinner.\n7. **Veggie Frittata**: Similar to an omelette, but bake the mixture in a skillet with eggs, cheese, and herbs for a delicious brunch dish.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create something amazing with your leftover veggies!",
