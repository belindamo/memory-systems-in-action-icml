  "content": "Even if your dog rarely leaves the house, they are still at risk of contracting some diseases that can be transmitted through indirect contact, such as the parvovirus and the canine distemper virus, which can survive in the environment for extended periods of time. These viruses can contaminate surfaces, food or water bowls, and even clothing and shoes, which can be carried into your home. Vaccines are designed to protect against these and other diseases that can be transmitted. Vaccinations are especially important for puppies, as they have immature immune systems and are more susceptible to diseases. Skipping vaccinations can put your dog at risk of contracting these preventable diseases, which can have severe consequences, including hospitalization or even death. It's important to talk to your veterinarian about your dog's individual risk factors and which vaccinations are necessary to keep them healthy.",
