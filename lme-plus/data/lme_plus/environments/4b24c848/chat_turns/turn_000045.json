  "content": "Dogs should be vaccinated against parvo and other common canine diseases as puppies starting at around 6-8 weeks old, with boosters given every 2-4 weeks until the puppy is around 16 weeks old. After the initial series of vaccinations, most dogs should receive a booster vaccine one year later, and then every three years thereafter.\n\nThe best vaccination schedule may vary depending on a variety of factors such as the dog's age, overall health, lifestyle, and any local disease outbreaks. It is important to consult with a veterinarian to determine the best vaccination schedule for your individual dog.",
