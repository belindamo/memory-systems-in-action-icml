  "content": "Treating a sick dog can be both costly and risky. Preventative care, including vaccinations, is much more cost-effective and generally results in better outcomes for your pet. A single visit to the vet for treatment of a preventable disease can sometimes cost more than several years\u2019 worth of vaccinations. Furthermore, some diseases, such as parvovirus, require intensive and often prolonged treatment, which can be both physically and emotionally taxing for the dog and the owner. Additionally, some diseases, such as rabies, are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted between animals and humans. Vaccinating your dog not only helps protect them but also helps protect you and others around them.\n\nIt is important to remember that prevention is always better than cure, and regular vaccinations are a fundamental part of preventative care for dogs. While it may seem like a lot of money upfront, vaccinations can ultimately save you money and reduce the risk of severe illness or death for your furry friend.",
