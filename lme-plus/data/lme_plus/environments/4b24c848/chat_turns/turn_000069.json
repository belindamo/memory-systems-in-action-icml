  "content": "The mall's website should have the most up-to-date information on store locations and promotions.\n\nAs for H&M's promotions and sales, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information on specific store promotions or sales. However, I can suggest a few ways to find out about any ongoing deals:\n\n1. **Check H&M's website**: You can visit H&M's official website and look for their \"Deals\" or \"Offers\" section. They usually list their current promotions, discounts, and sales online.\n2. **Sign up for H&M's newsletter**: If you haven't already, consider signing up for H&M's email newsletter. They often send exclusive offers, promo codes, and sale notifications to their subscribers.\n3. **Follow H&M's social media**: Keep an eye on H&M's social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) for promotional posts, flash sales, or special deals.\n4. **Download the H&M app**: H&M has a mobile app that sometimes offers exclusive discounts, promotions, or early access to sales.\n5. **Visit the H&M store**: When you're at the mall, you can always check the H&M store's windows, doors, or in-store displays for any promotional signs or banners. The sales associates might also be able to let you know about any ongoing deals or upcoming sales.\n\nRemember to always check the terms and conditions of any promotion or sale to ensure it applies to the items you want to purchase. Happy shopping!",
