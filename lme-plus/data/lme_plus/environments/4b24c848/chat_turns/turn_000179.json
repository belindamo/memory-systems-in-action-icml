It's a beautiful hotel with a lot of amenities and perks, including Extra Magic Hour benefits for hotel guests.\n\nRegarding special fireworks displays or events during the summer season, Disneyland usually offers a summer-themed fireworks show, often with a patriotic twist around the 4th of July. However, the exact schedule and details may vary from year to year.\n\nIn recent years, Disneyland has offered a special summer fireworks show called \"Disneyland Forever,\" which features a mix of classic Disney songs, modern hits, and patriotic music. The show often includes special effects, pyrotechnics, and projections on the castle and Main Street USA buildings.\n\nIt's also possible that Disneyland might offer special events or celebrations during the summer season, such as character meet-and-greets, live music performances, or themed food and drinks. I recommend checking the official Disneyland website or the Disneyland app for the most up-to-date information on summer events and fireworks schedules.\n\nAdditionally, if you're planning to visit during peak summer season, be prepared for larger crowds and longer wait times for attractions. Consider using the Disneyland app to reserve FASTPASSes, make dining reservations, and even order food and drinks from your phone to minimize wait times.\n\nHave a magical time at Disneyland, and I hope you enjoy the fireworks display!",
