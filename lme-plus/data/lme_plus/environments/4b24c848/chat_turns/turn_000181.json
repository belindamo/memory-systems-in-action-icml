  "content": "I think there might be some confusion again. There is no \"Summer Nights\" event at Disney California Adventure Park that I'm aware of. It's possible that you might be thinking of a different event or promotion.\n\nHowever, Disney California Adventure Park does offer special events and celebrations throughout the year, including during the summer season. For example, they often have a summer-themed party called \"Disney California Adventure Park After Dark\" or \"Summer of Heroes\" in the past, which featured extended park hours, special food and drinks, and character meet-and-greets.\n\nAs for fireworks displays, Disney California Adventure Park typically doesn't have a regular fireworks show like Disneyland Park does. However, they might offer special fireworks or pyrotechnic displays during specific events or holidays, such as the 4th of July or Halloween.\n\nI recommend checking the official Disneyland website or the Disney California Adventure Park website for the most up-to-date information on summer events and celebrations. You can also follow Disney's social media accounts or sign up for their email newsletter to stay informed about upcoming events and promotions.\n\nIf you could provide more details or context about the \"Summer Nights\" event you attended, I might be able to help you better.",
