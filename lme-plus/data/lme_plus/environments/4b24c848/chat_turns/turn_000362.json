By the way, I've been experimenting with different cuisines, and I recently tried a vegan Indian place called Tandoori Nights through Foodora. Their vegan butter chicken with basmati rice and naan bread was amazing and around $12. Anyway, back to the hummus, do you have any suggestions for what type of bread or veggies to serve it with?",
