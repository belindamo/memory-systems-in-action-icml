  "content": "I'd be happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific mall layouts or store locations in real-time. But I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you're looking for:\n\n1. **Check the mall's website or directory**: You can visit the website of the mall you plan to visit and look for a directory or store list. Most malls have an online directory that allows you to search for stores and view their locations on a map.\n2. **Use a mall app**: Many malls have their own mobile apps that provide an interactive map, store listings, and even special offers. You can download the app for your mall and search for H&M to find nearby stores.\n3. **Google search**: You can try searching for \"stores near H&M [mall name]\" or \"H&M [mall name] directory\" to find relevant information. This might give you a list of nearby stores or a link to the mall's website.\n4. **Call the mall's customer service**: If you're unable to find the information online, you can call the mall's customer service number and ask about the stores near H&M. They should be able to provide you with the information you need.\n\nRemember to double-check the mall's hours of operation and store listings before you head out, as they may be subject to change. Have a great time at the mall!",
