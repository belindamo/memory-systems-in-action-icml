I'm happy to chat with you about sci-fi books, but I should let you know that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or read books like humans do. I'm here to provide information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge based on my training data.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some popular and highly-recommended sci-fi books that you might enjoy:\n\n1. **The Three-Body Problem** by Liu Cixin - A science fiction epic that explores the first contact between humans and an alien civilization.\n2. **Diaspora** by Greg Egan - A thought-provoking novel that delves into the theme of artificial intelligence, consciousness, and interstellar travel.\n3. **The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers - A character-driven novel that follows the crew of a tunneling ship as they travel through the galaxy.\n4. **Ancillary Justice** by Ann Leckie - A gripping space opera that follows an AI who seeks revenge against the ruler who destroyed her ship and crew.\n5. **The Expanse** series by James S.
