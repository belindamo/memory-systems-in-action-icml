They continue to rely on hunting and gathering for food, and hunt marine mammals such as seals, whales, and walruses with traditional tools such as harpoons and knives. They also rely on fishing, trapping, and gathering berries and other plants. \n\nAnother example is the Sami people, who are indigenous to the northern parts of Scandinavia, Russia, and Finland.
