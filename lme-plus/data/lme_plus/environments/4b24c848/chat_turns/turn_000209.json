When the decade began, the band was still heavily influenced by blues and rock and roll, as heard on their albums \"Sticky Fingers\" and \"Exile on Main St.\" However, as the decade progressed, they incorporated more funk and disco elements into their sound. This can be heard on albums like \"Goats Head Soup\" and \"Black and Blue.\" The band also experimented with reggae on their hit single \"Emotional Rescue\" and the album \"Some Girls.\" By the end of the decade, the band had adopted a more polished, pop-oriented sound on their album \"Tattoo You.\" Overall, The Rolling Stones' music in the 1970s showcased their ability to adapt and evolve with the changing musical landscape.",
