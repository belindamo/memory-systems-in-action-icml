  "content": "A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a version of a product that has just enough features to be usable by early customers, and to provide feedback for future development. The MVP is the first version of the product that can be used to gather feedback and validate the product's value proposition.\n\nA basic MVP can be many things, depending on the product or service being developed. Some common examples of basic MVPs include:\n\n1. Landing pages: A landing page is a simple website that describes a product or service and encourages visitors to sign up for more information or to pre-order the product.\n2. Prototypes: A prototype is a working model of a product or service that can be used to demonstrate its functionality and gather feedback.\n3. Concierge MVPs: A concierge MVP is a version of a service that is performed manually by the company instead of being automated. It's a way to test the idea and get customer feedback before building a scalable solution.\n4. Wizard of Oz MVPs: A Wizard of Oz MVP is a version of a service that appears to be fully automated, but is actually operated manually behind the scenes. This allows the company to test the idea and get customer feedback before building a fully automated solution.\n5. Explainer Videos: An explainer video is a short video that describes a product or service, and explains how it works. It can be used to generate interest in a product or service, and to gather feedback on its value proposition.\n\nThe goal of MVP is to validate the value proposition of the product or service with the least amount of resources, time, and money. It's a way to test the product or service with real customers to see if it's worth continuing to develop.",
