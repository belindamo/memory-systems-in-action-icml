However, I can suggest a few ways to find out about upcoming events and book clubs at your local bookstore:\n\n1. **Check their website**: Visit your local bookstore's website to see if they have an events calendar, blog, or newsletter sign-up. They might list upcoming events, book clubs, and author readings.\n2. **Social media**: Follow your local bookstore on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. They often post about upcoming events, promotions, and book clubs.\n3. **Call or visit the store**: Give the bookstore a call or stop by in person to ask about upcoming events and book clubs. The staff might be able to provide you with more information or recommend something that suits your interests.\n4. **Sign up for their newsletter**: Many bookstores have a newsletter that highlights upcoming events, new releases, and book clubs.
