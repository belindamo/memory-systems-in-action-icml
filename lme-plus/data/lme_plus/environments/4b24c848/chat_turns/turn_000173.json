Yes, \"Big Magic\" is a great choice for your daily commute, and you can easily finish it within a week or so. The audiobook is engaging, and Elizabeth Gilbert's narration is wonderful.\n\nAs for \"Glass Castle\", breaking it up into smaller chunks is a great idea. You can try listening to it in 30-45 minute increments, which should fit nicely into your daily commute. It's a memoir that's worth savoring, and you'll appreciate the opportunity to reflect on the story and themes between listens.\n\nRemember, audiobooks are a great way to make the most of your commute time, and I'm happy to have helped you discover two new titles to enjoy. If you need more recommendations or have any other questions, feel free to ask!\n\nHappy listening, and I hope you enjoy \"Big Magic\" and \"Glass Castle\"!",
