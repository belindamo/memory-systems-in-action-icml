  "content": "Threat actors targeting Australian financial services organizations to steal PII and extort them can come from a variety of sources, including nation-state actors, criminal groups, and hacktivist groups. Some of the most active threat actors currently targeting the financial services industry in Australia include:\n\n1. APT10: A Chinese state-sponsored threat actor that has been active since at least 2009. APT10 has been known to target financial services organizations to steal sensitive information and to engage in intellectual property theft.\n2. Lazarus Group: A North Korean state-sponsored threat actor that has been active since at least 2009. Lazarus Group has been known to target financial services organizations to steal sensitive information and to engage in theft of funds.\n3. FIN7: A financially motivated criminal group that has been active since at least 2015. FIN7 has been known to target financial services organizations to steal sensitive information and to engage in payment card fraud.\n\nThe TTPs used by these threat actors are constantly evolving, but some of the most common tactics that they have been using recently include:\n\n1. Phishing and social engineering - sending emails or messages that appear to come from trusted sources to trick users into downloading malware or disclosing sensitive information.\n2. Malware - using malicious software, such as Trojans, to infect systems and steal sensitive information.\n3. Command and control infrastructure - using servers or other resources to control infected systems and to exfiltrate stolen data.\n4. Fileless malware - using malicious code that is executed directly in memory without being written to disk, making it more difficult to detect.\n5. Network reconnaissance - gathering information about the target's network and systems to identify vulnerabilities and to plan the attack.\n6. Lateral movement - moving from one system to another within the target network to gain access to sensitive information.\n7. Data exfiltration - stealing sensitive information and sending it back to the attacker's infrastructure.\n\nIt is important for organizations to be aware of the TTPs used by these and other threat actors and to implement appropriate security measures to protect their systems and data.",
