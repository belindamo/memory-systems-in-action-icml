I'd be happy to help you find bike-sharing options in your area.\n\nTo get started, could you please tell me what city or region you're in? That way, I can provide you with more tailored information on bike-sharing schemes available in your area.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned you need a bike that can get you to your office quickly and easily, I'll make sure to look for options that offer bikes with comfortable riding conditions and suitable gear systems for short to medium-distance commutes.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider the following factors when choosing a bike-sharing scheme:\n\n1. Station locations: Are there bike-sharing stations near your home, train station, and office?\n2. Bike types: Do they offer bikes with gears, suspension, or other features that might be important to you?\n3. Pricing: What are the membership fees, rental rates, and any additional costs?\n4. Operating hours: Are the bikes available during your commute hours?\n5. Helmet availability: Do they provide helmets, or do you need to bring your own?\n\nLet me know your location, and I'll do my best to find bike-sharing options that fit your needs!",
