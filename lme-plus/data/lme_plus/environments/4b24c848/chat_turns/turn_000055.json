However, I think there might be some confusion - I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I wasn't aware of your jog last weekend.\n\nBut I'd be delighted to suggest some fun outdoor activities you could do on Saturday morning! Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Hiking**: Find a nearby trail and take in the scenic views while getting some exercise.\n2. **Cycling**: Dust off your bike and explore local bike trails or take a ride through your neighborhood.\n3. **Kayaking or Paddleboarding**: Rent a kayak or paddleboard and enjoy a peaceful morning on a nearby lake or river.\n4. **Yoga or Tai Chi**: Find a quiet spot in a park or by a body of water and start your day with some mindfulness exercises.\n5. **Birdwatching**: Grab some binoculars and see how many species you can spot in your area.\n6. **Geocaching**: Create an account and go on a treasure hunt using GPS coordinates.\n7. **Picnic**: Pack a breakfast or brunch and head to a nearby park or scenic spot to enjoy a meal alfresco.\n8. **Gardening**: If you have a green thumb, spend the morning tending to your garden or starting a new project.\n9. **Photography**: Take your camera or phone and capture the beauty of nature around you.\n10. **Star Gazing**: If you're an early riser, find a dark spot away from city lights and enjoy some stargazing before the sun rises.\n\nRemember to stay safe, wear sunscreen, and bring plenty of water and snacks to keep you energized throughout your outdoor adventure!\n\nWhich one of these activities sounds appealing to you?",
