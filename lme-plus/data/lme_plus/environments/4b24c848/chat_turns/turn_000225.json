The building has two observation decks, one on the 45th floor (202 meters high) and another on the 46th floor (212 meters high). From these decks, you can enjoy panoramic views of Tokyo, including famous landmarks like the Tokyo Tower, Meiji Shrine, and the Imperial Palace.\n\nOn a clear day, you can even see Mount Fuji in the distance. The observation decks are open from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM (last entry at 5:00 PM), and admission is free.\n\nTo get to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building from your hotel in Shinjuku, you can:\n\n1. Take a short 10-minute walk north from Shinjuku Station (JR or subway lines) to the building.\n2. Take the Toei Oedo subway line from Shinjuku Station to Tochomae Station (exit A4), which is directly connected to the building.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* The observation decks can get crowded, especially on weekends and holidays, so try to visit early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the crowds.\n* There may be security checks before entering the building, so be prepared to go through metal detectors and bag checks.\n* There are also souvenir shops and a cafe on the observation decks, in case you want to take a break or grab a snack while enjoying the views.\n\nEnjoy your visit to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and your stay in Shinjuku!",
