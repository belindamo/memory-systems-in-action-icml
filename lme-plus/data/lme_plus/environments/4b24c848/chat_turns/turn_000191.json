  "content": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. \"Windy\" is a song by The Association, released in 1967. It was written by two members of the band, Ruthann Friedman, and Jim Yester. The inspiration behind the song is said to have been a woman named Wendi Slaton, whom Friedman saw walking down the street. The song is written in a whimsical, cheerful tone and is said to be a tribute to the joy and happiness that Wendi brought to the songwriter. The lyrics are filled with images of sunshine, rainbows, and flowers, celebrating the carefree spirit of the era.",
