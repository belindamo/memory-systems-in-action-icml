  "content": "There are a few modern-day equivalents to the role of lady-in-waiting, but the nature and responsibilities of the positions have changed significantly. One may find similarities between the role of a personal assistant, a chief of staff, or a senior advisor to a public figure in modern times. Just like the lady-in-waiting, these positions involve working closely with a person of prominence and providing them with support, advice, and assistance in various areas of their work and personal life. For example, the Chief of Staff of the White House in the United States is responsible for managing the schedule and staff of the President of the United States, much like how a lady-in-waiting managed the schedule and staff of a queen or princess in the past. These modern-day equivalents may not involve the same level of formality, prestige, and societal expectations that were associated with being a lady-in-waiting in the past, but they share some common characteristics and require a similar level of dedication and professionalism.",
