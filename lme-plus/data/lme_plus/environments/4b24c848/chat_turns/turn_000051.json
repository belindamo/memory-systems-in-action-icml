  "content": "While it is true that dogs have immune systems that can fight off some diseases, it is not always reliable or sufficient. The purpose of vaccination is to give the immune system a head start and help protect against diseases that are potentially life-threatening. Vaccines are formulated to trigger an immune response that simulates a natural infection, without actually causing illness, so that the immune system can be prepared to fight off the real disease if encountered in the future.\n\nUnlike humans, who tend to spend most of their days indoors, dogs have the opportunity to come into contact with a variety of pathogens when outside. Furthermore, certain diseases, such as parvovirus and distemper, can have severe consequences for dogs, and require a robust immune response to overcome. Relying on a dog's natural immune system alone doesn't always provide adequate protection against these and other diseases.\n\nUltimately, vaccinating your dog is an important part of responsible pet ownership, helping to prevent the spread of disease and to protect your dog's health and wellbeing. It's important to talk to your veterinarian about your dog's individual vaccination needs.",
