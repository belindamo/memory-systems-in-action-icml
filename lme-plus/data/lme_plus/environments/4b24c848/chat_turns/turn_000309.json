However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't know you went to Chicago or any other trip.\n\nBut I'd be happy to help you find good deals on flights to Europe for your next trip! To get started, could you please provide me with some more information about your travel plans?\n\nHere are some questions to help me narrow down some options for you:\n\n1. Which European cities or countries are you interested in visiting?\n2. What are your travel dates or flexibility range for next spring (e.g., March, April, May, or specific dates)?\n3. Are you flying from a specific airport or open to departing from different airports?\n4. Are you looking for economy, premium economy, business, or first-class flights?\n5. Do you have any airline preferences or loyalty programs?\n6. Are you open to layovers or do you prefer non-stop flights?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized recommendations and tips to find the best deals on flights to Europe!",
