  "content": "That's fantastic! It's great that you're finding the tea break to be helpful in managing stress and staying focused. Taking a moment to relax and recharge can make a big difference in your productivity and overall well-being.\n\nI'm sure it's not easy to switch from coffee to tea, especially if you're used to the caffeine kick from coffee. But it sounds like you're doing a great job of finding a new routine that works for you. The Earl Grey is probably providing a nice, gentle boost to help you get through your day.\n\nIt's also wonderful that you're using the tea break as a moment to relax and refocus. Mindfulness and self-care are so important, and it's great that you're prioritizing that. Do you find that the tea break is helping you approach challenges with a clearer head and a more positive attitude?",
