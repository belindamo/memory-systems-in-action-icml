You want to focus on inviting Sarah to participate, not make the message all about you.\n\nHere's a revised example of a LinkedIn message that mentions your experience:\n\n\"Hi Sarah, great meeting you at TechCon last week! I'm organizing a meetup for my professional network in June and I think your insights would be a great addition to our panel discussion on [topic]. As someone who recently participated as a panelist at the Industry Summit in April, I'm confident in my ability to create a engaging and informative event. Would you be interested and available to participate? Let me know, and we can discuss details.\"\n\nBy mentioning your experience, you're:\n\n* Showing that you have some experience in organizing and participating in similar events\n* Demonstrating your understanding of what makes a good panel discussion\n* Establishing credibility and building trust with Sarah\n\nHowever, remember to keep the focus on the event and Sarah's potential participation. You can always provide more information about your experience if she expresses interest and asks follow-up questions.\n\nIn your follow-up email, you can reiterate the invitation and provide more details about the event, such as the date, time, location, and expected audience. This will give Sarah a better understanding of the event and help her make an informed decision about participating.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you get a positive response from Sarah!",
