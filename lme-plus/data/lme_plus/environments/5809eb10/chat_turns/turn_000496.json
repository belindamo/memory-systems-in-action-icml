  "content": "While a data container is a standardized unit of software that encapsulates and packages together an application and its dependencies, a data virtual machine (VM) is a software implementation of a physical computer that runs its own operating system and applications, and can be accessed and managed like a physical machine.\n\nA data VM allows for the creation of multiple virtual machines on a single physical server, each with its own isolated operating system, applications, and resources. This allows for greater flexibility in managing and deploying software, as well as more efficient use of hardware resources.\n\nIn contrast, a data container shares the underlying host operating system and kernel with other containers on the same host. This makes containers more lightweight and portable than VMs, as they do not require the same level of resources and overhead as a full VM.\n\nWhile both data containers and data VMs provide a way to isolate and manage software environments, the main difference between the two is that data containers are designed to provide a lightweight and portable way to package and deploy applications, while data VMs provide a more complete virtualization of a physical machine, allowing for greater flexibility in managing and deploying entire operating systems and software stacks.",
