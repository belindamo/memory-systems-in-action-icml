Here are some tips on what to pack:\n\n**Temple Etiquette:**\n\n1. **Cover your shoulders**: Avoid sleeveless shirts or tank tops, as they may be considered impolite. Opt for clothing that covers your shoulders, such as a light jacket or a scarf.\n2. **No short shorts**: Shorts are generally not acceptable at temples, especially if they're very short. Pack lightweight, knee-length pants or a skirt instead.\n3. **Remove your shoes**: In many temples, you'll be required to remove your shoes before entering. Pack socks or slippers to wear inside.\n4. **Dress modestly**: Avoid revealing or tight clothing, and opt for loose, comfortable clothing that covers your body.\n\n**Garden Etiquette:**\n\n1. **Dress for the seasons**: Japan's gardens are often designed to showcase the beauty of each season.
