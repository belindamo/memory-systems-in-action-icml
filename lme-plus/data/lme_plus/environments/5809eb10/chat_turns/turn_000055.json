  "content": "If you added a line to the configuration file of proFTP last time and it was running, but it is not running now, it's possible that the line you added is causing a configuration error.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can try the following:\n\n1. Remove the line that you added to the configuration file of proFTP and save the changes. Then try starting the proFTP service again to see if it runs properly.\n2. If removing the line does not solve the problem, you can try restoring the original configuration file that worked last time. You may have made other changes to the configuration file since then, so make sure to backup the current configuration file before restoring the old one.\n3. It's also possible that the issue is not related to the line you added but to another configuration error. You can check the proFTP logs (usually located in the XAMPP installation directory) to see if there are any error messages that can help identify the problem.\n4. Finally, you can try reinstalling XAMPP and proFTP to start with a clean installation. This will reset all configuration files to their default settings",
