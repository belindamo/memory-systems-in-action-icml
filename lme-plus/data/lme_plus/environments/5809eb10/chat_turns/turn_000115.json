Speaking of which, I received an invitation to my high school reunion, which is scheduled to take place on July 15th. It's hard to believe it's been 10 years since I graduated! I'm planning to attend with some of my close friends from back in the day. Do you have any advice on how to make the most of the reunion itself?",
