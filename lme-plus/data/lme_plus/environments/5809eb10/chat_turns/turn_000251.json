Sticking to the Earl Grey for now is perfectly fine, and you can always experiment with other flavors later on.\n\nIt's interesting that you've adjusted your tea break time to 2:30 pm. Sometimes, making small changes to our routine can have a big impact. Having your tea break a bit earlier might be helping you tackle the post-lunch slump and stay focused during the afternoon.\n\nDo you find that you're more productive or energized after your 2:30 pm tea break? And are there any other habits or routines that you're incorporating into your daily schedule to help you stay focused and motivated?",
