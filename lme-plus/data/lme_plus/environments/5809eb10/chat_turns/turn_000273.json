You can choose to wear traditional Native American clothing or casual attire. Avoid wearing clothing with offensive images or slogans. 2. Comfortable shoes - Wear comfortable shoes as you may be standing or walking for an extended period. 3. Bring a chair or blanket - It's a good idea to bring a comfortable chair or blanket to sit on, as seating may be limited. 4. Sunscreen and hat - Bring sunscreen as the powwow may be held outdoors and a hat to protect from the sun. 5. Respectful behavior - Be respectful and attentive during the events. Avoid taking pictures without permission, and always be mindful of your surroundings. 6. Bring cash - Bring cash as some powwows may have vendors selling Native American crafts, food, and souvenirs. 7. Water - Bring a water bottle to stay hydrated. These are just a few things to keep in mind to ensure you have a comfortable and respectful experience at a powwow.",
