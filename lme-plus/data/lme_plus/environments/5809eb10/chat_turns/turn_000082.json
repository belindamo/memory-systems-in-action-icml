  "content": "Sure, here is an example of a 4-week lesson plan that employs the Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) model using some readily available resources:\n\nWeek 1:\n\n* I Do It: Introduce the topic of the week, which is rhyming words. Show students a video about rhyming words (e.g. \"Rhyming Words for Kids\" on YouTube).\n* We Do It: Have students work in pairs to come up with as many rhyming words as they can for a given word (e.g. \"cat\"). Provide guidance and support as needed.\n* You Do It: Assign students to find and read a short story or poem that contains rhyming words. Have them highlight or underline the rhyming words and then discuss their findings with the class.\n\nWeek 2:\n\n* I Do It: Introduce the concept of syllables. Show students a video about syllables (e.g. \"Syllables for Kids\" on YouTube).\n* We Do It: Have students work in small groups to clap and count the syllables in words (e.g. \"butterfly\"). Provide guidance and support as needed.\n* You Do It: Assign students to find and read a short story or poem that contains words with different number of syllables. Have them clap and count the syllables in the words, and then discuss their findings with the class.\n\nWeek 3:\n\n* I Do It: Introduce the concept of prefixes and suffixes. Show students a video about prefixes and suffixes (e.g. \"Prefixes and Suffixes for Kids\" on YouTube).\n* We Do It: Have students work in pairs to identify and define prefixes and suffixes in words (e.g. \"unhappy\"). Provide guidance and support as needed.\n* You Do It: Assign students to find and read a short story or poem that contains words with prefixes and suffixes. Have them identify and define the prefixes and suffixes in the words, and then discuss their findings with the class.\n\nWeek 4:\n\n* I Do It: Review the concepts of rhyming words, syllables, prefixes, and suffixes. Show students a video that combines all of these concepts (e.g. \"Rhyming Words, Syllables, Prefixes and Suffixes for Kids\" on YouTube).\n* We Do It: Have students work in small groups to create a short poem that includes rhyming words, different number of syllables, and words with prefixes and suffixes. Provide guidance and support as needed.\n* You Do It: Have students present their poems to the class and discuss the elements of rhyming words, syllables, prefixes, and suffixes that they included in their poems.\n\nNote: These are just examples and you can adjust the resources to the level of your students. Also, you can add more activities and also, make sure to assess the students' understanding and adjust your instruction accordingly.",
