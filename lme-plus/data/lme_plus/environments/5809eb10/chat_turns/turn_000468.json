  "content": "Fragging is one of the most popular and effective coral propagation methods. It involves cutting or breaking off a portion of a healthy coral colony, known as a frag, and attaching it to a new substrate or plug. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to prepare frags for attachment:\n\n**Fragging Methods:**\n\n1. **Cutting:** Use coral cutters or scissors to cut the coral colony into smaller pieces, making sure each frag has at least 2-3 polyps.\n2. **Breaking:** Gently break off a portion of the coral colony using a gentle twisting motion, making sure each frag has at least 2-3 polyps.\n\n**Preparing Frags for Attachment:**\n\n1. **Clean and Prepare the Frag:** Rinse the frag gently in a separate container with tank water to remove any debris or loose tissue.\n2. **Trim Excess Tissue:** Use coral cutters or scissors to trim any excess tissue or dead coral from the frag, making sure to leave enough tissue to attach to the substrate or plug.\n3. **Apply Coral Glue:** Apply a small amount of coral glue (e.g., epoxy or cyanoacrylate) to the base of the frag, making sure to cover the entire area that will be attached to the substrate or plug.\n4. **Attach to Substrate or Plug:** Gently press the frag onto the substrate or plug, making sure it's securely attached. Hold the frag in place for a few seconds to ensure it adheres properly.\n5. **Secure with Rubber Bands or Clips:** If necessary, use rubber bands or clips to hold the frag in place until the glue sets.\n\n**Tips and Considerations:**\n\n* **Handle Frags Carefully:** Handle frags gently to avoid damaging them and causing stress to the coral.\n* **Use the Right Glue:** Choose a coral glue that's suitable for the type of coral you're working with and follows the manufacturer's instructions.\n* **Monitor Water Parameters:** Ensure the water parameters in the tank are stable and within the acceptable range for the coral species being propagated.\n* **Provide Proper Lighting and Water Flow:** Provide the frags with proper lighting and water flow to promote healthy growth and attachment.\n\n**Post-Fragging Care:**\n\n* **Monitor the Frag:** Observe the frag regularly to ensure it's attaching properly and showing signs of growth.\n* **Provide Regular Water Changes:** Perform regular water changes (10-15% every week) to maintain optimal water quality and promote healthy growth.\n* **Feed the Coral:** Feed the coral regularly with small meaty foods, such as brine shrimp or mysis shrimp, to promote healthy growth and development.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you'll be able to successfully prepare frags for attachment and promote healthy growth in your coral propagation tank.",
