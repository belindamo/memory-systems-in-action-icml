  "content": "Vaccines work by introducing a small or weakened form of a pathogen into the body. This allows the immune system to recognize the pathogen and create antibodies to fight against it. If the person is later exposed to the same pathogen, their immune system is prepared to quickly respond and fight off the infection.\n\nVaccines are important for global health because they are one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. They have played a critical role in eradicating diseases such as smallpox and reducing the incidence of others such as polio and measles. Vaccines also protect individuals who cannot be vaccinated, such as those with weakened immune systems or allergies. They help to create herd immunity, which means that when a large percentage of a population is vaccinated, even those who are not vaccinated are less likely to become infected. This helps to reduce the spread of diseases and protect vulnerable populations. Overall, vaccines have saved millions of lives and continue to be a critical tool in promoting global health.",
