Here are some tips on how to reach out to your old friends and what to talk about when you catch up:\n\n**Reaching Out:**\n\n1. **Choose the right medium**: Consider the best way to reach out to your friends. Social media, email, or a phone call may be the most convenient, but a personalized message or letter can be more meaningful.\n2. **Start with a casual approach**: Begin with a lighthearted, casual message or post. You might say something like, \"Hey, long time no talk! How have you been?\" or \"I was thinking about old times and wanted to catch up.\"\n3. **Reference a shared memory**: If you have a shared memory or inside joke, bring it up to break the ice and spark conversation.\n4. **Keep it brief**: Keep your initial message brief and to the point. You don't want to overwhelm your friend with too much information or questions at once.\n\n**What to Talk About:**\n\n1. **Catch up on each other's lives**: Ask open-ended questions about your friend's life, such as \"What have you been up to since graduation?\" or \"How's your family?\" Listen actively and show genuine interest in their responses.\n2. **Share your own updates**: Open up about your life, including your accomplishments, challenges, and changes.

This can help rekindle your connection and create a sense of nostalgia.\n\n**Conversation Starters:**\n\n1. **What have you been up to since graduation?**\n2. **How's your family?**\n3. **What's the most exciting thing that's happened to you in the past 10 years?**\n4. **Do you have any fun plans or vacations coming up?**\n5. **What do you think about the reunion? Are you excited or nervous?**\n\n**Tips for the Conversation:**\n\n1. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to what your friend is saying and show that you care about their life and experiences.\n2. **Be honest and authentic**: Be yourself and don't try to pretend to be someone you're not.\n3. **Avoid controversy**: Steer clear of sensitive or controversial topics that might make your friend uncomfortable.\n4. **Keep it light**: Keep the conversation light and enjoyable.
