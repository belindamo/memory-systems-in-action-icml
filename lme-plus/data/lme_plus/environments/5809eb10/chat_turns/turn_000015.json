  "content": "I'm happy to help you explore new genres! However, I have to correct you - Jennifer Weiner didn't write \"Who Did It\". It's possible that you're thinking of a different author or title.\n\nThat being said, if you enjoyed Jennifer Weiner's style, you might like authors who write in a similar vein, such as Emily Giffin, Taylor Jenkins Reid, or Colleen Hoover. But if you're looking to venture out of contemporary fiction, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Mystery/Thriller:**\n\t* Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn: A psychological thriller about a marriage that takes a dark and unexpected turn.\n\t* The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides: A psychological thriller about a famous painter who shoots her husband and refuses to speak after the incident.\n2. **Science Fiction/Fantasy:**\n\t* The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern: A magical realist tale about a competition between two young magicians who are bound together by a magical contract.\n\t* The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North: A thought-provoking novel about a man who is reborn every time he dies, and must navigate a complex web of time travel and cause and effect.\n3. **Historical Fiction:**\n\t* The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah: A historical novel set in France during World War II, following two sisters as they navigate the war and its aftermath.\n\t* The Alice Network by Kate Quinn: A historical novel based on the true story of a socialite and a female spy from the Alice Network, a real-life espionage ring, during World War I.\n4. **Romance:**\n\t* The Hating Game by Sally Thorne: A romantic comedy about two co-workers who engage in a series of escalating pranks and one-upmanship until they realize their feelings for each other.\n\t* The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger: A romantic novel about a man with a genetic disorder that causes him to time-travel, and his relationship with his wife.\n5. **Non-Fiction:**\n\t* Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari: A sweeping narrative that covers the entire history of humankind, from the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa to the present day.\n\t* The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot: A fascinating story about the life of Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells were taken without her knowledge and led to numerous scientific breakthroughs.\n\nI hope you find something that piques your interest!",
