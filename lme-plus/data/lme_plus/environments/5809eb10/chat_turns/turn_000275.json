What a wonderful reason to celebrate!\n\nI'd be delighted to help you with some baby-themed party decoration ideas that are perfect for an adoption celebration:\n\n1. **Blue and White Balloons**: Use balloons in various shades of blue to create an ombre effect. You can also add white balloons with blue polka dots or stripes to add some visual interest.\n2. **Adoption-Themed Banners**: Create a custom banner with a message like \"Welcome to the Family, Little One!\" or \"Love Grows Through Adoption.\" You can also use a banner with a onesie and a heart, symbolizing the love and care that comes with adoption.\n3. **Baby Blocks and Toys**: Set up a display of baby blocks, rattles, and soft toys in blue and white to create a playful atmosphere. You can also hang them from the ceiling or create a mobile to add a whimsical touch.\n4. **Foster Care-Themed Decor**: Consider using decorations that acknowledge the foster care system, such as a \"Foster Care to Forever Family\" sign or a \"Love Knows No Bounds\" banner.\n5. **Onesie Garland**: Hang a garland made of onesies in various sizes, with the smallest onesie representing the new baby boy. This is a heartwarming way to celebrate the baby's arrival.\n6. **Baby Footprint Art**: Create a beautiful piece of art using baby footprints in blue ink or paint. You can add the baby's name and the adoption date to make it extra special.\n7. **Nursery Rhyme Elements**: Incorporate elements from popular nursery rhymes, such as a \"Humpty Dumpty\" wall, a \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" mobile, or a \"Rock-a-Bye Baby\" swing.\n8. **Personalized Centerpieces**: Use picture frames with photos of the adoptive family, the baby's journey, or inspirational quotes about adoption. You can also add candles, flowers, or small toys to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n9. **Baby Book Station**: Set up a station where guests can write notes, advice, or wishes for the baby boy. This will create a beautiful keepsake for the family to treasure.\n10. **Cake and Cupcake Tower**: Design a cake or cupcake tower with a baby boy theme, complete with blue and white frosting, baby blocks, or onesies.\n\nRegarding your newborn nephew Ethan, congratulations to your family! 7 pounds is a healthy weight for a newborn, and it's wonderful that you got to meet him so soon. Enjoy this special time with your family!\n\nRemember to have fun planning the party, and I'm sure your friends will appreciate the thought and love you're putting into celebrating their new addition.",
