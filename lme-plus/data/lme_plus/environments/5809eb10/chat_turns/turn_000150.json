Fans may be gradually allowed back into the stadium; however, they will be required to observe COVID-19 protocols such as wearing masks, social distancing, and regular temperature checks. There might also be a limit on the number of fans that can attend games to allow for social distancing and reduce the risk of transmission. \n\nSports organizations may continue to rely on technology to host virtual events and engage with fans who cannot attend games physically. There will be a significant increase in the use of online platforms to purchase and access sports-related content. \n\nAdditionally, there may be new modifications that will be carried beyond the pandemic, such as the use of video assistant referees (VARs) in preventing potentially dangerous physical contact between players. \n\nOverall, sports organizations will have to adjust to the new normal and find innovative ways to continue engaging fans while keeping them safe. The future of professional sports will likely be different from what we had pre-pandemic, but fans can still look forward to their favorite games, albeit with some necessary modifications to ensure their safety.",
