  "content": "What a fascinating experiment! Smoked orange bitters can add a unique twist to the classic Negroni. To make the most of this combination, I'd recommend modifying the classic recipe to accommodate the smoky flavor. Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Smoked Orange Negroni Recipe:**\n\n* 1 1/2 oz (45 ml) Gin (choose a citrus-forward or herbal gin to complement the orange and smoky flavors)\n* 1/2 oz (15 ml) Sweet Vermouth ( opt for a sweet vermouth with a rich, fruity flavor profile to balance the smokiness)\n* 1/2 oz (15 ml) Campari\n* 2-3 dashes Smoked Orange Bitters\n* Orange twist or slice, for garnish\n\n**Modifications:**\n\n1. **Reduce the Campari ratio**: Since the smoked orange bitters will add a bold flavor, consider reducing the Campari ratio to 0.75 oz (22.5 ml) or even 0.5 oz (15 ml) to allow the other flavors to shine.\n2. **Add a smoky element to the sweet vermouth**: Infuse your sweet vermouth with a smoky flavor by adding a dash or two of smoked orange bitters to the vermouth before mixing the drink. This will help integrate the smokiness throughout the cocktail.\n3. **Choose a gin with a complementary flavor profile**: Select a gin with a citrus-forward or herbal flavor profile to complement the orange and smoky flavors. This will help create a harmonious balance between the ingredients.\n4. **Experiment with the bitters ratio**: Start with 2-3 dashes of smoked orange bitters and adjust to taste. You may find that you prefer a stronger or weaker smoky flavor, depending on your personal taste.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To amplify the smoky flavor, consider adding a small amount of mezcal or smoky whiskey to the mix.\n* If you prefer a more subtle smokiness, try using a smaller amount of smoked orange bitters or substituting with a different type of bitters, like orange or citrus bitters.\n* Experiment with different garnishes, such as a smoked orange slice or a sprig of rosemary, to enhance the aromatic experience.\n\nRemember, the key to successfully incorporating bitters into a Negroni is to balance the flavors. Start with a small amount of bitters and adjust to taste, as the smokiness can quickly overpower the other ingredients.\n\nEmbrace the experiment, and I hope you discover a unique and delicious Smoked Orange Negroni variation that you'll enjoy!",
