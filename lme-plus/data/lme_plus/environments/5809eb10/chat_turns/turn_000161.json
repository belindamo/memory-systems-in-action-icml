  "content": "I've been experimenting with different types of bitters at home, and I recently bought a few bottles of artisanal bitters online, including a smoked orange bitters and a chocolate mole bitters. I've been adding them to my Old Fashioneds and Manhattans, and it's amazing how much depth they add to the flavor. Do you have any recommendations for pairing bitters with other cocktails, like a Daiquiri or Whiskey Sour?",
