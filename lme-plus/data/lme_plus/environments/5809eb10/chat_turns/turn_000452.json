You mentioned earlier that you have it on \"certain days\" of the week, but I didn't get the exact days.\n\nWhy don't we try to incorporate your oatmeal breakfast into the schedule? Let's say you have oatmeal with banana and honey on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and try out new breakfast ideas on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. This way, you can still enjoy your familiar breakfast routine while experimenting with new options.\n\nHere's an updated schedule with oatmeal breakfasts on Tuesdays and Thursdays:\n\n**Monday to Friday Schedule:**\n\n* Monday: Breakfast (new idea, e.g., scrambled eggs with spinach and whole-grain toast)\n* Tuesday: Breakfast (oatmeal with banana and honey)\n* Wednesday: Breakfast (new idea, e.g., Greek yogurt with berries and granola)\n* Thursday: Breakfast (oatmeal with banana and honey)\n* Friday: Breakfast (new idea, e.g., avocado toast on whole-grain bread with a fried egg)\n\nFeel free to adjust this schedule as needed, and let me know if you have any other preferences or dietary restrictions!",
