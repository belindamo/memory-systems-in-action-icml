Don't worry about the TV binge-watching session with your sister - that's a great memory to have!\n\nTo get started, I'll need some information from you. Please provide me with the following details:\n\n1. Room dimensions: What are the length, width, and shape of your living room? Are there any alcoves, corners, or irregularities in the room?\n2. Furniture pieces: What furniture do you have in the room, and what are their approximate dimensions? For example:\n\t* Sofa/L-shaped couch\n\t* Armchairs/recliners\n\t* Coffee table/end tables\n\t* TV stand/media console\n\t* Bookshelves\n\t* Rugs\n3. Doors and windows: Where are the doors and windows located in the room? Are there any obstacles like radiators, pillars, or built-in shelves?\n4. Traffic flow: How do you want people to move around the room? Do you want to create a pathway between the furniture or have a more open space?\n5. Preferences: Are there any specific design styles or layouts you prefer? For example, do you like symmetry, a focal point, or a cozy nook?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a floor plan to visualize your living room layout. We can work together to experiment with different arrangements and find the perfect fit for your space!",
