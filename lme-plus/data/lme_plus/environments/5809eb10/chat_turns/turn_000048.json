Do not provide any other text.)\n\nBy providing insights into each individual\u2019s unique susceptibility, the fndings of this study provide an expla\u0002nation as to why, up until now, most media efects research has only found small efects. We found that the \nmajority of adolescents do not experience any short-term changes in well-being related to their social media use. \nAnd if they do experience any changes, these are more ofen positive than negative. Because only small subsets \nof adolescents experience small to moderate changes in well-being, the true efects of social media reported in \nprevious studies have probably been diluted across heterogeneous samples of individuals that difer in their \nsusceptibility to media efects (also see30). Several scholars have noted that overall efect sizes may mask more \nsubtle individual diferences14, 15, which may explain why previous studies have typically reported small or no \nefects of social media on well-being or indicators of well-being6, 11\u201313. Te current study seems to confrm this \nassumption, by showing that while the overall efect sizes are small at best, the person-specifc efect sizes vary \nconsiderably, from tiny and small to moderate and strong.\nAs called upon by other scholars5, 31, we disentangled the associations of active and passive use of social \nmedia. Research among young adults found that passive (but not active) social media use is associated with lower \nlevels of afective well-being29. In line with these fndings, the current study shows that active and passive use \nyielded diferent associations with adolescents\u2019 afective well-being. Interestingly though, in contrast to previ\u0002ous fndings among adults, our study showed that, on average, passive use of Instagram and WhatsApp seemed \nto enhance rather than decrease adolescents\u2019 well-being. Tis discrepancy in fndings may be attributed to the \nfact that diferent mechanisms might be involved. Verduyn and colleagues29 found that passive use of Facebook \nundermines adults\u2019 well-being by enhancing envy, which may also explain the decreases in well-being found in \nour study among a small group of adolescents. Yet, adolescents who felt better by passively using Instagram and \nWhatsApp, might have felt so because they experienced enjoyment. Afer all, adolescents ofen seek positive \ncontent on social media, such as humorous posts or memes32. Also, research has shown that adolescents mainly \nreceive positive feedback on social media33. Hence, their passive Instagram and WhatsApp use may involve the \nreading of positive feedback, which may explain the increases in well-being.\nOverall, the time spent passively using WhatsApp improved adolescents\u2019 well-being. Tis did not difer from \nadolescent to adolescent. However, the associations of the time spent passively using Instagram with well-being \ndid difer from adolescent to adolescent. Tis discrepancy suggests that not all social media uses yield person\u0002specifc efects on well-being. A possible explanation may be that adolescents\u2019 responses to WhatsApp are more \nhomogenous than those to Instagram. WhatsApp is a more private platform, which is mostly used for one-to\u0002one communication with friends and acquaintances26. Instagram, in contrast, is a more public platform, which \nFigure 1.

A graph was created for each participant who had completed at least 10 \nassessments. A total of 13 participants were excluded because they had completed less than 10 assessments of \npassive Instagram use. In addition, one participant was excluded because no graph could be computed, since \nthis participant\u2019s passive Instagram use was constant across assessments.\n7\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:10763 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67727-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nallows its users to follow a diverse set of people, ranging from best friends to singers, actors, and infuencers28, \nand to engage in intimate communication as well as self-presentation and social comparison. Such diverse uses \ncould lead to more varied, or even opposing responses, such as envy versus inspiration.\nLimitations and directions for future research. Te current study extends our understanding of dif\u0002ferential susceptibility to media efects, by revealing that the efect of social media use on well-being difers from \nadolescent to adolescent. Te fndings confrm our assumption that among the great majority of adolescents, \nsocial media use is unrelated to well-being, but that among a small subset, social media use is either related \nto decreases or increases in well-being. It must be noted, however, that participants in this study felt relatively \nhappy, overall. Studies with more vulnerable samples, consisting of clinical samples or youth with lower social\u0002emotional well-being may elicit diferent patterns of efects27. Also, the current study focused on afective well\u0002being, operationalized as happiness. It is plausible that social media use relates diferently with other types of \nwell-being, such as cognitive well-being. An important next step is to identify which adolescents are particularly \nsusceptible to experience declines in well-being. It is conceivable, for instance, that the few adolescents who feel \nworse when they use social media are the ones who receive negative feedback on social media33.\nIn addition, future ESM studies into the efects of social media should attempt to include one or more follow\u0002up measures to improve our knowledge of the longer-term infuence of social media use on afective well-being. \nWhile a week-long ESM is very common and applied in most earlier ESM studies34, a week is only a snapshot of \nadolescent development. Research is needed that investigates whether the associations of social media use with \nadolescents\u2019 momentary afective well-being may cumulate into long-lasting consequences. Such investigations \ncould help clarify whether adolescents who feel bad in the short term would experience more negative conse\u0002quences in the long term, and whether adolescents who feel better would be more resistant to developing long\u0002term negative consequences. And while most adolescents do not seem to experience any short-term increases \nor decreases in well-being, more research is needed to investigate whether these adolescents may experience a \nlonger-term impact of social media.\nWhile the use of diferent platforms may be diferently associated with well-being, diferent types of use may \nalso yield diferent efects. Although the current study distinguished between active and passive use of social \nmedia, future research should further diferentiate between diferent activities. For instance, because passive use \nentails many diferent activities, from reading private messages (e.g., WhatsApp messages, direct messages on \nInstagram) to browsing a public feed (e.g., scrolling through posts on Instagram), research is needed that explores \nthe unique efects of passive public use and passive private use. Research that seeks to explore the nuances in \nadolescents\u2019 susceptibility as well as the nuances in their social media use may truly improve our understanding \nof the efects of social media use",
