  "content": "Bitters are a great way to add depth and complexity to a Negroni! While Campari is a key ingredient in a classic Negroni, adding a few dashes of complementary bitters can elevate the drink to new heights. Here are some bitters that pair well with a Negroni:\n\n1. **Orange Bitters**: Orange bitters can enhance the citrus notes in the Negroni and add a subtle sweetness. Try using 1-2 dashes of orange bitters to complement the Campari.\n2. **Chocolate Mole Bitters**: These bitters can add a rich, chocolatey flavor to the Negroni, which pairs nicely with the bitter and sweet elements. Use 1-2 dashes to add depth and complexity.\n3. **Cocoa Nib Bitters**: Similar to chocolate mole bitters, cocoa nib bitters can add a deep, chocolatey flavor to the Negroni. Use 1-2 dashes to add a luxurious twist.\n4. **Grapefruit Bitters**: Grapefruit bitters can add a bright, citrusy flavor to the Negroni, cutting through the richness of the Campari. Use 1-2 dashes to add a refreshing twist.\n5. **Aromatic Bitters**: Aromatic bitters, like those from Angostura or Fee Brothers, can add a warm, spicy flavor to the Negroni. Use 1-2 dashes to add depth and warmth.\n6. **Lavender Bitters**: Lavender bitters can add a floral, herbal flavor to the Negroni, which pairs nicely with the botanicals in the gin. Use 1-2 dashes to add a unique twist.\n\nRemember, when working with bitters, a little goes a long way. Start with 1 dash (about 2-3 drops) and adjust to taste. You can always add more bitters, but it's harder to remove the flavor once it's been added.\n\nSome popular bitters brands to consider include:\n\n* Angostura\n* Fee Brothers\n* Scrappy's\n* Bittercube\n* The Bitter Truth\n\nExperiment with different bitters and flavor combinations to find the perfect pairing for your Negroni. Have fun and happy mixing!",
