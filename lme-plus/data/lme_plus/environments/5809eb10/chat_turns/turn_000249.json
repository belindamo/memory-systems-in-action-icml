  "content": "It sounds like the switch to tea is having a really positive impact on you. The reduced jitters are likely due to the lower caffeine content in tea compared to coffee, and the increased focus might be attributed to the L-theanine in the tea, which is known for promoting relaxation and concentration.\n\nIt's also wonderful that you're supporting a local caf\u00e9 by buying the Earl Grey tea bags from them. Shopping locally can make a big difference in the community, and it's great that you're investing in a business that you enjoy.\n\nHave you tried any other teas from the caf\u00e9, or are you sticking to the Earl Grey for now? And do you find that you're more inclined to visit the caf\u00e9 now that you're buying their tea?",
