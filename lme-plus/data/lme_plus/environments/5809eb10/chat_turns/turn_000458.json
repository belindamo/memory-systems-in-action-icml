The combination of fiber, protein, and healthy fats will keep you full and satisfied between meals.\n\nMaking homemade granola is a great idea! It's a fantastic way to control the ingredients and sugar content, and you can customize it to your taste preferences. You can also use it as a topping for your oatmeal or yogurt for added crunch.\n\nRemember, the key to healthy snacking is to focus on whole, unprocessed foods and portion control. Aim for snacks that are nutrient-dense and low in added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your new snacks and homemade granola!\n\nBest of luck with your meal prep and healthy habits journey!",
