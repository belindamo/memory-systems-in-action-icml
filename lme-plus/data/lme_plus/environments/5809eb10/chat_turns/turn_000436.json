If not, it might not be the best use of his time or yours.\n2. **Value proposition:** What's in it for John? Is there a clear benefit for him to attend or participate in your meetup? Make sure you can articulate the value he'll gain from attending.\n3. **Overwhelming your network:** Be mindful of not overwhelming your network with too many requests or invitations. Space out your outreach efforts to avoid fatigue.\n\nIf you do decide to reach out to John, consider a gentle, non-committal message, such as:\n\n\"Hi John, great catching up with you at TechCon! I'm organizing a meetup for my professional network in June and thought you might be interested in attending. The topic is [topic] and I think you'd find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested and available, and I'll send over more details.\"\n\nThis approach allows John to opt-in or out without feeling obligated, and you're not committing him to anything just yet.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Keep your messages personalized and concise.\n* Make sure you're not duplicating efforts or sending the same message to everyone.\n* Consider creating a list or spreadsheet to track your outreach efforts and follow-ups.\n* Be respectful of people's time and decisions, whether they're interested or not.\n\nBy being thoughtful and strategic in your outreach, you'll increase the chances of getting positive responses and building a strong, engaged community for your meetup.",
