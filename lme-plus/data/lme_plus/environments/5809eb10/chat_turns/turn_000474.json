Admins have full control over the system, while Tagers and Checkers have specific permissions to tag and verify annotations respectively.\n* Task Management: The system allows Admins to create tasks, assign them to specific users, set due dates, and view the progress of the task. The task management screen shows a list of all documents assigned to the task, and information about who is the Tagger, Checker, assigned date, due date, and description.\n* Annotation Tool: The system includes a tool for Tagers to annotate documents. The tool allows Tagers to view the document and add annotations using different labels and classifications.\n* Data Export: The system allows Data Scientists to access annotated data through an API. The API provides access to a dataset of completed documents, and allows for detailed information about the data, including who created it, who annotated it, labels, classifications, and more.\n4.
