Homeowners invest a significant amount of time and money into building their dream homes, and it is essential to have legal protection to ensure that their investment is safeguarded. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the case, focusing on the legal issues involved, the decision made by the court, and the lessons that homeowners can learn from it.\n\nBackground:\nThe background of the case involves the construction of a new home in New South Wales, Australia, by the plaintiff, Mr. Bajimaya, and the defendant, Reward Homes Pty Ltd. The construction of the house began in 2014, and the contract was signed between the parties in 2015. The agreement stated that the construction would be completed by October 2015, but the defendant failed to finish the work within the agreed timeframe.\n\nAfter several delays, the plaintiff received the keys to the house in December 2016, but he soon noticed several defects in the construction, including incomplete works, poor workmanship, and non-compliance with the building code. The plaintiff notified the defendant of these defects and requested rectification, but the defendant failed to address them promptly. The plaintiff then sought legal action against the defendant, claiming compensation for the cost of rectification and other damages.\nLegal Issues and Analysis\n\nThe legal issues in the case of Bajimaya v Reward Homes Pty Ltd [2021] NSWCATAP 297 primarily centered around whether the builder had breached its contractual obligations to the homeowner, Mr. Bajimaya, and whether Mr. Bajimaya was entitled to compensation for the defects in the construction of his home.\n\nThe tribunal found that Reward Homes Pty Ltd had breached its contract with Mr. Bajimaya by failing to complete the work in a proper and workmanlike manner, failing to comply with the plans and specifications, and failing to comply with the Building Code of Australia. Specifically, the tribunal found that the workmanship was of a poor standard, there were defects in the waterproofing, tiling, and brickwork, and the home was not constructed in accordance with the approved plans.\n\nThe tribunal also found that Mr. Bajimaya was entitled to compensation for the defects in his home.
