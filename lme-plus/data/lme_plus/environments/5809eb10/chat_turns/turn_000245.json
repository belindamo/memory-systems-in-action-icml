Honey has antibacterial properties and can help soothe a sore throat. Plus, it's a natural sweetener, so you can feel good about cutting down on refined sugars.\n\nHow's the transition from coffee to tea been treating you so far? Are you finding that the Earl Grey is helping you stay focused and energized throughout the day?",
