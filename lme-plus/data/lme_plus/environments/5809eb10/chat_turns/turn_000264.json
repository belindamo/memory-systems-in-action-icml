Like the time I commented on a YouTube video about a new skincare routine and the creator responded to me, saying they hadn't tried the product I mentioned but would check it out. Or when I commented on a LinkedIn post about a new AI tool and the CEO of the company messaged me to discuss potential collaborations. It's pretty cool when you can have meaningful conversations with people you admire or learn from! \ud83d\ude0a",
