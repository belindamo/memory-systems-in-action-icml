Here's an HR introduction email turned into a speech with a Nicki Minaj-inspired style:\n\nWhat's good, [Recipient]?\n\nIt's ya girl, Christina, and I'm an HR Executive, CCC grad, and a mother, holla! I wanted to drop you a line and introduce myself, so let's get down to business.\n\nI've been in the HR game for over [number of years] years, and during that time, I've been doing everything from recruitment to talent management to employee relations to benefits administration. I'm all about helping organizations grow and succeed, and I bring the heat every time.\n\nAnd let's talk about being a mom, okay? I know firsthand the importance of work-life balance, and I make it my mission to create workplaces that are productive and positive for everyone.\n\nSo here's the deal - I want to link up with you for a coffee, on me, to talk about how we can be thought partners. Let's see how we can work together to take things to the next level, you feel me?\n\nThanks for your time, [Recipient]. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you and seeing what kind of magic we can create together.\n\nPeace out,\n\nChristina [Last Name]",
