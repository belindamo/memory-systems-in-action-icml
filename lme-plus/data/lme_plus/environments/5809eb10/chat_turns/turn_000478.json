  "content": "Seattle in 5 days sounds like a great trip!\n\nAs for packing, Seattle's weather can be quite unpredictable, but I can give you some general guidelines.\n\n**Time of year:** You didn't mention the specific time of year you're planning to visit, but I'll provide information for the typical Seattle weather patterns.\n\n* **Spring (March to May)**: Mornings and evenings can be cool and rainy, with highs in the mid-50s to low 60s Fahrenheit (13\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C). A light jacket or water-repellent windbreaker would be a good choice.\n* **Summer (June to August)**: Warmest months, with highs in the mid-70s to mid-80s Fahrenheit (23\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C). A light jacket or sweater for cooler mornings and evenings would be sufficient.\n* **Fall (September to November)**: Similar to spring, with cooler mornings and evenings, and highs in the mid-50s to low 60s Fahrenheit (13\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C). A light jacket or water-repellent windbreaker would be a good choice.\n* **Winter (December to February)**: Coolest and wettest months, with highs in the mid-40s to low 50s Fahrenheit (7\u00b0C to 12\u00b0C). A heavier coat, waterproof jacket, or umbrella would be necessary.\n\n**Packing advice:**\n\n* If you're visiting during the shoulder season (spring or fall), a light jacket or water-repellent windbreaker should be sufficient.\n* If you're visiting during the winter months, bring a heavier coat or waterproof jacket to keep you dry and warm.\n* If you're visiting during the summer, a light jacket or sweater for cooler mornings and evenings would be a good idea.\n\nAs for your experience in Chicago, 7 shirts might have been excessive, but it's great that you're thinking about packing more efficiently!\n\nFor a 5-day trip to Seattle, consider packing:\n\n* 3-4 tops or shirts ( layers are key in Seattle's unpredictable weather)\n* 2-3 bottoms (jeans, trousers, or leggings)\n* 1-2 dresses or jumpsuits (optional)\n* 1 light jacket or sweater (depending on the time of year)\n* Undergarments and socks\n* Comfortable walking shoes or sneakers\n* Accessories like hats, scarves, and umbrellas (it's Seattle, after all!)\n\nRemember to check the weather forecast before your trip to ensure you're prepared for any unexpected weather conditions. Enjoy your trip to Seattle!",
