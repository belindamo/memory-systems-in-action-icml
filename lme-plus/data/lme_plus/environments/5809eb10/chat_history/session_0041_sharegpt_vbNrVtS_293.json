Admins have full control over the system, while Tagers and Checkers have specific permissions to tag and verify annotations respectively.\n* Task Management: The system allows Admins to create tasks, assign them to specific users, set due dates, and view the progress of the task. The task management screen shows a list of all documents assigned to the task, and information about who is the Tagger, Checker, assigned date, due date, and description.\n* Annotation Tool: The system includes a tool for Tagers to annotate documents. The tool allows Tagers to view the document and add annotations using different labels and classifications.\n* Data Export: The system allows Data Scientists to access annotated data through an API. The API provides access to a dataset of completed documents, and allows for detailed information about the data, including who created it, who annotated it, labels, classifications, and more.\n4. Getting Started:\n* Creating an Account: To use the system, you'll need to create an account. To do this, navigate to the sign-up page and enter your details. Once you have created an account, you will be able to log in and start using the system.\n* Creating a Task: Admins can create tasks by navigating to the task management screen and clicking the \"Create Task\" button. Fill in the required information and assign the task to the appropriate user(s).\n* Tagging Documents: Tagers can start annotating documents by navigating to the task management screen and clicking the \"Start Annotation\" button. The annotation tool will open, and Tagers can view the document and add annotations.\n* Verifying Annotations: Checkers can verify annotations by navigating to the task management screen and clicking the \"Verify Annotations\" button. The system will show the annotations made by the Tagger, and the Checker can verify or reject them.\n* Exporting Data: Data Scientists can access annotated data through the API. They can request data using specific commands, and the system will respond with the requested information.\n5. Troubleshooting:\n* Error Messages: If you encounter an error while using the system, you may receive an error message. Common error messages include \"Data not found\" and \"Data already downloaded\". If you receive an error message, refer to the API documentation for more information on how to resolve it.\n* Contact Support: If you have any questions or need help with the system, you can contact support through the help page. Our team will be happy to assist you."
