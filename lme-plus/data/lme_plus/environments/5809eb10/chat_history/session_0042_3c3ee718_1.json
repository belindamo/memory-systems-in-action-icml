      "content": "Seattle in 5 days sounds like a great trip!\n\nAs for packing, Seattle's weather can be quite unpredictable, but I can give you some general guidelines.\n\n**Time of year:** You didn't mention the specific time of year you're planning to visit, but I'll provide information for the typical Seattle weather patterns.\n\n* **Spring (March to May)**: Mornings and evenings can be cool and rainy, with highs in the mid-50s to low 60s Fahrenheit (13\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C). A light jacket or water-repellent windbreaker would be a good choice.\n* **Summer (June to August)**: Warmest months, with highs in the mid-70s to mid-80s Fahrenheit (23\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C). A light jacket or sweater for cooler mornings and evenings would be sufficient.\n* **Fall (September to November)**: Similar to spring, with cooler mornings and evenings, and highs in the mid-50s to low 60s Fahrenheit (13\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C).

A heavier coat, waterproof jacket, or umbrella would be necessary.\n\n**Packing advice:**\n\n* If you're visiting during the shoulder season (spring or fall), a light jacket or water-repellent windbreaker should be sufficient.\n* If you're visiting during the winter months, bring a heavier coat or waterproof jacket to keep you dry and warm.\n* If you're visiting during the summer, a light jacket or sweater for cooler mornings and evenings would be a good idea.\n\nAs for your experience in Chicago, 7 shirts might have been excessive, but it's great that you're thinking about packing more efficiently!\n\nFor a 5-day trip to Seattle, consider packing:\n\n* 3-4 tops or shirts ( layers are key in Seattle's unpredictable weather)\n* 2-3 bottoms (jeans, trousers, or leggings)\n* 1-2 dresses or jumpsuits (optional)\n* 1 light jacket or sweater (depending on the time of year)\n* Undergarments and socks\n* Comfortable walking shoes or sneakers\n* Accessories like hats, scarves, and umbrellas (it's Seattle, after all!)\n\nRemember to check the weather forecast before your trip to ensure you're prepared for any unexpected weather conditions.
