      "content": "I'd be happy to help you create a schedule and provide some healthy lunch ideas beyond salads and sandwiches.\n\n**Creating a Schedule:**\n\nTo create a schedule that works for you, let's break down your daily routine into manageable chunks. Please answer the following questions:\n\n1. What time do you wake up on weekdays?\n2. What are your work/school hours?\n3. How many hours of sleep do you aim to get each night?\n4. What are your top three priorities for your daily routine (e.g., exercise, meditation, reading, etc.)?\n5. How much time do you want to dedicate to meal prep and cooking each day?\n\nOnce you have these details, we can create a personalized schedule for you.\n\n**Healthy Lunch Ideas Beyond Salads and Sandwiches:**\n\nHere are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Soup and Crackers**: Prepare a big batch of soup on the weekend and portion it out for the week. Serve with whole-grain crackers or crusty bread.\n2. **Rice or Quinoa Bowls**: Cook a large batch of rice or quinoa and top with different ingredients each day, such as roasted vegetables, grilled chicken, or avocado.\n3. **Stuffed Bell Peppers**: Fill bell peppers with a mix of cooked rice, beans, and vegetables, and bake until tender.\n4. **Mason Jar Meals**: Layer cooked vegetables, beans, and grains in a mason jar for a quick and easy meal.\n5. **Wraps (not sandwiches!)**: Use large lettuce leaves or collard green wraps as a low-carb alternative to traditional wraps. Fill with ingredients like hummus, avocado, and veggies.\n6. **Mini Casseroles**: Prepare individual-sized casseroles in muffin tins for a fun and easy meal.\n7. **Veggie and Bean Chili**: Cook a big batch of chili on the weekend and serve with a side of whole-grain crackers or cornbread.\n8. **Grilled Vegetable Skewers**: Alternate vegetables like cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and bell peppers on skewers and grill until tender. Serve with quinoa or brown rice.\n9. **Lentil or Veggie Burgers**: Prepare a batch of lentil or veggie burgers on the weekend and serve on a bed of greens or with a side of roasted vegetables.\n10. **Breakfast for Lunch**: Scrambled eggs, whole-grain toast, and saut\u00e9ed vegetables make for a satisfying and healthy lunch.\n\nWhich of these ideas resonates with you, or do you have any dietary restrictions I should keep in mind?\n\nLet's get started on creating your personalized schedule and meal prep plan!"

Season with sea salt and chili powder for added flavor.\n7. **Cut Veggies with Ranch or Tzatziki**: Dip raw or blanched veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots in a homemade ranch or tzatziki sauce for a creamy snack.\n8. **Apple Slices with Almond Butter**: A classic combination that's both healthy and delicious.\n9. **Cottage Cheese**: High in protein and low in calories, cottage cheese is an excellent snack when paired with fruit or veggies.\n10. **Homemade Granola**: Whip up a batch of homemade granola with rolled oats, nuts, and seeds for a crunchy snack that's perfect for munching on the go.\n11. **Smoothie Cubes**: Prepare individual smoothie cubes with frozen fruit, spinach, and almond milk for a quick and easy snack.\n12. **Roasted Chickpeas**: Season roasted chickpeas with herbs and spices for a crunchy and satisfying snack.\n\nRemember, portion control is key when it comes to snacking.
