I'm looking forward to running through the entire show one last time and making sure I'm comfortable with all the transitions and cues. I'm also hoping to get a sense of the overall energy and pacing of the performance, so I can make any final adjustments before the shows.\n\nOne area I'm specifically focusing on is the school dance fight scene. I took a workshop on stage combat a few weeks ago, and I want to make sure I'm executing the choreographed fight moves safely and confidently. I'll be paying close attention to my movements and reactions during the rehearsal to ensure I'm in sync with the other cast members.\n\nOverall, I'm feeling pretty confident about the show, but I'm also aware that there's always room for improvement. I'm looking forward to getting feedback from the director and other cast members during the rehearsal to help me refine my performance.\n\nWhat do you think about my plan to focus on the school",
