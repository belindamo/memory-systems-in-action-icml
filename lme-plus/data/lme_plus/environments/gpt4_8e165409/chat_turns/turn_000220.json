  "content": "2 episodes per day is a great pace, and you'll likely finish the season within 5 days.\n\nAs for other intense dramas on Netflix, I've got some fantastic recommendations for you:\n\n1. **Narcos: Mexico**: A spin-off of the original Narcos series, this show explores the rise of the Guadalajara cartel in the 1980s. It's a gripping and intense ride with outstanding performances.\n2. **When They See Us**: A powerful and emotional miniseries based on the true story of the Central Park Five, five teenagers wrongly accused of a crime in the 1980s. It's a thought-provoking and intense drama that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.\n3. **The Sinner**: A crime drama that follows a young mother who commits a public act of violence without apparent motive. The show's atmospheric and intense, with a strong performance from Jessica Biel.\n4. **Killing Eve**: A spy thriller that follows a cat-and-mouse game between an MI6 agent and a psychopathic assassin. It's a stylish and intense show with great performances from Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer.\n5. **You**: A psychological thriller about a bookstore manager who becomes obsessed with a customer. It's a dark and intense show that explores themes of obsession, toxic relationships, and social media.\n\nAll of these shows offer a similar level of intensity and drama as Ozark, so you might enjoy them if you're in the mood for something serious and gripping.\n\nRemember, these shows deal with mature themes, strong language, and graphic content, so viewer discretion is advised.\n\nWhich one of these shows catches your attention, or do you want to explore other options?",
