  "content": "No, the new US $100 bill does not have two pockets embedded along the vertical blue line. The most recent design of the US $100 bill was released in 2013, and it features a blue security strip that runs vertically down the right-hand side of the bill. This blue security strip contains images of bells and 100s that move and change as the bill is tilted, but it does not have any pockets or other physical features embedded within it. The blue security strip is one of several anti-counterfeiting measures included in the design of the new $100 bill.",
