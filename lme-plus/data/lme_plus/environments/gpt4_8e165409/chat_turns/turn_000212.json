While some governments have taken steps to prevent disasters, there is always room for improvement. It is important for governments to prioritize proactive measures and invest in disaster prevention and risk reduction strategies. This may involve identifying and mitigating hazards, improving early warning systems, improving land use planning and building codes, and promoting sustainable practices that can mitigate the impact of natural disasters. It is also important for governments to work closely with affected communities to understand their needs and experiences, and tailor their disaster prevention and response efforts accordingly.",
