  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have a personal opinion. However, to make progress and find a balance between economic and environmental concerns during international climate change negotiations, countries need to take a collaborative approach. All countries must agree to consider both economic and environmental factors when discussing climate policies. Countries with advanced economies must support developing countries in their transition to a low-carbon economy by providing financial and technological assistance. On the other hand, developing countries should consider the economic benefits of shifting towards clean energy sources when determining their long-term growth strategies. Additionally, climate policies need to be implemented in a way that promotes a just transition to a low-carbon economy without causing significant economic disruption. In summary, progress can be made by taking a collaborative and realistic approach that takes into account both economic and environmental concerns.",
