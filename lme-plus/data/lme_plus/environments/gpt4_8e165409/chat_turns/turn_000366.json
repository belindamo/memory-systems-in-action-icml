One of my favorites is Handvo, which is a savory cake made from a mixture of lentils and rice flour. My mom makes it really well, and it's always a treat when she cooks it for me.\n\nSpeaking of food, I've been meaning to try out some traditional Indian recipes myself. Do you have any simple recipes or tips for someone who's just starting out with Indian cooking?",
