Identifying that pattern is a huge step forward.\n\nYes, it's very likely that the busy meeting days are contributing to your afternoon caffeine cravings. Here are a few potential factors at play:\n\n1. **Stress and fatigue**: Back-to-back meetings can be draining, both mentally and physically. Grabbing a coffee or tea on the go might be a way to cope with the stress and fatigue.\n2. **Rushed breaks**: When you're in a hurry, you might not be taking the time to properly recharge. This can lead to a false sense of energy from the caffeine, rather than actually addressing your body's need for rest.\n3. **Conditioning**: If you often associate busy meeting days with grabbing a coffee or tea, your brain might be conditioned to crave it as a way to cope with the chaos.\n\nTo break this pattern, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Schedule breaks**: Make sure to block out time in your calendar for short breaks, even on busy meeting days. This will help you prioritize self-care and avoid relying on caffeine to get you through.\n2. **Prioritize relaxation**: During your breaks, focus on relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, stretching, or a short meditation. This can help reduce stress and increase energy levels naturally.\n3. **Choose a different pick-me-up**: If you still need a pick-me-up, try opting for a non-caffeinated drink, like water, herbal tea, or a sparkling water with a squeeze of lemon or lime.\n4. **Rethink your meeting routine**: If possible, try to schedule breaks between meetings or group them together to allow for longer breaks. This might help you feel more in control and reduce the need for a quick caffeine fix.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding a new ritual that works for you. Experiment with different approaches and see what helps you feel more energized and focused without relying on caffeine.\n\nHow do you think you can apply these strategies to your busy meeting days? Are there any other challenges you foresee, or any questions about implementing these ideas?",
