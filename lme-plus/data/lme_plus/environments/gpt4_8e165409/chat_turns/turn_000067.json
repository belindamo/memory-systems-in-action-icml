  "content": "This is what someone else had to say about this essay and why it worked well, can you summarize this person's opinion in bullet points?\n\nOpinion on why this essay worked well:\nThere\u2019s a wonderful hook. The first line is great. It\u2019s funny, intriguing, and doesn\u2019t give too much away. In just the first bit we already know that the author is a football enthusiast, detail-oriented, and academically gifted. Not only does it tell us a lot about him, but it allows him to transition into the meat of his story about how his unconventional educational trajectory influenced the person he is today. Think about how you can use the first sentence or two of your personal statement to effectively introduce readers to your narrative voice and rope them into reading more.\n\nIt has a great \u201cAha!\u201d moment. Great personal statements often convey growth. In this example, the author struggles to find a place for himself in high school after skipping two grades and being homeschooled for a significant portion of his life. It isn\u2019t until his friend on the football team affirms his value that he starts to see all of the ways in which his unique skills benefit the people around him. If you think of your essay like a movie reel of your life, this moment is sort of like the climax. It\u2019s when the mindset of the main character changes and allows him to embrace what he\u2019s got. The anticipation and release of this \u201caha moment\u201d keeps readers engaged in the piece and demonstrates your ability, as the applicant, to be self-reflective and adaptable to change.\n\nIt covers a broad time frame, but still fits in tons of nice details. This essay essentially talks about the author\u2019s life from 5th grade to present day. He\u2019s not focusing on one specific moment. This is absolutely something you can do as well if you want to demonstrate how you\u2019ve grown over a longer period of time. However, notice that the author here doesn\u2019t sacrifice depth for breadth. Even though he\u2019s covering a pretty significant chunk of time, he still touches on great details about his favorite classes and authors, football role models, and conversations with friends. These are what make the essay great and specific to his life. If you\u2019re going to talk about more than just one event or moment, don\u2019t forget to highlight important details along the way.",
