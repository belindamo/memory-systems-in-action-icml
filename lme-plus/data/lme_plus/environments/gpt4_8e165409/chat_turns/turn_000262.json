Here are some tips on how to incorporate box jumps, depth jumps, and lateral bounds into your routine and how to progress over time:\n\n**Incorporating Plyometrics into Your Routine:**\n\n1. **Start with 2 times a week**: Begin by incorporating plyometric exercises into your strength training routine 2 times a week, with at least 48 hours of rest in between.\n2. **Warm up and cool down**: Make sure to warm up with 10-15 minutes of light cardio and dynamic stretching before starting your plyometric exercises, and cool down with 10-15 minutes of stretching and foam rolling afterwards.\n3. **Start with lower volumes and intensities**: Begin with lower volumes and intensities and gradually increase as you become more comfortable with the exercises.\n4. **Focus on proper technique**: Prioritize proper technique over the number of sets and reps. It's better to do fewer sets with good form than to risk injury by doing more sets with poor form.\n5. **Incorporate plyometrics after strength training**: Do plyometric exercises after your strength training exercises, when your muscles are warm and ready for explosive movements.\n\n**Progressing Over Time:**\n\n1. **Increase volume and intensity**: Gradually increase the number of sets, reps, and intensity of your plyometric exercises over time.\n2. **Increase box height**: For box jumps and depth jumps, gradually increase the height of the box as you become more comfortable with the exercise.\n3. **Increase lateral bound distance**: For lateral bounds, gradually increase the distance you're jumping as you become more comfortable with the exercise.\n4. **Add variations**: Add variations to your plyometric exercises, such as single-leg box jumps or lateral bounds with a twist.\n5. **Increase frequency**: Gradually increase the frequency of your plyometric exercises, but make sure to allow for adequate rest and recovery time.\n\n**Example Plyometric Workout:**\n\nWarm-up: 10-15 minutes of light cardio and dynamic stretching\n\n1. Box Jumps: 3 sets of 10 reps\n\t* Start with a box height of 12-18 inches and gradually increase as you become more comfortable with the exercise.\n2. Depth Jumps: 3 sets of 10 reps\n\t* Start with a box height of 12-18 inches and gradually increase as you become more comfortable with the exercise.\n3. Lateral Bounds: 3 sets of 10 reps (5 each leg)\n\t* Start with a distance of 2-3 feet and gradually increase as you become more comfortable with the exercise.\n\nCool-down: 10-15 minutes of stretching and foam rolling\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust the intensity and volume of your plyometric workouts based on your individual needs and goals. It's also essential to incorporate proper warm-ups, cool-downs, and recovery strategies to prevent injuries and optimize performance.",
