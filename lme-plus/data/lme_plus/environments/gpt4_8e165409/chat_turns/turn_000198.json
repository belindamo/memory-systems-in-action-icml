  "content": "The Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronze & Glow is a fantastic product for creating a natural, sun-kissed glow.\n\n**Applying the Filmstar Bronze & Glow**\n\nTo get the most out of this product, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prep your skin**: Make sure to moisturize and prime your skin before applying the Filmstar Bronze & Glow. This will help the product blend seamlessly and last longer.\n2. **Choose your tool**: You can use either a brush or your fingers to apply the product. If you're new to contouring, I recommend using your fingers, as they provide more control and allow for a more natural-looking application. If you prefer using a brush, a flat foundation brush or a contour brush works well.\n3. **Apply to the right areas**: For an oval face shape, focus on the following areas:\n\t* **Sides of the nose**: Use a small amount of product and apply it to the sides of your nose, starting from the tip and working your way up towards the bridge. Blend, blend, blend!\n\t* **Hollows of the cheeks**: Apply the product to the hollows of your cheeks, starting from the apples of your cheeks and working your way up towards your hairline. Use a light hand and build up gradually.\n\t* **Jawline**: Apply a small amount of product to the jawline, starting from the center and working your way outwards towards the ears. Blend well to create a seamless transition.\n4. **Blend, blend, blend**: Use your fingers or a brush to blend the product into your skin. Make sure to blend upwards and outwards to create a natural-looking contour.\n5. **Build up gradually**: Start with a light application and build up gradually. It's easier to add more product than it is to remove excess.\n6. **Set with powder**: Once you've applied the Filmstar Bronze & Glow, set it with a light dusting of translucent powder to extend its wear.\n\n**Tips and Tricks**\n\n* Use a light hand when applying the product, especially if you're new to contouring.\n* Blend, blend, blend! This is key to creating a natural-looking contour.\n* If you have trouble getting the product to blend, try warming it up on the back of your hand before applying it to your face.\n* Don't be afraid to mix and match the shades to create a custom contour that suits your skin tone.\n* Remember, the goal of contouring is to enhance your natural features, not to create a dramatic, sculpted look.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you'll be able to create a beautiful, natural-looking contour with the Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronze & Glow.\n\nDo you have any other questions about applying the Filmstar Bronze & Glow or contouring in general?",
