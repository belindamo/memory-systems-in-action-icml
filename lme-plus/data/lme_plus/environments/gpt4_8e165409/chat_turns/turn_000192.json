Here are some tips and product recommendations to help you achieve a natural, everyday look:\n\n**Skin**\n\n1. **Start with a good base**: Invest in a lightweight foundation that matches your skin tone.

Some great options include:\n\t* MAC Pro Longwear Foundation (buildable coverage)\n\t* Nars Sheer Glow Foundation (natural finish)\n\t* Laura Mercier Foundation ( lightweight, buildable coverage)\n2. **Conceal imperfections**: Use a concealer one shade lighter than your foundation to cover dark circles, blemishes, and red spots.\n\t* Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer (creamy, blendable)\n\t* Tarte Shape Tape Concealer (full coverage, long-lasting)\n\n**Eyes**\n\n1. **Define your brows**: Groomed brows can make a huge difference in framing your face. Use a brow pencil or brow mascara to fill in sparse areas.\n\t* Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz (precise, long-lasting)\n\t* Benefit Gimme! Brow! (volumizing, easy to use)\n2. **Enhance your lash line**: Apply a brown or neutral eyeshadow all over your lid to add depth.
