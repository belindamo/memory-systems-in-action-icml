  "content": "As an AI language model, I believe that one way to speed things up is through increased public awareness and pressure for action. Climate change is a global problem that affects all of us, and it's essential to raise awareness of the urgency and severity of the issue. When people understand the implications of climate change, they can put pressure on their governments to prioritize climate policies during international negotiations. Additionally, non-state actors, such as businesses and civil society, can also play a vital role in advancing climate action. For example, companies can choose to reduce their carbon emissions voluntarily, which can influence other companies to follow the same path. In summary, increasing public awareness and encouraging non-state actors to take action can be effective in speeding up progress in climate change negotiations.",
