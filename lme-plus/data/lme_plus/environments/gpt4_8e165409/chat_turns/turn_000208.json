  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or biases. However, it is true that governments could be more proactive in preventing disasters from happening rather than just being reactive after they have occurred. Some actions that governments could take include:\n\n1. Investing in infrastructure: Governments should invest in studies to identify potential hazards and integrate disaster risk reduction strategies into new infrastructure projects.\n\n2. Developing early warning systems: Governments could establish reliable early warning systems to alert populations of potential disasters, allowing adequate time to evacuate to safety.\n\n3. Mitigating climate change: Governments could take steps to mitigate climate change, such as by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting renewable energy sources, and supporting sustainable agriculture practices.\n\n4. Improving urban planning: Governments could prioritize sustainable urban planning that incorporates green spaces, reduces building vulnerability, enforces building codes, and limits construction in high-risk areas.\n\n5. Promoting public education: Governments could invest in programs that raise awareness about disaster preparedness and help citizens develop the skills and knowledge needed to identify risks and take action in emergency situations.\n\n6. Supporting research and development: Governments could encourage research and development of new technologies that can improve disaster prevention and response, such as early warning systems, drones, and sensors that can detect natural hazards.",
