I'm really looking forward to diving into Ozark and exploring the world of the Ozarks. Since I've been watching a lot of comedies lately, it'll be nice to switch gears and watch something more intense and dramatic. By the way, do you have any recommendations for other intense dramas on Netflix that I might enjoy?",
