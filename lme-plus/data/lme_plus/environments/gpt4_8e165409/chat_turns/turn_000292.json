  "content": "\"The Walking Dead\" is a priority, isn't it? Don't worry, I've got you covered!\n\nThe next season of \"The Walking Dead\" is Season 11, and it's expected to premiere on **August 22, 2021**, on AMC. This will be the final season of the show, and it's been split into three parts, with a total of 24 episodes.\n\nIf you're planning to finish \"Breaking Bad\" before the new season of \"The Walking Dead\" starts, you've got some time. With 62 episodes, you'd need to watch around 3-4 episodes per week to finish the entire series before August 22nd. That's definitely doable, but it depends on your viewing schedule and pace.\n\nIf you're concerned about not having enough time, you could always start with \"Narcos\" instead, which has fewer episodes (30) and might be a quicker binge. Alternatively, you could start \"Breaking Bad\" now and take breaks in between to catch up on other shows or movies. The important thing is to enjoy the show at your own pace!\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
