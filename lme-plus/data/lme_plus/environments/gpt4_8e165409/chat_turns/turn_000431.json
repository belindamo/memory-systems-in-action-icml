You might be able to find a deal that's not advertised online, or get a better price by negotiating with a sales associate.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try:\n\n* Signing up for Target's email newsletter or loyalty program to receive exclusive offers and discounts.\n* Checking Target's weekly ad or sales flyer to see if the vacuum cleaners are on sale.\n* Using Target's price match policy to match a lower price from a competitor.\n* Asking a sales associate if they have any floor models or display units available for sale at a discounted price.\n\nRemember to also check the prices and promotions at other retailers, such as Amazon, Best Buy, or the manufacturers' websites, to make sure you're getting the best deal.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a great deal on your new vacuum cleaner!",
