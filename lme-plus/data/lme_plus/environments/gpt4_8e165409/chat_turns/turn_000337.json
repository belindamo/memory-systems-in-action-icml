The cherry blossoms will be in full bloom, and the weather is usually mild and pleasant.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on getting your travel insurance sorted out!

Here are some travel tips and recommendations for you:\n\n**Before You Go:**\n\n1. **Learn some basic Japanese phrases**: While many Tokyo residents speak some English, it's always appreciated when visitors make an effort to communicate in Japanese. Learn basic phrases like \"konnichiwa\" (hello), \"arigatou\" (thank you), and \"sumimasen\" (excuse me).\n2. **Download essential apps**: Get apps like Google Translate, Hyperdia (for navigating public transport), and Google Maps to help you navigate the city.\n3. **Pack layers**: April can be quite chilly in the mornings and evenings, so bring light jackets and layers.\n\n**Must-Visit Attractions:**\n\n1. **Shibuya Crossing**: One of the busiest intersections in the world, surrounded by shopping and entertainment districts.\n2. **Tokyo Tower**: A iconic landmark with great city views, especially during sunset.\n3. **Tsukiji Outer Market**: While the inner market has moved to a new location, the outer market still offers a fascinating glimpse into Tokyo's seafood culture.\n4. **Meiji Shrine**: A serene Shinto shrine dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shoken.\n5. **Asakusa**: Explore the historic Senso-ji Temple and Nakamise Shopping Street, a traditional Japanese shopping street.\n\n**Food and Drink:**\n\n1. **Try sushi**: You can't go to Tokyo without trying some of the freshest sushi at the Tsukiji Fish Market or at a local restaurant like Sushi Dai or Sushi Zo.\n2. **Explore food streets**: Visit Shinjuku's Omoide Yokocho, Shibuya's Nonbei Yokocho, or Golden Gai for a variety of small eateries and bars.\n3. **Sample street food**: Try yakitori (grilled chicken skewers), takoyaki (octopus dumplings), or okonomiyaki (savory pancake).\n\n**Tips and Tricks:**\n\n1. **Buy a Suica or Pasmo card**: These prepaid cards can be used to ride public transportation, making it easy to get around the city.\n2. **Learn to use the train system**: While it may seem overwhelming at first, the train system is efficient and convenient. Take some time to understand the different lines and routes.\n3. **Respect local customs**: Remove your shoes when entering traditional Japanese homes or temples, and avoid tipping, as it's not customary in Japan.\n4. **Carry cash**: Many places in Japan, especially smaller shops and restaurants, still only accept cash.\n5. **Be prepared for crowds**: Tokyo is a busy city, so be prepared for crowded trains, streets, and popular attractions.\n\nThese are just a few tips to get you started.
