  "content": "The amount of time you should plan to spend at Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay depends on your level of interest in the artwork and the amount of attention you want to give each piece. If you are a true art lover and want to see the majority of works in the museum, you could easily spend a full day there. However, if you are short on time or just want to see the highlights, you could probably see the most famous pieces in two to three hours. The museum has a large area of over 78,000 square meters, so it is essential to plan your visit in advance and prioritize the collections that interest you the most. The museum is a popular tourist attraction, so I recommend getting there early, when it opens, to avoid the crowds.",
