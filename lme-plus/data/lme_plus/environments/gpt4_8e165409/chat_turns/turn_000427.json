However, there are some differences to consider:\n\n* The Dyson V11 Absolute Pro has a more compact and sealed system, which can be beneficial for those who want a more portable and easy-to-maintain vacuum.\n* The Miele Complete C3 Limited Edition has a more advanced filtration system with multiple stages, which can provide even better air quality and particle capture.\n\nIn terms of suction power, both models are high-performance vacuums that can pick up dirt and dust effectively. The Dyson V11 Absolute Pro has a maximum suction power of 185 Air Watts, while the Miele Complete C3 Limited Edition has a maximum suction power of 1200 Watts.\n\nUltimately, the choice between these two models will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you prioritize portability and ease of maintenance, the Dyson V11 Absolute Pro might be the better choice. If you're looking for a more advanced filtration system and exceptional suction power, the Miele Complete C3 Limited Edition could be the better option.",
