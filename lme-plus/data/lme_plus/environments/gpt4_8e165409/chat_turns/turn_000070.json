I stumbled across a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and I was immediately captivated. I had never seen anything like it before. The way the dancers moved, the way they told stories with their bodies, the way the music and the choreography came together in perfect harmony... it was like nothing I had ever experienced before. I was hooked.\n\nI begged my parents to let me try dance classes and, after a lot of convincing, they finally agreed. I was so excited to start, but I also felt a little bit nervous. I had never really taken any kind of dance class before, and I wasn't sure if I would be any good at it. But I quickly discovered that I loved it. I loved the way it made me feel, the way it challenged me, the way it allowed me to express myself in ways I never thought possible. I started taking classes at a local dance studio and I was hooked. I spent hours in the studio, practicing and perfecting my technique, and I quickly became one of the top dancers in my class.\n\nAs I got older, my love for dance only grew. I started taking more advanced classes and I began competing in local and regional dance competitions. I was a member of my high school's dance team and I also started performing with a local contemporary dance company. I loved the rush of performing on stage, the way the audience would respond to my movements, and the way I could use dance to tell a story or express an emotion. I knew that dance was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\nWhen it came time to apply to college, I knew that I wanted to study dance at a school that would allow me to pursue my passion. I did my research and I found a school that offered a top-notch dance program and a strong liberal arts education. I applied and, to my delight, I was accepted.\n\nNow, as I enter my sophomore year at [University], I am proud to say that dance is still a huge part of my life. I am a member of the university's dance company and I am also taking classes in choreography, dance history, and dance technique. I am learning so much and I am constantly being challenged and pushed to be the best dancer I can be. I am also fortunate enough to have amazing teachers who are not only knowledgeable and experienced, but who are also passionate and dedicated.\n\nI am so grateful to have found my passion in dance. It has not only allowed me to express myself in ways I never thought possible, but it has also taught me discipline, hard work, and perseverance. I know that dance will always be a part of my life, and I am excited to see where it will take me.\n\nReason why this essay worked well:\n\nThe essay has a clear focus.
