  "content": "I didn't think about the noise level in the helicopter. A pre-recorded message or custom soundtrack could be a great alternative. I'll definitely look into that.\n\nAs for presenting the ring, I was thinking of doing something simple yet romantic. I've got a beautiful ring box that I'll open during the proposal, and I'll get down on one knee to pop the question. I want the moment to be intimate and personal, so I'll keep it straightforward and sincere. I'm more focused on expressing my feelings and commitment to my partner than on elaborate gestures.\n\nSpeaking of which, I've been thinking about our marriage preparation course at church, and how it's helped us prepare for this moment. I'm grateful for the guidance and support we've received, and I feel more confident about our future together. Do you have any advice on how to make our proposal and wedding planning process more meaningful and spiritual?",
