  "content": "Habitica is a fantastic tool for tracking habits and staying motivated.\n\nRegarding Luna's litter box, it's great that you're thinking about keeping it clean! The frequency of cleaning depends on several factors, including:\n\n1. Number of cats: If you have multiple cats, you'll need to clean the litter box more frequently.\n2. Litter type: Clumping litter can be scooped daily, while silica gel or natural litters might require more frequent changes.\n3. Cat behavior: If Luna is a tidy cat and doesn't dig or kick litter around, you might get away with cleaning less often. But if she's a messy kitty, you'll need to clean more frequently.\n\nHere's a general guideline:\n\n* Scoop out solid waste daily, or at least every other day.\n* Change the litter completely every 7-10 days for a single cat, or every 3-5 days for multiple cats.\n\nYou can also consider the following signs that it's time to clean the litter box:\n\n* Strong odors\n* Visible dirt or debris\n* Luna avoiding the litter box or showing signs of discomfort\n\nA good rule of thumb is to clean the litter box when you notice any of these signs or every 7-10 days, whichever comes first.\n\nRemember, a clean litter box is essential for Luna's health and hygiene. You can also consider setting a reminder in Habitica to help you stay on track!\n\nHow often do you think you'll aim to clean Luna's litter box?",
