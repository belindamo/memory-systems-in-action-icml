Then, select \"Distance\" from the dropdown menu. You can choose from the following distance ranges:\n\t* Under 1 mile\n\t* 1-3 miles\n\t* 3-5 miles\n\t* 5-10 miles\n\t* 10+ miles\n2. **Mobile App**: On the trail list screen, tap on the \"Filters\" icon (looks like a funnel) on the top-right corner. Then, tap on \"Distance\" and select your preferred range from the same options as above.\n\nBy filtering trails by length, you can quickly find trails that fit your desired hike duration, whether you're looking for a quick afternoon stroll or a longer, more challenging hike.\n\nRemember, you can combine multiple filters to narrow down your search. For example, you could filter trails by difficulty level and length to find a moderate 5-mile hike with scenic views. The possibilities are endless!",
