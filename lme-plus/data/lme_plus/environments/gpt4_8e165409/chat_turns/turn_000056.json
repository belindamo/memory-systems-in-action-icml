Reaching out to Emma to run through scenes together is an excellent way to ensure a strong connection and chemistry between the leads, especially with the new Danny on board.\n\nRunning scenes with Emma will help you:\n\n1. **Re-establish chemistry:** With the new Danny, it's essential to rebuild the chemistry between the leads. Running scenes with Emma will help you develop a stronger connection and timing with each other.\n2. **Fine-tune interactions:** You can work on perfecting your interactions, reactions, and dialogue delivery, which will make the scenes feel more natural and authentic.\n3. **Get comfortable with the new Danny:** This will also give you an opportunity to get comfortable with the new Danny's performance style, mannerisms, and energy, which will help you adjust your own performance accordingly.\n4. **Work out any kinks:** Running scenes together will help you identify and work out any issues, such as timing, blocking, or pacing, before the final performances.\n\nMake sure to communicate with Emma and the new Danny to schedule a time that works for everyone. You might even consider inviting the new Danny to join you and Emma for a run-through, so you can all work together to solidify the chemistry and dynamics between the three of you.\n\nRemember to approach these rehearsals with an open mind, be willing to take feedback, and make adjustments as needed. By doing so, you'll be able to deliver a more confident and polished performance on opening night.\n\nHow do you think Emma will respond to your suggestion? Have you worked with her closely before, or is this a new collaboration?",
