I've started experimenting with herbal teas like peppermint and chamomile, but I still find myself craving a coffee break. By the way, I always take a short 10-15 minute break every morning to enjoy my coffee and scroll through social media or catch up on news - it's become a nice habit. Do you have any suggestions on how I can curb my afternoon caffeine cravings?",
