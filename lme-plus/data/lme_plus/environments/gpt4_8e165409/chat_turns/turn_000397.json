  "content": "Economic concerns are often considered during international climate change negotiations because climate change policies can have significant impacts on job creation and trade policies. For example, the transition to a low-carbon economy may result in the creation of new industries and jobs in clean energy, but may also lead to job losses in traditional sectors such as coal and oil. In addition, climate policies can affect trade by increasing the costs of certain products or industries, resulting in potential trade barriers or disputes. Hence, economic concerns are often raised and discussed during climate change negotiations to ensure that policies are implemented in a way that balances environmental and economic concerns.",
