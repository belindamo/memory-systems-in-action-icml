I've been really into Netflix lately, just finished \"Stranger Things\" season 4 and now I'm watching \"The Crown\". By the way, I started watching the \"Daily Dose of Laughter\" playlist on Peacock while getting ready for work in the morning, it's such a great way to start the day. Can you recommend some popular comedies or dramas on Netflix that I might like?",
