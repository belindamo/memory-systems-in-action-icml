I'd be happy to guide you through the basics of contouring for your face shape and recommend some beginner-friendly products.\n\n**Understanding Your Face Shape**\n\nBefore we dive into contouring, it's essential to determine your face shape. There are six basic face shapes: Oval, Round, Square, Heart-Shaped, Triangular, and Diamond. Knowing your face shape will help you identify the areas to contour and highlight.\n\n**Contouring Tips for Beginners**\n\n1. **Start with a light hand**: Contouring is all about creating subtle definition, so begin with a light application and build up as needed.\n2. **Use a mirror that shows you the truth**: Use a well-lit mirror that allows you to see the contours of your face clearly.\n3. **Identify your contour areas**: Depending on your face shape, you'll focus on specific areas to contour. We'll get to that in a bit.\n4. **Choose the right products**: Select a contour product that's one to two shades deeper than your natural skin tone. For beginners, it's best to start with a cream or powder contour product.\n5. **Blend, blend, blend**: Use a fluffy brush or a beauty blender to blend the contour product seamlessly into your skin.\n\n**Contouring for Different Face Shapes**\n\nHere's a brief guide on where to contour for each face shape:\n\n* **Oval**: Contour the sides of your nose, hollows of your cheeks, and jawline.\n* **Round**: Contour the sides of your nose, temples, and jawline to create the illusion of length.\n* **Square**: Contour the sides of your nose, hollows of your cheeks, and jawline to soften the angles.\n* **Heart-Shaped**: Contour the sides of your nose, hollows of your cheeks, and forehead to balance the width of your forehead.\n* **Triangular**: Contour the sides of your nose, hollows of your cheeks, and jawline to balance the narrow forehead.\n* **Diamond**: Contour the sides of your nose, hollows of your cheeks, and forehead to soften the angles.\n\n**Recommended Contour Products for Beginners**\n\n1. **Cream Contour**:\n\t* Nars Contour Blush (buildable, creamy formula)\n\t* Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronze & Glow (easy to blend, natural-looking)\n2. **Powder Contour**:\n\t* MAC Pro Longwear Powder (buildable, long-lasting)\n\t* Tarte Amazonian Clay 12-Hour Contour Palette (natural-looking, easy to blend)\n3. **Contour Kits**:\n\t* Urban Decay Naked Contour Palette (includes a range of shades and a highlighter)\n\t* Anastasia Beverly Hills Contour Kit (includes a range of shades and a highlighter)\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. **Use a contour brush**: Invest in a contour brush that's specifically designed for contouring. This will help you apply the product precisely and blend it seamlessly.\n2. **Practice makes perfect**: Don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries to get the hang of contouring. Practice on different areas of your face to find what works best for you.\n3. **Highlighting is key**: Remember to highlight the high points of your face (cheekbones, nose, cupid's bow) to balance out the contouring.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your contouring journey!
