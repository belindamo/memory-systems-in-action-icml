That's a great foundation for your trip.\n\n**Additional travel insurance for the Nikko tour:**\n\nWhile it's not necessary to purchase additional travel insurance specifically for the Nikko tour, it depends on your personal risk tolerance and the specific policy details. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Check your existing policy**: Review your current travel insurance policy to see if it already covers trip cancellations or interruptions due to unforeseen circumstances, such as natural disasters or travel disruptions. If it does, you might not need additional insurance.\n2. **Tour operator's policies**: Check with the tour operator (TravelBug) to see if they offer any cancellation or refund policies in case of unforeseen circumstances. Some tour operators might have their own insurance or guarantees in place.\n3. **Cost and coverage**: If you do decide to purchase additional insurance, weigh the cost against the potential benefits. Consider the cost of the tour and the likelihood of cancellations or interruptions. If the cost of the insurance is relatively low compared to the tour cost, it might be worth considering.\n4. **Peace of mind**: Ultimately, purchasing additional insurance can provide peace of mind, especially if you're concerned about the uncertainty of traveling to a foreign country.\n\n**Other options:**\n\nInstead of purchasing additional insurance, you could consider the following:\n\n1. **Pay with a credit card**: If you pay for the tour with a credit card, you might be able to dispute the charge or claim a refund if the tour is cancelled or doesn't meet your expectations.\n2. **Book with a reputable operator**: Research the tour operator and read reviews to ensure they have a good reputation and a track record of providing refunds or rescheduling tours in case of cancellations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile additional travel insurance for the Nikko tour is not necessary, it's essential to weigh the risks and benefits. If you're concerned about the cost of the tour and the potential for cancellations, purchasing additional insurance might be a good idea. However, if you're comfortable with the risks and have a good understanding of the tour operator's policies, you might not need additional insurance.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards purchasing additional insurance or relying on your existing policy and the tour operator's policies?",
