      "content": "Here's another personal statement that's considered excellent for college admissions. Can you highlight multiple reasons why it worked well?\n\nPersonal Statement:\n12\n12 is the number of my idol, Tom Brady. It\u2019s the sum of all the letters in my name. It\u2019s also how old I was when I started high school.\n\nIn short, I skipped two grades: first and sixth. Between kindergarten and eighth grade, I attended five schools, including two different styles of homeschooling (three years at a co-op and one in my kitchen). Before skipping, I was perennially bored. \n\nBut when I began homeschooling, everything changed. Free to move as fast as I wanted, I devoured tomes from Jefferson, Hamilton, and Madison to London, Kipling, and Twain. I wrote 10-page papers on subjects from Ancient Sparta and military history to the founding of the United States and the resounding impact of slavery. I discovered more than I ever had, kindling a lifelong joy for learning. \n\nWhile high school offered welcome academic opportunities--studying two languages and taking early science APs chief among them--the social environment was a different beast. Many classmates considered me more a little brother than a true friend, and my age and laser focus on academics initially made me socially inept. I joined sports teams in spring and built better relationships, but my lack of size (5\u20191\u201d) and strength relegated me to the end of the bench. Oftentimes, I secretly wished I was normal age.\n\nThat secret desire manifested itself in different ways. While I\u2019ve loved football since I was a little kid, I soon became obsessed with personal success on the gridiron--the key, I figured, to social acceptance and the solution to my age problem. I had grown up obsessively tracking my New England Patriots. Now, instead of armchair quarterbacking, I poured hours into throwing mechanics and studying film after my homework each night. Itching to grow, I adopted Brady\u2019s diet, cutting dairy, white flour, and processed sugar. But in the rush to change, my attitude towards academics shifted; I came to regard learning as more a job than a joy. No matter what talents I possessed, I viewed myself as a failure because I couldn\u2019t play. \n\nThat view held sway until a conversation with my friend Alex, the fastest receiver on the team. As I told him I wished we could switch places so I could succeed on the gridiron, he stared incredulously. \u201cDude,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cI wish I was you!\u201d Hearing my friends voice their confidence in my abilities prompted me to reflect: I quickly realized I was discounting my academic talents to fit a social construct. Instead of pushing myself to be something I wasn\u2019t, I needed to meld my talents and my passions. Instead of playing sports, I recognized, I should coach them.\n\nMy goal to coach professionally has already helped me embrace the academic side of the game--my side--rather than sidelining it. I have devoured scouting tomes, analyzed NFL game film, spoken with pros like Dante Scarnecchia, and even joined the American Football Coaches Association. Translating that coach\u2019s mentality into practice, I began explaining the concepts behind different plays to my teammates, helping them see the subtleties of strategy (despite Coach Whitcher\u2019s complaints that I was trying to steal his job). And I discovered that my intellectual understanding of the game is far more important in determining my success than my athletic tools: with the discipline, adaptability, and drive I had already developed, I\u2019ve become a better player, student, and friend.\n\nPhysically and mentally, I\u2019ve changed a lot since freshman year, growing 11 inches and gaining newfound confidence in myself and my abilities. Instead of fighting for social acceptance, I\u2019m free to focus on the things I love. Academically, that change re-inspired me. Able to express my full personality without social pressure, I rededicated myself in the classroom and my community. I still secretly wish to be Tom Brady. But now, I\u2019m happy to settle for Bill Belichick."

      "content": "This is what someone else had to say about this essay and why it worked well, can you summarize this person's opinion in bullet points?\n\nOpinion on why this essay worked well:\nThere\u2019s a wonderful hook. The first line is great. It\u2019s funny, intriguing, and doesn\u2019t give too much away. In just the first bit we already know that the author is a football enthusiast, detail-oriented, and academically gifted. Not only does it tell us a lot about him, but it allows him to transition into the meat of his story about how his unconventional educational trajectory influenced the person he is today. Think about how you can use the first sentence or two of your personal statement to effectively introduce readers to your narrative voice and rope them into reading more.\n\nIt has a great \u201cAha!\u201d moment. Great personal statements often convey growth. In this example, the author struggles to find a place for himself in high school after skipping two grades and being homeschooled for a significant portion of his life. It isn\u2019t until his friend on the football team affirms his value that he starts to see all of the ways in which his unique skills benefit the people around him. If you think of your essay like a movie reel of your life, this moment is sort of like the climax. It\u2019s when the mindset of the main character changes and allows him to embrace what he\u2019s got. The anticipation and release of this \u201caha moment\u201d keeps readers engaged in the piece and demonstrates your ability, as the applicant, to be self-reflective and adaptable to change.\n\nIt covers a broad time frame, but still fits in tons of nice details. This essay essentially talks about the author\u2019s life from 5th grade to present day. He\u2019s not focusing on one specific moment. This is absolutely something you can do as well if you want to demonstrate how you\u2019ve grown over a longer period of time. However, notice that the author here doesn\u2019t sacrifice depth for breadth. Even though he\u2019s covering a pretty significant chunk of time, he still touches on great details about his favorite classes and authors, football role models, and conversations with friends. These are what make the essay great and specific to his life. If you\u2019re going to talk about more than just one event or moment, don\u2019t forget to highlight important details along the way."

      "content": "Personal Statement:\n\nI remember when I first discovered dance. It was a Sunday afternoon and I was flipping through the channels on the TV, trying to find something to watch. I stumbled across a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and I was immediately captivated. I had never seen anything like it before. The way the dancers moved, the way they told stories with their bodies, the way the music and the choreography came together in perfect harmony... it was like nothing I had ever experienced before. I was hooked.\n\nI begged my parents to let me try dance classes and, after a lot of convincing, they finally agreed. I was so excited to start, but I also felt a little bit nervous. I had never really taken any kind of dance class before, and I wasn't sure if I would be any good at it. But I quickly discovered that I loved it. I loved the way it made me feel, the way it challenged me, the way it allowed me to express myself in ways I never thought possible. I started taking classes at a local dance studio and I was hooked. I spent hours in the studio, practicing and perfecting my technique, and I quickly became one of the top dancers in my class.\n\nAs I got older, my love for dance only grew. I started taking more advanced classes and I began competing in local and regional dance competitions. I was a member of my high school's dance team and I also started performing with a local contemporary dance company. I loved the rush of performing on stage, the way the audience would respond to my movements, and the way I could use dance to tell a story or express an emotion. I knew that dance was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\nWhen it came time to apply to college, I knew that I wanted to study dance at a school that would allow me to pursue my passion. I did my research and I found a school that offered a top-notch dance program and a strong liberal arts education. I applied and, to my delight, I was accepted.\n\nNow, as I enter my sophomore year at [University], I am proud to say that dance is still a huge part of my life. I am a member of the university's dance company and I am also taking classes in choreography, dance history, and dance technique. I am learning so much and I am constantly being challenged and pushed to be the best dancer I can be. I am also fortunate enough to have amazing teachers who are not only knowledgeable and experienced, but who are also passionate and dedicated.\n\nI am so grateful to have found my passion in dance. It has not only allowed me to express myself in ways I never thought possible, but it has also taught me discipline, hard work, and perseverance. I know that dance will always be a part of my life, and I am excited to see where it will take me.\n\nReason why this essay worked well:\n\nThe essay has a clear focus. The author is clearly passionate about dance, and that passion is evident throughout the essay. From the first sentence to the last, the author's love for dance is the driving force behind the essay. This focus allows the author to tell a compelling and engaging story about their passion for dance and how it has shaped their life.\n\nThe"
