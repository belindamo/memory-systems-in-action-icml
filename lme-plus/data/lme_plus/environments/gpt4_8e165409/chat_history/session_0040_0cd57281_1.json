      "content": "What a wonderful idea! Recreating a special moment from your cousin's wedding will make the proposal even more meaningful and personal. Having the helicopter pilot play the same song during the proposal is a fantastic idea, but it might be a bit challenging to execute.\n\nHelicopters are noisy environments, and playing music during the flight might not be possible or safe. However, you could consider alternative options to still make it special:\n\n1. **Pre-recorded message**: Record a message or the song on a portable speaker or a phone, and play it during the proposal. This way, you can still share the special moment and the music, even if it's not live.\n2. **Custom soundtrack**: Create a custom soundtrack or playlist with the song and other romantic tracks. You could play it during the pre-flight preparation, while you're getting ready for takeoff, or during the post-flight celebration.\n3. **Serenade**: If you have a musically inclined friend or family member, consider asking them to serenade you both with a live performance of the song after the flight, during the romantic photo shoot or celebration.\n\nRemember to focus on the romantic gesture and the sentiment behind it, rather than the exact logistics. Your partner will appreciate the thought and effort you've put into making the proposal special and meaningful.\n\nHow do you think you'll present the ring during the proposal? Will you have a special box or a creative way to reveal it?"

I'll definitely look into that.\n\nAs for presenting the ring, I was thinking of doing something simple yet romantic. I've got a beautiful ring box that I'll open during the proposal, and I'll get down on one knee to pop the question. I want the moment to be intimate and personal, so I'll keep it straightforward and sincere. I'm more focused on expressing my feelings and commitment to my partner than on elaborate gestures.\n\nSpeaking of which, I've been thinking about our marriage preparation course at church, and how it's helped us prepare for this moment. I'm grateful for the guidance and support we've received, and I feel more confident about our future together. Do you have any advice on how to make our proposal and wedding planning process more meaningful and spiritual?"
