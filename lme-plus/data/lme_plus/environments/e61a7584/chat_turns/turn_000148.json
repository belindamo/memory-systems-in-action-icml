  "content": "Yes, definitely! Adding more veggies to the recipe is a great idea. Here's how you can modify the recipe to include spinach or bell peppers:\n\n- For spinach: Wash and chop a handful of fresh spinach leaves. After step 6, add the chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture and mix well before layering.\n\n- For bell peppers: Wash and chop a bell pepper into small pieces. After step 3, add the chopped bell pepper to the skillet with the meat and mushrooms. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the bell pepper is softened.\n\nYou can also try adding other low-carb veggies, like kale or broccoli, to make the lasagna even more nutrient-dense. Just make sure to adjust the cooking times as needed to ensure that the veggies are cooked through. Enjoy!",
