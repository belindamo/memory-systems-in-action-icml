Meeting up early for a coffee or tea is a wonderful way to catch up with your friends before brunch.\n\nBistro 5 does offer a variety of specialty coffee drinks and teas, including espresso-based drinks, pour-overs, and loose-leaf teas. They source their coffee beans from a local roaster and take pride in their coffee program. Their tea selection includes herbal and caffeinated options, and they also offer fresh-squeezed juices and smoothies.\n\nYou can definitely grab a coffee or tea at Bistro 5 before your brunch reservation. They have a cozy atmosphere, and it's a great way to start your gathering. If you're planning to meet at 10 am, you can grab a drink and hang out at the bar or in the lounge area before your table is ready.\n\nHowever, if you'd like to explore other options, there might be other coffee shops or cafes nearby that you could visit before heading to Bistro 5. This could be a good idea if you want to grab a quick coffee and then head to the restaurant for brunch.\n\nIf you do decide to grab a drink at Bistro 5, be sure to let your server know that you have a brunch reservation later, and they'll take care of you. They might even be able to accommodate your group in the lounge area or at the bar until your table is ready.\n\nNow, go ahead and send those invites to your friends, and I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time catching up over coffee and brunch!",
