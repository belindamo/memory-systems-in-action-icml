  "content": "A judgment was handed down in a case (F v M) in January 2021, which presented serious allegations of coercive and controlling behavior by the father (F) in the context of two relationships. The case had an \"extraordinarily protracted\" litigation history and the final fact-finding hearing was adjourned 6 times. The findings were not appealed and the approach to this type of abuse was approved by the Court of Appeal. In March 2021, F issued an application for a Child Arrangements Order for contact with both children, despite never having met the youngest child, and an application for a Specific Issue Order to change the youngest child's surname. In May 2021, the mother's legal team made applications for permission to disclose the judgment and case papers to the police and to remove F's Parental Responsibility. The disclosure of the judgment to the police does not require a court order, as per Family Procedure Rules r.12.73.",
