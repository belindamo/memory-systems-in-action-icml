  "content": "What a great idea! A custom invitation with a SpongeBob and Elsa theme will surely get the kids excited for the party! Including a picture of Ava in her Elsa costume from the Character Bash event at Thrill Kingdom will make it even more special and personalized.\n\nCreating a custom invitation will also give you the opportunity to set the tone for the party and give your guests a sneak peek into the fun that's to come. You could include a tagline like \"Dive into the fun with SpongeBob and friends!\" or \"Let it go and join the party with Elsa and Ava!\"\n\nMake sure to include all the important details, such as the date, time, location, and dress code (if applicable). You could also add a note about the character meet-and-greet, craft station, and other activities you have planned to get the kids even more excited.\n\nOnce you've finalized the invitation, you can send it out to your guests and start getting RSVPs. This will give you a better idea of how many guests to expect and help you plan accordingly.\n\nRemember to also send out reminders closer to the party date to ensure everyone remembers to mark their calendars. With a custom invitation and a fun party planned, I'm sure you'll get a lot of excited RSVPs!",
