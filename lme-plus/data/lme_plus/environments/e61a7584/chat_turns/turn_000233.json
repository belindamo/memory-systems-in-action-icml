I'd be delighted to help you with a delicious coffee cake recipe that's sure to please your family.\n\nHere's a classic recipe for a moist and flavorful coffee cake that's perfect for a special occasion:\n\n**Cinnamon Swirl Coffee Cake with Brown Sugar Crumb Topping**\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the cake:\n\n* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon baking powder\n* 1 teaspoon baking soda\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened\n* 2 large eggs\n* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n* 1/2 cup sour cream\n\nFor the cinnamon swirl:\n\n* 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon\n\nFor the brown sugar crumb topping:\n\n* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup packed brown sugar\n* 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n* 1 teaspoon cinnamon\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish and set it aside.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.\n3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the sugar and butter until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.\n4. Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.\n5. Gradually mix in the flour mixture until just combined, being careful not to overmix.\n6. Stir in the sour cream until smooth.\n7. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon for the swirl.\n8. Pour half of the batter into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the batter.\n9. Top with the remaining batter.\n10. To make the crumb topping, combine the flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Use your fingers or a pastry blender to work the cold butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\n11. Sprinkle the crumb topping evenly over the coffee cake.\n12. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n13. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nThis coffee cake is a perfect blend of sweet and spicy, with a lovely crumb topping and a beautiful swirl of cinnamon throughout. Your family will love it!\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to not overmix the batter, as it can lead to a dense coffee cake.\n* If you want a more pronounced cinnamon flavor, you can increase the amount of cinnamon in the swirl to 1-2 tablespoons.\n* You can also add chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans work well) to the crumb topping for added texture and flavor.\n\nI hope you and your family enjoy this recipe!",
