  "content": "On the 15th January 2021, I handed down judgment in F v M [2021] EWFC 4. The case presented very serious allegations of coercive and controlling behaviour by the father (F), in the context of two relationships. The first of the relationships analysed in that judgment concerned the mother (M) of the two children with whom I am concerned at this hearing. They are Y, now aged 8, and S, now aged 5. The litigation history, as I recorded in the earlier judgment, had been extraordinarily protracted. The final fact-finding hearing, which I concluded in January 2021, had been adjourned 6 times. The originating application was made by F in October 2017. In August 2021, there had been a successful appeal from a case management decision by a Circuit Judge, and the case was then allocated to me. Peter Jackson LJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, referred to the \"extremely difficult procedural history\".\nMy judgment sets out very serious findings, at the highest end of the index of gravity, within the sphere of coercive and controlling behaviour. The findings have not been appealed. My approach, in the judgment, to this particularly insidious type of abuse, was approved by the Court of Appeal in H-N and others (Children) (Domestic Abuse: Finding of Fact Hearings) (Rev 2) [2021] EWCA Civ 448.\nOn the 24th March 2021, F issued an application for a Child Arrangements Order for contact with both children (i.e., barely 8 weeks after the judgment). It should be noted that he has never met S (the youngest child). There was also an application for a Specific Issue Order, seeking a change of surname for S. The latter application, in particular, and in the context of my findings, reveals, at best, an arrogant lack of empathy for the effect that the protracted proceedings had already had on M and the elder child, Y. More than that, however, it reveals how F has used the Court proceedings as a different facet of controlling behaviour.\nOn the 21st May 2021, M's legal team made applications for permission to disclose the judgment and the case papers to the police. Additionally, the application sought, in the event that no order for contact was made, to remove F's Parental Responsibility. It would appear to require to be stated that disclosure of the judgment to the police does not require a Court order. Unless the court specifically prevents it, the police and CPS are entitled to a copy of a judgment pursuant to Family Procedure Rules r.12.73. The information within that judgment must only be used for the purposes of child protection and/or investigation of crime. M's legal team also sought disclosure of the court order to F's immigration lawyers.\n\nSummarise the text above",
