Establish clear boundaries: Be clear about your work hours and make sure to communicate it with your colleagues and managers so they understand your availability. Stick to your work schedule and avoid checking work emails or messages after the set work hours.\n\n2. Prioritize self-care: Taking care of yourself helps you stay healthy, balanced and productive. Set aside time to eat healthily, exercise regularly, and engage in activities that you enjoy.\n\n3. Create a transition routine: Develop an activity in between work and home that helps you to shift from work mode to leisure. This could be taking a brief walk, listening to music, or reading a book.\n\n4. Use technology mindfully: Set up specific work times on your calendar and use the do-not-disturb function on your phone or computer to avoid constant interruptions.\n\n5. Identify your triggers: Recognize what triggers you to check work emails or messages when not necessary. For example, is it the fear of missing out or the desire to please your manager? Acknowledging your triggers is the first step towards overcoming them.\n\n6. Seek support: Enlist the help of a trusted friend, coach or therapist who can offer motivation or support as you work towards establishing healthy boundaries.\n\nRemember, setting boundaries is a constant practice that requires consistency and patience. With awareness and effort, it is possible to overcome this challenge and protect your personal time.",
