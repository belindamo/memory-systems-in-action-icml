Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C).\n2. In a large bowl, mix together oats, nuts, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds.\n3. In a separate bowl, mix together honey, maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla extract, and salt.\n4. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir until everything is well coated.\n5.
