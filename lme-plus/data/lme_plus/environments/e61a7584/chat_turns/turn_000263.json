Mason jars, Ziploc bags, or containers with vacuum-seal lids work well.\n2. **Keep them Cool**: Store chopped veggies in the refrigerator at a consistent temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C).\n3. **Dry Them Out**: Pat dry chopped veggies with a clean towel or paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps prevent mold and bacterial growth.\n4. **Use the Right Storage Location**: Store veggies in the crisper drawer or the coldest part of the refrigerator, usually the bottom shelf.\n5. **Prep in Portions**: Divide chopped veggies into smaller portions to reduce exposure to air and moisture. This also makes it easier to grab what you need for each meal.\n6. ** Blanching**: Blanching (quickly boiling and then cooling) certain veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots can help preserve their color and texture. However, this method may not be necessary for all veggies.\n7. **Freeze Them**: If you won't be using chopped veggies within 3-5 days, consider freezing them. Frozen veggies are perfect for soups, stews, or saut\u00e9ed dishes.\n8. **Label and Date Containers**: Be sure to label containers with the date and contents, so you can easily keep track of what you have and how long it's been stored.\n\n**Specific Tips for Common Veggies:**\n\n* Leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, kale): Store in a breathable container or bag with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture.\n* Carrots: Store in an airtight container with a paper towel to keep them dry.\n* Onions: Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.\n* Bell peppers: Store in an airtight container to prevent moisture from entering.\n\nBy following these tips, you can enjoy your prepped veggies throughout the week while maintaining their freshness and nutritional value.\n\nRemember to always check your veggies for signs of spoilage before consuming them, such as sliminess, mold, or an off smell. Happy meal prepping!",
