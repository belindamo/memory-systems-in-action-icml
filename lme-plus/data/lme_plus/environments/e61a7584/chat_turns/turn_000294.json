  "content": "Three motifs that were present in \"Jumping Monkey Hill\" are:\n\n1. Power Dynamics motif: \"These workshops were, after all, a subtle contest of power, an assertion of control in a world that sometimes didn't make sense\" (Adichie 108). This passage illustrates how the workshops are a power struggle between the participants and the workshop leader, with each party attempting to assert their control and dominance over the other.\n2. Cultural Differences motif: \"I never knew I was supposed to use separate knives and forks for meat and vegetables, and nobody told me that it was rude to eat with your left hand\" (Adichie 109). This passage highlights the cultural differences between the protagonist and the other workshop participants, demonstrating how they have different customs and practices that may not be universally understood or accepted.\n3. Identity motif: \"All I saw was the race that suddenly defined me, and how it defined me seemed to matter more than anything else\" (Adichie 115). This passage shows how the protagonist is struggling with her identity, particularly as it relates to her race, and how this struggle shapes her interactions with others and her perception of the world around her.\n\nIf I were to choose a key concept present in this story, it would be the theme of cultural identity and the challenges that come with navigating different cultural worlds. The protagonist's experiences illustrate the complexities of existing between different cultural spheres and trying to find a sense of belonging in each one. The story also raises questions about the role of cultural norms and expectations, and how these can impact our perceptions of ourselves and others.",
