  "content": "I've been enjoying the ceramics class I'm taking, and I've been learning a lot from my instructor. I'm actually making a series of functional pieces, like plates and bowls, and it's been a great challenge to learn new techniques and improve my skills. Last week, we learned how to make a foot ring on a plate, which was harder than it looks! But I'm getting better with each class and I'm excited to see how my pieces turn out after they're fired. By the way, my sister's birthday is coming up soon, and I just finished making a quilt for her.",
