Here's a simple framework to help you prioritize your content based on your upcoming events:\n\n**1. Identify Your Key Events:**\n\nMake a list of your upcoming events, including the dates, locations, and types of events (e.g., craft fairs, markets, holiday markets).\n\n**2. Categorize Your Content:**\n\nGroup your content into the following categories:\n\n* **Event-specific content**: Content directly related to your events, such as event announcements, vendor spotlights, and sneak peeks.\n* **Product-focused content**: Content showcasing your products, including product features, tutorials, and behind-the-scenes content.\n* **Evergreen content**: Content that remains relevant and valuable to your audience regardless of the event schedule, such as educational content, tips, and FAQs.\n\n**3. Assign Priority Levels:**\n\nAssign a priority level to each content category based on your event schedule:\n\n* **High priority**: Event-specific content for upcoming events (e.g., promoting your craft fair appearance next week).\n* **Medium priority**: Product-focused content that showcases products relevant to the upcoming event (e.g., highlighting your new candle collection for the holiday market).\n* **Low priority**: Evergreen content that can be shared at any time (e.g., a tutorial on how to care for handmade soap).\n\n**4. Create a Content Calendar:**\n\nPlan your content in advance using a content calendar. Schedule your high-priority content first, followed by medium-priority content, and finally, low-priority content. Be sure to leave some buffer time for unexpected events or changes in your schedule.\n\n**5. Adjust and Refine:**\n\nMonitor your analytics and adjust your content priority levels based on performance and audience engagement. Refine your content strategy as needed to ensure you're meeting your goals and resonating with your audience.\n\nHere's an example of how you could prioritize your content based on an upcoming craft fair:\n\n* High priority: Event-specific content (craft fair announcement, vendor spotlight, sneak peek of new products)\n* Medium priority: Product-focused content (showcasing candles and soaps that will be available at the craft fair)\n* Low priority: Evergreen content (educational content on the benefits of handmade soap)\n\nBy prioritizing your content based on your events, you'll be able to create a focused content strategy that drives engagement, promotes your products, and attracts attendees to your events.",
