  "content": "That's great to hear! Daily brushing can make a huge difference in reducing shedding, and it's wonderful that you've seen an improvement already. The bonding time with your cat is an added bonus!\n\nThe freeze-dried salmon treats are an excellent choice, too! Salmon is a nutrient-rich ingredient that's packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which are fantastic for Luna's skin, coat, and overall health. The omega-3s can help reduce inflammation, promote healthy skin, and even support her heart health.\n\nSince you've started brushing daily, you might notice that Luna's shedding has decreased, and her coat looks healthier and shinier. The brushing helps distribute skin oils, which can improve the overall appearance of her coat.\n\nTo take it to the next level, you could consider adding some omega-3 supplements to her diet, in consultation with your vet, of course. These supplements can provide an extra boost to her skin and coat health.\n\nRemember to always introduce new foods or supplements gradually to prevent any digestive upset. And, as always, consult with your vet before making any significant changes to Luna's diet or supplement routine.\n\nKeep up the great work, and enjoy those snuggle sessions with Luna!",
