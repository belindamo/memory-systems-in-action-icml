  "content": "It sounds like you're already doing a great job of keeping Luna active and engaged! Adding interactive toys to her playtime routine can be an excellent way to provide mental and physical stimulation, and help prevent boredom and stagnation.\n\nThe interactive toys I recommended earlier, such as puzzle toys, treat-dispensing toys, and hide-and-seek toys, can be a great addition to Luna's playtime routine. These types of toys can help challenge her problem-solving skills, encourage her natural hunting instincts, and provide a fun and engaging way to exercise her brain and body.\n\nSince Luna enjoys climbing and playing on her cat tree, she may particularly enjoy interactive toys that encourage vertical play, such as:\n\n1. **Cat towers with interactive elements**: Look for cat towers with built-in puzzle toys, treat dispensers, or hidden compartments that challenge Luna to climb and problem-solve.\n2. **Wall-mounted toys**: Wall-mounted toys that encourage vertical play, such as scratching posts with hidden treats or puzzle toys, can be a great way to keep Luna active and engaged.\n3. **Interactive climbing walls**: Interactive climbing walls with hidden treats or puzzle toys can provide a fun and challenging way for Luna to exercise her climbing skills.\n\nWhen introducing new toys, remember to:\n\n1. **Start slowly**: Introduce new toys gradually to prevent overwhelming Luna.\n2. **Observe and adjust**: Watch Luna's behavior and adjust the toys or playtime routine as needed to ensure she's engaged and having fun.\n3. **Rotate toys regularly**: Continue to rotate toys every week to keep things fresh and exciting for Luna.\n4. **Encourage playtime**: Make time for playtime with Luna, using the interactive toys to encourage her to engage and have fun.\n\nBy incorporating interactive toys into Luna's playtime routine, you can help provide a more stimulating and engaging environment, which can lead to a happier and healthier cat.",
