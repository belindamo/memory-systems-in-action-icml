However, I can suggest a few ways for you to find out more about upcoming classes and workshops at the studio:\n\n1. **Check their website**: Visit the studio's website to see if they have a calendar of events, class schedules, or a newsletter sign-up. This should give you an idea of what's coming up.\n2. **Follow them on social media**: Many businesses use social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to announce upcoming events and promotions. Follow the studio to stay up-to-date on their latest offerings.\n3. **Give them a call or visit in person**: Reach out to the studio directly to ask about their current or upcoming classes. They might have some new classes or workshops that aren't listed online yet.\n4. **Sign up for their email newsletter**: If the studio has a newsletter, sign up to receive updates on new classes, promotions, and events.\n\nYou might also consider asking your instructor or other students at the studio for recommendations on upcoming classes or workshops that they think you might enjoy.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with your pottery-making! It's a great hobby, and it's wonderful that you're sharing it with your family through your handmade gifts.\n\nDo you have a favorite part of the pottery-making process, or is there a specific technique you're looking to learn or improve on in your next class?",
