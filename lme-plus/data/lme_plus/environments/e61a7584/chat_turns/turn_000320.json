  "content": "What a great idea! Interactive toys are an excellent way to provide mental and physical stimulation for your furry friend, Luna! Here are some paw-some recommendations that'll keep her engaged and active:\n\n1. **Kong Toy**: A classic! Fill the Kong with treats, peanut butter, or even canned dog food, and Luna will be busy for hours trying to get them out. You can also freeze it for an extra challenge.\n2. **Tricky Treat Ball**: This treat-dispensing ball will keep Luna's problem-solving skills sharp. Fill it with her favorite treats, and she'll have to figure out how to get them out by rolling, pushing, and pawing at the ball.\n3. **Puzzle Toys**: Puzzle toys like Outward Hound's Brick Puzzle or Nina Ottosson's Dog Brick challenge Luna to figure out how to get the treats out by sliding, lifting, and rotating the pieces.\n4. **Hide-and-Seek Toys**: Toys like the Hide-a-Squirrel or the Snuffle Mat encourage Luna to use her sense of smell and problem-solving skills to find hidden treats or kibble.\n5. **Interactive Feeder**: An interactive feeder like the Outward Hound's Sensory Maze Feeder or the Omega Paw Tricky Treat Feeder will challenge Luna to work for her meals, slowing down eating and providing mental stimulation.\n6. **Tug Toys with Hiding Compartments**: Toys like the West Paw Design's Tux Interactive Dog Toy or the Pet Zone Treat Wobbler have hiding compartments that encourage Luna to problem-solve and tug to get the treats out.\n7. **Sensory Mats**: Sensory mats like the Pawfect Pets Sensory Mat or the Pet Zone Treat Mat provide a variety of textures, smells, and hidden treats to keep Luna engaged and active.\n8. **Interactive Plush Toys**: Toys like the Pet Zone Treat Trix or the Outward Hound's Sensory Plush Toy have hidden treats or squeakers that encourage Luna to problem-solve and engage in play.\n9. **Obstacle Course Toys**: Toys like the Pawfect Pets Obstacle Course or the Outward Hound's Agility Tunnel provide a fun and challenging way for Luna to exercise her physical and mental abilities.\n10. **Subscription Boxes**: Consider a dog subscription box like BarkBox or PupJoy, which often include interactive toys and treats tailored to Luna's size and preferences.\n\nRemember to rotate toys regularly to keep things fresh and exciting for Luna.
