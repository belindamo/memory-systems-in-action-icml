  "content": "The Salted Caramel Chocolate Crinkle Cookies are a showstopper, and the crinkled surface is a big part of their charm. Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect crinkles:\n\n1. **Use the right sugar:** The crinkles are created by rolling the dough balls in a mixture of granulated sugar and flaky sea salt. Use a high-quality, flaky sea salt like Maldon or Fleur de Sel, and make sure it's fresh and not too fine.\n2. **Chill the dough:** Chilling the dough is crucial to help the cookies retain their shape and create a crinkled surface. Chill the dough for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow the butter to firm up and the flour to hydrate.\n3. **Use the right rolling technique:** When rolling the dough balls, make sure to apply gentle pressure to compress the dough slightly. This will help the sugar and salt stick to the dough. Roll the balls between your palms to shape them into smooth spheres.\n4. **Coat evenly:** Place the granulated sugar and flaky sea salt mixture in a shallow dish. Gently roll each dough ball in the sugar mixture to coat evenly, making sure to press the sugar onto the dough slightly. This will help the sugar stick and create a crinkled surface.\n5. **Don't over-sugar:** Use just enough sugar and salt to coat the dough balls lightly. Excess sugar can prevent the cookies from spreading properly and create a smooth surface instead of crinkles.\n6. **Bake at the right temperature:** Bake the cookies at the correct temperature (375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C) to help them spread and create a crinkled surface. If the oven is too hot or too cold, the cookies may not develop the right texture.\n7. **Don't overbake:** Take the cookies out of the oven when they're lightly golden and still slightly soft to the touch. Overbaking can cause the cookies to lose their crinkles and become too crispy.\n8. **Cool on the baking sheet:** Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5-7 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack. This will help them retain their shape and crinkles.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a beautifully crinkled surface on your Salted Caramel Chocolate Crinkle Cookies. Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first batch doesn't turn out exactly as you hoped. Keep trying, and you'll soon be a crinkle cookie master!\n\nHere's the recipe for Salted Caramel Chocolate Crinkle Cookies:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 tsp baking soda\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature\n* 3/4 cup white granulated sugar\n* 1 cup brown sugar\n* 2 large eggs\n* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract\n* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\n* 1/2 cup flaky sea salt\n* 1/4 cup granulated sugar (for coating)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
