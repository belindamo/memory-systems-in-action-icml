This should yield 8-12 bars depending on the size you cut them. Each bar will be approximately 150-200 calories, making them a satisfying snack to curb your hunger between meals.\n\n**Healthy Coffee Creamer Alternatives:**\n\nIf you're looking for a healthier alternative to traditional coffee creamers, here are some options:\n\n1. **Coconut Oil or Ghee:** Add a spoonful of melted coconut oil or ghee to your coffee for a creamy, dairy-free alternative.
