  "content": "Altruism is when you care about other people and are willing to put their needs ahead of your own. It's like if you give your toy to a friend who really wants to play with it, even if you really wanted to play with it yourself. In our society, many people believe that being selfless and putting others first is the best way to be a good person.\n\nBut there is a philosopher named Ayn Rand who thinks differently. She believes that putting your own interests first is the way to survive and be happy in life. She says that nature doesn't guarantee that we'll always be safe and have what we need, so we have to make sure we take care of ourselves first. If we always put others first, we might not have enough for ourselves and could end up struggling to survive.\n\nRand also thinks that being too selfless can actually be bad for us. If we always give to others and never think about our own needs, we might end up feeling unhappy and unfulfilled. She thinks that we should take care of ourselves first, so that we can be healthy and happy, and then we can help others.\n\nSo, while some people think that being selfless is the best way to be a good person, others like Ayn Rand think that putting ourselves first is the best way to survive and be happy.",
