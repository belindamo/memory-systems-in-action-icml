  "content": "Eggs benedict is a classic brunch dish! Hollandaise sauce is a crucial component, and making it from scratch can be a bit tricky, but I've got a reliable recipe for you.\n\n**Hollandaise Sauce Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n* 1/2 cup egg yolks\n* 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for some heat)\n* Salt, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Double Boiler Setup**: Fill a medium saucepan with about an inch of water and bring it to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and keep the water at a gentle simmer.\n2. **Whisk Egg Yolks**: In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper (if using) until well combined.\n3. **Melt Butter**: Place the bowl over the saucepan with simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl isn't touching the water. Slowly melt the butter in the microwave or in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally.\n4. **Temper the Egg Yolks**: Slowly pour the melted butter into the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Make sure to pour the butter very slowly, as you want to temper the egg yolks without scrambling them.\n5. **Cook and Whisk**: Continue whisking until the mixture thickens and emulsifies, about 5-7 minutes. You'll know it's done when the sauce has doubled in volume, is smooth, and has a thick, creamy consistency.\n6. **Season and Strain**: Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in a pinch of salt. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any excess egg yolk solids.\n7. **Serve**: Use the hollandaise sauce immediately, or refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze for up to 2 months. Reheat gently over low heat, whisking constantly, before serving.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use room-temperature egg yolks for easier whisking and emulsification.\n* Whisk constantly when tempering the egg yolks to prevent scrambling.\n* Don't overheat the sauce, as it can break and become too thick.\n* If the sauce breaks, don't worry! Simply start again with a new egg yolk and slowly whisk in the broken sauce.\n\nNow that you have the hollandaise sauce recipe, you're ready to make a delicious eggs benedict this weekend! Enjoy",
