I'd be happy to help you find a great brunch spot for your group.\n\nFirst, congratulations on discovering a new brunch spot that you loved! It's always exciting to find a new favorite spot.\n\nFor your group of 5-6 people, I'll need a bit more information to give you tailored recommendations. Here are a few questions to help me narrow down some options:\n\n1. What's your preferred location for the brunch spot? Is it in a specific neighborhood, city, or region?\n2. Are you open to trying a new spot, or do you have a particular cuisine or atmosphere in mind (e.g., farm-to-table, buffet, outdoor seating, etc.)?\n3. Do you have a budget in mind for the meal, or is it flexible?\n4. Are there any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, etc.) that the venue should accommodate?\n5. Do you need a private room or area, or are you okay with a more casual, open seating arrangement?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your preferences, I can provide some personalized recommendations for a fantastic brunch spot that fits your group's needs!"
