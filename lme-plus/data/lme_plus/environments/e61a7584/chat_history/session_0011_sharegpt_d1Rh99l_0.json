Repeat alternating. Have each workout use 3 sets of 15 reps. each lower body workout should alternate from hip to knee dominant movements and should account for posterior and anterior chain collectively. Use as many compound exercises (multi-joint movements) as possible. For upper body, stick to the same rep scheme, and keep as many compound movements as possible. try and stick to exercises that are freeweight more than machines."
