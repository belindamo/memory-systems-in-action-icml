      "content": "Gollum is a fictional character from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. He is introduced in the 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, and plays a central role in its sequel, The Lord of the Rings. Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit of the River-folk, who lived near the Gladden Fields. Originally known as Sm\u00e9agol, he was corrupted by the One Ring and became the creature known as Gollum. He was highly secretive and possessed an intense, obsessive desire for the Ring, which had a corrupting influence on him. Gollum was torn between his loyalty to the Ring, which he referred to as \"my precious\" or \"precious,\" and his love for his \"master,\" Bilbo Baggins, who took the Ring from him. The character has become iconic, and has been referenced and parodied in popular culture."
