      "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal experience, but usually, musicians and their teams do a lot of preparation and research before creating a new album or EP. \n\n1. Ideation: Artists brainstorm ideas based on their inspirations and experiences that can be turned into songs or themes.\n\n2. Demos: A demo is a rough draft of the song, including the melody, lyrics, hooks, and other important elements. Through these demos, artists try to experiment with different tunes and rhythms to see which combination works best.\n\n3. Songwriting: Once the demos are selected, artist or team starts to write lyrics for the songs, keeping in mind the theme of the album.\n\n4. Recording: After writing the songs or lyrics to the music, artists, and producers go to the recording studio or home-based studio to record the songs.\n\n5. Mixing and Mastering: Once the recordings are done, the mixing and mastering stage starts. Mixing is the process of blending all the separate elements of recording into the final product, and mastering is the process of fine-tuning the album's overall sound.\n\n6. Marketing: Once the album is complete, artists and their teams prepare to market the album or EP. They create visuals, bios, and other assets that will promote the songs and album on social media, radio, and other media platforms.\n\n7. Post-release analysis: After the album is released, analysis and criticism come about. Songs that perform well are often used to make remixes, music videos or may be included in a live show tour. \n\nOverall, creating an album requires mental and emotional energy from artists to complete the project. It requires a lot of preparation, patience, and hard work to achieve success."
