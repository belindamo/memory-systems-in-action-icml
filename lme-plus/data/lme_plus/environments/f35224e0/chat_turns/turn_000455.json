I've been listening to podcasts during my daily commute, which is about 45 minutes each way, so I'm always looking for new shows to add to my rotation. Are there any podcasts on this list that are more focused on the stories behind the companies, similar to \"How I Built This\"? I've finished around 15 episodes so far and I really enjoy hearing about the founders' journeys and the challenges they faced when building their businesses.",
