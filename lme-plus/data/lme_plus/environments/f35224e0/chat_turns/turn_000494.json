This helps the chicken cook more evenly and prevents it from becoming too thick and dry.\n2. **Seasoning**: Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs (e.g., Italian seasoning, garlic powder, or dried basil) before adding it to the pot. This helps lock in moisture and flavor.\n3. **Sear the chicken**: Sear the chicken breast in a hot skillet with some olive oil before adding the pasta and cherry tomatoes. This creates a nice crust on the outside, which helps retain juices.\n4. **Don't overcook**: Cook the chicken breast until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Overcooking can make the chicken dry and tough.\n5. **Add aromatics**: Add aromatics like onions, garlic, and celery to the pot, which will release moisture and flavor as they cook. This helps keep the chicken breast moist.\n6. **Use a gentle heat**: Once you add the pasta and cherry tomatoes, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. This helps cook the chicken breast slowly and evenly, preventing it from drying out.\n7. **Don't overcrowd**: Make sure to leave enough space between the chicken breast and the pasta, so the chicken can cook evenly and not steam instead of sear.\n8. **Add a little acidity**: A splash of lemon juice or white wine can help tenderize the chicken breast and add flavor to the dish.\n\nHere's a sample recipe to get you started:\n\n**One-Pot Pasta with Chicken Breast, Cherry Tomatoes, and Spinach**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* 1 onion, diced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved\n* 1 cup spinach leaves\n* 1 cup whole-grain pasta (e.g., penne or fusilli)\n* Salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning\n* 1/4 cup white wine (optional)\n* 1/4 cup chicken broth\n* Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Pound the chicken breast to an even thickness.\n2. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.\n3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken breast until browned on both sides, about 5-6 minutes.\n4. Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent.\n5. Add the cherry tomatoes, spinach, pasta, white wine (if using), and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir to combine.\n6. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook, covered, until the pasta is al dente and the chicken breast reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n7. Serve hot, topped with grated Parmesan cheese (if desired).\n\nBy following these tips and the recipe, you should end up with a deliciously tender and juicy chicken breast in your one-pot pasta dish!",
