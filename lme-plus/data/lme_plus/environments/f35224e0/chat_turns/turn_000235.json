Can you clean up this version (without changing it significantly) and then give me the whole thing again?\n\nThe advantage of using design tokens over other approaches is that they simplify the process of updating and maintaining consistency across applications. Imagine you want to make your bakery's frosting sweeter. You would update the frosting recipe, and then inform your fellow bakers to use the updated version. From that point on, all the cakes in your bakery will have the sweeter frosting. You don't have to update all the different cake recipes individually. Similarly, when you update a design token, all of your designs will incorporate the change without being individually managed.",
