These programs provide guidance on creating a bird-friendly habitat and recognize your efforts to support local wildlife.\n\nBy following these tips and continuing to maintain your birdbath and native plantings, you'll be well on your way to creating a bird-friendly habitat that attracts a variety of bird species to your yard!",
