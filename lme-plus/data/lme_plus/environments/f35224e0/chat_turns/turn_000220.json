Estate sales can be a treasure trove for finding unique and valuable pieces at a fraction of their worth. It's great that you have a good eye for spotting hidden gems.\n\nNow, I'm curious - what's the story behind the vase? Do you know anything about its history, or is it a complete mystery?\n\nAlso, have you considered adding any other decorative elements to the coffee table, such as a table runner, placemats, or a few decorative books? These can help tie the whole look together and add some extra texture and interest.\n\nLet me know, and I can offer some suggestions if you'd like!",
