To help you improve your running performance and increase your running frequency, I've got some advice for you:\n\n**Gradual Progression**\n\n1. **Increase mileage gradually**: To avoid injury, increase your weekly mileage by no more than 10% each week. This allows your body to adapt to the demands of running.\n2. **Gradually increase frequency**: Aim to add one extra run per week, every two weeks, to allow your body to adapt to the increased frequency.\n\n**Structured Training**\n\n1. **Create a training plan**: Develop a structured training plan that includes a mix of easy runs, interval workouts, hill repeats, and long runs. This will help you build endurance, speed, and strength.\n2. **Incorporate interval training**: Intervals can help you improve your running efficiency, speed, and endurance. Examples include 4-6 x 800m at a fast pace, with 400m active recovery in between.\n3. **Include strength training**: Incorporate strength exercises 2-3 times a week to target your core, glutes, and legs. This will help you maintain good form and reduce your risk of injury.\n\n**Incorporating Rest and Recovery**\n\n1. **Rest and recovery days**: Make sure to include rest and recovery days in your training plan. This allows your body to recover from the demands of running and adapt to the training stimulus.\n2. **Listen to your body**: If you're feeling fatigued or experiencing pain, take an extra rest day or modify your workout to avoid exacerbating the issue.\n\n**Nutrition and Hydration**\n\n1. **Fuel your runs**: Make sure to fuel your runs with a balanced diet that includes complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats. Avoid heavy meals before runs, and opt for light snacks or sports drinks instead.\n2. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water or sports drinks to stay hydrated, especially during and after runs.\n\n**Mental Preparation**\n\n1. **Set realistic goals**: Set realistic goals for yourself, both in terms of performance and frequency. This will help you stay motivated and focused.\n2. **Visualize success**: Visualize yourself achieving your goals, including completing your runs and feeling strong and confident.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help your body recover from the demands of running.\n2. **Join a running community**: Joining a running community or finding a running buddy can help you stay motivated and accountable.\n3. **Track your progress**: Keep a running log or use a tracking app to monitor your progress, including your pace, distance, and heart rate.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to increasing your running frequency and improving your performance.
