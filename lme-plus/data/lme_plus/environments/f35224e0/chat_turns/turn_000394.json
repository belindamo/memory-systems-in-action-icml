Examples include original documents, photographs, videos, and objects.\n\nSecondary evidence, on the other hand, is evidence that is not original and is used to support or supplement primary evidence. Examples include photocopies, transcriptions, and hearsay testimony. Secondary evidence is generally considered less reliable than primary evidence because it is not an original source.",
