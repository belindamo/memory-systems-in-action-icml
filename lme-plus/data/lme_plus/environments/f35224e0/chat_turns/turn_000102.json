  "content": "That sounds amazing! I've been to the Great Ocean Road before, and it's definitely a must-see in Australia. I actually went there with some friends during my study abroad program at the University of Melbourne. We had a blast exploring the coast, hiking, and taking in the stunning views. If you have time, I'd recommend stopping by the Kennett River Koala Walk to spot some koalas in their natural habitat.",
