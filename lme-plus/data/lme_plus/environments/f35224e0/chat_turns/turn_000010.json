  "content": "I loved \"The Power\" by Naomi Alderman! It was such a thought-provoking and timely read. Our book club discussion was really fascinating, and we had a great conversation about the themes of power dynamics and resistance. Our discussion leader, Rachel, did a great job of guiding the conversation and asking insightful questions that really made us think.",
