  "content": "Frozen spinach can be a great alternative to fresh spinach, and it's definitely worth considering, especially if you're short on time or want to reduce food waste.\n\nIn general, frozen spinach can work well in this one-pot pasta dish, but it will change the texture and flavor slightly. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Texture:** Frozen spinach will release more water when thawed, which can make the sauce slightly more watery. However, since this is a one-pot pasta dish, the starches from the pasta will help absorb some of the excess moisture.\n\n**Flavor:** Frozen spinach can be slightly blander than fresh spinach, but it will still provide a nice spinach flavor to the dish. You might need to adjust the amount of seasoning or add a bit more garlic to balance the flavor.\n\nTo use frozen spinach in this recipe, follow these tips:\n\n1. **Thaw the spinach:** Defrost the frozen spinach according to the package instructions. You can thaw it in the microwave, in cold water, or by leaving it in room temperature for a few hours.\n2. **Squeeze out excess water:** Once thawed, squeeze out as much water as possible from the spinach using a cheesecloth, paper towels, or a clean kitchen towel. This will help reduce the excess moisture.\n3. **Add it to the pot:** Add the thawed and drained spinach to the pot along with the cherry tomatoes and pasta. You can add it towards the end of the cooking time, so the spinach heats through and wilts into the sauce.\n\nKeep in mind that using frozen spinach will change the cooking time slightly. Since it's already thawed, it will cook faster than fresh spinach, so adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\nIn summary, frozen spinach can be a good substitute in this recipe, but it will affect the texture and flavor slightly. Just be sure to thaw, squeeze out excess water, and adjust the seasoning as needed. Enjoy your one-pot pasta dinner!",
