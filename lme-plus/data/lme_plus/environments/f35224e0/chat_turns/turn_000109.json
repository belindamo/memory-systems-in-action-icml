It's a thoughtful way to acknowledge Emily's role as a big sister and create a sense of connection between the siblings.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider when adding a message:\n\n1. **Keep it short and sweet**: A shorter message is better, as it will be easier to read and won't overwhelm the design. \"Big sister Emily loves you\" is a great length, but you could also consider something like \"Emily's little bro\" or \"Emily's buddy\".\n2. **Choose a fitting font**: Select a font that's easy to read and suits the tone of the message. A playful, cursive font might be perfect for a sweet message like this.\n3. **Balance the design**: Make sure the message doesn't overpower the baby's name and initials. You might consider placing the message in a smaller font or in a corner of the blanket to create a sense of balance.\n4. **Check with Sarah**: Before finalizing the design, run it by Sarah to ensure she's comfortable with the message and the overall design.\n\nHere's an example of what the design could look like:\n\n**Baby's Name:** Liam James Smith\n**Initials:** L.J.S.\n**Message:** Big sister Emily loves you\n\nRemember to choose a high-quality blanket and embroidery service to ensure the final product is soft, cozy, and beautifully crafted. I'm sure Sarah and her family will treasure this special gift!",
