I've been listening to a lot of podcasts during my daily commute, and I'm always interested in hearing about the stories behind successful tech companies. Do you know if any of these podcasts have episodes that cover companies that were founded by non-technical founders? I think it's really inspiring to hear about entrepreneurs who didn't have a technical background but still managed to build successful companies.",
