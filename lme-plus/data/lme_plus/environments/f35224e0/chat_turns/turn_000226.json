  "content": "Design tokens are like a box of crayons. Imagine you're an artist, and you have to color a variety of different pictures. Instead of using different crayons for each picture, you have a set of crayons that you use consistently across all of your artwork. This way, the colors in your drawings look harmonious and consistent, and people can easily recognize your style.\n\nIn design, we use design tokens as our \"crayons\" to maintain consistency in the visual aspects of a project, like colors, typography, and spacing. They are the smallest units of a design system, and we use them to create a more coherent and harmonious look across different platforms and devices. So, just like the box of crayons helps you keep your artwork consistent, design tokens help designers keep their work consistent across various projects.",
