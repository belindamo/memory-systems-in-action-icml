  "content": "Design tokens are like a recipe book for your favorite dishes. Imagine you are a chef, and you want to create a consistent flavor and presentation for your dishes across different branches of your restaurant. To ensure this consistency, you create a recipe book with specific ingredients, quantities, and cooking instructions that all the chefs must follow.\n\nIn design, we use design tokens as our \"recipe book\" to maintain consistency in the visual aspects of a project, like colors, typography, and spacing. They are the smallest units of a design system, and we use them to create a more coherent and harmonious look across different platforms and devices. The advantage of using design tokens over other approaches is that they can be easily updated, shared, and managed centrally. This means that if you want to change a color or a font style, you can do it in one place, and the change will propagate throughout the entire project, ensuring consistency.\n\nSo, just like a recipe book helps chefs maintain consistency in their dishes, design tokens help designers keep their work consistent across various projects while allowing for efficient updates and collaboration.",
