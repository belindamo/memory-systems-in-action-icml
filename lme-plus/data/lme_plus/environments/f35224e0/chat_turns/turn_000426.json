  "content": "Both knock-out and round-robin formats are widely used in professional sports. In fact, many sports organizations use different formats for different stages of a competition. For instance, some sports may use a knock-out format for the early stages of a competition and then switch to a round-robin format for the later stages.\n\nThat being said, the knock-out format is often used in some of the biggest and most high-profile competitions in professional sports, such as the FIFA World Cup, Wimbledon, and the NFL playoffs. This is because the knock-out format can create more excitement and drama for spectators, since a single match can determine a participant's fate in the competition.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that each sport and competition has its unique demands and challenges, and the choice of tournament format often depends on various factors, such as the number of participants, available venue, and scheduling considerations.",
