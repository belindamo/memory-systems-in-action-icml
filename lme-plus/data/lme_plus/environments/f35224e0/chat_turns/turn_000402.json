  "content": "The Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) is a mechanism for resolving disputes over domain name registrations. It applies to all domain names registered under ICANN-accredited registrars and provides a low-cost, fast, and efficient mechanism for resolving disputes. Some of the salient features of the UDRP are:\n\n1. Cost-effective: The UDRP is a cost-effective mechanism for resolving domain name disputes as compared to court litigation. The fees for filing a complaint and administrative fees are generally lower than the cost of traditional legal proceedings.\n2. Fast: The UDRP process is designed to be fast and efficient. The decision of the panel is typically rendered within a few months of the complaint being filed.\n3. Expertise: The panel appointed by the dispute resolution service provider (DRSP) to review the case is composed of experts in domain name disputes and intellectual property law.\n4. Binding: The decision of the panel is final and binding, and can order the transfer or cancellation of the disputed domain name.\n5. Fairness: The UDRP process is designed to be fair and impartial, providing equal opportunity for both the complainant and the registrant to present their case.\n6. Online: The UDRP process is conducted online and the documents are filed electronically.\n7. Language: The UDRP process is conducted in the language of the registration agreement, unless the panel determines that the complaint was filed in another language.\n8. No appeal: There is no appeal process under the UDRP, making the process quicker and more cost-effective.\n9. Only for ICANN-accredited registrars: The UDRP only applies to disputes over domain names registered under ICANN-accredited registrars and is not applicable to disputes over country code top-level domain names (ccTLDs) such as .in, .uk, etc.\n10. Only for legal right: The UDRP process is based on the legal right of a person to a domain name. It is not based on the first come, first serve basis.",
