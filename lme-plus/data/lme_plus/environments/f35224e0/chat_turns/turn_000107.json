Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Name and Initials**: A classic choice is to embroider the baby's name (e.g., \"Liam\") and initials (e.g., \"L.J.S.\") on the blanket. This adds a special touch and makes the gift truly unique.\n2. **Special Message**: Consider a heartfelt message like \"Welcome to the World, Baby [Name]\" or \"Love, [Your Name]\" to make the gift even more personal.\n3. **Birth Details**: Embroider the baby's birth details, such as date, time, weight, and length, to create a unique and memorable keepsake.\n4. **Monogrammed Alphabet**: If you're unsure of the baby's name, opt for a monogrammed alphabet blanket with the first letter of the baby's name (e.g., \"L\" for Liam).\n5. **Cute Designs**: Add a playful touch with cute designs like baby animals (e.g., lions, monkeys, or bears), baby blocks, or nursery rhyme characters.\n6. **Family Name**: If you're close to Sarah, consider embroidering the family's last name or a special nickname (e.g., \"Baby [Last Name]\" or \"Little Buddy\").\n7. **Special Quote**: Choose a quote that resonates with you or Sarah, such as \"You are loved\" or \"Dream big, little one.\"\n8. **Personalized Pattern**: Opt for a custom pattern that reflects the baby's interests or Sarah's style, like a sports team logo, a favorite animal, or a specific color scheme.\n9. **Baby's Nickname**: If Sarah has already given her baby boy a nickname, consider embroidering it on the blanket for a unique and personalized touch.\n10. **Coordinating Colors**: Choose a blanket color that matches the nursery's theme or Sarah's favorite colors to make the gift even more thoughtful.\n\nRemember to check with Sarah about any specific preferences or allergies when it comes to fabric, size, and design.
