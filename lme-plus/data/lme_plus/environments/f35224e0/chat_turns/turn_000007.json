  "content": "Your question about Olive Llewellyn was a great one, and I'm sure Emily St. John Mandel's answer was enlightening. Authors often draw from their own experiences and observations, so it's fascinating to hear how they weave those threads into their characters and stories.\n\nNow, about the literary festival you attended on March 4th... I think it's fantastic that you got to experience such an amazing event! Seeing authors like Celeste Ng, Tommy Orange, and Ayobami Adebayo discuss diversity in contemporary literature must have been incredibly enriching. Those authors are all known for their thought-provoking works, and I'm sure the discussion was lively and insightful.\n\nDiversity in literature is such an important topic, and it's crucial to have these conversations to promote greater understanding, empathy, and representation in the stories we tell. The fact that you got to hear from authors with diverse backgrounds and perspectives must have been incredibly valuable.\n\nWhat were some of the key takeaways or moments that stood out to you from the discussion? Were there any particular points or insights that resonated with you, or any questions you wished you could have asked the authors?",
