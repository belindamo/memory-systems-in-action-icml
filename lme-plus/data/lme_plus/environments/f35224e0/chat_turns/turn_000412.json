  "content": "I completely agree with you. Having diverse interview panels, including people of different genders, races, ages, abilities, and cultural backgrounds can help avoid unconscious bias during the hiring process. It allows for a broader perspective on the candidates, helping to eliminate subjective evaluations and create a fair and inclusive interviewing experience for everyone. Additionally, it sends a strong message to candidates that the company values diversity and inclusion, and is committed to creating an equal opportunity workplace. By taking this step, companies can also create a more open and transparent recruitment process, which can contribute to greater gender parity in leadership positions.",
