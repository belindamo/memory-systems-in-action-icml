A 3-ounce serving typically contains about 24 grams of protein and 2-3 grams of carbs.\n3. **Shrimp**: A low-carb and low-fat protein source.

A 3-ounce serving contains about 9 grams of protein and 2-3 grams of carbs.\n5. **Grass-fed ground beef**: While beef can be higher in carbs, grass-fed options tend to be lower.
