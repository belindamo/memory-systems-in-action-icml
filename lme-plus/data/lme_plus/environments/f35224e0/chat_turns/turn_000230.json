  "content": "Design tokens are like the recipes for frosting and batter at a bakery. Imagine you are a baker who wants to create a consistent flavor and appearance for your cakes across different designs and occasions. To ensure this consistency, you develop standard recipes for frosting and batter that can be used as the foundation for various types of cakes.\n\nIn design, we use design tokens as our \"standard recipes\" for the visual aspects of a project, like colors, typography, and spacing. They are the smallest units of a design system, and we use them to create a more coherent and harmonious look across different platforms and devices. By standardizing these fundamental components, designers can focus on creating unique designs while maintaining consistency.\n\nThe advantage of using design tokens over other approaches is that they can be easily updated, shared, and managed centrally. This means that if you want to change a color or a font style, you can do it in one place, and the change will propagate throughout the entire project, ensuring consistency.\n\nSo, just like having standard recipes for frosting and batter at a bakery allows for a consistent foundation while still enabling creativity in cake designs, design tokens help designers maintain consistency across various projects while streamlining the design process and allowing for more efficient updates and collaboration.",
