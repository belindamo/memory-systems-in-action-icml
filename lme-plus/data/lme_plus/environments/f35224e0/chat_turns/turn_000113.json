Here are a few more ideas that might fit the bill:\n\n1. **Big Sister of a Little Bro**: A playful design featuring the words \"Big Sister of a Little Bro\" in a bold, modern font. You could add a small icon of a onesie or a baby block with a blue accent to highlight the baby boy.\n2. **Sister to a Superhero**: A fun design featuring a cartoon-style superhero cape with the words \"Sister to a Superhero\" written above or below. This one is perfect for a big sister who's excited to have a little brother to look out for.\n3. **Big Sister, Little Bro Crush**: A cute design featuring a heart with an arrow through it, surrounded by the words \"Big Sister, Little Bro Crush\" in a playful, handwritten font.\n4. **Brotherly Love, Sisterly Pride**: A design that incorporates both sibling relationships, featuring the words \"Brotherly Love, Sisterly Pride\" in a circular pattern with a small heart or star symbol in the center.\n5. **Big Sister, Little Dude**: A fun, laid-back design featuring the words \"Big Sister, Little Dude\" in a bold, graffiti-style font. You could add a small icon of a baby boy's onesie or a pacifier to complete the look.\n6. **Sister to a Little Legend**: A design that implies the baby boy is going to grow up to be someone amazing, featuring the words \"Sister to a Little Legend\" in a strong, modern font. You could add a small icon of a star or a trophy to emphasize the idea.\n\nThese designs incorporate the fact that the baby is a boy while still emphasizing Emily's role as a big sister. I hope these ideas help inspire you to create a onesie that Emily will love!",
