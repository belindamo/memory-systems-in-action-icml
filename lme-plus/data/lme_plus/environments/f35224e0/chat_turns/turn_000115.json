  "content": "Adding Emily's name to the onesie is a great idea! It makes the gift even more personalized and special. You can definitely add her name above or below the main phrase, depending on the design and layout you prefer. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Name above the phrase**: \"Emily\" could be written in a smaller font above the main phrase \"Big Sister of a Little Bro\". This creates a clear hierarchy of information and makes Emily's name stand out.\n2. **Name below the phrase**: Alternatively, you could place \"Emily\" in a smaller font below the main phrase. This creates a sense of flow and continuity, and the name becomes a nice finishing touch to the design.\n3. **Integrated into the design**: If you want to get creative, you could integrate Emily's name into the design itself. For example, you could use a font that incorporates Emily's name into the words \"Big Sister of a Little Bro\", or use a design element that incorporates her name in a fun and playful way.\n\nWhen adding Emily's name, make sure to:\n\n* Choose a font that complements the main phrase and doesn't overpower it.\n* Keep the font size and style consistent throughout the design.\n* Leave enough space around the name and phrase to avoid clutter and ensure the design remains easy to read.\n\nBy adding Emily's name to the onesie, you'll create a unique and thoughtful gift that she'll cherish. It's a great way to make the gift feel extra special and personalized, and I'm sure she'll love wearing it!",
