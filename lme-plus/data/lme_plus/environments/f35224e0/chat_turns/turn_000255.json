  "content": "The history of Malayalam can be traced back to the ancient language Tamil. As early as the 8th century, Malayalam was considered a dialect of Tamil. However, over the centuries, Malayalam evolved into an independent language with its own distinctive script and vocabulary.\n\nThe earliest written record of Malayalam can be traced back to the 13th century, with the advent of the Vattezhuthu script. Over time, the script evolved into the modern-day Malayalam script, which was standardized in the 19th century.\n\nDuring the medieval period, Malayalam was heavily influenced by Sanskrit, and many Sanskrit words were borrowed and adapted into the language. This process continued into the colonial era, when English words also began to be absorbed into Malayalam.\n\nOne of the key figures in the evolution of Malayalam literature was Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan, a 16th-century poet and scholar who is considered one of the fathers of modern Malayalam. His works helped standardize the language and establish it as a separate entity from Tamil.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Malayalam literature experienced a resurgence, with writers such as Vaikom Muhammad Basheer and Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai producing works that tackled social and political issues. Today, Malayalam is one of the official languages of India and is spoken by millions of people in Kerala and beyond.",
