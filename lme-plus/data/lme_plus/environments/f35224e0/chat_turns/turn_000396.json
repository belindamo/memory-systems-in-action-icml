  "content": "I am sorry, I don't have the knowledge of Indian laws after 2021, but I can tell you about some general information about Indian laws.\n\nIn Indian law, primary evidence is considered to be more reliable than secondary evidence. Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines primary evidence as the original document or object that is directly relevant to a fact or event. Examples of primary evidence include original documents, photographs, videos, and objects.\n\nSecondary evidence, on the other hand, is evidence that is not original and is used to support or supplement primary evidence. Examples of secondary evidence include photocopies, transcriptions, and hearsay testimony. According to Indian Evidence Act, 1872, Secondary evidence is admissible only when the primary evidence is not available.\n\nIndian laws also recognize electronic records as evidence in court, provided they meet certain conditions set forth in the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.\n\nIn Indian laws, Hearsay evidence is not admissible as evidence, as it is based on the statement of a person who is not present in court and who cannot be cross-examined.\n\nIt is worth noting that Indian laws are complex and varied, and specific laws and regulations may apply in different situations.",
