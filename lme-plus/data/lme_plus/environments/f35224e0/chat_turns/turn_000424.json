  "content": "Yes, that's correct! In a knock-out format, it is possible for a participant to have a less-than-stellar performance in the earlier rounds and still come out on top in the end. This is because, in each round, the participant essentially starts with a clean slate, and as long as they can perform well in that individual match, they can move on to the next round.\n\nOn the other hand, in a round-robin format, a participant's overall performance throughout the entire competition is considered. This means that even if they have one or two weak performances, it could affect their overall standing in the competition, making it harder for them to progress to the next stage.",
