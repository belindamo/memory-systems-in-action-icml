Celeste Ng is indeed a champion of representation and inclusivity in literature, and her novels are a testament to her commitment to reflecting the diversity of the world we live in.\n\nNow, about your question on book recommendations... I'd be happy to suggest some titles that explore the theme of power dynamics and resistance! \"The Power\" by Naomi Alderman is a thought-provoking novel, and if you're looking for more books that delve into similar themes, here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **The Handmaid's Tale** by Margaret Atwood: A classic dystopian novel that explores a patriarchal society where women's bodies are controlled by the oppressive regime.\n2. **The Power** by Octavia Butler: A lesser-known novel by the legendary science fiction author, which explores a world where a young Black woman discovers she has the power to control and manipulate others.\n3. **The Fifth Season** by N.K. Jemisin: The first book in the Broken Earth trilogy, which is set in a world where natural disasters called \"Fifth Seasons\" have caused widespread destruction, and a group of orogenes with powerful abilities must navigate a complex web of power dynamics.\n4. **The Poppy War** by R.F. Kuang: A fantasy novel set in a world inspired by Chinese history and mythology, which explores the consequences of war, power, and resistance through the eyes of a young orphan girl who enrolls in a prestigious military academy.\n5. **The Song of Achilles** by Madeline Miller: A beautifully written novel that reimagines the Trojan War from the perspective of Achilles' lover, Patroclus, which explores the complexities of power, identity, and resistance in ancient Greece.\n\nThese books all explore themes of power dynamics, resistance, and social hierarchy, and I hope you find something that interests you!\n\nWhat did you think of \"The Power\" by Naomi Alderman, by the way?
