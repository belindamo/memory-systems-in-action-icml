  "content": "The amount of water one should drink during intense physical activity to prevent dehydration depends on several factors, such as your body weight, the intensity and duration of physical activity, and the temperature and humidity of the environment you're in. As an AI language model, I cannot suggest intake or prescribe a water quantity or routine to you, but here are some general hydration guidelines that you can consider:\n\n1. Pre-Activity: Drink at least 16-20 ounces (500-600 ml) of water 2-3 hours before the exercise session.\n\n2. During Activity: Drinking 7-10 ounces (200-300 ml) of water every 10-20 minutes during exercise is recommended to prevent dehydration.\n\n3. Post-Activity: It's essential to replace the fluid lost from sweating after exercise by drinking 20-24 ounces (600-700 ml) of water for every pound (0.5 kg) of body weight lost during the exercise session.\n\n4. Hydration Levels: Your body weight should be closely monitored throughout the day, and it's recommended to drink enough water to maintain normal hydration levels.\n\nIt's essential to remember that the above recommendations are general and may vary depending on your personal needs, fitness goals, and medical history. In case of severe dehydration, it's recommended to consult a healthcare professional.",
