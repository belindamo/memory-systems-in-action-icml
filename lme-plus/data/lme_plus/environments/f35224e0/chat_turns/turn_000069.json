It can provide insights into the character's personality, thoughts, or emotions, and offer a sense of intimacy between the viewer and the character.\n\nVoiceover narration can also be used to reinforce the themes and messages of a film. For example, it can offer a counterpoint to the visual narrative, or provide additional context that helps the audience understand what is happening on screen.\n\nHowever, the use of voiceover is not essential for connecting with a character, and in some cases, it can detract from the film's impact if not used effectively. Ultimately, the success of voiceover narration in a film will depend on its purpose, execution, and how it interacts with the rest of the movie.",
