  "content": "Yes! As of 2021, there are over 800 Royal Warrant holders, which includes individuals, companies, and tradespeople who supply goods or services to the royal household. New warrants are awarded and existing ones are reviewed regularly by the Royal Warrant Holders Association. Awards are made either to the reigning monarch, the consort of the monarch, or the heir to the throne. Companies that receive the royal warrant must demonstrate consistent excellence in their products and services, and they are reviewed regularly to ensure that they continue to meet the standards required of them. Companies can apply for a Royal Warrant, but it is not a given that it will be granted as it is a prestigious accolade and is only awarded to companies that meet the rigorous standards required.",
