However, \"folklore\" by Taylor Swift has been widely praised for its introspective and nostalgic lyrics along with its dreamy, indie-folk sound. Swift worked with Aaron Dessner of The National and Jack Antonoff to create the album in secret over the course of a few months during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released in July 2020 and quickly became a critical and commercial success, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and receiving numerous accolades and nominations. Many fans and critics noted that \"folklore\" marked a distinct departure from Swift's previous pop-oriented work and ushered in a new era of artistry for the singer.",
