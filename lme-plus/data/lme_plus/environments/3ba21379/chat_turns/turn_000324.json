  "content": "MK wakes up to the sound of food being thrown into his barrier prison. At first, he's cautious, wondering if it's some sort of trick or trap. But as his hunger takes over, he can't resist the temptation any longer and begins to devour everything in sight.\n\nAs he eats, he can't help but wonder why the monkeys are suddenly being kind to him after days of neglect. He looks up at them, but they only smile and wave before disappearing into the forest.\n\nMK finishes the food and lays back down, feeling a little better but still trapped and alone. He wonders what the monkeys want from him and if he'll ever be able to escape this prison.",
