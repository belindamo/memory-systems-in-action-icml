Choose reliable sources: Instead of relying on multiple sources, narrow down your list to a few trusted sources that provide consistent and reputable information on the topics you're interested in. This can help you focus on reliable information and spare yourself the noise from less reliable sources.\n\n2. Set limits: To prevent information overload, try setting limits on the amount of time you spend on social media or watching news. You can also decide which notifications to receive to prioritize the most important stories.\n\n3. Find balance: Try to find a balance between staying informed and taking breaks from the media. Allow yourself to unplug from the news and social media occasionally, to help recharge your energy.\n\n4. Check your biases: Be aware of your biases and how they affect your perception of the news. Try to read and listen to a wide range of opinions and perspectives to gain a more balanced view.\n\n5. Stay attentive to facts: Do not believe everything you see or read, particularly without fact-checking. Always verify the source and accuracy of the information before sharing it with others.\n\nOverall, finding the right balance of staying informed and avoiding information overload is crucial in combating propaganda and remaining a well-informed citizen.",
