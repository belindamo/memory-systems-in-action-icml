  "content": "MK's stomach growled loudly as he lay in the barrier prison. He hadn't eaten in days and was beginning to feel weak.\n\n\"Please, Wukong, can I have some food? Anything?\" he pleaded.\n\nWukong sneered down at him. \"What, do humans have to eat every day or something? How needy can you be?\"\n\nMK felt his cheeks flush with embarrassment. \"I'm sorry, I just...I'm hungry,\" he stammered.\n\nWukong rolled his eyes. \"Fine, I'll get you something. But don't expect me to make a habit of it. I have better things to do than cater to the needs of a weakling like you.\"\n\nHe disappeared for a few moments before returning with a small bowl of rice and a cup of water. He tossed them through the barrier prison at MK, who eagerly snatched them up and began to eat.\n\nAs he ate, MK couldn't help but feel a sense of bitterness towards Wukong. The Monkey King had been so kind to him at first, but now he seemed to delight in making his life miserable. MK vowed to find a way to escape this prison and get revenge on Wukong for what he had done.",
