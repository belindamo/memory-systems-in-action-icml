Beating your personal best by 10 minutes is a significant improvement, and it's fantastic that you can attribute it to your consistent training, including yoga.\n\nIt's no surprise that yoga has played a role in your improvement. As we discussed earlier, yoga can help with flexibility, balance, strength, and recovery, all of which are essential for running and cycling. The increased flexibility and strength in your core, glutes, and legs likely helped you maintain good form and generate more power during your run.\n\nAdditionally, yoga's focus on breathing, relaxation, and mental focus can also contribute to improved performance. By incorporating yoga into your routine, you've likely developed greater body awareness, which can help you optimize your running technique and make adjustments on the fly. The mental toughness and confidence you've gained from yoga can also help you push through challenging moments during your runs.\n\nIt's also great to hear that you've been consistent with your training. Consistency is key to seeing progress and improvements in any sport or activity. By combining your running and cycling training with yoga, you've created a well-rounded fitness routine that's paying dividends.\n\nWhat's your next goal or target? Are you planning to tackle a longer distance, like a half-marathon or marathon, or focus on improving your cycling performance?\n\nAlso, have you noticed any specific changes in your body or running form since incorporating yoga into your routine? For example, do you feel like you're landing more midfoot or forefoot instead of heel striking, or do you notice improvements in your posture or core engagement during runs?",
