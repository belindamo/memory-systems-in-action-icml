  "content": "**Varnish Remover Selection:**\nWhen choosing a varnish remover, consider the type of finish you're dealing with and the level of stripping needed. Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Mineral spirits-based removers**: Good for most varnishes and shellacs. Examples: Citristrip, Klean-Strip, and Goo Gone.\n2. **Methylene chloride-based removers**: Stronger and faster, but more hazardous. Use with caution. Examples: Zip Strip and Jasco.\n3. **Water-based removers**: Safer and more environmentally friendly, but may take longer to work. Examples: Eco-Strip and SmartStrip.\n4. **Bio-based removers**: Plant-based, eco-friendly options. Examples: SoyStrip and Bio-Strip.\n\nFor an antique armchair, I'd recommend starting with a mineral spirits-based remover like Citristrip or Klean-Strip. They're widely available and effective.\n\n**Safety First:**\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions, wear protective gear (gloves, safety glasses, and a mask), and work in a well-ventilated area.\n\n**Antique Furniture Restoration Resources:**\n\nBooks:\n\n1. **\"The New Traditional Woodworker\" by Jim Kingshott**: A comprehensive guide to traditional woodworking and furniture restoration.\n2. **\"Antique Furniture Restoration: A Comprehensive Guide\" by Michael Dresdner**: A detailed book on restoration techniques and materials.\n3. **\"Furniture Restoration: A Guide to the Care and Conservation of Furniture\" by Ian C.
