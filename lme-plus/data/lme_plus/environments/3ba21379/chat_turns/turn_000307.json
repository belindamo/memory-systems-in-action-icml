  "content": "Yes, there have been several initiatives to improve public transportation in Hulme in recent years. One of the most significant changes has been the extension of the Metrolink tram system, which now serves Hulme with the Hulme High Street and Cornbrook stops, providing residents with quick and easy access to other parts of Greater Manchester, including Manchester city center.\n\nAdditionally, Hulme has several bus routes that connect it to other parts of Manchester, such as the 85, 86, 101, 102, and 103. The bus network in Manchester is extensive, and many of the city's major bus routes pass through or close to Hulme.\n\nThere have also been other initiatives to encourage the use of public transportation in Hulme, such as the introduction of bike-sharing schemes and the promotion of cycling, which can be a convenient and healthy alternative to public transportation.\n\nOverall, these initiatives have made public transportation in Hulme more convenient, accessible, and reliable, making it an appealing place to live for those who rely on public transportation to get around.",
