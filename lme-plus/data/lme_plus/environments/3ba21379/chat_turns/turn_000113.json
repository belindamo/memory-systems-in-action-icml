  "content": "Yes, you can take the stairs to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but only up to the second level. If you want to go all the way to the top, you need to take the elevator. However, taking the stairs can be a rewarding experience as it allows you to enjoy the beautiful views from different levels at your own pace.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower has a total of 1665 stairs to the third level. However, the stairs are not open to public access all the way to the top, as it is not practical for visitors to climb all the way. Climbing the stairs to the second level involves 674 steps, and from there, you will need to take an elevator to reach the third level which has a total of 897 steps.",
