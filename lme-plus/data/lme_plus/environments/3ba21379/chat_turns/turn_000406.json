  "content": "Yes, there are several other festivals in Japan that focus on honoring ancestors. One such festival is Shichigosan, which is celebrated on November 15th. Shichigosan, which means \"seven-five-three\" in English, is a festival for children who are seven, five, and three years old. On this day, young children dress up in traditional clothing and visit shrines to pray for their health and growth. The festival celebrates the safety of children, and it is believed that visiting the shrines and offering prayers will protect them from harm.\n\nAnother festival that honors ancestors in Japan is Setsubun, which is celebrated on February 3rd or 4th. During Setsubun, people throw roasted soybeans called \"fuku mame\" while shouting \"Oni wa soto! Fuku wa uchi!\" (\"Demons out, luck in!\") to drive away evil spirits and bring good fortune to their homes. It is believed that the throwing of the beans can purify the home and bring good luck.\n\nOverall, the importance of ancestors and family is deeply rooted in Japanese culture, and many festivals are celebrated throughout the year to honor and pay respects to them.",
