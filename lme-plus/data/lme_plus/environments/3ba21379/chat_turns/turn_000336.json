Considering a gift for Olivia, the big sister, is a thoughtful touch that will make her feel special and included in the celebration.\n\nIncluding a gift for Olivia can help her feel more connected to the new babies and excited about her new role as a big sister. Here are some ideas for gifts that might be suitable for Olivia:\n\n1. **Big Sister T-Shirt or Onesie:** A cute \"Big Sister\" t-shirt or onesie is a fun way to acknowledge her new role.\n2. **Special Activity or Outing:** Gift Olivia an experience, like a special outing to the zoo, a movie night, or a fun activity she's been wanting to do. This will create memories and give her some one-on-one time with a parent or caregiver.\n3. **Book or Stuffed Animal:** A heartwarming book about being a big sister or a cuddly stuffed animal can help Olivia feel more connected to the new babies.\n4. **Art Supplies or Craft Kit:** A craft kit or art supplies can encourage Olivia to express her creativity and make something special for the babies.\n5. **Small Gift or Token:** A small gift or token, like a necklace, bracelet, or special charm, can serve as a reminder of her importance as a big sister.\n\nRemember, the gift itself is less important than the thought and love behind it. Choose something that reflects Olivia's interests and personality, and include a sweet note or card expressing your excitement for her new role as a big sister.\n\nWhen you present the gifts, you could say something like:\n\n\"Olivia, I'm so excited to welcome you to your new role as a big sister! I got you a special gift to celebrate this big change in your life. I hope you love it!\"\n\nBy including a gift for Olivia, you'll show Karen and her family that you care about everyone's feelings and are excited to celebrate this special time together.",
