  "content": "Wukong grabbed MK by the arm and gave him a quick look-over, tsking at his scrawny appearance.\n\n\"You're not much to look at, are you?\" he said.\n\nMK's stomach dropped at the thought that Wukong might be considering eating him. He tried to pull away, but Wukong held him tight.\n\n\"What's the matter, little monkey? You look like you're about to faint,\" Wukong teased.\n\nMK swallowed hard, trying to find his voice. \"W-what are you going to do with me?\" he asked.\n\nWukong grinned. \"Oh, I haven't decided yet. Maybe I'll keep you as a pet, or maybe I'll have you for dinner,\" he said, chuckling to himself.\n\nMK's heart raced as he tried to come up with a plan to escape. He had to find a way to get out of Wukong's grasp and back to his friends. But with Wukong's strength and cunning, it seemed like an impossible task.\n\nDesperately, MK tried to appeal to Wukong's sense of reason. \"Please, Wukong. I'm just a young boy. I haven't done anything to you. You don't have to hurt me,\" he pleaded.\n\nWukong laughed. \"I don't have to hurt you? I'm the great Monkey King! I can do whatever I want,\" he boasted.\n\nMK's hope began to fade as he realized he was at Wukong's mercy. He could only hope that his friends were out there, searching for him and planning a rescue.",
