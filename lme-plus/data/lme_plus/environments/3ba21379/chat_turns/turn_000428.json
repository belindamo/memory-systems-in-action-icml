Let me know what you think of it once you've given it a listen!\n\nAlso, if you want to explore more of their discography, I'd recommend checking out their earlier albums like \"Rubber Factory\" (2004) and \"Magic Potion\" (2006). These albums are a bit more raw and lo-fi, but they've got a lot of character and some amazing tracks.\n\nAnyway, happy listening, and I hope you discover some new favorite songs and albums!",
