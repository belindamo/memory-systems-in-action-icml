  "content": "MK wakes up to the sound of something hitting the ground. He sits up and sees that several monkeys are standing around his prison, throwing various types of food at him. MK's stomach growls as he stares at the food in front of him, realizing he hasn't eaten in days.\n\nMK: (gratefully) Thank you so much, I was starving.\n\nMonkey 1: Don't get too excited, we didn't do this out of kindness.\n\nMK: (pauses) What do you mean?\n\nMonkey 2: We need you to do something for us.\n\nMK: (suspiciously) What kind of something?\n\nMonkey 3: There's a cave nearby that we've been trying to explore, but there's a monster inside that keeps attacking us. We want you to go in and kill it for us.\n\nMK: (hesitantly) Why me? Can't you just ask Wukong to do it?\n\nMonkey 1: Wukong is too busy celebrating his victory over the Jade Emperor. Plus, he's got other plans for you.\n\nMK: (alarmed) Other plans? What plans?\n\nMonkey 2: We don't know the details, but we've heard Wukong talking about how he's going to use you to get more power.\n\nMK: (scared) More power? How?\n\nMonkey 3: We don't know, but we do know that you need to get out of here before it's too late.\n\nMK: (nodding) Okay, I'll help you with the cave monster. But how do I get out of here?\n\nMonkey 1: We'll create a distraction so Wukong won't notice when you leave. Just be careful.\n\nMK: (determined) I will. Thank you for the food and for warning me.\n\nThe monkeys nod and quickly scatter, leaving MK alone in his prison to plan his escape.",
