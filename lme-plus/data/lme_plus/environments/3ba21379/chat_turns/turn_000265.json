  "content": "I'd be happy to help you come up with some gift ideas for your family members.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your family members? For example:\n\n* What are their interests or hobbies?\n* What's their style or taste like? (e.g. classic, modern, eclectic)\n* Do they have any specific needs or wants that you're aware of?\n* What's your budget for each person?\n* Are there any specific categories you'd like to focus on (e.g. experiences, tech, luxury, practical items)?\n\nAlso, who else is on your list besides your sister and brother-in-law? Do you have parents, other siblings, nieces or nephews, or any other relatives you'd like to get gifts for?\n\nWith a bit more information, I can start generating some personalized gift ideas for you!",
