Here are some tips to help you deal with those feelings:\n\n1. **Give yourself time**: It's natural to feel like an outsider at first, but remember that it's a normal part of the process. With time, you'll get to know the group members, and they'll get to know you.\n2. **Focus on shared interests**: Instead of worrying about being an outsider, focus on the shared interest that brought you together. This common ground can help you build connections and feel more included.\n3. **Be patient with yourself**: Don't put too much pressure on yourself to fit in immediately. It's okay to take things at your own pace and get to know people gradually.\n4. **Look for commonalities**: Find ways to connect with others beyond the group's main interest. You might discover shared hobbies, similar senses of humor, or common goals that can help you build relationships.\n5. **Communicate openly**: If you're feeling left out or struggling to connect, don't be afraid to express your concerns to the group leader or a fellow member. They may be able to offer guidance or introduce you to others who share similar interests.\n6. **Find a buddy**: Try to find someone in the group who is also new or has a similar personality to yours. Having a buddy can make the experience less intimidating and help you feel more connected.\n7. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small achievements, like attending a meeting or contributing to a discussion. This can help boost your confidence and make you feel more invested in the group.\n8. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of thinking \"I don't belong,\" try reframing it to \"I'm new, and it's normal to feel this way.\" or \"I'm here to learn and grow with this group.\"\n9. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes or not know everything. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't click with everyone immediately.\n10. **Give it time to develop**: Building relationships and feeling a sense of belonging takes time. Don't give up if you don't feel like you fit in right away. Keep attending meetings, participating, and engaging with the group, and you'll increase your chances of forming meaningful connections.\n\nRemember, it's normal to feel like an outsider at first, but with time, effort, and patience, you can build connections and become a valued member of the group.\n\nHow do you feel about these tips? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or do you have any other concerns about feeling like an outsider?",
