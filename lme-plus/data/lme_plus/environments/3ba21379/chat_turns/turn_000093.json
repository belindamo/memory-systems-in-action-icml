  "content": "I have no personal experience or emotions. however, here is the explanation to your question -\n\nthe u.s. military budget is passed each year by the united states congress. the process usually starts with the department of defense submitting a proposed budget to the president, who then presents it to congress. the budget is then reviewed by various committees in both the house of representatives and the senate. these committees hold hearings where they listen to testimony from military officials and other experts.\n\nafter the hearings are complete, the committees vote on their respective versions of the budget. these versions are then reconciled in a conference committee, which produces a final version of the budget that both houses of congress must approve. once both houses approve the budget, it goes to the president for signature. if the president signs the budget, it becomes law and the military is given the authorization to spend the money allocated to it for that year.",
