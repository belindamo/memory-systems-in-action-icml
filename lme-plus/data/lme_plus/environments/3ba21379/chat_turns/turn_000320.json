  "content": "As MK lay on the hard ground inside the barrier prison, shivering from the cold, his stomach growled loudly. He hadn't eaten in days, and the hunger pains were becoming unbearable. He closed his eyes, hoping to find some peace in sleep, but the cold made it impossible.\n\nHe looked up at the stars above, searching for some solace. Maybe if he prayed hard enough, one of the gods would hear him and come to his rescue. But then he remembered that even the gods were afraid of Wukong.\n\nMK let out a deep sigh, feeling hopeless and alone. He wondered if he would ever escape this prison and see his family and friends again. He missed Pigsy, Sandy, and even Macaque, despite their past disagreements.\n\nAs he lay there, the cold and hunger consuming him, MK decided that he would not give up. He would find a way to escape this prison and defeat Wukong, no matter how powerful he seemed. He closed his eyes, determined to rest and conserve his energy for the battle ahead.",
