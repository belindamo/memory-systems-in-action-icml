  "content": "Yes, there have been several major plot twists in the Spider-Man comics that have generated strong reactions from fans.\n\nOne of the most significant twists came in the mid-2000s with the \"One More Day\" storyline. In this arc, Peter Parker's Aunt May is dying, and Peter makes a deal with the devil-like figure Mephisto to save her life. In exchange, Mephisto erases Peter's marriage to Mary Jane Watson from history, resetting their relationship back to a previous point. Many fans were upset by this development, feeling that it undermined years of character development and relationship building between Peter and Mary Jane.\n\nAnother plot twist that was met with mixed reactions was the reveal that Norman Osborn, Peter's longtime foe the Green Goblin, was secretly alive and manipulating events from the shadows for years. This twist came in the pages of the \"Brand New Day\" storyline, and while it created a lot of drama and tension, some fans felt that it unnecessarily complicated the character's continuity.\n\nOn the other hand, there have been several plot twists that fans have overwhelmingly enjoyed, such as the introduction of Miles Morales, a new Spider-Man with a different background, ethnicity, and origin story. Morales was first introduced in the \"Ultimate\" universe, a parallel universe to the main Marvel Comics continuity, and his character has since been incorporated into the mainstream Spider-Man universe. Fans have praised the character's unique perspective and the diversity he brings to the Spider-Man mythos.",
