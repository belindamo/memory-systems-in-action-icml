  "content": "That's really helpful! I'm excited to try out these recipes and music. I'll definitely ask Maria about more Colombian dishes and recipes, and maybe even plan a cooking session together. I'm also curious about the cultural events and festivals in my area, so I'll look into that. By the way, I recently had a conversation with my coworker Rachel, who is Korean-American, and we talked about our shared experiences as racial minorities in a predominantly white workplace. We exchanged numbers and plan to grab lunch soon to continue the conversation. Can you give me some recommendations for Korean recipes or cultural events that I could explore?",
