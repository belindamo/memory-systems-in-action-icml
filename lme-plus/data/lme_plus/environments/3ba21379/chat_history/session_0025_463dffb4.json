Label each shelf or basket so you can easily identify what's inside.\n3. **Store Heavy Items at the Bottom**: Place heavier items, like canned goods, at the bottom of your pantry to prevent them from falling and making a mess.\n4. **Utilize the Back of the Pantry Door**: Use over-the-door storage racks, hooks, or adhesive magnets to hang spices, oils, or frequently used items, keeping them easily accessible.\n5. **Label and Date Items**: Label each item with its contents and expiration date (if applicable) to ensure you use the oldest items first and avoid expired or spoiled food.\n\n**Fridge Organization**\n\n1. **Purge and Clean**: Before organizing, remove everything from your fridge and wipe down the shelves and walls with soap and warm water. Discard expired or spoiled items.\n2. **Assign Zones**: Divide your fridge into zones for dairy, meats, fruits, vegetables, leftovers, and condiments. This helps maintain a logical flow and prevents cross-contamination.\n3. **Use Bins and Baskets**: Store small items like yogurt, cheese, and condiments in bins or baskets to keep them organized and easy to find.\n4. **Label Shelves and Containers**: Label each shelf and container with its contents to help you quickly locate items.\n5. **Store Raw Meat and Fish at the Bottom**: Place raw meat and fish on the bottom shelf to prevent juices from dripping onto other foods.\n6. **Keep Frequently Used Items Front and Center**: Store frequently used items, like milk and eggs, in easy-to-reach locations to save time.\n7. **Store Leftovers in a Designated Area**: Designate a specific area for leftovers to encourage you to use them up before they go bad.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. **Store Food in Airtight Containers**: Transfer dry goods like flour, sugar, and coffee to airtight containers to maintain freshness and prevent pests.\n2. **Keep a \"First In, First Out\" System**: Ensure you consume older items before they expire by implementing a \"first in, first out\" system.\n3. **Clean as You Go**: Clean up as you cook to prevent crumbs, spills, and messes from building up in your pantry and fridge.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you'll be able to optimize your pantry and fridge storage, reduce food waste, and make meal prep a breeze!"
