And don't worry, I won't hold you to the exact date, but I'm curious - are you looking for music that's similar to indie-folk or do you want to explore other genres entirely?\n\nTo get started, here are a few questions to help me narrow down some recommendations:\n\n1. Do you have a preferred mood or atmosphere in mind for the music? (e.g. relaxing, upbeat, introspective, etc.)\n2. Are there any specific artists or bands you've been enjoying in the indie-folk genre?\n3. Are you open to exploring sub-genres like folk-rock, psychedelic folk, or singer-songwriter?\n4. Would you like to venture into other genres like electronic, hip-hop, or pop?\n\nLet me know your answers to these questions, and I'll provide you with some personalized music recommendations!"
