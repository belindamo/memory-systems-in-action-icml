Host company-wide meetings: Regular company-wide meetings can communicate shared goals, progress, and provide a dialogue for feedback or suggestions from employees.\n\n3. Create dedicated channels of communication: As channels of communication such as email, instant messaging, or social collaboration tools are increasingly popular, small businesses can create appropriate channels for specific use-cases. Consider Slack or similar tools which are great for quick and informal communication.\n\n4. Use anonymous surveys or suggestion boxes: Sometimes employees don't feel comfortable sharing their thoughts or ideas openly, so small businesses can use anonymous surveys or suggestion boxes to gather feedback.\n\n5.
