Let\u2019s discuss off line. What I do know is that we have had two hot water failures in the last six weeks. No other Board member, ie Claude, Linda, etc was called at midnight to go check on this as Darwin was. Perhaps Claude and Linda want to be on call for the 24/7 service until this is resolved. \n\n \n\nOn Wed, Mar 22, 2023 at 3:04 PM karen lare wrote:\n\nJulie I don\u2019t think it is lack of urgency it is that we don\u2019t have all of the bids needed to make the decision on this unit and so it will be done by the board by e-mail as soon as we have all of them in. We were also told by the vendor that there is no urgency to getting it replaced - i.e. it is not going to go out tomorrow. \n\nUnderstand your concern but Claude was assured that the work done stabilized it and now we need estimates. Claude can fill you in on how long he expects it to take before he has them all in (he was hoping for it by yesterday in time for the meeting). \n\nAnd paying dues is not optional but then I think you know that \u2026\u2026\n\nKaren\n\n> On Mar 22, 2023, at 1:52 PM, Julie Denton wrote:\n> \n> \ufeffHi Claude - I am Darwin\u2019s wife. I understand that we are looking about for bids on a new boiler to provide hot water for 16 units. I am not impressed with any sense of urgency to this matter. I realize the lack of hot water doesn\u2019t affect you. This issue needs to be raised to the level of \u201curgent\u201d. If we experience another hot water outage, I will be be reducing my HOA dues for each day. Please understand that Darwin doesn\u2019t agree with my approach. Thank you."

I must say, I had a \"Eureka!\" moment when I read your suggestion for Linda and me to be on call 24/7. We could even make a fun game out of it, like musical chairs, and whoever's left standing when the boiler fails has to rush over to fix it! On a more serious note, rest assured that we're working diligently to resolve this issue.\n\nAs Karen mentioned, we're waiting for all the necessary bids to make an informed decision, and we'll keep you updated on the progress. In the meantime, let's all remember that we're in this together, and we appreciate everyone's contributions, including Darwin's, to keep our community running smoothly. So, let's keep the teamwork going and avoid any \"Game of Thrones\" scenarios with our HOA dues, shall we? \ud83d\ude04\n\nWarm regards (and soon-to-be warm showers),\n\nClaude"
