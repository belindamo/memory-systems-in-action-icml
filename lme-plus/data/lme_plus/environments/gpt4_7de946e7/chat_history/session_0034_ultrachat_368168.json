Similarly, you can find vegetarian takoyaki with just the batter and without any seafood filling. Okonomiyaki can be made with vegetables such as cabbage and carrots instead of meat or seafood. Taiyaki can also be made with different fillings like sweet potatoes or custard instead of the traditional red bean paste. Make sure to check with the street food vendor if the dish is vegetarian or if it can be made vegetarian. Some vendors may not speak English, so it's always helpful to carry a guide or use a translation app on your phone if needed."
