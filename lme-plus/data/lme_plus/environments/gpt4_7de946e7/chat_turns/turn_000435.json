It's a great way to stay accountable, celebrate your successes, and address any challenges that come up.\n\nLet's schedule our weekly review for every Friday. I'll check in with you to see how your week went, discuss any progress you've made, and offer guidance and advice to help you overcome any obstacles you're facing.\n\nIn preparation for our weekly review, I recommend keeping a brief journal or log to track your progress. You can use a physical notebook, a notes app on your phone, or even a spreadsheet to record your daily steps, any challenges you faced, and any successes you achieved. This will help you reflect on your progress and identify patterns or areas for improvement.\n\nTo make it easy, I'll send you a reminder every Friday to share your update. You can simply reply to my message with a brief summary of your week, including:\n\n1. Your average daily step count for the week\n2. Any successes or achievements you're proud of\n3. Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them (or need help with)\n\nThis will give us a good starting point for our weekly review and help me provide more targeted guidance and support.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to get started with our weekly review and crush your fitness goals?",
