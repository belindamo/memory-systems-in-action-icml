  "content": "Write a later report from the same historian in which she documents how she came across more evidence about precisely how the transformation was accomplished. She describes exactly what the process entailed and puts forward the possibility of trying the technique on a willing volunteer to test its effectiveness. The process involves no magic whatsoever and is indeed a combination of the other methods she suggested in her first report. The process should yield better results even than modern gender conversion surgeries and should even enable the patient to bear children as a girl! The historian then speculates that this newly uncovered ancient technique could become part of the modern medical repertoire but she stresses the need for an experimental trial with a willing volunteer.",
