  "content": "According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, in 2020, the rural population in China was approximately 518 million, which accounts for about 37% of the total population of the country.\n\nIn comparison, in 1980, the rural population in China was around 81% of the total population, which means that the percentage of the population living in rural areas has decreased significantly over the past four decades.\n\nThis shift from rural to urban areas has been driven by China's economic development and urbanization policies, which have led to increased opportunities for employment and better living conditions in cities. However, the trend towards urbanization has also brought its own set of challenges, such as rising inequality and environmental concerns.",
