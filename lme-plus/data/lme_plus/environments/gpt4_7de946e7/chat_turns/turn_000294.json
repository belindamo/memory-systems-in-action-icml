However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about a coffee shop called \"The Daily Grind\" or its loyalty program. It's possible that it's a fictional or local coffee shop.\n\nIf you're referring to a real coffee shop, I recommend checking their website, social media, or visiting the shop in person to ask about their loyalty program and the number of stamps required to get a free drink.",
