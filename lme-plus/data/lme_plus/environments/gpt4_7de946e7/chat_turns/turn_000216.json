  "content": "Exciting times! Buying a new guitar amp can be a thrilling experience! Considering you play both guitar and digital piano, you'll want an amp that can handle both instruments with ease. Here's a breakdown of what to look for and some recommendations to get you started:\n\n**Key Features to Consider:**\n\n1. **Multi-Channel Capability**: Look for an amp with multiple channels, allowing you to plug in both your guitar and digital piano simultaneously. This will save you the hassle of switching cables or using a separate amp for each instrument.\n2. **Instrument-Specific Channels**: Ensure the amp has separate channels optimized for guitar and keyboard/piano. This will provide the best tone and response for each instrument.\n3. **Power Rating**: Consider the power output you need, based on the size of the venues you play and the volume you require. A 20-50 watt amp should be sufficient for small to medium-sized gigs.\n4. **Tone Shaping Options**: Choose an amp with a range of tone controls (e.g., bass, mid, treble) to help you dial in the perfect sound for both instruments.\n5. **Connectivity**: Make sure the amp has the right inputs for your instruments: a guitar input (e.g., 1/4\" or XLR) and a keyboard input (e.g., 1/4\" or XLR, possibly with a separate volume control).\n6. **Built-in Effects**: If you want to add depth to your sound, look for an amp with built-in effects like reverb, delay, or chorus.\n7. **Portability**: Consider the weight, size, and durability of the amp, especially if you plan to gig regularly.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nBased on your requirements, here are some great options to consider:\n\n1. **Fender Acoustic 100**: A versatile, 100-watt amp with two channels (one for guitar, one for keyboard/piano). It features a range of tone controls, built-in reverb, and a compact design.\n2. **Roland AC-60**: A 60-watt amp designed for acoustic guitar and keyboard, with two channels and separate tone controls.
