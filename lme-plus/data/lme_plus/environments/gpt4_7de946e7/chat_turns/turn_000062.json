  "content": "Altruism has been considered the highest moral virtue in contemporary society, a selfless concern for the welfare of others and the willingness to sacrifice one's own interests for their benefit. The notion has been widely promoted through religion, culture, and education. Individuals who prioritize their own interests above others are often viewed as immoral and evil.\n\nHowever, Ayn Rand, an American philosopher, challenges this view by arguing that altruism is, in fact, immoral. Rand believes that humans must prioritize their own interests to survive, as nature does not guarantee automatic survival. She asserts that prioritizing one's own interests is not only necessary but also moral, which she calls the philosophy of self-interest. Rand argues that selflessness, which is promoted by altruism, is self-defeating and leads to an individual's self-destruction.\n\nThis perspective on self-interest contradicts traditional views of altruism, which promotes selflessness as the ultimate moral act. While Rand's ideas have been widely debated among philosophers, her views on self-interest remain influential today. Rand's philosophy of self-interest asserts that an individual should prioritize their own interests before those of others to achieve success and a fulfilling life.\n\nDespite criticisms of Rand's philosophy, her views on self-interest have contributed to important debates and discussions surrounding the role of selflessness and self-interest in contemporary society. While altruism may still be considered a moral virtue, the philosophy of self-interest encourages individuals to prioritize their own needs and interests, which has influenced how many people view success and the pursuit of happiness in their lives.",
