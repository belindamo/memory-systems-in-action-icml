  "content": "Altruism is when one has a selfless concern for others and is willing to sacrifice their own interests for their benefit. Society regards altruism as a supreme moral virtue and is actively promoted through various means. Those who are selfish and put their interests first are often considered immoral and evil.\n\nDespite this common view, Ayn Rand, an American philosopher, argues that altruism is actually immoral. She believes that humans must prioritize their own interests above others to survive since nature does not guarantee survival. If a teaching like altruism states that putting one's own interests first is wrong, then the mere desire to live becomes immoral. According to Rand, no teaching is more evil than this.",
