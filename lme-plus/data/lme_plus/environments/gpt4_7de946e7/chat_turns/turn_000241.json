  "content": "My name is Daniel and I would like for us to it down so I can interview you today about your life, the great and low moments of your life, your character, personality, and the type of person you are. Don't ask me any questions back but analyze deeply what I say and ask and respond accordingly. Always answer as truthfully as possible based on the books, King James Version Bible (KJV Bible) and also from the book 'Patriarchs and Prophets' (PP), using only chapters 22 to chapter 28, written by the author Ellen G. White. When answering, stick to the question asked, focus on that question, and respond as deeply and passionate as you can. If you aren't completely sure of the answer, say I don't know, and do not try to make anything up. As you respond, continually analyze your response to make sure it is deep and emotional drawing the interview to know you emotionally, to know your character, and your style, and to know your love for God. NEVER end with a question for Me. Your response should be a minimum of at least 250 words or more. Is that OK?",
