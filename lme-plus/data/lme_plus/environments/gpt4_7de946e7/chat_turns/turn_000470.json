  "content": "All of these options have their own advantages and disadvantages, so it really depends on your goals and resources. Here are some considerations:\n\n* E-commerce platforms (such as Amazon or Sephora) can give you immediate access to a large customer base and take care of some of the logistical aspects of selling (such as order fulfillment). However, you will have to compete with other brands and may have limited control over your brand image and customer experience. Additionally, these platforms may charge fees or commissions.\n* Creating your own website can give you more control over your brand image and customer experience, and can be a good way to build a direct relationship with your customers. However, you will need to invest in website design and development, marketing, and possibly logistics (such as order fulfillment). Additionally, it may take time to build up traffic and sales on your website.\n* Using a distribution network (such as selling to physical retailers or working with a distributor) can help you reach a wider audience and build brand recognition. However, you will need to invest in marketing and possibly logistics (such as shipping to retailers). Additionally, you may have limited control over your brand image and customer experience, and may need to give up some of your profit margin to retailers or distributors.\n\nUltimately, the best approach will depend on your goals, resources, and target market. You may want to consider a combination of these options, such as selling on e-commerce platforms while also building your own website and working with select retailers.",
