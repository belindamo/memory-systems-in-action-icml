  "content": "That's a great approach! The QSC K10.2 is a fantastic amp for your digital piano, and it's definitely worth trying it out with your guitar to see how it sounds. By adjusting your playing style and tone settings, you can likely get a decent guitar sound out of it.\n\nAnd you're right, if you find that you need a better guitar tone in the future, you can always consider getting a separate guitar amp. It's always better to start with a versatile amp like the QSC K10.2 and then add a dedicated guitar amp later on if needed, rather than buying a separate guitar amp right off the bat.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding the right balance between tone, portability, and convenience for your specific needs. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further advice.\n\nGood luck with your gigs, and I hope the QSC K10.2 serves you well for both your digital piano and guitar!",
