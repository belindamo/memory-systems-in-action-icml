  "content": "The role of a nurse practitioner differs from a registered nurse in several ways:\n\n1. Education and Training: Nurse practitioners have a Master's, post-master\u2019s or doctoral degree in nursing or related field, which requires additional supervised clinical experience beyond that required of a registered nurse. Registered nurses typically have an associate or bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing.\n\n2. Scope of Practice: Nurse practitioners are authorized to practice independently or in collaboration with physicians, depending on the state they are working in, and have a broader scope of practice than registered nurses. They can diagnose and treat illnesses, prescribe medications, order laboratory tests and interpret results.\n\n3. Patient care: Nurse practitioners are often the primary care providers for patients, providing preventive and routine care, as well as managing chronic conditions. RNs work alongside nurse practitioners and assist in the patient\u2019s care.\n\n4. Leadership Role: Nurse practitioners may serve as a leader in the healthcare team, collaborating with physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers to manage patient care.\n\nOverall, the role of a nurse practitioner involves a higher level of education, training, and responsibility in patient care and decision making as compared to a registered nurse.",
