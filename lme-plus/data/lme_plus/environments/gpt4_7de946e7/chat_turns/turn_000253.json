  "content": "I apologize for the oversight. Here is the revised section VII. Cost Approach, including a table showing the calculation of the Cost Approach:\n\nVII. Cost Approach\n\nThe Cost Approach is one of the three methods used to estimate the value of the subject property. This approach is based on the principle that the value of a property is equal to the cost to replace or reproduce the improvements, less depreciation.\n\nA. Estimation of the Cost to Replace or Reproduce the Improvements\nThe appraiser has estimated the cost to replace or reproduce the improvements on the subject property to be $2,500,000. This estimate is based on the current cost of labor and materials in the Oakland market.\n\nB. Deductions for Depreciation\nThe appraiser has estimated the depreciation of the improvements to be $1,200,000. This depreciation is based on the appraiser's analysis of the age, condition, and remaining useful life of the subject property's improvements.\n\nC. Calculation of the Property Value using the Cost Approach\nThe value indicated by the Cost Approach does not support the appraiser's final opinion of market value for the subject property. This is because the value indicated by the Cost Approach is significantly lower than the values indicated by the Income and Sales Comparison Approaches.\n\nPlease refer to the table below for a detailed calculation of the Cost Approach:\n\n|  | Calculation | Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A. Replacement Cost | Replacement cost of the improvements | $2,500,000 |\n| B. Depreciation | Estimated depreciation of the improvements | $1,200,000 |\n| C. Property Value | Replacement cost of the improvements less depreciation | $1,300,000 |\n\nIn this case, the appraiser chose to give more weight to the Income and Sales Comparison Approaches in determining the final opinion of market value for the subject property, as explained above.",
