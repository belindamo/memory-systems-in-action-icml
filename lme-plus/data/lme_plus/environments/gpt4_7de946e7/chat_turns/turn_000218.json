Here are some more portable options that can handle both guitar and keyboard/piano:\n\n**Portable Amp Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Fender Passport Mini**: A tiny, 7-watt amp that's perfect for small gigs. It has two channels, tone controls, and a built-in reverb. Weighs only 3.5 lbs!\n2. **Roland CUBE Street EX**: A battery-powered, 20-watt amp that's designed for street performing and small venues. It has two channels, tone controls, and built-in effects like reverb and delay. Weighs around 16 lbs.\n3. **Yamaha THR5**: A compact, 5-watt amp that's part of Yamaha's THR series. It has two channels, tone controls, and built-in effects like reverb and delay. Weighs around 5 lbs.\n4. **Blackstar Fly 3**: A mini, 3-watt amp that's incredibly portable (only 3.5 lbs!). It has two channels, tone controls, and built-in reverb. Perfect for small, intimate performances.\n5. **AER Compact 60**: A 60-watt amp that's designed for acoustic instruments, but can handle keyboard/piano as well. It's compact, lightweight (around 12 lbs.), and has two channels with tone controls.\n\n**Key Features to Consider for Portability:**\n\n1. **Weight and Size**: Look for amps that are lightweight (under 20 lbs.) and compact in size.\n2. **Battery Power**: If you need to play in areas without access to power outlets, consider amps with battery power options.\n3. **Compact Design**: A smaller amp with a more compact design will be easier to transport and store.\n4. **Simple Controls**: A simpler control layout can make it easier to dial in your sound quickly, which is important for quick setup and teardown at small venues.\n\nThese amps are all designed to be more portable and suitable for small venues and private events. However, keep in mind that they may not have as much power or features as the larger amps I mentioned earlier.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider a amp with a built-in speaker or a separate portable speaker to save space and weight.\n* Look for amps with a carrying handle or strap for easy transport.\n* If you plan to play outdoors or in noisy environments, you may want to opt for an amp with a bit more power to cut through the noise.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect portable amp for your small gigs and private events!",
