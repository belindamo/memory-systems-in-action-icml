  "content": "According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the percentage of the Chinese population aged 65 and above was 13.5% in 2020, which translates to around 190 million people. This represents a significant increase from the 7.9% of the population aged 65 and above in 2000.\n\nChina is currently facing a significant aging population issue, driven by a combination of factors such as a low birth rate and an increase in life expectancy. This trend is expected to continue in the coming decades, with the percentage of the population aged 65 and above projected to reach nearly 25% by 2050. This demographic shift poses significant challenges for the Chinese government, including issues related to healthcare, social welfare, and pension systems.",
