Compromising on guitar tone can be a good trade-off when you need an amp that can handle both instruments.\n\n**Considering a separate guitar amp**\n\nHaving a separate guitar amp in addition to the QSC K10.2 is definitely an option, but it depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here are some points to consider:\n\nPros:\n\n* Dedicated guitar tone: A separate guitar amp will give you a more focused, tailored sound for your guitar.\n* More flexibility: You can use the QSC K10.2 for your digital piano and the separate guitar amp for your guitar, giving you more flexibility in your setup.\n* Better sound quality: A dedicated guitar amp will likely provide a better sound quality for your guitar, especially if you're playing with a lot of gain or effects.\n\nCons:\n\n* Additional cost: Buying a separate guitar amp will add to your overall cost.\n* More gear to carry: You'll need to transport and set up an additional amp, which can be a hassle.\n* Space and weight: You'll need to consider the space and weight of the additional amp, especially if you're playing small venues or traveling frequently.\n\n**When a separate guitar amp might be worth it**\n\nIf you:\n\n* Play guitar as your primary instrument and need a high-quality, dedicated sound.\n* Use a lot of effects or play with high gain, which can be challenging for a PA speaker like the QSC K10.2 to handle.\n* Have a specific guitar tone in mind that you can't achieve with the QSC K10.2.\n\n**When a separate guitar amp might not be necessary**\n\nIf you:\n\n* Are primarily a keyboard/piano player and only occasionally play guitar.\n* Are willing to compromise on guitar tone to have a single, versatile amp for both instruments.\n* Don't need a high-gain or heavily effects-driven guitar sound.\n\n**Ultimate decision**\n\nIt's up to you to weigh the pros and cons and decide what's best for your specific situation. If you're willing to compromise on guitar tone and want a single, versatile amp for both instruments, the QSC K10.2 is a great choice. However, if you need a dedicated guitar sound and are willing to carry an additional amp, a separate guitar amp might be the way to go.\n\nI hope this helps you make a more informed decision!",
