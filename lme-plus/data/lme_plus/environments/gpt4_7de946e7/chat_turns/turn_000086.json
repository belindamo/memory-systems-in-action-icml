Here's a brief comparison between capacitor-based and battery-based dash cams:\n\n**Capacitor-Based Dash Cams:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Longer Lifespan:** Capacitors can last longer than batteries, potentially up to 10 years or more, depending on the quality and usage.\n2. **No Battery Degradation:** Capacitors don't degrade over time like batteries do, so they maintain their performance throughout their lifespan.\n3. **Low Self-Discharge:** Capacitors lose their charge slowly, so they can retain power even when not in use for extended periods.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **No Parking Mode:** Capacitor-based dash cams typically don't support parking mode, as they don't have a power source to support continuous recording when the car is turned off.\n2. **Limited Power Reserve:** Capacitors have a limited power reserve, which means they might not be able to record for an extended period during a power outage or when the car is turned off.\n\n**Battery-Based Dash Cams:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Parking Mode Support:** Battery-based dash cams can support parking mode, allowing them to record even when the car is turned off.\n2. **Longer Recording Time:** Batteries can provide a longer recording time, especially if you hardwire the camera to your car's electrical system.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Battery Degradation:** Batteries degrade over time, reducing their performance and overall lifespan.\n2. **Self-Discharge:** Batteries lose their charge faster than capacitors, especially when not in use.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide between a capacitor-based and battery-based dash cam:\n\n1. Do you need parking mode functionality? If yes, a battery-based dash cam might be a better option.\n2. Are you concerned about battery degradation and limited lifespan? If yes, a capacitor-based dash cam could be a better choice.\n3. Are you willing to hardwire the camera to your car's electrical system to extend the parking mode recording time? If yes, a battery-based dash cam might be more suitable.\n\nUltimately, the decision comes down to your specific needs and preferences. If you prioritize parking mode functionality, a battery-based dash cam like the Garmin Dash Cam 66W might be a good choice. However, if you're looking for a low-maintenance option with a longer lifespan, a capacitor-based dash cam could be a better fit.",
