  "content": "According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the percentage of the rural population aged 65 and above was 15.5% in 2020. This means that out of the approximately 518 million people living in rural areas in China, around 80 million were aged 65 or above.\n\nChina is facing a significant aging population issue due to a low birth rate and a longer life expectancy. This has led to concerns about the country's future economic growth and its ability to support its elderly population. The government has implemented policies aimed at addressing these challenges, such as increasing the retirement age and providing support for elderly care, but the issue remains a significant challenge for the country.",
