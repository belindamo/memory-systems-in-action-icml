  "content": "That sounds like a wonderful plan! Getting back to your normal routine, including cooking and trying out new recipes, can be a great way to regain a sense of control and normalcy after a period of illness or recovery. And starting a small garden in your backyard is a great way to get outside, get some exercise, and connect with nature.\n\nCooking and gardening can be such therapeutic activities, don't you think? There's something so satisfying about creating something nourishing and delicious in the kitchen, and watching your own plants grow and thrive in the garden. Plus, it's a great way to take care of yourself and prioritize your health and well-being.\n\nDo you have any favorite recipes or cuisines that you're looking forward to exploring once you're feeling back to normal? And what kind of plants are you planning to start with in your garden? Are you thinking of growing herbs, vegetables, flowers, or a mix of everything?\n\nAlso, since you mentioned trying out new ingredients, I have to ask: have you considered exploring any new cooking methods or techniques while you're at it? Like, have you ever tried cooking with an Instant Pot or an air fryer? Or are you more of a traditional stovetop and oven kind of cook?",
