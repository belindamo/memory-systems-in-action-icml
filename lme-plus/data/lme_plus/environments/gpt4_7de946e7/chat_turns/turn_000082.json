Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Internal Battery:** The camera has a built-in lithium-ion battery that provides power when the car's engine is turned off. The internal battery is designed to last for up to 24 hours in parking mode, depending on the settings and environmental conditions.\n2. **Motion Detection:** When the camera detects motion in front of the lens, it will wake up and start recording a 1-minute video segment. The camera will then go back to sleep until it detects motion again.\n3. **Impact Detection:** If the camera detects an impact or a sudden shock, it will also wake up and start recording a 1-minute video segment.\n\n**Hardwiring:**\n\nYes, it is possible to hardwire the Garmin Dash Cam 66W to your car's electrical system. This allows the camera to draw power from the car's battery even when the engine is turned off, which can extend the parking mode recording time.\n\nGarmin provides a hardwire kit (sold separately) that includes a harness and a fuse tap. The kit allows you to connect the camera directly to the car's electrical system, bypassing the internal battery. This setup can provide continuous power to the camera, enabling longer parking mode recording times.\n\n**Hardwiring Benefits:**\n\n1. **Extended Parking Mode:** With a hardwired connection, the camera can record for an extended period, potentially up to several days, depending on the car's battery health and other factors.\n2. **Reduced Battery Drain:** By drawing power from the car's battery, you can reduce the drain on the camera's internal battery, which can help prolong its lifespan.\n3. **Increased Peace of Mind:** Hardwiring the camera provides an added layer of security, as the camera can continue to monitor your vehicle even when you're not around.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n1. **Car Battery Health:** If your car's battery is old or weak, it may not be able to provide enough power to support the camera's parking mode feature.\n2. **Wiring Complexity:** Hardwiring the camera requires some technical knowledge and may void your car's warranty if not done correctly.\n3. **Power Management:** It's essential to ensure that the camera's power settings are configured correctly to avoid draining your car's battery.\n\nIf you're interested in hardwiring your Garmin Dash Cam 66W, I recommend consulting with a professional installer or a knowledgeable mechanic to ensure a safe and proper installation.",
