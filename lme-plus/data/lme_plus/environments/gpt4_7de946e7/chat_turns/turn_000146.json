  "content": "I don't have information on any recent news or updates on rennes' plans to expand its public transportation system. however, rennes has been actively working to develop and improve its public transportation network.\n\none of the city's flagship projects is the creation of a metro line, which has been in operation since 2002 and has expanded to four different lines over the years. the metro system covers the city center, as well as the suburbs, providing residents with accessible and efficient transportation.\n\nadditionally, the city has an extensive bus network, including a high-frequency bus rapid transit (brt) system that connects the city center with the outskirts, making public transport more accessible to a wider group of residents. moreover, the city operates a bike-share system, which allows users to rent bikes from various locations within the city center.\n\nalthough i don't have any specific news on upcoming public transportation initiatives, i can say that rennes has shown a strong commitment to addressing transportation-related issues, and it's likely that the city will continue to invest in the public transport system to ensure it meets the needs of its residents.",
