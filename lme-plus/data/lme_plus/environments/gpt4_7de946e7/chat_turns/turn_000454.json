  "content": "Certainly! Here's an updated description that highlights the Cashmeran base note and includes a reference to the top notes:\n\n\"Accord Royale is a captivating fragrance that opens with a burst of invigorating top notes, including sparkling Bergamot and juicy Mandarin. As the scent settles, a rich heart of elegant Pink Pepper, lush Lily of the Valley, and velvety Rose de Mai blooms, balanced by the subtle sweetness of Hedione. At its foundation lies the warmth of Cashmeran, which gives the fragrance its distinct and luxurious character. As the perfume evolves on the skin, the Cashmeran deepens and intensifies, leaving a trail of pure sophistication in its wake. A true masterpiece, Accord Royale is the perfect scent for those who appreciate the finest things in life.\"",
