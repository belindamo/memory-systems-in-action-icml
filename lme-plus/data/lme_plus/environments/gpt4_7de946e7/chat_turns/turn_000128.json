  "content": "The Dada music movement was mostly a avant-garde artistic experiment, and its practitioners weren't necessarily concerned with achieving mainstream success. However, some of the artists associated with the movement did go on to have influential careers in more traditional musical genres. For example, Erik Satie, who was closely associated with the Dada movement, is now widely regarded as one of the most important composers of the 20th century. His music has been used in films, television shows, and commercials, and has been covered by countless artists in a variety of genres. Similarly, Kurt Schwitters, who was a key figure in the Dadaist sound poetry movement, went on to influence the development of electronic music, as well as the work of several prominent postmodern artists. So while they weren't necessarily successful in the traditional sense, their work has had a lasting impact on the world of music and art.",
