  "content": "Altruism is defined as a selfless concern for the well-being of others and a willingness to sacrifice one's own interests for their benefit. In today's society, it is widely considered the highest moral virtue and is actively promoted through religion, culture, and education. Those who prioritize their own interests for selfish reasons are often viewed as immoral and evil.\n\nHowever, Ayn Rand, an American philosopher, challenges this view by arguing that altruism is actually immoral, altruism is immoral, rather than selfishness. She believes that humans must put their own interests above other people's interests in order to survive, as nature does not ensure automatic survival. If a doctrine like altruism says that prioritizing one's own interests (selfishness) is wrong, then the mere desire to live becomes immoral. Rand asserts that no teaching can be more evil than this.",
