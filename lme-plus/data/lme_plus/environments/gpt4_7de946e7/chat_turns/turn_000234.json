  "content": "That's awesome! The Spider-Verse series is an epic storyline, and I can imagine how satisfying it must feel to finally complete the set. Congratulations on tracking down that elusive last issue!\n\nDisplaying your comics alongside your figurines is a great way to showcase your collection. Do you have a favorite Spider-Man character or iteration? I'm guessing you might have a soft spot for Miles Morales, given the Spider-Verse connection?\n\nIt's also great that you're a comic book fan. There's something special about holding a physical copy of your favorite stories and admiring the artwork. Have you considered getting any of your comics signed by the creators or attending a comic-con to meet them in person?\n\nBy the way, how do you store and protect your comics? Do you use bags, boards, and top-loaders, or do you have a specialized comic book storage system?",
