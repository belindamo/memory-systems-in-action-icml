I must say, I had a \"Eureka!\" moment when I read your suggestion for Linda and me to be on call 24/7. We could even make a fun game out of it, like musical chairs, and whoever's left standing when the boiler fails has to rush over to fix it! On a more serious note, rest assured that we're working diligently to resolve this issue.\n\nAs Karen mentioned, we're waiting for all the necessary bids to make an informed decision, and we'll keep you updated on the progress. In the meantime, let's all remember that we're in this together, and we appreciate everyone's contributions, including Darwin's, to keep our community running smoothly. So, let's keep the teamwork going and avoid any \"Game of Thrones\" scenarios with our HOA dues, shall we? \ud83d\ude04\n\nWarm regards (and soon-to-be warm showers),\n\nClaude",
