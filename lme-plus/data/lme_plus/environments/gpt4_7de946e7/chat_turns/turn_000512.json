  "content": "For remote access to the VLC media player using the RVM VLC remote plugin, you would typically need a network connection between the computer running RVM and the computer running VLC media player.\n\nThe RVM VLC remote plugin allows you to control VLC media player from the command line interface of RVM. This means that you can issue commands to VLC media player, such as playing or pausing media, changing the volume, or navigating through a playlist, from within RVM.\n\nTo use the RVM VLC remote plugin, you would first need to install it in RVM. This can typically be done using a package manager such as RubyGems. Once installed, you can then use the plugin to control VLC media player remotely.\n\nIt's worth noting that the RVM VLC remote plugin is not a remote access tool in the traditional sense, as it does not provide direct access to the computer running VLC media player. Rather, it provides a means of controlling VLC media player from another computer (in this case, the one running RVM) using a command-line interface.",
