  "content": "It's understandable to have personal preferences in art and music, but it's important to recognize that movements like Dadaism were not just about being edgy or controversial for the sake of it. Instead, Dada artists were responding to the upheaval and destruction of World War I by rejecting traditional artistic and cultural values in favor of new, experimental forms of expression. Dadaism was a way of redefining the role of art in society, and many of its practitioners believed that traditional approaches to art and music had become irrelevant in the face of modern life. So while it may not appeal to everyone, it's important to acknowledge the cultural significance of movements like Dadaism and the lasting impact they have had on the world of art and music.",
