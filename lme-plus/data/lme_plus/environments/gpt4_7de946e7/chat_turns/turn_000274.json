  "content": "Sure, I can add more details and be even more imaginative in the prompt for text to image that describes Ma'at, with a level of [1]:\n\nCreate an image that embodies the ancient Egyptian concept of Ma'at, the goddess of truth, balance, order, harmony, morality, and justice. In this image, Ma'at is depicted as a youthful woman with a serene expression and graceful movements. Her features are delicate and refined, and her skin is a radiant gold that glows with an inner light, representing her connection to the sun and the divine.\n\nMa'at's wings are a central feature of the image, stretching out from her shoulders in graceful arcs that convey a sense of balance and harmony. Each feather on her wings is delicately patterned with intricate designs, symbols of the stars and celestial movements that she governs. Her wings also have a soft, feathery texture that seems to rustle in the gentle breeze of her movements, giving the impression of a bird in flight. In one hand, Ma'at holds a balance scale, which represents her role in maintaining the equilibrium of the universe and the moral order of society. The balance scale is intricately carved with images of animals and other symbols that represent the dualities that Ma'at oversees.\n\nIn her other hand, Ma'at holds a staff, which symbolizes her authority as a goddess and her power to regulate the actions of both mortals and deities. The staff is adorned with jewels and precious metals, and has a delicate filigree that represents the intricate web of relationships and influences that Ma'at oversees. Her head is adorned with an elaborate headdress that includes the ostrich feather, symbolizing truth, as well as other symbols of her role as the regulator of the universe and the cosmic order.\n\nThe overall effect of the image should be one of serenity, balance, and order, with a subtle but powerful sense of justice and morality. The gentle curves and flowing lines of Ma'at's form, combined with the intricate details of her wings and accessories, create a sense of beauty and refinement that evokes the ideal of a harmonious and just society. The image should convey a sense of reverence for the goddess and the timeless principles she represents, while also inspiring a sense of connection with the deeper aspects of truth and morality that underlie all human action.",
