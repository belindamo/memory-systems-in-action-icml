  "content": "I'm feeling more confident about managing my time and prioritizing tasks. I like the idea of creating a master calendar and setting clear goals and objectives. I've used Trello before for group projects, so I might try using it for my personal task management as well. I also appreciate the reminder to take breaks and practice self-care - it's easy to get caught up in work and studies, but it's important to maintain my mental and physical health. \n\nHowever, I do have a question about taxes. As an international student, I'm not sure how freelancing or online tutoring will affect my tax situation. Do I need to pay taxes on my freelance income, and are there any specific tax forms I need to file?",
