However, if the issue is complex or you're unsure of the cause, a dealership might be a better option.\n3. **Do you have a trusted local mechanic?** If you have a local mechanic you trust, who has experience with your vehicle make and model, they might be a good choice.\n4. **What's your budget?** If you're on a tight budget, a local mechanic might be a more affordable option.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to choose a mechanic who is trustworthy, experienced, and has a good reputation. If you're unsure, you could also consider getting a second opinion from a different mechanic or asking friends and family for recommendations.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your car's safety and your own safety when dealing with unusual noises or issues. If you're concerned about the noise, it's better to err on the side of caution and have it checked out sooner rather than later.",
