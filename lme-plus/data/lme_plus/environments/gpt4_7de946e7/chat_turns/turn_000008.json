I'd be happy to help you set up a budget for your living expenses in Melbourne.\n\nSince you've transferred all your funds to your new Australian bank account, let's start fresh and create a budget that works for you. To get started, we'll need to categorize your expenses into needs and wants. Don't worry, I'll guide you through it!\n\n**Step 1: Identify your income**\nWhat is your monthly income in Australian dollars (AUD)? This will be the foundation of your budget.\n\n**Step 2: Categorize your expenses**\nWe'll divide your expenses into two main categories: Essential Expenses (Needs) and Non-Essential Expenses (Wants).\n\n**Essential Expenses (Needs):**\n\n1. **Rent**: How much is your monthly rent in Melbourne?\n2. **Utilities**: Estimated costs for electricity, gas, water, and internet (average around $150-200 per month)\n3. **Food**: Groceries and dining out (estimated $500-700 per month)\n4. **Transportation**: Public transport costs, fuel, or car loan/lease (if applicable)\n5. **Insurance**: Health, contents, and any other insurance premiums\n6. **Minimum debt repayment**: If you have any outstanding debts, such as credit cards, personal loans, or student loans\n7. **Phone and internet**: Monthly plans and bills\n\n**Non-Essential Expenses (Wants):**\n\n1. **Entertainment**: Hobbies, movies, concerts, travel, and other leisure activities\n2. **Savings**: Any savings goals, such as building an emergency fund or saving for a specific purpose\n3. **Personal care**: Gym memberships, beauty products, and other personal expenses\n4. **Gifts**: Charitable donations, birthday gifts, or other miscellaneous gifts\n5. **Miscellaneous**: Any other expenses that don't fit into the above categories\n\n**Step 3: Allocate your income**\nAssign a percentage of your income to each category based on your priorities. A general rule of thumb is:\n\n* Essential Expenses: 50-60% of your income\n* Non-Essential Expenses: 30-40% of your income\n* Savings: 10-20% of your income\n\n**Step 4: Track your expenses**\nFor the next month, track every single transaction to get a better understanding of your spending habits. You can use a budgeting app like Mint, You Need a Budget (YNAB), or even just a spreadsheet to record your expenses.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Consider setting up automatic transfers for your essential expenses, savings, and debt repayment to ensure you never miss a payment.\n* Review your budget regularly (e.g., every 3-6 months) to adjust as needed.\n* Be realistic and flexible \u2013 your budget should be a guide, not a strict rulebook.\n\nNow, let's get started! What's your monthly income in AUD, and do you have any specific financial goals or concerns you'd like to address?",
