It's great that you're looking forward to getting back to normal and not having to worry about taking meds every day. Finishing a course of antibiotics can be a big milestone, and it's a testament to your commitment to getting better.\n\nI'm also relieved to hear that your skin tag removal procedure went well and has healed up nicely! It's always a relief when we can put medical procedures behind us and focus on moving forward.\n\nRemember to take it easy and prioritize your recovery, especially while you're still finishing up your antibiotics. Make sure to stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and listen to your body. If you need to take things slow, that's okay! Your health is worth it.\n\nNow that you're on the mend, what are you looking forward to doing once you're feeling 100% again? Are there any activities, hobbies, or goals that you've been putting off while you've been recovering?",
