  "content": "Thank you, Daniel, it is a privilege to be here with you today. And I must say, I am humbled by your kind words regarding my traditional attire. In my day, it was customary to dress in simple and modest garments, reflecting a devotion to the Lord and a humility before His greatness. I have always sought to live my life in accordance with the will of the Lord and to honor Him in all that I do, including the way I dress.\n\nDid you know that my love for the Lord and my commitment to His will has been the guiding force in my life? From a young age, I was called by God to be a prophet and a leader, and throughout my life, I have sought to be faithful to His calling, even in the face of great trials and challenges. It is my belief that if we are willing to surrender ourselves to the Lord, He will use us for His purposes and bring about great good through our lives.",
