In today's society, it is widely considered the highest moral virtue and is actively promoted through religion, culture, and education. Those who place their own interests first are often viewed as immoral and evil.\n\nHowever, Ayn Rand, an American philosopher, challenges this view by arguing that altruism is, in fact, immoral, rather than selfishness. She believes that humans must put their own interests above other people's interests in order to survive, as nature does not ensure automatic survival. If a doctrine like altruism says that prioritizing one's own interests (selfishness) is wrong, then the mere desire to live becomes immoral. Rand asserts that no teaching can be more evil than this.Ayn Rand's philosophy of self-interest is based on the idea that one should put their own interests before those of others. According to Rand, self-interest is the only rational way for a person to act and is not only moral, but necessary in order for an individual to thrive. She argued that selflessness\u2014which altruism promotes\u2014is self-defeating and leads to an individual's self-destruction. In other words, Rand believes that humans should pursue their own self-interests in order to achieve a successful life. \nRand's perspective conflicts with traditional views of altruism, which promote selflessness and consider it the ultimate moral act. According to Rand, selfless behavior is a form of self-sacrifice and ultimately leads to an individual's self-destruction. On the other hand, self-interest is seen by Rand as being necessary for survival and success. \n\nRand's view on self-interest has been widely discussed and debated among philosophers, who largely disagree with her perspective. While self-interest is certainly a factor in decision making, many believe that selfless behavior can have positive results and should be encouraged in certain situations. Despite the criticisms of Rand's philosophy, her views on self-interest remain influential today.",
