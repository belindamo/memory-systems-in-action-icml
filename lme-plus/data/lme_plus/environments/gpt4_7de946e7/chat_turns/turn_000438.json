That's a remarkable improvement from 6,000-7,000 steps, and it's clear that you've been making consistent progress.\n\nWith this in mind, I think it's a good idea to revisit our previous discussion on breaking down your goal into smaller, manageable chunks. Since you're already averaging 8,000-9,000 steps, let's aim to increase that by 1,000-2,000 steps per day to reach your goal of 10,000-11,000 steps.\n\nWhat do you think? Is that a realistic goal for you, or do you want to adjust it based on your current progress?",
