Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I): If you have trouble with balance or keeping your feet grounded, you can widen your stance, bring your hands to your hips or the wall, or transform into crescent lunge pose by lifting your back heel.\n\n4. Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II): If you have sensitive knees, you can reduce the depth of the stance by widening your feet apart, or adjust the knee positioning until it's comfortable.\n\n5. Triangle Pose (Trikonasana): If you have trouble reaching the floor, you can rest your hand on your shin or put the block beside the front foot next to the ankle.\n\n6. Child\u2019s Pose (Balasana): If your hips or knees are tight, you can put a pillow or blanket under them or keep your arms alongside your body instead of stretching them out.\n\n7.
