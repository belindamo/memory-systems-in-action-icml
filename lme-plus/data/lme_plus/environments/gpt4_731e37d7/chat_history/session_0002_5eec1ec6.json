Speaking of keeping track of comments, I think I commented on a post from an old high school friend on Facebook last Tuesday, congratulating her on her new job.

      "content": "I'm glad you're excited to explore those tools and strategies!\n\nRegarding tracking comments on Facebook, dashboard tools like Hootsuite, Buffer, or Sprout Social can help you schedule and post content on Facebook, but they might not be the best solution for tracking your own comments on Facebook.\n\nFacebook's algorithm and commenting system are quite complex, and it's not always possible for third-party tools to accurately track comments made by individual users. However, there are a few workarounds to help you keep track of your Facebook comments:\n\n1. **Facebook's Activity Log**: You can use Facebook's built-in Activity Log feature to view your past activity, including comments you've made on posts. To access it:\n\t* Go to your Facebook profile\n\t* Click on the three dots next to \"Update Info\" and select \"Activity Log\"\n\t* Filter the log by \"Comments\" to see your past comments\n2. **Facebook Notifications**: Make sure you have notifications enabled for comments and posts you've commented on. This way, you'll receive a notification when someone responds to your comment.\n3. **Facebook's \"See First\" Feature**: If you want to keep track of a specific post or conversation, click the three dots on the post and select \"See First\" to prioritize updates from that post in your News Feed.\n4. **Manual Tracking**: If you're concerned about missing responses to your comments, you can try manually tracking the posts you've commented on by:\n\t* Bookmarking the post or saving the link\n\t* Setting a reminder to check the post for new comments\n\t* Periodically checking the post for updates\n\nWhile these methods aren't as convenient as using a dashboard tool, they can help you keep track of your Facebook comments and engage with your friends and acquaintances."
