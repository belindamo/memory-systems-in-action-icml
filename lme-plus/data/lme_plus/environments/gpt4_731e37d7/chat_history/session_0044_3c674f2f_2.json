The mixture is brought to a boil, and then removed from the heat to allow the coffee to steep.\n4. **Serving**: The coffee is served in small cups called \"cini\" or \"finjal.\" The cups are usually decorated with intricate designs and patterns. The coffee is served with snacks, such as popcorn, roasted barley, or traditional Ethiopian bread.\n5. **Snacks and chat**: The coffee ceremony is a social occasion, and it's accompanied by snacks and lively conversation. You'll have the opportunity to chat with the locals, learn about their culture, and enjoy the warm hospitality.\n\nTo experience a coffee ceremony with your family, you can try the following:\n\n* **Visit a local family**: Many tour operators and cultural organizations offer homestays or cultural immersion programs that include a traditional coffee ceremony.

It's often flavored with a touch of salt and sometimes a sprinkle of berbere spice (a blend of spices that includes chili peppers, garlic, coriander, and more).\n2. **Roasted barley (Kolo)**: Roasted barley is another common snack served during the coffee ceremony. The barley is roasted over an open flame, giving it a nutty, slightly sweet flavor. It's often seasoned with salt and sometimes a bit of oil.\n3. **Injera chips**: Injera is the traditional Ethiopian flatbread made from teff flour. During the coffee ceremony, you might be served crispy injera chips, which are perfect for scooping up with your fingers.\n4. **Kik alitcha**: Kik alitcha is a type of roasted chickpea that's often seasoned with spices and herbs. It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, making it a satisfying snack.\n5. **Shiro**: Shiro is a thick, creamy paste made from chickpea flour, often served as a snack during the coffee ceremony. It's similar to hummus, but with a coarser texture and a more robust flavor.\n6. **Dried fruits and nuts**: Dried fruits like apricots, raisins, and dates are commonly served during the coffee ceremony, along with nuts like almonds and pistachios.\n7. **Gursha**: Gursha is a traditional Ethiopian snack made from a mixture of roasted wheat, barley, and spices. It's often served as a small ball or patty, and it's meant to be broken apart and shared with others.\n\nWhen attending a coffee ceremony, don't be surprised if you're offered multiple snacks throughout the event. It's customary to try a little of each snack, as a sign of respect and appreciation for the host's hospitality.\n\nRemember to wash your hands before the ceremony, as many of these snacks are eaten with your fingers. Also, be prepared to engage in lively conversation and laughter with your hosts and fellow guests \u2013 the coffee ceremony is a social occasion, after all!"
