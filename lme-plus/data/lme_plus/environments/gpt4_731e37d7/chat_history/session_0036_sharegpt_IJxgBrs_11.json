Instead, it has a diminished fifth interval between its tonic and fifth scale degrees. This gives the Locrian mode a unique sound, characterized by its dissonance and tension.\n\nThe F Locrian mode is built upon the notes F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, and F. It has a minor tonality, but it is quite different from the natural minor scale. It's also quite dissonant and it's not used frequently in tonal music, but it can be used in experimental and avant-garde music."

The half-diminished scale is often used as a substitute for the Locrian mode because it contains the same intervals, but it does not include the diminished fifth interval, which can make it a bit more palatable for tonal music."
