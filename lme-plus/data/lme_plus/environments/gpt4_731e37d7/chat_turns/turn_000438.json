Here are some areas where the language could be tightened up for clarity:\n\n* \"However, I do have some other concerns that I would like to bring to your attention.\" This sentence could be more specific about what concerns the writer has, rather than leaving it vague.\n* \"Recently, I found a rusty metal spike sticking out of the ground where the back gate is to be replaced.\" This sentence could be clarified to specify that the spike was not visible before the writer's dog stepped on it.\n* \"I recently had my safety threatened there by an individual I can only presume was on drugs.\" This sentence could be more specific about what happened and what actions the writer took in response, if any.\n* \"If there was someone casing this house, they are now aware of a large amount of technology inside (personal computers with expensive accessories) and we are increasingly worried about a break-in.\" This sentence could be tightened up to more clearly state the writer's concern and what action they would like the landlord to take in response.",
