  "content": "The Elcor are a quadrupedal species in the Mass Effect universe, they are known for their slow and deliberate speech patterns, due to their low metabolism and gravity on their home planet. They are also known for their use of body language in addition to verbal communication.\n\nIn the game, their speech is represented by text in all capital letters, with each word separated by a period, to convey their slow and deliberate speech patterns. They also use multiple forms of body language, such as tilting their head or shifting their weight, to communicate and express emotions.\n\nThe Elcor are also known for their stoic and reserved nature, and their speech reflects this. They tend to speak in a measured, thoughtful way and avoid unnecessary words. They are also known for their direct and literal communication style, which can sometimes come across as blunt or insensitive to other species.\n\nIn summary, Elcor's unique speech pattern is slow, deliberate and measured, with the use of capital letters and periods to separate words in the text, this is to represent their slow speech pattern, and their use of body language in addition to verbal communication to convey emotions and express themselves.",
