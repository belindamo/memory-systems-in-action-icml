Overnight oats and hard-boiled eggs are excellent additions to your meal prep, providing sustained energy and protein to keep you going throughout the day.\n\nNow, let's talk snacks! Healthy snacking can be a game-changer for energy levels. Here are some snack suggestions that can help:\n\n**1. Nuts and seeds**: Almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, and chia seeds are all great sources of healthy fats, protein, and fiber. Look for unsalted or low-sodium options.\n\n**2. Fresh fruit**: Fresh fruit like apples, bananas, and berries are rich in natural sugars, fiber, and antioxidants. They're easy to grab and go, and can provide a quick energy boost.\n\n**3. Energy balls**: Make your own energy balls with rolled oats, nuts, seeds, and dried fruit to create a healthy, sustaining snack.\n\n**4. Veggie sticks with hummus**: Carrot, celery, and cucumber sticks with a protein-rich hummus dip make for a satisfying snack.\n\n**5. Protein-rich snacks**: Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and hard-boiled eggs are all high in protein to help keep you full and energized.\n\n**6. Whole grain crackers with avocado or peanut butter**: Spread whole grain crackers with mashed avocado or peanut butter for a snack rich in healthy fats and protein.\n\n**7. Edamame**: Steam or boil edamame for a tasty, protein-rich snack that's easy to prepare.\n\n**8. Trail mix**: Mix nuts, seeds, and dried fruit for a healthy, portable snack that's rich in fiber and protein. Just be mindful of added sugars and artificial ingredients.\n\n**9. Smoothies**: Prepare a smoothie with frozen fruit, yogurt, and milk or protein powder for a quick, energy-boosting snack.\n\n**10. Dark chocolate**: Dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content can provide a natural energy boost and satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nRemember, portion control is key when it comes to snacking. Aim for snacks that are around 100-200 calories to keep you satisfied without overdoing it.\n\nWhat do you think?
