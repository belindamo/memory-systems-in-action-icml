  "content": "I've been really into Miles Davis' \"Kind of Blue\" lately. It's such a classic album, but it still feels so modern and influential. I love the way the musicians improvise and respond to each other, it's like they're having a conversation through their instruments. I've been trying to capture some of that spontaneity in my own music production, but it's not easy! Do you have any tips on how to create a more improvisational feel in Ableton Live?",
