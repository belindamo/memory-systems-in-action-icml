It can be tough to resist the temptation of luxury shopping, especially when you feel like you've earned it after a big accomplishment like getting a new job.\n\nIt's great that you're aware of your shopping habits and are trying to be more mindful of your spending. Recognizing that you need to be more practical is the first step to making a change.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of depriving yourself of luxury items entirely, maybe try setting a budget for yourself or allocating a certain amount for \"treats\" each month. That way, you can still indulge every now and then, but within reason.\n\nAlso, have you considered finding free or low-cost alternatives to luxury shopping? For example, you could try thrift shopping, browsing online marketplaces, or even DIY projects to satisfy your creativity and desire for something new.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding balance and being intentional with your spending. You got this!\n\nHow's your new job going, by the way? What's been the most exciting or challenging part so far?",
