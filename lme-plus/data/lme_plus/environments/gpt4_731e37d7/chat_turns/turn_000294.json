Consider narrowing them down to more specific sub-niches, such as:\n\t+ Photography: portrait, landscape, wildlife, wedding, etc.\n\t+ Entrepreneurship: startup founders, small business owners, freelancers, etc.\n* Additional targeting options:\n\t+ Behaviors: people who have shown interest in photography or entrepreneurship-related products or services\n\t+ Job titles: photographers, entrepreneurs, creatives, etc.\n\t+ Education: people with a degree in a related field or those who have taken online courses\n\t+ Income: target people with a certain income level or those who have shown purchasing power\n* Exclusions: exclude people who are not your ideal audience, such as students or people outside your target location\n\n**Ad Creative**:\n\n* High-quality images are a must, but make sure they're relevant to your target audience and ad message.\n* Clear headlines are important, but also consider using attention-grabbing headlines that resonate with your target audience.\n* Consider using social proof, such as customer testimonials or reviews, to build credibility and trust.\n\n**Bidding Strategy**:\n\n* Cost per click (CPC) can be effective, but consider testing other bidding strategies, such as cost per action (CPA) or optimized cost per click (oCPC), to optimize for specific actions or conversions.\n* Set up conversion tracking to measure the effectiveness of your ads and optimize for better ROI.\n\n**SEO and Facebook Ads**:\n\n* While SEO is important for your website's visibility, it's a separate channel from Facebook Ads. Focus on optimizing your Facebook Ads for Facebook's algorithm and ad auction, rather than relying on SEO tips.\n* However, if you're driving traffic to your website from Facebook Ads, make sure your website is optimized for conversions, with clear calls-to-action and a seamless user experience.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n\n1. Refine your targeting by adding more specific interests, behaviors, and demographics to your ad sets.\n2. Test different ad creatives, including images, headlines, and copy, to see what resonates best with your target audience.\n3. Consider setting up conversion tracking and optimizing for CPA or oCPC bidding strategies.\n4. Monitor your ad performance closely and make adjustments based on the data.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Are there any specific areas you'd like to focus on or questions you have about implementing these changes?",
