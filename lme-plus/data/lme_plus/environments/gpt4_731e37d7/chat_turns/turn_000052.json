Some clubs may not require any equipment or software, while others may require access to specialized tools, equipment, or software. For example:\n\n1. Business clubs may use simple office equipment such as computers, printers, and projectors for presentations.\n\n2. Case competitions may require specialized software or tools such as financial analysis software, data analysis tools, or specialized equipment for presentations.\n\n3. Entrepreneurship clubs may need access to software platforms for designing and building prototypes, creating marketing materials, or building a website.\n\n4. Student-run companies may require access to specialized equipment or software specific to their industry or field.\n\nIn general, universities will provide access to common software and equipment like computer labs, basic office software, meeting spaces, and presentation equipment. However, for specialized needs, students may need to obtain their own equipment or software or access it through a specific program or partnership with a company. It is best to check with the specific extracurricular club or program to determine what equipment and software will be required.",
