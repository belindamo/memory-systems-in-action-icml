  "content": "Yes, Too Short has faced backlash in the past for his explicit lyrics and objectification of women. In 2013, he was criticized for giving advice on how to sexually assault a woman in a video posted online. He apologized for his comments, stating that they were \"not reflective of me speaking about how I feel.\" \n\nAdditionally, in a 2019 interview, he reflected on his past behavior and acknowledged that he was part of the problem in the past, stating \"I'm like, 'Damn, I was a part of that? I was one of the dumbasses back then?'\" He also expressed a desire to use his platform to promote positive change and encourage men to treat women with respect.\n\nOverall, it appears that Too Short has acknowledged and taken responsibility for his past actions, and expressed a desire to promote positive change going forward.",
