It's great to hear that you're inspired to incorporate those elements into your own music.\n\nGetting back into playing guitar after a long break can be challenging, but with a solid approach, you can regain your skills and even improve. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Set realistic goals**: Don't expect to pick up where you left off. Set achievable goals, like practicing for 15-20 minutes a day, 3-4 times a week. As you progress, you can increase the duration and frequency.\n2. **Re-familiarize yourself with the instrument**: Start with the basics: hold the guitar correctly, tune it, and get comfortable with the neck and fretboard. Practice simple chords, scales, and arpeggios to rebuild your muscle memory.\n3. **Find a practice routine**: Develop a routine that works for you. This could include:\n\t* Warm-up exercises (finger stretches, chromatic scales, etc.)\n\t* Reviewing chord shapes and progressions\n\t* Practicing scales and arpeggios\n\t* Working on specific techniques (bending, tapping, etc.)\n\t* Learning new songs or pieces\n4. **Focus on tone and phrasing**: As you get more comfortable, focus on developing your tone and phrasing. Experiment with different picking styles, amp settings, and effects to find your unique sound.\n5. **Listen to and study other players**: Listen to a wide range of guitarists, including jazz and rock players. Analyze their techniques, tone, and phrasing. Try to incorporate these elements into your own playing.\n6. **Make it fun**: Don't forget to enjoy the process! Play songs you love, experiment with new styles, and have fun with the process of learning and improving.\n7. **Consider taking lessons**: If you're serious about improving, consider taking lessons from a qualified guitar teacher. They can help you identify areas for improvement, provide personalized feedback, and guide you toward your goals.\n8. **Be patient**: Regaining your skills takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't see improvement right away. Stay consistent, and you'll eventually start to see progress.\n\nAs you get back into playing, remember to have fun and enjoy the process. It's great that you're inspired to pick up the guitar again, and with consistent practice, you'll be playing like a pro in no time!\n\nWhat's the first song you're eager to learn or revisit on the guitar?",
