  "content": "Certainly! Here are a few common business-related extracurricular activities that universities may offer:\n\n1. Business Clubs: These organizations are usually run by business school students and can cater to specific fields or areas of interest in business, such as finance, entrepreneurship, or consulting.\n\n2. Case Competitions: These events involve teams of students working on real-world business cases and presenting their findings to a panel of judges. They are a great way to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\n\n3. Internship Programs: Many universities offer internship programs that allow business students to gain hands-on experience in their field of interest.\n\n4. Industry Talks and Workshops: These events give students the opportunity to hear from industry professionals and learn about trends and best practices in their field.\n\n5. Student-Run Companies: Some universities have programs that allow students to start their own businesses with guidance and support from faculty and staff.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many extracurricular options available to business students. I would advise you to check with the University of Pennsylvania's business school website to explore their wide range of options.",
