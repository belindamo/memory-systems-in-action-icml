  "content": "Hello Alex,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. Firstly, I wanted to express my gratitude towards the landlord for repairing the dishwasher in such a timely manner. Venkatesh came to take a look at the dishwasher on Monday morning and successfully repaired the issue. I had meant to send a thank you email sooner but have been very unwell this week.\n\nHowever, I have some concerns that I would like to bring to your attention. Recently, I found a rusty metal spike sticking out of the ground where the back gate is to be replaced. Venkatesh had informed me that there was construction debris back there but never mentioned that there could be hazards coming out of the ground. I only found this hard spike after hearing an awful shriek from my dog who I can only assume stepped on it. Seeing there are no other hazards back there and she was passing by that gate site, I had only ever seen the metal posts used for construction laid flat on the ground near the gate site and thought the construction mess was limited to those as I had not been warned about dangerous protrusions from the gravel or ground. The spike had likely been present since the removal of the gate, without being noticed.\n\nFurthermore, to provide context for this situation, I would like to make Rent Select aware that the neighborhood has seemingly started to degrade in terms of safety. In my entire tenancy in this property up until recently, I had always felt very safe. However, in recent months a few of our neighbors have been affected by the recent uptick in crime and aggressive individuals in the area. The park which sits in the middle of the neighborhood has also started to show signs of unruly individuals. I recently had my safety threatened there by an individual I can only presume was on drugs.\n\nThis being the case, I was quite distressed to wake up this morning and find our side gate wide open to the street. It had been secured with the latch and bolted, but due to the gardeners coming through, my personal master lock had not been resecured on the latch. Due to the bottom bolt (the one going into the ground) on the gate being shut the night before, it is likely that someone hopped the fence to open it. If there was someone casing this house, they are now aware of a large amount of technology inside (personal computers with expensive accessories) and we are increasingly worried about a break-in. With all that being the case, I wanted to touch base on the progress toward the security cameras that the landlord stated he wanted to install, and also the security of the front and garage doors, which are both in need of repair. Venkatesh has already fixed the lock on the front screen door but we are still awaiting the main door repairs. On top of this, the wood on the actual front door is still decaying in places.\n\nOn the topic of the construction, I would also like to inform Rent Select that the active construction sites have been left in place for so long that the sites and items in them are starting to show signs of decay. I will attach photos of the front yard site and the backyard area where the gate is to be replaced. The baseboard that the back gate will be sitting on now shows signs of the same rot that could have contributed to the decay of the back gate.\n\nAt the front construction site, there has been rusty rebar sticking out of the ground very close to the neighbor's yard, and the actual structure Venkatesh is working to build is starting to fall apart due to weathering. On top of that, there is starting to be weed growth that I do not feel comfortable having removed from an active construction site with hazards such as rebar posts sticking out of the ground.\n\nLastly, at this point in time, I am still not sure",
