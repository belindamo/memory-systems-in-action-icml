However, there are a few workarounds to help you keep track of your Facebook comments:\n\n1. **Facebook's Activity Log**: You can use Facebook's built-in Activity Log feature to view your past activity, including comments you've made on posts. To access it:\n\t* Go to your Facebook profile\n\t* Click on the three dots next to \"Update Info\" and select \"Activity Log\"\n\t* Filter the log by \"Comments\" to see your past comments\n2. **Facebook Notifications**: Make sure you have notifications enabled for comments and posts you've commented on. This way, you'll receive a notification when someone responds to your comment.\n3. **Facebook's \"See First\" Feature**: If you want to keep track of a specific post or conversation, click the three dots on the post and select \"See First\" to prioritize updates from that post in your News Feed.\n4. **Manual Tracking**: If you're concerned about missing responses to your comments, you can try manually tracking the posts you've commented on by:\n\t* Bookmarking the post or saving the link\n\t* Setting a reminder to check the post for new comments\n\t* Periodically checking the post for updates\n\nWhile these methods aren't as convenient as using a dashboard tool, they can help you keep track of your Facebook comments and engage with your friends and acquaintances.",
