  "content": "I'm looking for some writing tips. I've been working on a short story since a writing workshop I attended in November at a literary festival. It was a two-day workshop, and I paid $200 to attend. The instructor was a published author, and I got some great feedback on my work. Do you have any resources on character development and editing that you could recommend?",
