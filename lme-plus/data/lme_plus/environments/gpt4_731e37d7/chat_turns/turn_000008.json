  "content": "Transcendental meditation (TM) is a type of meditation that originated in India and was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the mid-20th century. It involves the use of a specific mantra, or sound, which is repeated silently to oneself with the goal of reaching a state of deep relaxation and mental calm.\n\nDuring TM, the practitioner sits comfortably with eyes closed and silently repeats the mantra for 20 minutes, twice a day. The mantra is chosen for each individual by a trained TM teacher and is kept private.\n\nThe goal of TM is to transcend, or go beyond, the active thinking mind and enter a state of deep relaxation and restful alertness. This is believed to promote physical and mental relaxation, reduce stress and anxiety, and promote overall well-being.\n\nResearch has shown that TM can have numerous benefits, including reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, improving cardiovascular health, and improving cognitive function. However, it should be noted that some of the claims made about TM by its proponents are controversial and have been disputed by some researchers.",
