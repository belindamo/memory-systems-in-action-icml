Make it a habit: One of the best ways to stick to a regular meditation practice is to make it a habit. Try to set aside a specific time each day for meditation, such as first thing in the morning or before bed, and make it a non-negotiable part of your routine. 2. Start small: If you're struggling with consistency, it can be helpful to start with short meditation sessions, such as five to ten minutes. As your practice becomes more established, you can gradually increase the length of your sessions. 3. Use guided meditations: Guided meditations can be helpful for beginners, as they provide a structure and focus for your practice. Look for guided meditations that are tailored to your specific goals, such as reducing stress or improving focus. 4. Find an accountability partner: Having someone to hold you accountable can be a powerful motivator. Find a meditation buddy or join a meditation group to help keep you on track. 5. Practice self-compassion: Remember that meditation is a practice, and it's normal to struggle with consistency or other challenges along the way. Approach your practice with self-compassion, and don't beat yourself up if you miss a session or if your mind wanders during meditation. 6. Track your progress: Keeping track of your meditation sessions can help you stay motivated and see the progress you're making over time. Use a meditation app or journal, or simply mark off each day on a calendar to create a sense of momentum and progress. Remember, consistency is key when it comes to meditation. By making it a priority and gradually building momentum, you can establish a regular practice that supports your overall well-being and happiness.",
