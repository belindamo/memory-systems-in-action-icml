  "content": "Galapagos tortoises are herbivorous and they mainly feed on the vegetation that is available on the islands. They have a keen sense of smell and can detect food from a distance. They also have a long neck that allows them to stretch up and reach high-growing vegetation that may be out of reach for other animals. Due to their large size, they can also move relatively slowly and spend most of their time grazing the vegetation close to the ground. The Galapagos tortoise has adapted to feed on different types of plants that grow in these islands, which helps to ensure that they can find enough food even during periods of scarcity.",
