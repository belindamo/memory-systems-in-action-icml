This sense of unity can lead to a greater sense of oneness with a higher power or the universe.\n2. **Compassion and empathy:** Loving-kindness meditation increases compassion and empathy towards yourself and others. As you cultivate these qualities, you may begin to see the divine in every being, including yourself. This can lead to a deeper sense of reverence and connection to a higher power.\n3. **Letting go of ego:** Loving-kindness meditation encourages you to let go of your ego and focus on the well-being of others. As you release your attachment to your ego, you may feel a greater sense of surrender and openness to the guidance of a higher power.\n4. **Cultivating gratitude:** Loving-kindness meditation often involves cultivating gratitude for the blessings in your life.
