Take your time to think about what you want to achieve with your university alumni group, and who would be interested in joining.\n\nRegarding your Facebook group, \"Book Lovers,\" that's great! It's always exciting to share your thoughts and opinions with like-minded people. \"The Nightingale\" is a powerful and emotional novel; I'm not surprised your review got some nice feedback. Have you read any other books recently that you'd recommend?\n\nNow, back to your university alumni group... Do you think you might want to create a private group or a public one? A private group might be more suitable for alumni who want to connect with each other in a more intimate setting, while a public group could be open to anyone interested in your university or its community.\n\nAlso, have you considered creating a content calendar or a schedule for posting in your group? This can help keep the conversation going and ensure that members stay engaged. You could share news about your university, upcoming events, or even feature a \"Member of the Month\" to encourage participation and sharing.",
