I'm interested in finding more writing workshops and events like the one I attended in November, which was a two-day writing workshop at a literary festival. I paid $200 to attend, and it was really worth it. Do you know of any websites or platforms that allow me to search for events by price range or duration? That would be really helpful in finding the right fit for me.",
