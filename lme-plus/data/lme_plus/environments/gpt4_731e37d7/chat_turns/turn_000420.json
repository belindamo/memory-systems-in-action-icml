Now, let's talk about storing them for the week. You have two options: refrigeration and freezing. Here are some tips to help you decide:\n\n**Refrigeration:**\n\n* Cool the roasted veggies to room temperature to prevent moisture buildup.\n* Store them in airtight containers, such as glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids.\n* Keep them in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n* Use them within 3-4 days for optimal flavor and texture.\n\n**Freezing:**\n\n* Cool the roasted veggies to room temperature.\n* Portion them into individual servings or freezer-safe containers/bags.\n* Label and date the containers/bags.\n* Store them in the freezer for up to 3 months.\n* When you're ready to use them, simply thaw overnight in the refrigerator or reheat in the microwave or oven.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Freeze roasted veggies in portions that make sense for your meal prep. For example, if you plan to use a cup of roasted veggies in each quinoa bowl, freeze them in 1-cup portions.\n* When reheating frozen veggies, you can add a splash of water or broth to help them retain moisture.\n* Frozen roasted veggies are perfect for adding to soups, stews, or casseroles.\n\n**Roasted Garlic:**\n\n* Once roasted, let the garlic cool completely.\n* Squeeze the garlic out of its skin and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\n* You can also freeze roasted garlic for up to 3 months. Simply thaw it overnight in the refrigerator or at room temperature when you're ready to use it.\n\nNow, go ahead and roast those veggies! You'll be enjoying delicious, healthy meals all week long.",
