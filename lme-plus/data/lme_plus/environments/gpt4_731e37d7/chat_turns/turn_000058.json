  "content": "I apologize, but I'm not sure if there is a comprehensive directory available online for business clubs at the University of Pennsylvania. However, the Penn Clubs website contains a list of over 500 student clubs and organizations at the university, which may include some of the business clubs you are interested in. The directory includes contact information for each club, as well as a brief description of their purpose and activities. You can search for specific keywords, such as \"business\" or \"entrepreneurship\", to find relevant clubs. Alternatively, you can check out social media pages such as Facebook or LinkedIn since many clubs create dedicated social media pages to engage with their members.",
