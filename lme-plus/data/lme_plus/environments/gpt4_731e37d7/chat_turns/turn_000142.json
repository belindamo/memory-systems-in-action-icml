  "content": "The Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW) aims to ensure that payments for construction work are made promptly and fairly. Under this act, a payment claim can be made by a builder or subcontractor for work completed or goods supplied. The payment claim must be accompanied by a supporting statement that outlines the work done, the amount claimed, and the due date for payment. The recipient of the payment claim has a set period to respond with either a payment schedule or a payment amount. If a payment schedule is provided, it must specify the amount that will be paid and the date on which it will be paid. Failure to comply with the Security of Payment Act can result in significant penalties for both parties. It is important for homeowners to understand the impact of this act on their progress payment schedules and their obligations under the NSW HIA Lump Sum contract.",
