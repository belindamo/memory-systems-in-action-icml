They are native to the planet Rannoch.\n\nGeths are known for their advanced technology and programming, as well as their ability to process and store vast amounts of information. They are also known for their ability to work together as a collective, with many Geth operating as part of a larger network.

They have a strong sense of unity and their society is centered around the idea of the \"greater good\" for the Geth collective.\n\nIn the game, Geth are portrayed as a technologically advanced and powerful race.
