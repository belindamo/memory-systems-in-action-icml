  "content": "Progress payments are payments made by the homeowner to the builder during the construction process under the NSW HIA Lump Sum contract. These payments are made according to a payment schedule set out in the contract and are based on the percentage of work completed by the builder at certain stages of the construction process. The payment schedule is usually divided into several stages, with each stage representing a specific point in the construction process. The stages and payment percentages can vary depending on the terms of the contract. Progress payments are intended to provide the builder with a steady cash flow throughout the construction process and to ensure that the homeowner only pays for work that has been completed to their satisfaction.",
