  "content": "Wow, that sounds like an incredible experience! Michelin-starred restaurants are known for their exceptional cuisine and service, and it's no surprise that it came with a higher price tag.\n\n$200 per person is definitely an investment, but if the food and service were exceptional, it's understandable that you felt it was worth it. Sometimes, it's nice to splurge and treat yourself to a special dining experience.\n\nWhich Michelin-starred restaurant did you visit, if you don't mind me asking? I'm curious! Was it a specific chef or cuisine that drew you to that particular restaurant?\n\nAlso, what was the highlight of your meal? Was there a particular dish or course that stood out to you?",
