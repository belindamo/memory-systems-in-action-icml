  "content": "The notes F3, Bb3, C4, Eb4, F4, G4, Ab4, Bb4, and C5 form the F Locrian mode.\n\nThe Locrian mode is the seventh and final mode of the major scale and it is the only mode that does not have a perfect fifth interval. Instead, it has a diminished fifth interval between its tonic and fifth scale degrees. This gives the Locrian mode a unique sound, characterized by its dissonance and tension.\n\nThe F Locrian mode is built upon the notes F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, and F. It has a minor tonality, but it is quite different from the natural minor scale. It's also quite dissonant and it's not used frequently in tonal music, but it can be used in experimental and avant-garde music.",
