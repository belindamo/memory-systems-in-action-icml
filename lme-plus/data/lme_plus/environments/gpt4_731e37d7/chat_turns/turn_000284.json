  "content": "It can be hard to keep track of all the details when you're on a fun-filled trip with friends.\n\nIt sounds like you had a great time exploring New York City, and Fifth Avenue is definitely a shopper's paradise. Even if you didn't end up buying anything major, it's always fun to window shop and get a feel for the luxury brands.\n\nSouvenirs are a great way to remember your trip, though! What kind of souvenirs did you end up getting? Were they NYC-themed, or something more personal to you or your friends?\n\nAnd hey, since you mentioned Fifth Avenue, I have to ask: did you happen to walk by the iconic Saks Fifth Avenue department store? It's a must-see, even if you're not planning to buy anything. The building itself is stunning, and the window displays are always impressive.",
