Acknowledge the distraction: When you notice your mind wandering or a distraction pulling your attention away from your meditative focus, simply acknowledge the distraction without judgment. Recognize that it's normal for your mind to wander, and try to redirect your focus back to your breath or other meditative focus. 2. Refocus on your breath: Focusing on your breath is a common meditation technique that can help you anchor your attention and bring your focus back to the present moment. Try counting your breaths or focusing on the sensation of air moving in and out of your nose. 3. Use a mantra: A mantra is a repetitive phrase, word or sound that you can use to help focus your mind and prevent it from wandering. Repeat your chosen mantra silently to yourself and let go of any other distracting thoughts. 4. Embrace the distraction: Sometimes, trying to suppress a distracting thought or feeling can only make it stronger. Instead, try to embrace the distraction and allow it to enter your consciousness without judgment. Observe the thought or feeling and then let it go, returning your focus to your breath or meditative focus. 5. Practice self-compassion: Remember, meditation is a practice, and distractions will happen. Be kind and non-judgmental with yourself when your mind wanders, and keep your focus on the progress you've made rather than any perceived failures or setbacks. By acknowledging distractions without judgment and gently bringing your attention back to your meditative focus, you can develop greater concentration and mindfulness in your practice over time.",
