  "content": "The notes F3, Bb3, C4, Eb4, F4, G4, Ab4, Bb4, C5 form a mode, but it is not the Locrian mode, as the Locrian mode includes the note Db.\n\nThe notes you've provided form a scale that can be called F Half-Diminished scale, F minor seventh scale, or F minor/flat five scale, it contains a minor seventh interval (F-Eb) and a diminished fifth interval (F-Bb). The half-diminished scale is often used as a substitute for the Locrian mode because it contains the same intervals, but it does not include the diminished fifth interval, which can make it a bit more palatable for tonal music.",
