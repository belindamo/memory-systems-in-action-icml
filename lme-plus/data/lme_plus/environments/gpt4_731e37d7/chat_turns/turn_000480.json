It's great that they have a personal connection to the culture and heritage of the country, and I'm sure they'll be excited to share their story with you during your trip.\n\nIt's also wonderful that Emily has given them a loving home and is helping them maintain their connection to their roots.

Those are always great ways to get kids excited about exploring a new place.
