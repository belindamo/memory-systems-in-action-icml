I recently attended a two-day digital marketing workshop at the city convention center, and it was really informative. The instructor was a well-known industry expert. I learned a lot about social media advertising and SEO, which I've been trying to implement in my own business. Do you know of any resources or websites that offer digital marketing workshops or online courses?",
