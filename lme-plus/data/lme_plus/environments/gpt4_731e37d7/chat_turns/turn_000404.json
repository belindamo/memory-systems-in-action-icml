Click below to purchase our course and get started today!\"\n* Layout: The CTA button should be prominently displayed, ideally in a contrasting color to make it stand out. It could be centered or aligned to the left or right of the section, depending on the overall design.\n* Image/Icon: You could use an image or icon that reinforces the idea of taking action, such as an arrow pointing to the CTA button or a person taking a confident step forward.\n\nMake sure that the CTA button is clearly visible and stands out from the rest of the section. You could also consider using a hover effect or animation to draw attention to the button and make it more engaging.",
