Food is a big part of any travel experience, and trying local cuisine is a great way to immerse yourself in the culture.\n\nRegarding your \"Foodie Friends\" WhatsApp group, that sounds like a lot of fun! Sharing recipes and discovering new dishes is a great way to connect with like-minded people. Vegan quinoa bowls are very popular these days, and I'm sure your recipe was a hit with the group. Did you pick up any inspiration for new recipes during your trip to Hawaii?\n\nBack to your Europe trip, I'd like to add a few more food-related tips:\n\n* In Paris, try a traditional French breakfast at a bakery or caf\u00e9, including croissants, baguettes, and coffee.\n* In Rome, don't miss the opportunity to try authentic Italian gelato. Look for shops with unique flavors like limone (lemon) or nocciola (hazelnut).\n* Be sure to try some fresh fruit and vegetables at local markets, like the March\u00e9 aux Enfants Rouges in Paris or the Campo de' Fiori in Rome.\n* If you have time, take a food tour in either city to learn more about the local cuisine and sample a variety of dishes.\n\nRemember to also try some of the local specialties, such as escargots in Paris or carbonara in Rome. And don't be afraid to ask your server for recommendations or ask to try something new. Buon appetito and bon app\u00e9tit!",
