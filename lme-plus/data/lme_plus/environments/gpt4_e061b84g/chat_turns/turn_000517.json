  "content": "The response time for emergency services can vary depending on factors such as location, traffic, and the nature of the emergency. However, in most cases, emergency services aim to respond as quickly as possible to life-threatening emergencies such as a heart attack. In the United States, for example, the average response time for an ambulance is around 8 minutes, but it can be shorter or longer depending on the location and the circumstances. It is important to call emergency services immediately and provide as much information as possible about the situation so that they can respond appropriately.",
