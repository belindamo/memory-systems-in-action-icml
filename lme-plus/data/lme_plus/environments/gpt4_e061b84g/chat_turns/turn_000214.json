Are there any specific aspects within romance novels that she particularly enjoys or looks for in a story?\n\nFor example, does she:\n\n1. Enjoy stories with happily-ever-afters (HEAs) or is she open to more realistic, open-ended conclusions?\n2. Prefer romances with a strong focus on relationships, family, or friendships?\n3. Like stories with alpha males, strong female leads, or a mix of both?\n4. Enjoy romances set in specific time periods, like historical or contemporary?\n\nUnderstanding these nuances will help me provide more tailored recommendations for your sister.\n\nAlso, regarding the gift, would you like it to be a complete surprise, or would you like to involve your sister in the book selection process?
