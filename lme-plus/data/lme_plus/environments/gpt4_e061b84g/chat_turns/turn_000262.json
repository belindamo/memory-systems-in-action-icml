Cardiovascular warm-up: Start your warm-up with your preferred cardio exercise, such as jogging or cycling, to increase your heart rate and warm up your body.\n\n2. Stretching exercises: Stretch the muscles you plan on using during your weight training exercises. Hold each stretch for about 15-30 seconds.\n\n3. Dynamic stretches: Do some dynamic stretches that mimic the movements you'll be doing during your workout. For example, if you plan on doing squats, you can do some bodyweight squats to warm up.\n\n4. Gradually increase weight: Start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as your muscles get warmed up.\n\n5. Warm-up sets: Do a few sets of warm-up exercises with lighter weights before moving onto heavier weightlifting exercises. For example, if you plan to deadlift heavy weights, you can start by doing a few warm-up sets with lighter weights.\n\nRemember to take your time and don't rush your warm-up routine. Warming up properly can help reduce the risk of injury and improve your performance during your workout.",
