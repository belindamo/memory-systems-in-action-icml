I'm not aware of the exact mall you're referring to, nor can I know which store you visited three weeks ago.\n\nBut I can offer some suggestions to help you find the store you're looking for:\n\n1. Check the mall's website or social media pages: You can try searching for the mall's website or social media pages to see if they have a directory of stores or a list of new openings. You might be able to find the store you're looking for and get information on their collections and promotions.\n2. Ask mall customer service: You can visit the mall's customer service desk or call their customer service number to ask if they can provide information about the store you're looking for. They might be able to give you details on new stores that have opened recently.\n3. Walk around the mall: If you're already at the mall, you can take a stroll around and look for a store that matches your description.
