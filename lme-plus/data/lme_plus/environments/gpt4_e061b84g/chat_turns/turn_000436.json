  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not hold personal opinions and present information neutrally. Art critics from different cultural and historical backgrounds diverge due to several reasons.\n\n1. Aesthetic Preferences: Aesthetic preferences are subjective and influenced by cultural and historical context. Art critics from different cultural backgrounds may have diverging opinions on the same piece of contemporary art based on their cultural and historical conditioning.\n\n2. Historical Perspective: Art critics from various historical backgrounds may evaluate the same piece of contemporary art based on their historical context. For instance, a contemporary piece depicting war could be evaluated differently by a critic living in a country affected by war, versus a critic from a country that hasn't experienced war.\n\n3. Knowledge and Expertise: Art critics from different cultural and historical backgrounds possess different levels of knowledge and expertise, which may influence how they evaluate a contemporary piece of art. They may interpret and analyze the artwork differently based on their knowledge of art history, cultural traditions and artistic techniques.\n\n4. Societal Values: Societal values influence art criticism. Art critics from different cultural backgrounds are bound by their cultural and societal values. These values shape how they perceive and evaluate contemporary art. \n\nTherefore, it\u2019s safe to assume that perspectives of art critics from different cultural and historical backgrounds diverge when evaluating the same piece of contemporary art due to the reasons mentioned above.",
