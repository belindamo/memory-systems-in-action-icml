Their ground beef is always high-quality and flavorful, and it will absorb the Korean chili flakes and soy sauce beautifully.\n\nRemember to cook the ground beef until it's browned and crispy, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. This will help to distribute the flavors evenly and give the tacos a nice texture. And don't forget to add those delicious kimchi slaw and cilantro lime rice on the side - they'll complement the tacos perfectly!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need any further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a blast making and enjoying your Korean BBQ tacos!",
