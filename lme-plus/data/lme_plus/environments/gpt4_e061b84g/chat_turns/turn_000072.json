It's a playful touch that will add some personality to the hat without overpowering it. Plus, it's easy to make and attach, so it won't add too much extra time to the project. What do you think about adding a small, subtle label or tag to the hat with my sister's initials or name? Is that a good idea, or might it be too much?",
