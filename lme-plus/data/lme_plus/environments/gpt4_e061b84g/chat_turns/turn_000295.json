A blanket with a cute design and Ethan's name embroidered on it will make a thoughtful and personalized gift.\n\nChoosing the right color for the blanket depends on your personal preference, Rachel's style, and the overall aesthetic you want to achieve. Here are some considerations to help you decide between soft, pastel colors and bold, bright colors:\n\n**Soft, Pastel Colors:**\n\n* Soft pastel colors like light blue, pale pink, yellow, and mint green are calming and soothing, creating a serene atmosphere for baby Ethan.\n* They're also versatile and can complement a variety of nursery themes and decor.\n* Pastel colors are often associated with baby blankets and can add a touch of sweetness and innocence to the gift.\n\n**Bold, Bright Colors:**\n\n* Bold, bright colors like navy blue, red, orange, and green can add energy and excitement to the blanket.\n* They can also help stimulate baby Ethan's senses and create a playful atmosphere.\n* If Rachel has a more modern or bold style, a bright color might be a great fit.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you make a decision:\n\n* What's Rachel's personal style? Is she more into soft, traditional, or modern and bold designs?\n* What's the nursery theme or color scheme? If it's already established, you might want to choose a color that complements it.\n* Do you want the blanket to be a statement piece or blend in with the surroundings?\n\nUltimately, you can't go wrong with a soft, pastel color like light blue or pale yellow, as they're classic choices that are always in style. However, if you want to add some personality to the gift, a bold, bright color could be a great option.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a color that you think Rachel and baby Ethan will love and cherish.",
