  "content": "Truffle oil is not a traditional ingredient in Neapolitan-style pizza, and it's actually considered a modern twist. In fact, many Neapolitan pizzaiolos (pizza makers) would frown upon the use of truffle oil in a traditional Neapolitan-style pizza.\n\nTruffle oil is a relatively recent addition to the world of pizza, and it's more commonly associated with modern, gourmet, or upscale pizza styles. Truffle oil is often used to add a luxurious, umami flavor to dishes, but it can also be overpowering if used excessively.\n\nIn traditional Neapolitan pizza, the focus is on showcasing the simplicity and quality of the ingredients, rather than relying on fancy or trendy additives. The flavor profile of a traditional Neapolitan pizza is centered around the sweetness of the San Marzano tomatoes, the creaminess of the mozzarella, and the brightness of the fresh basil.\n\nThat being said, if you want to experiment with truffle oil, it can be a great way to add depth and complexity to your pizza. Just be mindful of the amount you use, as it can quickly overpower the other flavors. A few drops or a light drizzle can be enough to add a subtle, earthy note to your pizza.\n\nIf you're looking for a more traditional Neapolitan-style pizza, you might consider using fresh truffles instead of truffle oil. Fresh truffles are a prized ingredient in Italy, and they can add an incredible, umami flavor to your pizza. However, they can be extremely expensive and are usually reserved for special occasions.\n\nIn summary, while truffle oil can be a tasty addition to pizza, it's not a traditional ingredient in Neapolitan-style pizza. If you want to stay true to the traditional style, focus on using high-quality ingredients and simple, time-honored techniques. But if you want to experiment with modern flavors, truffle oil can be a interesting addition to your pizza repertoire.",
