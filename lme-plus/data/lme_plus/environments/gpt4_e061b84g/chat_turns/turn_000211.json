Since it's a romance novel and cost around $20, it's probably a mass market paperback edition.\n\nIf you'd like to get the same book for your sister, you could try checking with the same bookstore or searching online to see if it's still available. However, if you'd like to get a different book by the same author, I can try to help you with some recommendations.\n\nCan you tell me more about your mom's favorite author? Is it one of the authors I mentioned earlier, such as Nora Roberts, Jude Deveraux, or Susan Mallery? Or is it someone else?\n\nAdditionally, does your sister have a similar reading taste to your mom, or does she prefer different types of romance novels (e.g., historical, contemporary, paranormal, etc.)?",
