Since baby Ethan is a newborn, he'll likely grow quickly, and the 0-3 month sizes might not fit for long. On the other hand, 3-6 month sizes might be a bit roomy at first, but they'll provide more wear and tear throughout the next few months.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n* Get a few onesies and sleepers in 0-3 month sizes to fit Ethan in the first few weeks and months. These will be perfect for the initial newborn stage.\n* Get a few more onesies and sleepers in 3-6 month sizes to provide a transition period and accommodate Ethan's growth. These will be suitable for the next few months and will give Rachel some flexibility with sizing.\n\nBy getting a mix of both sizes, you'll cover the initial newborn stage and provide some room for growth. This way, Rachel can choose the right size depending on Ethan's development and the season.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and get a few larger sizes, as babies tend to grow quickly. And who knows, Ethan might be a big baby!\n\nLastly, don't forget to check the material and quality of the onesies and sleepers. Look for soft, breathable fabrics like cotton, bamboo, or organic materials that will be gentle on Ethan's skin.",
