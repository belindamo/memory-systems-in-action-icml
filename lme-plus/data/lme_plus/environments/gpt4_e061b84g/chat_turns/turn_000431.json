I'll also encourage my friends to share the post and reach out to their networks. Since I have a strong online presence, I'm hoping to get some good responses. With 500 friends on Facebook, I'm confident that I can find the right instructors or facilitators for my event. Do you have any tips on how to screen or evaluate the responses I receive from potential instructors or facilitators?",
