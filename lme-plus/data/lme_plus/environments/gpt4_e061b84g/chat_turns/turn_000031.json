  "content": "Congratulations on updating your Social Security card!\n\nSince you've already updated your Social Security card, you don't need to notify the Social Security Administration (SSA) again about your name change. When you applied for a new Social Security card with your updated name, the SSA should have automatically updated their records.\n\nHowever, to confirm that your records are accurate and up-to-date, you may want to:\n\n1. **Check your Social Security statement**: Wait for your next Social Security statement (usually mailed annually) or create a my Social Security account ([www.ssa.gov/myaccount](http://www.ssa.gov/myaccount)) to view your statement online. Verify that your name change is reflected on your statement.\n2. **Verify your earnings record**: Ensure your earnings record is accurate by checking your Social Security statement or using the my Social Security portal. Your earnings record should reflect your new name.\n3. **Confirm your benefits (if applicable)**: If you're receiving Social Security benefits, make sure your name change is reflected on your benefit statements and that your payments are still being sent to the correct address.\n\nIf you notice any discrepancies or issues, you can contact the SSA at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778) or visit your local SSA office.\n\nRemember to update your name with other government agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and any other relevant institutions.\n\nYou've taken a significant step in updating your records, and now you can focus on enjoying your new name!",
