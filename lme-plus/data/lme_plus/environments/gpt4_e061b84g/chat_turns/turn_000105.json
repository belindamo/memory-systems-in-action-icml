However, I can suggest a few ways to find out if the waterfront path is open to cyclists during the week:\n\n1. **Check the city's website**: Look for the city's official website, parks department, or transportation department website. They usually have information on bike trails, paths, and their usage rules.\n2. **Contact local bike shops**: Reach out to local bike shops or cycling organizations in your area. They often have knowledge about the local cycling infrastructure and can provide you with information on the waterfront path's availability.\n3. **Social media and online forums**: Join local cycling groups or forums on social media platforms like Facebook or Reddit. Ask the community if they have any information about the waterfront path's hours of operation.\n4. **Check with local authorities**: If you're unable to find information online, you can contact the local parks department, transportation department, or police department to ask about the path's availability during the week.\n5. **Visit the path**: If all else fails, you can always visit the waterfront path during the week and see if it's open to cyclists. Look for signs or postings that might indicate any restrictions.\n\nRemember to always follow local rules and regulations, and be respectful of other path users, such as pedestrians and joggers.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a great ride along the waterfront path!",
