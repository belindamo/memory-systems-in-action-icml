Start with a small amount of seasoning: It's always easier to add more seasoning than remove it, so start by adding a small amount of seasoning and taste it as you go.\n\n2. Taste as you cook: Taste your dish as you go to understand how the seasoning is developing. This will help you make adjustments as needed. \n\n3. Use salt properly: Salt brings out the flavors of the dish, so it's important to use it properly. Don't oversalt, but make sure to add enough salt to bring out the natural flavors of the ingredients.\n\n4. Layer your seasoning: Don't add all the seasoning at once. Add a little at a time, and layer the seasoning by adding some at the start of cooking, some in the middle, and some at the end.\n\n5. Experiment with herbs and spices: Experiment with different herbs, spices, and seasonings to create unique flavors in your dishes. Try different combinations to find what works well together.\n\n6. Consider acidity: Tart or acidic ingredients like vinegar, lemon or lime juice can balance out rich or savory flavors in your dish.\n\n7. Keep a balance of flavors: Aim to balance the saltiness, sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and umami flavors. This will ensure that your dish has a depth and complexity of flavors.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect. Keep experimenting with different flavors and seasonings, and you'll soon master the art of seasoning your dishes like a pro.",
