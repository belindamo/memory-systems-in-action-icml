  "content": "Both the Samsung QN90A and LG OLED C1 are high-end TVs with impressive smart TV features and voice control capabilities. Here's a breakdown of their differences:\n\n**Smart TV Platform:**\n\n* **Samsung QN90A:** Runs on Samsung's Tizen operating system, which provides a user-friendly interface and access to various apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and more.\n* **LG OLED C1:** Runs on LG's webOS operating system, which offers a similar user experience to Tizen, with access to popular apps and services.\n\n**Voice Control:**\n\n* **Samsung QN90A:** Supports Samsung's Bixby voice assistant, which allows you to control the TV with voice commands, search for content, and access various features.\n* **LG OLED C1:** Supports LG's ThinQ AI voice assistant, which offers similar capabilities to Bixby, including voice control, content search, and feature access.\n\n**Voice Control Remotes:**\n\n* **Samsung QN90A:** Comes with a remote control that features a microphone and supports Bixby voice commands.\n* **LG OLED C1:** Comes with a remote control that features a microphone and supports ThinQ AI voice commands.\n\n**Additional Voice Control Options:**\n\n* **Samsung QN90A:** Compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to control the TV with voice commands using these popular voice assistants.\n* **LG OLED C1:** Compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as Apple's Siri and LG's own ThinQ AI voice assistant.\n\n**Smart Features:**\n\n* **Samsung QN90A:** Offers features like SmartThings, which allows you to control other compatible smart devices in your home, and Ambient Mode, which provides information like weather and news on the TV when it's not in use.\n* **LG OLED C1:** Offers features like LG's \u03b1 (Alpha) 9 Gen 3 processor, which provides improved picture and sound quality, and OLED Motion Pro, which enhances motion clarity.\n\n**Gaming Features:**\n\n* **Samsung QN90A:** Supports AMD's FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces screen tearing and stuttering, and has a low input lag of around 10ms.\n* **LG OLED C1:** Supports NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium, and has a low input lag of around 6ms.\n\nIn terms of smart TV features and voice control capabilities, both TVs are very similar. However, the Samsung QN90A has a slight edge with its support for more voice assistants and its SmartThings feature, which allows for greater control over other smart devices in your home. On the other hand, the LG OLED C1 has a more advanced processor and better motion clarity, making it a better choice for gamers and those who value picture quality.\n\nUltimately, the choice between these two TVs will depend on your specific needs and preferences. I recommend researching and comparing their features in more detail to make an informed decision.",
