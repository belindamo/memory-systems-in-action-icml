  "content": "Sleep sacks and swaddles are a great addition to the gift!\n\nFor sleep sacks and swaddles, I would recommend sticking to neutral colors and simple designs. Here's why:\n\n* Neutral colors like white, gray, beige, and light blue are calming and soothing, which is perfect for bedtime.\n* Simple designs like minimal patterns or subtle textures won't overstimulate the baby's senses, promoting better sleep.\n* Neutral colors and simple designs will also make it easier for Rachel to mix and match the sleep sacks and swaddles with other sleepwear and nursery decor.\n\nWhile fun designs can be adorable, they might be overwhelming for a newborn's sensitive senses. Plus, neutral colors will provide a clean canvas for adding a personalized touch, like a small embroidered name or initials.\n\nThat being said, if you still want to add some fun to the sleep sacks and swaddles, you could consider:\n\n* A subtle, tone-on-tone pattern like a gentle stripe or polka dot.\n* A soft, muted color like pale pink or baby blue.\n* A sweet, simple design like a tiny heart or star.\n\nRemember, the primary function of sleep sacks and swaddles is to provide comfort and security for the baby, so prioritize comfort, softness, and breathability when choosing the material and design.\n\nBy sticking to neutral colors and simple designs, you'll provide Rachel with a practical and soothing gift that will help create a peaceful sleep environment for baby Ethan.",
