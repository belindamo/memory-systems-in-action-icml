I haven't noticed any overheating issues, but I do notice that the battery drains faster when I'm using social media apps or watching videos. I've tried closing some background apps and adjusting the screen brightness, but it doesn't seem to make a huge difference. I also got a fast charger recently, which is nice, but I'm not sure if it's making a difference in terms of battery life.",
