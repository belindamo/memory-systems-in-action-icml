A certified copy of your court order or decree changing your name.\n2. A copy of your government-issued ID (driver's license, state ID, or passport) showing your new name.\n3. A completed request form (available on each agency's website or by calling their customer service).\n\nMail your request to:\n\n* Equifax: Equifax Information Services, LLC, P.O.
