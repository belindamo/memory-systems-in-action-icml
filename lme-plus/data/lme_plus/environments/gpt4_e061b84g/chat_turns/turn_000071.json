Adding a pom-pom or a small flower can be a wonderful way to add a personal touch to the hat and make it even more special for your sister. Here are some thoughts to consider:\n\n**Pom-pom:**\n\n* A small, soft pom-pom in a matching pastel pink color could add a playful, whimsical touch to the hat.\n* You could also use a contrasting color for the pom-pom to create a fun, bold look.\n* Pom-poms are relatively easy to make, and there are many tutorials online if you need guidance.\n\n**Small flower:**\n\n* A delicate, hand-knit or crocheted flower in a matching or contrasting color could add a sweet, feminine touch to the hat.\n* You could attach the flower to the hat using a small amount of yarn or a pin, so it's removable if your sister prefers.\n* There are many free flower patterns online, or you could use a small, pre-made flower embellishment.\n\n**Other embellishment ideas:**\n\n* A small, sparkly button or bead could add a touch of elegance to the hat.\n* A simple, hand-embroidered design or initial could make the hat even more special and personalized.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Keep the embellishment simple and understated, as you want the focus to be on the hat itself.\n* Make sure the embellishment is securely attached to the hat, so it doesn't come loose over time.\n* Consider your sister's personal style and preferences when choosing an embellishment. If she's not into bold or flashy accessories, a simple, subtle embellishment might be a better choice.\n\nUltimately, the decision to add an embellishment is up to you and your sister's preferences. If you're unsure, you could always make a small pom-pom or flower and attach it temporarily to the hat to see how it looks before committing to a particular design.",
