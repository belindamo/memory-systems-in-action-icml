  "content": "Sure! It can be challenging to stay calm and focused when negotiating with difficult people, especially when they try to push your buttons. Here are some suggestions for dealing with difficult negotiators:\n\n1. Be empathetic: Difficult negotiators may be acting out of fear, insecurity or even past experiences. Try to understand where they are coming from and approach the negotiation with empathy. Show that you care about their concerns and find common ground. 2. Keep your emotions in check: Stay calm and focused when the difficult negotiator starts pushing your buttons. Take a deep breath, pause and collect your thoughts before responding. Don't let them get under your skin or lose control. 3. Refrain from making it personal: Avoid taking their comments or behavior personally. If they come across as aggressive or rude, try to stay objective and deal with the situation at hand rather than responding with personal attacks. 4. Stay firm and assertive: Don't let the difficult negotiator intimidate you or push you into agreeing to something you don't want to. Stay firm on your position and reiterate your bottom line. Be assertive, but don't be aggressive. 5. Look for alternatives: If the negotiation reaches an impasse, try to look for alternative solutions that may benefit both parties. Be open to compromise but not at the cost of your goals or values. In summary, dealing with difficult negotiators can be challenging, but keeping calm, being empathetic, avoiding personal attacks, staying firm and assertive, and searching for alternative solutions may help you to navigate through the difficult conversation.",
