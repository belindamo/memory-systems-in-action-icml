Here are some tips to help you ask for a discount or negotiate the price:\n\n1. **Be polite and friendly**: Start by being friendly and courteous to the sales associate. A smile and a kind demeanor can go a long way in building rapport.\n2. **Mention your repeat business**: Let the sales associate know that you're a repeat customer and that you appreciate their store. This can help establish a connection and show that you're a loyal customer.\n3. **Ask about any ongoing promotions**: Inquire about any current sales, promotions, or discounts that might be available. This shows that you're interested in making a purchase and willing to look for a good deal.\n4. **Be specific about what you're looking for**: Let the sales associate know that you're interested in a specific type of necklace (e.g., silver with a small pendant) and ask if they have any similar pieces that might be on sale or discounted.\n5. **Ask if they can offer a discount**: If you find a piece you like, ask the sales associate if they can offer a discount or if there's any flexibility in the price. You can say something like, \"I love this necklace, but it's a bit above my budget. Is there any way you could offer a discount or work with me on the price?\"\n6. **Be willing to walk away**: If the sales associate is unwilling to budge on the price, be prepared to walk away. This shows that you're not desperate, and they might be more willing to compromise to make a sale.\n7. **Look for flaws or imperfections**: If you find a piece with a minor flaw or imperfection, you can ask the sales associate if they can offer a discount due to the defect.\n\nSome specific phrases you could use to ask for a discount or negotiate the price include:\n\n* \"I'm a repeat customer, and I love your store. Is there anything you can do for me in terms of a discount?\"\n* \"I'm interested in this necklace, but it's a bit above my budget. Can you offer any discounts or promotions?\"\n* \"I see you have some similar pieces on sale. Can you match that price for this necklace?\"\n* \"I really love this piece, but I was thinking more in the range of [insert lower price]. Is there any way you could work with me on the price?\"\n\nRemember to stay calm, polite, and respectful throughout the negotiation process. Good luck, and I hope you find a beautiful necklace for your mom's birthday!",
