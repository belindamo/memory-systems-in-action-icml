Look for relevant credentials, certifications, or qualifications that align with the topic they're proposing to teach.\n\n**2. Evaluate their proposal**:\nAsk potential instructors or facilitators to submit a brief proposal outlining their workshop or class idea, including the topic, objectives, and expected outcomes.

Review their requirements and expectations**:\nDiscuss and clarify their requirements, such as equipment needs, space requirements, and compensation or honorarium expectations.\n\n**10. Trust your instincts**:\nUltimately, trust your instincts and make a decision based on your overall impression of the candidate.
