  "content": "To observe whether the rules are applied, you can use the `sudo iptables -L -n -v` command. This command lists all of the current rules in the iptables firewall.\n\nThe output will show you the number of packets and bytes that have matched each rule, as well as the target action of the rule (such as ACCEPT or DROP). You can use this information to determine whether the rules you have added are being applied correctly.\n\nIf you want to test a specific rule, you can try accessing the service that the rule is intended to allow or block. For example, if you added a rule to allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP), you can try accessing a website on that port to see if the rule is working.\n\nKeep in mind that iptables rules are applied in order, so if you have multiple rules that match a particular packet, the first matching rule will be applied. You can use the `sudo iptables -L --line-numbers` command to see the order in which your rules are being applied.",
