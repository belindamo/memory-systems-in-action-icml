  "content": "The duration of a heart attack may vary depending on the individual, but generally, a heart attack can last from 20 minutes to several hours if left untreated. The longer the duration of the heart attack, the greater the damage to the heart muscle can be. It is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible if someone suspects they are having a heart attack, as the quicker the treatment is started, the better the chances of survival and recovery. Therefore, knowing the signs and symptoms of a heart attack and reacting quickly is key.",
