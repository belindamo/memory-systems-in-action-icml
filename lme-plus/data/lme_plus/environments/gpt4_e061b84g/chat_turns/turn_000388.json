I like the idea of a personalized banner and a memory lane with photos from her career. We'll also have a custom cake and a special menu with her favorite dishes. I'm thinking of having the party on a weekend, so we can have more family members attend. Do you think it's a good idea to send out formal invitations or just a casual Facebook event or group chat?",
