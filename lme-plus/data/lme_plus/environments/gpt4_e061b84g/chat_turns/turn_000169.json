  "content": "Korean BBQ Tacos are a unique and flavorful twist on traditional tacos.\n\nFor sides, you'll want something that complements the spicy, savory, and slightly sweet flavors of the Korean BBQ beef. Here are some ideas:\n\n**Kimchi Coleslaw**: A creamy coleslaw with a kick! Mix shredded cabbage, kimchi (use TJ's kimchi or make your own), green onions, and a drizzle of rice vinegar.\n\n**Cilantro Lime Rice**: A simple and refreshing side dish. Cook white or brown rice with cilantro, lime juice, and a bit of olive oil.\n\n**Roasted Gochujang Broccoli**: Roasting broccoli brings out its natural sweetness, which pairs well with the spicy gochujang sauce. Toss broccoli florets with gochujang, olive oil, garlic, and salt. Roast in the oven until tender and caramelized.\n\n**Pickled Carrots and Daikon**: A sweet and tangy side that cuts the richness of the tacos. Slice carrots and daikon thinly and soak them in a brine made with vinegar, sugar, salt, and Korean chili flakes (gochugaru).\n\n**Cucumber Kimchi Salad**: A light and crunchy side that's perfect for hot summer days. Slice cucumbers thinly and mix with kimchi, green onions, and a drizzle of rice vinegar.\n\n**Fried Wonton Chips**: Crispy and addictive! Fry wonton wrappers until crispy, then season with salt and a sprinkle of Korean chili flakes. Serve as a crunchy snack or use as a garnish for your tacos.\n\nChoose one or two of these options to serve alongside your Korean BBQ Tacos. Enjoy!",
