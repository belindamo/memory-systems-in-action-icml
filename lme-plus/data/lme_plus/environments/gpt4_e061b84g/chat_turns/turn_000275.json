Given your frequent usage, especially with social media and video streaming, it's likely that those apps are contributing to the battery drain. Here are some potential factors to consider:\n\n1. **Screen brightness**: Since you mentioned you don't have a screen protector, your screen might be more prone to fingerprints and smudges, which can reduce its brightness and increase battery consumption. Try cleaning your screen regularly and adjusting the auto-brightness setting to see if it makes a difference.\n2. **Social media apps**: Social media apps, especially those with a lot of visual content, can be battery-hungry. Consider limiting your usage or adjusting the app settings to reduce battery consumption. For example, you can turn off background refresh, reduce the frequency of notifications, or use the app's built-in power-saving features.\n3. **Video streaming**: Watching videos can quickly drain your battery, especially if you're streaming in high quality. Try reducing the video quality or switching to a lower-resolution setting to conserve battery life.\n4. **Background app usage**: Some apps might be running in the background and consuming battery power without your knowledge. Check your phone's settings to see which apps are using the most battery power and consider closing or restricting their background usage.\n5. **Case material**: Although unlikely, it's possible that the new case is affecting your phone's battery life. Some cases, especially those with metallic or conductive materials, can interfere with your phone's antenna or affect its ability to dissipate heat. This might cause your phone to work harder and consume more power.\n\nTo help you better, I have a few more questions:\n\n1. How long does your phone typically last on a single charge?\n2. Have you noticed any overheating issues with your phone, especially when using resource-intensive apps?\n3. Are there any specific times of the day when your battery life seems to drain faster?\n4. Have you tried any battery-saving features or modes on your phone, such as Low Power Mode or Power Saving?\n\nLet's work together to identify the main culprit behind your battery life issues and find ways to optimize your phone's performance!",
