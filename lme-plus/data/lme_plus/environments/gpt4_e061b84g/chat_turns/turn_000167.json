Here are a few options to get you started:\n\n**Classic Beef Tacos**\n\n* Brown the ground beef with some onion, garlic, and taco seasoning (you can use TJ's taco seasoning mix or make your own blend).\n* Serve it in a taco shell with your favorite toppings: shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, sour cream, and salsa.\n\n**Taco Variations**\n\n* **Korean BBQ Tacos**: Add some Korean chili flakes (gochugaru) to the ground beef while it's browning. Serve with kimchi slaw (made with TJ's kimchi and shredded cabbage), cilantro, and a drizzle of sriracha.\n* **Southwestern Tacos**: Mix in some diced bell peppers and onions into the ground beef. Top with black beans, diced tomatoes, avocado, sour cream, and a sprinkle of queso fresco.\n* **Mexican Street Corn Tacos**: Add some frozen corn kernels to the ground beef while it's cooking.
