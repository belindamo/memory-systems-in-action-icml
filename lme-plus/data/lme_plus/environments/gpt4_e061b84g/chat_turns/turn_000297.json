Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Neutral Colors:**\n\n* White, gray, and beige are great choices for onesies and sleepers because they:\n\t+ Are versatile and can be paired with any pattern or design\n\t+ Are easy to mix and match with other outfits\n\t+ Won't clash with any potential allergies or sensitivities to certain dyes\n\t+ Can be easily dressed up or down\n* Neutral colors are also a great choice because they provide a clean canvas for adding fun designs or patterns.\n\n**Fun Colors and Designs:**\n\n* Adding a few onesies and sleepers with brighter colors and fun designs can add some personality to the gift and make it more exciting.\n* Consider colors like navy blue, red, yellow, and green, which are all great for babies and can add a pop of color to the outfit.\n* Fun designs like stripes, polka dots, and animals can also add visual interest and make the onesies and sleepers more engaging.\n\nHere's a possible combination:\n\n* 2-3 neutral onesies/sleepers (white, gray, beige)\n* 2-3 onesies/sleepers with fun designs and brighter colors (e.g., navy blue with white anchors, yellow with orange monkeys, red with white polka dots)\n\nRemember, you can always consider Rachel's personal style and preferences when choosing the onesies and sleepers. If she has a more playful and bold style, you might lean towards more fun designs and colors. If she prefers a more classic look, you might stick with neutral colors and simpler designs.\n\nLastly, don't forget to check the size range and material of the onesies and sleepers to ensure they're suitable for baby Ethan's age and skin type.",
