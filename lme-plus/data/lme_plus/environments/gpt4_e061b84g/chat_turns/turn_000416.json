  "content": "\"The Journey Begins: Kadence's Origins Story\n\nKadence, a 25-year-old musician from New York City, was raised in Jamaica. Music has always been a constant in his life, serving as a source of comfort and inspiration that has seen him through the ups and downs of his journey. From a young age, Kadence was drawn to the rhythms of the Caribbean and the art of music-making, and it was in Jamaica where he first discovered his love for rap and hip-hop.\n\nIt all started with a grand piano at his grandmother's friend's house, where he would make a practice of playing random sounds on the keys. Though it was just a random act of musical exploration, it sparked a flame within him that would eventually lead him to pursue a career in music.\n\nIn early high school, Kadence and his friends would make beats using tables in classrooms by knocking their hands on them and take turns freestyling. His unique choice of words and flow quickly caught the attention of those around him, who told him that he was destined for greatness in the music world. And so, he took their words to heart and started recording at a local studio named 'Outta Space Records' ran by a friend named Steelchest. With Steelchest's encouragement, Kadence released his first EP entitled 'Untitled', although it didn't receive much attention, it was a proud moment for him.\n\nIn 10th grade, Kadence became close friends with a prominent Jamaican music producer named SOS Dynamikz. Watching SOS create a beat one night inspired Kadence to try his hand at music production for the first time. And despite his initial struggles, he eventually honed his skills to a level where he could confidently create the music he heard in his head to a 75% accurate level.\n\nHowever, life wasn't always easy for Kadence. He faced distractions in the form of women, drugs, and money, causing him to take breaks from his music. But today, he is determined to make this year different. He is ready to pour his heart and soul into each song he writes and each beat he produces, as he knows that music is more than just entertainment, it is a way of life.\n\nKadence's love for music began with a simple act of exploration on a grand piano, and it has since grown into a passion that drives him to create music that touches people's hearts and helps heal the world. He is a source of inspiration, a voice for the voiceless, and a shining light in a dark world. And as he continues on his journey, he is honored to share his life's work with you.\"",
