With 10-12 hours of battery life, it's indeed lower than usual for a relatively new phone.\n\nGiven your usage patterns, it's likely that the battery drain is due to a combination of factors. Here are some additional suggestions to help you optimize your phone's battery life:\n\n1. **App-specific settings**: Take a closer look at the settings for your social media apps and video streaming services. Some apps, like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, have built-in features to reduce battery consumption. Look for settings like \"Data Saver\" or \"Low Power Mode\" to limit their battery usage.\n2. **Background app refresh**: Go to your phone's settings and check which apps are allowed to refresh in the background. Restrict or turn off background refresh for apps that don't need it. This can help reduce battery consumption when you're not actively using those apps.\n3. **Screen resolution and refresh rate**: If your phone has a high-resolution display or a high refresh rate, it can consume more power. Consider reducing the screen resolution or refresh rate to conserve battery life.\n4. **Video streaming quality**: When watching videos, try reducing the streaming quality to conserve battery life. You can do this within the app settings or by switching to a lower-quality streaming option.\n5. **Fast charging**: While fast charging is convenient, it can also cause your battery to heat up and potentially reduce its overall lifespan. Try to charge your phone when the battery level is between 20% and 80% to minimize wear and tear.\n6. **Battery calibration**: Try calibrating your phone's battery by letting it drain to 0% and then charging it to 100%. Repeat this process a few times to see if it helps the battery gauge more accurately.\n7. **Software updates**: Make sure your phone's operating system and apps are up-to-date, as updates often include bug fixes and performance optimizations that can improve battery life.\n8. **Battery-saving features**: Explore your phone's built-in battery-saving features, such as Android's Adaptive Battery or iOS's Low Power Mode. These features can help extend battery life by limiting background usage and optimizing power consumption.\n\nTo help you better, I have a few more questions:\n\n1. Are you using any battery-saving apps or widgets on your phone?\n2. Have you noticed any unusual battery drain patterns, such as sudden drops in battery life?\n3. Do you use your phone's GPS or location services frequently?\n4. Have you tried resetting your phone's settings to their default values to see if it makes a difference?\n\nLet's continue to troubleshoot and find ways to optimize your phone's battery life!",
