Am I right?\n\nConsidering your sister enjoys romance novels and you're looking for a similar gift to the one you got for your mom, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Nora Roberts**: A legendary romance author with a vast collection of novels. If your sister enjoys romance, she might love a new release or a popular title like \"The Obsession\" or \"The Liar\".\n2. **Jude Deveraux**: Another beloved romance author known for her historical and contemporary romances. You could consider her latest release or a popular title like \"A Holiday of Love\" or \"Change of Heart\".\n3. **Susan Mallery**: A bestselling author of romance novels, often focusing on relationships, family, and women's fiction. Her latest releases or popular titles like \"The Summer of Sunshine and Margot\" or \"A Million Little Things\" might interest your sister.\n4. **Robyn Carr**: A popular author of romance novels, often set in small towns or featuring relatable heroines. Her Virgin River series is a fan favorite, or you could consider her latest releases like \"The Country Guesthouse\" or \"Sunrise on Half Moon Bay\".\n5. **Colleen Hoover**: A New York Times bestselling author known for her emotional and thought-provoking romance novels. Her latest releases or popular titles like \"Regretting You\" or \"Verity\" might appeal to your sister.\n\nSince you mentioned the book you got for your mom cost around $20, I've focused on authors with books in a similar price range. You can find these titles in paperback or hardcover at most bookstores or online retailers.\n\nFeel free to provide more information or clarify if these suggestions aren't quite right. I'm here to help you find the perfect gift for your sister!",
