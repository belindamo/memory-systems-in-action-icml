  "content": "Okay. I will share some personal stories:\n\nMy love for music began when I was about 6 and my grandmother used to take me to another lady's home just outside of Mandeville. Nothing interesting happened there and I never really wanted to go, that is until I remember the piano that she had each time. It was an amazing grand piano and she just had it sitting there. I used to make a practice of playing complete random noise on the keys, obviously to the disapproval of the adults in the house, but I made it a point in my head to transform that random key playing into a beautiful melody, kind of like the Dolby Atmos intro sound turns into a musical harmony. I only got to go there once every couple months, and at that I have only ever been to that house less than 20 times in my life. But it was enough to kickstart my interest in music, and that's where I think it all started. I used to listen to music passively before that, but since then I've always wanted to be the one who created the music.\n\nI started off rapping in early high-school, around 7th grade, at deCarterate College in Mandeville. Me and my friends would make beats using tables in classrooms by knocking our hands on them and then each of us would take turns freestyling. I was always getting a lot of recognition for my choice of words and flow. People would always tell me that I was cut out to be a famous musician some day. I believed it.\n\nI decided to take it seriously and ended up booking recording sessions at a studio named 'Outta Space Records' ran by my friend Steelchest. I was young at the time but he saw something in me that I didn't at the time. A grown man telling my young self that I was destined for greatness really pushed me. He also showed me just how much he meant it by pushing me to do my best every recording session. Thanks to him, I release my first EP entitled 'Untitled'. It didn't get that much attention, but I'm proud of it to this day.\n\nIt was later in my highschool years (around 10th grade) where I decided to try my hand at music production for the first time. Actually, I had tried making a beat years prior but it didn't go well at all. However, in 10th grade, I became close friends with a prominent Jamaican music producer named SOS Dynamikz. He was making a beat one night when I was at my best friends' Marc and Matthew's home. I saw what he was doing and he made it seem so easy, but the beat he was making at the time was so beautiful to my ears, I just decided I had to make beats then and there. If he could do it, so could it.\n\nSince then I have been on and off with my music, being distracted by women, drugs, money, you name it. Today, I would say I've honed my skills to a level where I can confidently created the music I hear in my head to a 75% accurate level. But that's enough for me to get working. I already feel bad about the years I wasted not releasing music. In total I've released less than 50 songs. But this year will be completely different...\n\nThere you go.",
