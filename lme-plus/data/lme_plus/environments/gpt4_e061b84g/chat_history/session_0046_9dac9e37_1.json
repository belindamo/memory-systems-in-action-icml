I'd be happy to help you make your social event more engaging for all attendees.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on having a strong online presence with 500 friends on Facebook! That's impressive. Now, let's dive into some ideas to make your social event a memorable one:\n\n**Group Activities:**\n\n1. **Icebreaker games**: Plan some fun, interactive games that encourage people to mingle and get to know each other. Examples include \"Two Truths and a Lie,\" \"Human Bingo,\" or \"Scavenger Hunt.\"\n2. **Workshops or classes**: Organize a group activity like a cooking class, art session, or yoga class. This can be a great way to create a shared experience and encourage collaboration.\n3. **Team-building exercises**: Design activities that promote teamwork, such as escape rooms, group puzzles, or volunteer work.\n4. **Karaoke or game nights**: Set up a karaoke session or host a board game night with a variety of games to cater to different interests.\n\n**One-on-One Conversations:**\n\n1. **Speed networking**: Inspired by speed dating, this format allows attendees to have short, timed conversations with each other.

Evaluating and screening potential instructors or facilitators is a crucial step to ensure you find the right fit for your event. Here are some tips to help you screen and evaluate the responses:\n\n**1. Review their profiles and credentials**:\nCheck the responder's Facebook profile, LinkedIn profile, or website to learn more about their background, expertise, and experience. Look for relevant credentials, certifications, or qualifications that align with the topic they're proposing to teach.\n\n**2. Evaluate their proposal**:\nAsk potential instructors or facilitators to submit a brief proposal outlining their workshop or class idea, including the topic, objectives, and expected outcomes. Assess the proposal's relevance, clarity, and feasibility.\n\n**3. Check their teaching or facilitation experience**:\nAsk about their experience leading workshops, classes, or facilitating discussions. Look for evidence of successful events or testimonials from previous participants.\n\n**4. Assess their communication skills**:\nEvaluate their communication style, tone, and responsiveness. Are they clear, concise, and professional in their messages? Do they respond promptly to your queries?\n\n**5. Conduct a phone or video interview**:\nShortlist candidates and conduct a phone or video interview to discuss their proposal, experience, and approach. This will give you a better sense of their personality, enthusiasm, and teaching style.\n\n**6. Request references or testimonials**:\nAsk for references or testimonials from previous clients, students, or event organizers. This can provide valuable insights into their work quality and professionalism.\n\n**7. Evaluate their fit with your event's goals and values**:\nAssess whether the instructor or facilitator's approach, tone, and values align with your event's objectives and atmosphere.\n\n**8.

Review their requirements and expectations**:\nDiscuss and clarify their requirements, such as equipment needs, space requirements, and compensation or honorarium expectations.\n\n**10. Trust your instincts**:\nUltimately, trust your instincts and make a decision based on your overall impression of the candidate. If you're unsure or hesitant, it may be best to keep looking.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to evaluate and screen potential instructors or facilitators effectively, ensuring you find the right fit for your event.\n\nRemember to stay organized, and consider creating a spreadsheet or document to track the responses and evaluations.
