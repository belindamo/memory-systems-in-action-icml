Slice cucumbers thinly and mix with kimchi, green onions, and a drizzle of rice vinegar.\n\n**Fried Wonton Chips**: Crispy and addictive!

      "content": "The Kimchi Coleslaw and Cilantro Lime Rice will complement the Korean BBQ Tacos perfectly.\n\nFor the Kimchi Coleslaw, the ratio of kimchi to cabbage is a matter of personal preference, but here's a general guideline:\n\n**Kimchi Coleslaw Recipe**\n\n* 2 cups shredded cabbage (green or napa work well)\n* 1/2 cup kimchi, chopped (use store-bought or homemade)\n* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise or Korean chili flake-infused mayonnaise (optional)\n* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar\n* 1 teaspoon honey\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Green onions and toasted sesame seeds for garnish (optional)\n\nStart with a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of cabbage to kimchi. If you prefer a milder slaw, use more cabbage. If you like it spicier, add more kimchi. You can always adjust to taste.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* Use a mandoline or sharp knife to shred the cabbage thinly, so it's easy to mix with the kimchi.\n* If using store-bought kimchi, drain and rinse it to remove excess brine.\n* Add the mayonnaise or spicy mayonnaise if you want a creamier slaw. Otherwise, the slaw will be more vinegary and refreshing.\n* Taste and adjust the seasoning as you go. You may want to add more honey, rice vinegar, or salt to balance the flavors.\n\nFor the Cilantro Lime Rice, simply cook your rice according to package instructions, then mix in chopped cilantro, lime juice, and a bit of olive oil. You can't go wrong with a simple recipe like this!\n\nEnjoy your delicious Korean BBQ Tacos with Kimchi Coleslaw and Cilantro Lime Rice!"
