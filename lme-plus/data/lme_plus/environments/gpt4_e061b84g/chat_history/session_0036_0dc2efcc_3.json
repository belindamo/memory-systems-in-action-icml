Shape into patties and pan-fry until crispy. Serve with a refreshing asparagus slaw made by chopping the leftover asparagus, adding some diced red onion, lemon juice, and a drizzle of olive oil.\n\n**Wednesday:**\n\n* **Quinoa and Veggie Stir-Fry**: Use the leftover quinoa as the base for a quick and easy stir-fry. Add your favorite veggies (bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, etc.) and some oil, garlic, and ginger for flavor. You can also add some protein like tofu, chicken, or shrimp if you like.\n\n**Thursday:**\n\n* **Salmon and Asparagus Wrap**: Fill a whole wheat tortilla with leftover salmon, roasted asparagus, mixed greens, and a dollop of tzatziki sauce (or your favorite spread). Add some sliced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, or avocado for extra freshness.\n\n**Friday:**\n\n* **Quinoa and Black Bean Bowl**: Cook some black beans and add them to the leftover quinoa.

      "content": "Excellent choices! Hummus and avocado spread will complement the saut\u00e9ed onions and bell peppers perfectly.\n\nQuinoa is a fantastic addition to wraps, and seasoning it can elevate the flavor of your meal.

Add some salt and pepper to taste.\n3. **Cumin and Chili Flakes**: Add a pinch of ground cumin and chili flakes to give your quinoa a smoky, spicy flavor.\n4. **Soy Sauce and Scallions**: Mix in some soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free) and chopped scallions for a savory, umami flavor.\n5. **Mexican-Style**: Add some diced tomatoes, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice for a flavorful and fresh twist.\n\nYou can also try combining these seasonings to create your own unique flavor profiles. For example, lemon and garlic or cumin and chili flakes with a squeeze of lime juice.\n\nWhen seasoning your quinoa, remember that a little goes a long way. Start with a small amount and taste as you go, adjusting the seasoning to your liking.\n\nNow, imagine your wrap filled with saut\u00e9ed onions and bell peppers, flavored quinoa, hummus, and avocado spread...
