Sort list in descending order by the rave rank.\nBelow are the emails and reviews that need to be evaluated. The paragraph under the mail is the review.\n\nbryantjames@example.com\nAs someone who has struggled with anxiety and stress for years, I've found Welltory to be incredibly helpful. The app's stress tracking and HRV analysis have helped me better understand my body's response to stress, and the guided meditations and breathing exercises have been a lifesaver when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nlgreen@example.net\nWelltory is a decent app overall. I appreciate the stress tracking and HRV analysis, but I do wish there were more personalized recommendations based on my data. The guided meditations and breathing exercises are helpful, but I wish there were more of them.\n\nryanryan@example.com\nI like using Welltory to track my stress levels and HRV, but I find the app a bit clunky and difficult to navigate at times. It can also be a bit overwhelming with all the data and graphs. I think the app could benefit from a simpler, more streamlined design.\n\nspearsjamie@example.org\nI was really disappointed with Welltory. The HRV measurements were wildly inconsistent, and the app was constantly crashing. I also found the recommendations to be quite generic and not very helpful. I ended up cancelling my subscription after just a few weeks.\n\njeffreyvincent@example.org\nI've been using Welltory for a few months now, and I love it. The app is easy to use and provides me with a ton of valuable information about my health. The stress tracking feature is particularly helpful for me, as I tend to get stressed easily. The guided meditations and breathing exercises are also great for managing stress.\n\nkevin03@example.com\nWelltory is okay, but I'm not sure it's worth the price. The free version of the app is quite limited, and the paid version doesn't offer much more in terms of features. I do appreciate the stress tracking and HRV analysis, but I'm not sure it's worth the monthly subscription fee.\n\nwilliamwang@example.org\nI've been using Welltory for a few weeks now, and while I like the stress tracking and HRV analysis, I find the app's recommendations to be a bit generic. I wish there were more personalized recommendations based on my data. The guided meditations and breathing exercises are helpful, but I wish there were more of them.\n\nrobertbautista@example.net\nWelltory is a decent app, but I find the HRV measurements to be a bit finicky. I often have trouble getting a good reading, and the app can be a bit frustrating to use as a result. The stress tracking and guided meditations are helpful, though.\n\nalexandermarshall@example.net\nAs someone who has struggled with anxiety and stress for years, I've found Welltory to be incredibly helpful. The app's stress tracking and HRV analysis have helped me better understand my body's response to stress, and the guided meditations and breathing exercises have been a lifesaver when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\njosephtucker@example.net\nI found Welltory to be a bit of a letdown. While the app provides some interesting data about my health, I didn't find it particularly useful in terms of making meaningful changes in my life. The guided meditations and breathing exercises were okay, but I didn't find them to be any better than other meditation apps out there."
