A small drop (2 uL) of milk with adulterants was dried on a gold-coated slide to examine concentrations ranging from 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/dL based on spectra ranging from 400 to 1500 cm.- A uniform distribution of analytes, with enhanced Raman signals was detected in a small region (maximum 1.9 mm) of coffee ring across the centre of coffee ring pattern. Nanoparticles with core (Au) diameter of 26 nm and shell thickness (Ag) of 6.5 nm were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. A strong Raman peak at 980 cm- was assigned to AmS, while that at 1001 cm- was ascribed to urea. With AuNPs, coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.9873 and 0.9859 were achieved for urea and AmS, respectively, while for Au@AgNPs values of 0.9827 and 0.9855 were obtained for urea and AmS, respectively. This study revealed that SERS based on coffee ring effect has the potential to be further exploited for detecting other banned and hazardous adulterants in milk and milk products.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIntroduction and renal failure, cancers and even deaths are Milk is a nutritious food commodity with macro reported in some parts of the world due to illegal and microconstituents necessary for a healthy life. adulteration (Cheng et al. 2010; Kandpal et al. 2012; Unfortunately, like other valuable agricultural pro- Domingo et al. 2014; Toledo et al., 2017). ducts, milk is also prone to adulteration with inex- Urea and AmS are among the most common pensive and hazardous substances for various adulterants added to milk to deceive the lact- purposes. For example, water is added as diluent, ometer readings (Nieuwoud et al., 2016). In while borax, salicylic acid, formaldehyde, hydrogen order to examine such water-soluble nitrogen- peroxide, hypochlorite and dichromate are adulter- rich compounds, conventional techniques possess ated to enhance shelf life or mask poor quality of numerous negative aspects. For example, Kjeldahl milk (Hussain et al. 2013; Moore et al. 2012; Jeong technique commonly used for urea determination et al. 2015). Likewise, surfactants, fats and oils are in milk samples is time-consuming (about 3 h) mixed to raise the fat content (Garcia et al. 2012), and requires high temperatures, and the method and urea, ammonium sulphate, dicyandiamide, cannot distinguish between protein and non- melamine and cheese whey are added to boost its protein nitrogen and is destructive in nature nitrogen content (Carvalho et al., 2015; Nieuwoudt (Ritota and Manzi 2018). Recently, non-destruc- et al. 2016). Such chemical adulterants can cause tive techniques such as computer vision (Sun and serious health issues like kidney and liver problems, Brosnan 2003; Wang and Sun 2003; Du and Sun 2005; Zheng et al. 2006; Jackman et al. 2011), spectroscopy (Morsy and Sun 2013; He and Sun 2015; Wang et al. 2017a, 2017b), and hyperspectral imaging (Dai et al. 2016; Cheng et al. 2016a, 2016b, 2017, 2018; Liu et al. 2017, 2018; Ma et al. 2017, 2018; Pan et al. 2018c) have thus been developed for food quality and safety evalua- tion. the emerging techniques reported to detect urea and AmS in liquid milk include liquid chro- matography-isotope dilution mass spectrometry, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, portable Raman spectro- meter, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, near- infrared Raman spectroscopy, infrared micro- spectroscopy and two-dimensional infrared corre- lation spectroscopy. However, some of these methods exhibit poor limits of detection (600 to 780 mg/L) (Santos et al. 2013; Khan et al. 2015), while others require complex instrumentation set- ups. In addition, some methods also involve a number of sample preparation steps and require more chemicals (Dai et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2014; Toledo de et al. 2017; Nieuwoudt et al. 2016). Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy is also a common method used with the benefits including speed, requirement of minor or no sam- ple preparation and suitability for proximate and simultaneous contaminants detection in milk sam- ples. However, its low sensitivity to trace elements in a sample and high water interference are among the main issues, which limit its applications (Sun 2018). Therefore, there is a need for a versatile technique that can cope with emerging food safety issues. SERS is among the above emerging technologies, as it is a highly sensitive and specific tool, which can deliver specific details about molecular fingerprints for trace screening of chemicals (Pan et al. 2017a, 2018a; Fu et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2019; Yaseen et al. 2018a, 2019). The high sensitivity of SERS is due to the simultaneous effect of chemical and physical mechanisms (Moskovits 1985). The enhancement due to optical characteristics of nanomaterials is the physical effect, which amplifies Raman signals by up to 1010-12 factor (Haynes et al. 2005). Likewise, the enrichment in charge transfer between nanopar- ticles and samples is the chemical mechanism, con- tributing to signal enhancement of up to 102 times (Firkala et al. 2013). For SERS detections, different single nanoparticles such as Au and Ag and their complexes are employed as Raman active nanoma- terials (Pu et al. 2017; Hussain et al. 2018a; Wang et al. 2019; Pan et al. 2017b; Jiang et al. 2018; Pan et al. 2018b). In addition, nanowires, nanoflowers, nano- cages, nanoplates and nanoprisms are also reported as SERS enhancers in different studies (Li et al. 2017; Ricotta et al., 2018; Hussain et al. 2018b; Yaseen et al. 2018b). Furthermore, in order to achieve the synergistic effect of Au and Ag nanoparticles, researchers recently introduced bimetallic Au@Ag core shelled nanoparticles with promising performances (Ritota and Manzi 2018; Wang et al. 2018). However, only limited studies are available using similar nanopar- ticles for detecting contaminants in milk, including amitraz pesticide (Li et al. 2018), chloramphenicol antibiotics (Gao et al. 2014), dicyandiamide con- taminant (Lin et al. 2015) and penicilloic acid veter- inary drug (Qi et al. 2016). In using SERS, overlapping of Raman bands and uncontrolled matrix variance often occurs, and thus solutions for the separation of desired spectra from unwanted bands are needed. Chemometric meth- ods including variable selection, discrimination and calibration are the commonly used techniques in the above studies."

Adulteration of milk with inexpensive and hazardous substances is a common problem in many parts of the world, and this technique provides a potentially more efficient and less expensive method of detecting these substances. The paper discusses the various methods that have been used to detect adulteration in milk, including computer vision, spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging. It then goes on to explain how SERS with the coffee ring effect was employed to detect urea and AmS in milk samples, and the results that were achieved. The authors suggest that this technique has the potential to be further exploited for detecting other banned and hazardous adulterants in milk and milk products."
