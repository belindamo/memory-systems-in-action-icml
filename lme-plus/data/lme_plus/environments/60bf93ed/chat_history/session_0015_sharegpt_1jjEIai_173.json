      "content": "The forest moon of Kodia III, with its humid subtropical climate and boreal/temperate rainforest characteristics, experiences frequent rainfall. This creates an environment where warm and comforting meals like soups are particularly appealing.\n\nIn such a climate, soups can provide not only the necessary nutrients but also warmth and comfort during the cooler and wetter periods. The variety of ingredients that can be used in soups, such as local vegetables, fruits, and proteins, allows for a diverse range of flavors and options that cater to different tastes and preferences.\n\nAs a result, soups become a staple in the diet of the rangers, scientists, and other inhabitants of the Kodia III colony. The MORK Relief Soup, in particular, serves as a versatile and nourishing option that is well-suited to the conditions on Kodia III. Its popularity among the rangers and scientists only grows as they continue to work in the challenging and often wet environments of the frontier."
