  "content": "I think those measures are a good start, but I still have some concerns. I understand the need for antitrust reform, but I worry that breaking up companies like Amazon or Google could have unintended consequences that might not be immediately apparent. For example, how would the breakup of these companies affect their ability to invest in research and development, which has driven innovation in these industries? Wouldn't smaller companies struggle to replicate the same level of investment and innovation?\n\nAdditionally, I'm not convinced that regulatory agencies have the capacity or resources to effectively monitor and enforce the breakup process, especially given the complexity of these companies and their operations. How would Warren's plan address these concerns, and what assurances are there that the breakup would lead to more competition and innovation, rather than just creating a power vacuum that other companies might fill?",
