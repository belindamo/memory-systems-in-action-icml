  "content": "Kenya's economy has been heavily impacted by the recent drought and climate change. The agricultural sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP and employs a large number of Kenyans, has been hit hard. Crops have failed, livestock have died, and many farmers have been forced to sell their assets to stay afloat.\n\nThe drought has also affected hydroelectric power generation, which accounts for a significant portion of Kenya's energy supply. Water levels in the country's dams have plummeted, reducing power output and forcing the government to rely on expensive and environmentally unfriendly thermal power plants.\n\nClimate change has contributed to the drought and other extreme weather events in Kenya. The country has experienced longer and more intense dry seasons, shorter and less predictable rainy seasons, and increased temperatures. These changes have had a negative impact on agriculture, energy production, tourism, and other sectors of the economy.\n\nOverall, the drought and climate change have slowed economic growth in Kenya, increased poverty and food insecurity, and put a strain on the country's resources and infrastructure.",
