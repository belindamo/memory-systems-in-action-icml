  "content": "Easter Sunday is a moveable feast, which means its date varies from year to year. In 2022, Easter Sunday fell on April 17th. If you're trying to keep track of events around that time, you might find it helpful to know that Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday following the full moon that occurs on or after the vernal equinox (the first day of spring) in the Northern Hemisphere. This is why the date of Easter can fall anywhere between March 22nd and April 25th.\n\nIf you need help with tracking events or dates, I'd be happy to assist you with that as well!",
