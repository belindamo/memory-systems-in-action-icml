Here are a few suggestions to help you make the most of your morning routine and train time:\n\n1. **Prepare your breakfast the night before**: Instead of making your breakfast in the morning, try preparing it the night before. You can slice the avocado, toast the bread, and even brew a thermos of coffee to grab-and-go in the morning. This will save you around 15-20 minutes in the morning.\n2. **Get ready in stages**: Break down your morning routine into smaller tasks and do them in stages. For example, you could lay out your clothes and prep your bag the night before, and then focus on getting dressed and doing your hair/makeup in the morning. This will help you avoid feeling rushed and make the most of your time.\n3. **Use your train time wisely**: Since you have a consistent 7:15 AM train, you can use this time to do something productive. You could:\n\t* Catch up on news or podcasts: Download episodes or articles to read during your commute.\n\t* Plan out your day: Review your schedule, make a to-do list, and prioritize your tasks.\n\t* Learn something new: Listen to audiobooks, language lessons, or online courses.\n\t* Relax and unwind: Meditate, listen to calming music, or simply enjoy the quiet time to yourself.\n4. **Consider a 'train-friendly' breakfast**: Since you'll be eating on-the-go, think about breakfast options that are easy to eat on the train, like energy bars, fruit, or sandwiches. You could also try making overnight oats or muffins the night before to grab on your way out.\n5. **Leave a little buffer time**: With the occasional train delay, it's a good idea to leave a 10-15 minute buffer between when you're ready to leave the house and when the train arrives. This will give you time to grab your coffee, double-check your bag, and get to the platform without feeling rushed.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, you should be able to optimize your morning routine and make the most of your time on the train.\n\nHow do these ideas sound? Are there any specific areas you'd like to focus on or any other challenges you're facing in your morning routine?",
