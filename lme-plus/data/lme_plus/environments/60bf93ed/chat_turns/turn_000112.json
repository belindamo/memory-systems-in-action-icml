Speaking of cleaning, I've been meaning to organize my digital life, and I spent a few hours on February 5th organizing my computer files and folders. I created a new folder structure and moved all my work documents to the cloud, which has freed up a lot of space on my hard drive. I also unsubscribed from a bunch of newsletters and promotional emails that were cluttering up my inbox. Do you have any tips on how to maintain my digital organization and keep my files and emails organized going forward?",
