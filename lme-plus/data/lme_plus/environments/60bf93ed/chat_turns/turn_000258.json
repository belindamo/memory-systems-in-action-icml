  "content": "I've been thinking about all these graduations I've attended recently, including my niece's high school graduation ceremony last month on June 15th. It got me thinking about how proud I was of her and how fast time flies. Anyway, getting back to my own education, I'm curious about online courses that can help me prepare for data science certifications. Can you recommend some resources that can help me assess my current skills and identify areas for improvement?",
