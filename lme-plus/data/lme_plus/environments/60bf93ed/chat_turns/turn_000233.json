For example, a friend of mine once visited Iceland and brought back a small glass jar filled with black sand from one of the country's famous beaches. Another person I know bought a pottery urn in Mexico that was shaped like a skull and decorated with colorful patterns. I've also heard of people buying taxidermied animals or preserved insects as souvenirs from remote locations. These types of souvenirs may be considered unusual or unexpected because they're not the typical t-shirts, magnets, or keychains that are commonly sold in tourist shops.",
