  "content": "Roasted vegetables are a fantastic way to complement the bright, citrusy flavors of the Lemon Garlic Chicken Breast. Here are some vegetable options that would pair beautifully with this dish:\n\n1. **Asparagus:** A natural pairing with lemon, asparagus is a great choice. Simply toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven until tender.\n2. **Brussels Sprouts:** Cut Brussels sprouts in half and toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast in the oven until caramelized and tender. The bitterness of the sprouts will balance out the brightness of the lemon.\n3. **Carrots:** Sliced or chopped carrots roasted with olive oil, cumin, and a pinch of salt will bring a sweet and earthy contrast to the dish.\n4. **Broccoli:** Like asparagus, broccoli loves lemon! Toss broccoli florets with olive oil, minced garlic, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Roast until tender and slightly caramelized.\n5. **Zucchini and Yellow Squash:** Thinly slice or spiralize these summer squashes and toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast in the oven until tender and lightly browned. The mild flavor of these squashes won't overpower the chicken.\n6. **Red Bell Peppers:** Sweet and slightly smoky, roasted red bell peppers pair beautifully with the bright flavors of lemon and garlic. Simply slice the peppers, toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast until tender.\n7. **Green Beans:** Blanched green beans tossed with olive oil, minced garlic, and a squeeze of lemon juice make a quick and easy side dish that complements the chicken nicely.\n\nWhen roasting vegetables, remember to:\n\n* Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper to bring out their natural flavors.\n* Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and lightly caramelized.\n* Adjust cooking time based on the vegetable's density and your desired level of doneness.\n\nThese vegetables will not only add color and texture to your plate but also enhance the flavors of the Lemon Garlic Chicken Breast. Enjoy!",
