Before reaching out to their customer support, let's go through some steps to see if we can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check your notification settings**: Ensure that notifications are enabled for your Ring doorbell camera in the Ring app. Go to the app, tap on the three horizontal lines () on the top left, then tap on \"Devices\" and select your doorbell camera. Tap on \"Motion Settings\" and make sure \"Notifications\" are turned on.\n2. **Verify your Wi-Fi connection**: As you've recently upgraded your router, ensure that your Ring doorbell camera is connected to the same network. Restart your router and the doorbell camera to refresh the connection.\n3. **Check the doorbell camera's battery level**: If your Ring doorbell camera is battery-powered, check the battery level. A low battery might prevent it from sending notifications. Charge the battery or replace it if necessary.\n4. **Motion detection settings**: Adjust the motion detection settings to ensure they're not too sensitive or too insensitive. You can do this in the Ring app under \"Motion Settings.\" Try setting it to \"Standard\" or \"High\" sensitivity to see if that resolves the issue.\n5. **App notifications**: Check your phone's notification settings to ensure that the Ring app is allowed to send notifications. On Android, go to Settings > Apps > Ring > Notifications, and on iOS, go to Settings > Notifications > Ring.\n6. **Doorbell camera's firmware**: Ensure your doorbell camera's firmware is up-to-date. Open the Ring app, go to \"Devices,\" select your doorbell camera, and check for any firmware updates.\n7. **Physical installation**: Verify that the doorbell camera is installed correctly and at the recommended height (about 4 feet off the ground). Make sure it's not obstructed by any objects or vegetation.\n8. **Reset the doorbell camera**: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, try resetting the doorbell camera. Press and hold the orange button on the back of the device for 20 seconds. This will restore it to its factory settings. Then, set it up again using the Ring app.\n\nIf none of these troubleshooting steps resolve the issue, it's likely a problem with the doorbell camera or your account. You can contact Ring's customer support for further assistance. They may be able to help you diagnose the problem or replace the device if it's defective.\n\nGlad to hear that your new Wi-Fi router has improved your online gaming experience, by the way!",
