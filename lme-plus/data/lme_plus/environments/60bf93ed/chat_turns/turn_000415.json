  "content": "This is a research paper that explores the use of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to detect urea and ammonium sulfate (AmS) in milk with the coffee ring effect. Adulteration of milk with inexpensive and hazardous substances is a common problem in many parts of the world, and this technique provides a potentially more efficient and less expensive method of detecting these substances. The paper discusses the various methods that have been used to detect adulteration in milk, including computer vision, spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging. It then goes on to explain how SERS with the coffee ring effect was employed to detect urea and AmS in milk samples, and the results that were achieved. The authors suggest that this technique has the potential to be further exploited for detecting other banned and hazardous adulterants in milk and milk products.",
