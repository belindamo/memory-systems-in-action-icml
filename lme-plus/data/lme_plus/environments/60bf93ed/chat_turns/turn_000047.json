  "content": "Hadrian's Wall was approximately 3.7 meters (12 feet) tall. The wall was constructed using a variety of materials including stone, turf, and wood. The wall was primarily made of stone, which was quarried locally and laid in a regular pattern using mortar. The wall was built with a wide base and tapered towards the top to provide stability and prevent it from collapsing under its own weight. The wall also had several defensive features including milecastles, turrets, and a ditch on the northern side.",
