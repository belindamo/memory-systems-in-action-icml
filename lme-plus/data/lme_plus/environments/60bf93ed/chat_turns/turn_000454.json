I've really enjoyed it so far, and I feel like I've improved a lot, especially with my footwork. Anyway, thanks for the tips! I'll definitely try to incorporate them into my practice routine. Do you have any recommendations for dance-inspired fashion or dancewear? I've been looking for some new outfits to wear to class.",
