However, as a general guideline, I'd recommend looking for places within a 10-20 minute drive from the beach. This distance usually offers a good balance between convenience and affordability.\n\nWithin a 10-15 minute drive, you'll likely find a range of accommodations, from apartments to houses, that offer more space and amenities at a lower cost than beachfront properties. You'll still be close enough to the beach to visit daily, but you'll also have the flexibility to explore other areas and beaches without feeling too far away.\n\nHere are some tips to consider when searching for accommodations within a 10-15 minute drive from the beach:\n\n1. **Check the route**: Make sure the driving route to the beach is straightforward and doesn't involve too much traffic or construction.\n2. **Look for amenities**: Consider accommodations that offer amenities like pools, BBQ areas, or game rooms to keep everyone entertained on days when you're not at the beach.\n3. **Research neighborhoods**: Read reviews and research the neighborhood to ensure it's safe, quiet, and suitable for your family's needs.\n4. **Check public transportation**: If you don't plan to rent a car, look into public transportation options from your accommodation to the beach.\n5. **Be flexible**: Be open to different types of accommodations, such as apartments, houses, or condos, to find the best fit for your family's needs and budget.\n\nBy staying a bit further away from the beach, you'll have more options to choose from, and you can find a great balance between convenience, affordability, and space. Happy searching!",
