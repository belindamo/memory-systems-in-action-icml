  "content": "If I were going to create a new classic style beat-em-up side scrolling fighting game called \"Save Grandma!\", I would design it with the following features:\n\n* The game would feature a single player mode, where the protagonist must fight through hordes of zombies to reach and save their grandmother.\n* The levels would feature a variety of environments, such as city streets, parks, and suburban neighborhoods, each with their own set of zombies and bosses to fight.\n* The game would have a variety of weapons, such as baseball bats, crowbars, and chainsaws, that the player can use to fight the zombies.\n* The game would also have a variety of special moves and combos that the player can use to deal extra damage to the zombies.\n\nIf the game was to have an endless mode with an infinite number of levels I would make sure that the levels are procedurally generated, this way the experience is different for every player and keeps the gameplay fresh.\n\nFor survival mode, I would make sure there is a well-designed scoring system, leaderboard and different rewards for different milestones.\n\nAs for the game engine, I would likely use Unity as it is a popular and widely-used game engine that allows for 2D and 3D game development, and has a large community of developers who can provide support and assets.\n\nI would launch the game on multiple platforms such as Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and consoles like Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nIn terms of monetization, I would consider a few options such as releasing the game as a paid game with no in-app purchases, or releasing it as a free-to-play game with in-app purchases for additional weapons, levels, and other game content. Another option could be making it subscription based.",
