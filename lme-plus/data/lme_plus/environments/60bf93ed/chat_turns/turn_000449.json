Since I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to specific studios in your city, but I can suggest some popular dance styles and studios that might offer classes in those styles:\n\n1. **Hip-Hop/Rap**:\n\t* Look for studios that offer classes in Hip-Hop, Breakdancing, or Street Jazz. Some popular studios might be affiliated with dance crews or companies like Monsters of Dance or Millennium Dance Complex.\n2. **Contemporary/Lyrical**:\n\t* Studios that focus on Contemporary, Lyrical, or Modern dance might offer classes that blend elements of ballet, jazz, and modern techniques. Look for studios with experienced instructors who have a background in contemporary dance.\n3. **Ballet**:\n\t* If you're interested in exploring classical dance, look for studios that offer Ballet classes for adults. Many studios offer beginner classes, and some might even have classes specifically designed for those with no prior experience.\n4. **Afrobeats**:\n\t* Afrobeats is a high-energy style that combines elements of African, Caribbean, and Latin rhythms. Studios that offer Afrobeats classes might also offer other styles like Dancehall or Afro-Caribbean.\n5. **K-Pop**:\n\t* K-Pop dance classes are becoming increasingly popular, and many studios now offer classes in this style. Look for studios with instructors who have experience teaching K-Pop choreography.\n\nTo find dance studios in your area, you can try the following:\n\n1. Online search: Type in \"dance studios near me\" or \"dance classes in [your city]\" to find studios in your area.\n2. Social media: Look for dance studios on social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook, where they often post updates, promotions, and class schedules.\n3. Dance community forums: Join online forums or groups dedicated to dance enthusiasts in your city, and ask for recommendations on studios and classes.\n4. Word of mouth: Ask friends, coworkers, or fellow dancers for recommendations on studios they've attended.\n\nRemember to research the studio, read reviews, and observe a class before committing to a particular style or studio. This will give you a better sense of the studio's atmosphere, teaching style, and level of instruction.",
