  "content": "Elizabeth Warren's campaign is built around a strong focus on economic populism and anti-corruption measures, which resonates with many voters who feel the system is rigged against them. Here's a breakdown of her key proposals:\n\n**Economic Populism:**\n\n1. **Wealth Tax:** Warren proposes a 2% annual tax on households with a net worth above $50 million and a 3% tax on those above $1 billion. This would raise an estimated $2.75 trillion over 10 years, which she'd use to fund various social programs.\n2. **Minimum Wage and Workers' Rights:** Warren wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, index it to inflation, and make it easier for workers to form unions and bargain collectively.\n3. **Antitrust Reform:** She aims to break up giant corporations, like tech giants and pharmaceutical companies, to promote competition and prevent monopolies.\n4. **Student Loan Debt Relief:** Warren proposes forgiving up to $50,000 in student loan debt for households earning less than $100,000 per year, and making public colleges and universities tuition-free.\n5. **Green New Deal:** Warren's climate plan includes a $3 trillion investment in clean energy, green infrastructure, and jobs, with a focus on environmental justice and community development.\n\n**Anti-Corruption Measures:**\n\n1. **Anti-Corruption Agency:** Warren wants to create a new, independent agency to investigate and prosecute corruption cases, including those involving elected officials and corporate executives.\n2. **Campaign Finance Reform:** She proposes banning corporate PAC money, increasing transparency in political spending, and implementing a small-donor matching system to empower individual contributors.\n3. **Lobbying Reform:** Warren aims to restrict lobbying by former government officials, increase transparency in lobbying activities, and ban lobbyists from serving on government advisory committees.\n4. **Executive Branch Accountability:** She wants to strengthen ethics rules for the executive branch, including the President, Vice President, and their families, to prevent conflicts of interest and self-dealing.\n5. **Supreme Court Reform:** Warren proposes reforming the Supreme Court, including adding more justices and imposing term limits, to reduce the influence of special interests and promote a more balanced judiciary.\n\nWarren's campaign is built around the idea that the system is rigged against ordinary Americans and that she's the candidate who can take on the powerful interests and restore fairness and accountability to government. Her proposals are often detailed and wonky, which has earned her a reputation as a policy expert.\n\nWhat do you think about Warren's economic populism and anti-corruption measures? Do you have any specific questions about her proposals or concerns about their feasibility?",
