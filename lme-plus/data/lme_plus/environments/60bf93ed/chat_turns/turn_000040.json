Okay, so I've got the Buddhist meditation session on May 20th, and I've also been attending the Tuesday morning prayer group at my church. I'd like to keep attending that. I'm also planning to join the choir rehearsals on Thursday evenings, so I'd like to make sure I have time for that. Oh, and I remember I met with the outreach committee last Sunday to discuss plans for our upcoming community service project, so I'll need to follow up on that soon.",
