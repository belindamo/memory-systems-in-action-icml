  "content": "I think I know the documentary you might be referring to! There have been a few popular ones on Netflix, but I'm guessing it might be \"What the Health\" or \"Forks Over Knives\"? Both of those documentaries do an excellent job of highlighting the environmental, health, and animal welfare impacts of the animal agriculture industry.\n\nIt's amazing that you were inspired to make a change and try a vegetarian diet! Even reducing meat consumption by a few days a week can make a significant positive impact on the environment. And it's great that you're experiencing the benefits firsthand by noticing how you feel.\n\nA month is a great amount of time to test the waters and see how a plant-based diet works for you. You might find that you have more energy, your digestion improves, or you simply feel more connected to the food you're eating.\n\nWhat have you noticed so far in terms of how you're feeling? Have you encountered any challenges or surprises along the way?\n\nAlso, have you explored different types of plant-based diets, such as veganism, flexitarianism, or reducetarianism? Or are you taking a more casual approach and just focusing on incorporating more plants into your meals?",
