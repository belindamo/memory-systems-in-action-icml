  "content": "A beach house trip sounds like a wonderful idea!\n\nTo avoid crowds and enjoy decent weather, I'd recommend considering the following dates for your trip:\n\n1. **Early June**: The weather is usually mild and sunny, and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak summer months of July and August. You might even get a better deal on accommodations and activities.\n2. **Mid-week in July or August**: If you can't avoid the peak season, try planning your trip during the week (Monday to Thursday) instead of weekends, when locals and tourists often take day trips or short breaks. The weather is usually warm and sunny, but you'll encounter smaller crowds.\n3. **Late August or early September**: As the summer season winds down, the crowds dissipate, and the weather is still warm and pleasant. You might even catch some end-of-summer deals on accommodations and activities.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general recommendations and can vary depending on the specific beach house location and local events.\n\nAs for your Sunday lunch conversation with your parents, it sounds like you're already getting a head start on planning your summer! Did you discuss any specific activities or excursions you'd like to do during your beach trip?\n\nFeel free to share more about your plans, and I'd be happy to help with any further recommendations or suggestions!",
