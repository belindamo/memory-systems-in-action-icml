Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Practicing with a mirror:**\n\n1. **Technique correction**: A mirror allows you to see yourself and correct your posture, alignment, and movement. You can check your footwork, arm placement, and body positioning.\n2. **Visual feedback**: You can observe your own movements and make adjustments in real-time.\n3. **Improved self-awareness**: Mirrors help you develop a better sense of your body's position in space and how you're executing moves.\n\n**Practicing without a mirror:**\n\n1. **Internalization of movements**: Without visual feedback, you'll focus more on the sensations in your body and the music, which can help you internalize the movements and develop muscle memory.\n2. **Improved proprioception**: Your body becomes more attuned to its own movements, which can enhance your overall coordination and balance.\n3. **Reduced self-consciousness**: You might feel more comfortable and less self-critical without a mirror, allowing you to focus on the movement rather than your appearance.\n\n**Ultimate tip:** Consider practicing with a mirror initially to develop good technique and correct any major issues. Once you feel comfortable with the basics, practice without a mirror to focus on internalizing the movements and developing your proprioception.\n\nFor salsa specifically, practicing with a mirror can be helpful for:\n\n* Checking your footwork and timing\n* Ensuring your hips and arms are moving in sync\n* Adjusting your posture and alignment\n\nHowever, don't rely solely on the mirror. Practice without one occasionally to develop your internal sense of movement and timing.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to practice regularly and have fun!",
