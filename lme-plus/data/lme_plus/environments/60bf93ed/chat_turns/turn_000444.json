I've also been meaning to try out some new spices and seasonings, so if you have any recommendations, I'd love to hear them!\n\nAnd yeah, I've been wanting to try out some new vegetables and ingredients. I've heard great things about Brussels sprouts and kale, so I might try roasting those next. Do you have any favorite ways of preparing those veggies?",
