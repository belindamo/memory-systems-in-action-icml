  "content": "I'm glad I could introduce you to a new term! Reducetarianism is a great approach for those who want to make a positive impact without feeling like they need to adopt a fully plant-based diet.\n\nIt sounds like you're taking a great approach by experimenting with new recipes and ingredients. Nutritional yeast and tahini are both amazing additions to a plant-based diet! Nutritional yeast has a cheesy, nutty flavor and is a great source of protein and B vitamins, while tahini is a tasty way to add healthy fats and creaminess to dishes.\n\nMeal prepping on Sundays is a fantastic idea, too! It can help you stay on track, save time during the week, and reduce food waste. What kinds of dishes have you been meal prepping? Are you finding that you're enjoying the process of cooking and preparing your meals?\n\nAlso, have you noticed any differences in your energy levels, digestion, or overall health since starting to eat more plants and reducing your meat intake?\n\n(By the way, if you're looking for more recipe inspiration, I'd be happy to share some ideas or resources!)",
