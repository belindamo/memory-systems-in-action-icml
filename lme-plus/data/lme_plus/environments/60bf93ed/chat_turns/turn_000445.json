  "content": "Simple is often the best way to go when it comes to seasoning roasted vegetables! Olive oil, salt, and pepper are a classic combination that lets the natural flavors of the veggies shine through. Garlic powder and paprika are great additions, too - they add a nice depth of flavor without overpowering the dish.\n\nIf you're looking to try out some new spices and seasonings, I'd recommend exploring the world of Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine. They have some amazing blends that can add incredible flavor to your roasted veggies. Some options to consider:\n\n* Garam masala: A warm, aromatic spice blend that pairs well with sweet potatoes and cauliflower.\n* Cumin: Adds a nice earthy flavor to broccoli and Brussels sprouts.\n* Sumac: A Middle Eastern staple that adds a tangy, slightly sour flavor to veggies like cauliflower and kale.\n* Berbere: A spicy Ethiopian blend that's amazing on sweet potatoes and carrots.\n\nAs for Brussels sprouts and kale, they're both amazing choices! Here are some tips for preparing them:\n\n* Brussels sprouts: Cut them in half or quarter them, depending on their size. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until caramelized and tender. You can also add some balsamic vinegar or maple syrup towards the end of roasting for a sweet and tangy glaze.\n* Kale: Massage kale leaves with olive oil, salt, and pepper to help soften them. Then, roast at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until crispy and slightly caramelized. You can also add some lemon juice or garlic powder for extra flavor.\n\nSome other veggies you might want to consider trying:\n\n* Carrots: Sweet and crunchy, carrots are amazing roasted with some cumin and coriander.\n* Parsnips: Similar to carrots, but with a nuttier flavor. Try roasting them with some honey and thyme.\n* Delicata squash: A type of winter squash that's easy to roast and adds a nice sweetness to dishes.\n\nFeel free to experiment and find your own favorite combinations!",
