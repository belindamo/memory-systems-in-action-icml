  "content": "Horizontal analysis compares financial statements over consecutive periods to identify changes in financial performance. It involves comparing line items from the current period with those from the previous period and expressing the change as a percentage. This method helps to identify trends in the company's financial performance over time.\n\nVertical analysis, on the other hand, compares each line item of the financial statements with the base item which is the total revenue for the income statement and total assets for the balance sheet. By expressing each line item as a percentage of the base item, vertical analysis makes it easy to compare each line item to the company's overall financial performance. It provides a deeper understanding of the relative importance of different elements of the financial statement. \n\nIn summary, horizontal analysis evaluates changes over time, whereas vertical analysis assesses the relative significance of each element within the financial statement.",
