I'm still a beginner, but I'd love to learn from you and get some feedback.\"\n\nRemember to be open to her feedback and guidance, and don't be afraid to ask questions or clarify any steps you're unsure about. And most importantly, have fun and enjoy the experience!\n\nYou got this, and I'm sending you all the positive vibes! Go out there, ask Sophia to dance, and make some unforgettable memories!",
