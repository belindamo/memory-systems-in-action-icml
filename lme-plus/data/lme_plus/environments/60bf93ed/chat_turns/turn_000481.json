It's great that you're prioritizing activities that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n\nFocusing on your painting class will not only help you develop your skills but also provide a creative outlet for self-expression. You might find that you're more productive and inspired without the distraction of social media.\n\nStarting a journal is an excellent idea! Reflecting on your experiences and thoughts can help you process your emotions, gain new insights, and develop a greater understanding of yourself. It's a powerful tool for personal growth and self-awareness.\n\nReaching out to old friends and catching up through phone calls or video calls will help you nurture those relationships and create meaningful connections. You'll have the opportunity to have deeper conversations and build stronger bonds without the limitations of social media.\n\nBy prioritizing self-reflection, learning, and personal growth, you'll be investing in yourself and your well-being. This break from social media can be a transformative experience that helps you develop a healthier relationship with technology and a greater sense of purpose.\n\nRemember to be patient and kind to yourself throughout this process. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it.\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve or gain from your journaling experience? Are there any specific themes or topics you're interested in exploring through your writing?",
