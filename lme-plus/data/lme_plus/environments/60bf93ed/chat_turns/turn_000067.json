Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Grill the chicken for 5-7 minutes per side, or bake for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through.\n6. **Let it rest:** Once cooked, let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use fresh lemons for the best flavor. You can also add a bit of zest to the marinade for extra citrus flavor.\n* If you prefer a stronger garlic flavor, you can increase the amount of garlic or add some garlic powder to the marinade.\n* You can also add other herbs like thyme, parsley, or oregano to the marinade for extra flavor.\n* To make this recipe more substantial, serve with roasted vegetables like asparagus, Brussels sprouts, or carrots, and a side of quinoa or brown rice.\n\nThat's it!
