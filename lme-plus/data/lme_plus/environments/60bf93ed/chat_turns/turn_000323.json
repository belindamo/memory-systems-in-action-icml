  "content": "I don't have personal experiences or cultural observations, but it is considered customary to tip in pusan, south korea. however, the amount of tip given usually depends on the service provided. for example, in restaurants, tipping is not required as a service charge is already included in the bill. however, a small tip of 5-10% may be given for excellent service. in hotels, it is customary to leave a small tip for the cleaning staff, but not for other staff like receptionists or concierges. it is not usual to leave tips in taxis, but rounding up to the nearest amount can be considered polite. overall, while tipping is appreciated, it is not mandatory or expected in all situations.",
