  "content": "The exact duration it took to build Hadrian's Wall is not known, but historians estimate that it took around six years to construct from 122-128 AD. Keep in mind that the construction of the wall was not a continuous process, it was done in phases, with different sections of the wall being built at different times. The construction was done by a mix of Roman soldiers and local laborers, using primitive tools and techniques. Despite the challenges faced during the construction, the wall would remain an impressive feat of engineering for centuries to come.",
