She learns to prioritize relationships and understand the importance of emotional connection and mutual respect.\n\nThrough these experiences, Cora transforms from a self-centered and entitled young woman to a more empathetic, self-aware, and independent individual. She learns to appreciate the value of hard work, loyalty, and genuine relationships, and begins to forge her own path in life.\n\nDaisy Goodwin's portrayal of Cora's growth is nuanced and realistic, and it's a joy to watch her evolve throughout the novel. Cora's character development is a testament to the power of self-reflection, personal growth, and the importance of embracing challenges and uncertainty."
