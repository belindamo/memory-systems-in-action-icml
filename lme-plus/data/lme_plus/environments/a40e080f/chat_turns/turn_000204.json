At the beginning of the novel, Cora is portrayed as a beautiful, spoiled, and entitled young woman who has always gotten what she wants. She's been raised to believe that her beauty and wealth are the keys to a successful life, and she's never had to work hard for anything.\n\nHowever, as she navigates the complexities of English society and her relationships with the aristocracy, Cora begins to realize that her privileged upbringing has not prepared her for the realities of life. She faces challenges and setbacks that force her to re-evaluate her values and goals.\n\nThroughout the novel, Cora undergoes significant growth and development as she:\n\n1. **Learns to navigate the complexities of English society**: Cora must adapt to a new set of social rules and expectations, which can be overwhelming and confusing.

She discovers her own interests, skills, and passions, and begins to assert her independence and autonomy.\n4. **Confronts the limitations of her privileged upbringing**: Cora's experiences in England force her to confront the reality that her wealth and social status don't guarantee happiness or fulfillment. She begins to question the values and expectations that have been imposed upon her.\n5. **Falls in love and learns to prioritize relationships**: Cora's romance with Ivo, the Duke of Wareham, is a pivotal aspect of her growth. She learns to prioritize relationships and understand the importance of emotional connection and mutual respect.\n\nThrough these experiences, Cora transforms from a self-centered and entitled young woman to a more empathetic, self-aware, and independent individual. She learns to appreciate the value of hard work, loyalty, and genuine relationships, and begins to forge her own path in life.\n\nDaisy Goodwin's portrayal of Cora's growth is nuanced and realistic, and it's a joy to watch her evolve throughout the novel.
