However, it is crucial for the government to implement regulations that ensure the safety of the public and security personnel while also allowing for peaceful demonstrations and speeches.\n\nStricter regulations might prevent chaos from unfolding, but authorities must be cautious in their implementation to avoid infringing on the rights of individuals still, exercising their free speech rights.\n\nInstead, the Government can utilize advanced technology tools such as facial recognition technology, artificial intelligence algorithms, and other technological advancements that can help to detect and analyze activities that may pose a threat to public safety. However, the implementation of technology should be balanced with civil liberties, privacy, and transparency considerations.\n\nMoreover, the government can work with organizers and protest groups to establish ground rules and ensure that they are followed, and provide training to both law enforcement and protesters to minimize the risk of violence and chaos. By taking these measures, National Conventions can be held safely and effectively, with respect for the rights and safety of all involved.",
