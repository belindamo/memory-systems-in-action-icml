As a large language model, I don't have the ability to retain information about our previous conversations or know your personal experiences. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation.\n\nI also want to clarify that there is no Coastal Cove State Park. It's possible that you might be thinking of a different park or location.\n\nIf you could provide me with more information about the park you visited, such as its location (city, state, or region), I might be able to help you identify it. Alternatively, you can also try searching online for \"state parks near me\" or \"coastal state parks in [your state]\" to find a list of parks that might match what you're looking for.\n\nAs for your binoculars, I'm happy to provide you with recommendations or advice on how to choose the right pair for birding. However, I won't be able to recall your birthday or any personal information about you.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!",
