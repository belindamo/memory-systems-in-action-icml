  "content": "Here is a possible user journey for a Gen Y group looking to buy a house:\n\n1. Research: The group begins by researching the housing market online, looking at different neighborhoods and types of homes. They may use online platforms and tools to compare prices, view virtual tours, and read reviews from other buyers.\n2. Pre-approval: Next, the group applies for pre-approval for a mortgage. They may also begin to research different types of mortgages and compare rates.\n3. Viewing homes: Once pre-approved, the group begins viewing homes in person. They may prioritize walkability, access to amenities, and location when viewing homes. They may also consider alternative forms of homeownership, such as co-living or community land trusts.\n4. Decision making: After viewing several homes, the group narrows down their options and begins making a decision. They may consult with a real estate agent or attorney for advice.\n5. Closing: Once a decision is made, the group begins the process of closing on the home. This may involve finalizing a mortgage, completing inspections and paperwork, and transferring ownership of the property.\n6. Moving: Finally, the group moves into their new home and begins to make it their own.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is a possible user journey and that the experience may vary depending on individual circumstances.",
