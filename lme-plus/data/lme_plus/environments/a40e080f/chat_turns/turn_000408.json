It's a separately ticketed event that takes place on select nights in September and October at Disneyland Park. The event typically runs from 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM, and it's a fantastic time to visit the park if you love Halloween and Disney magic.\n\nHere are some of the things you can expect during Mickey's Halloween Party:\n\n1. **Decorations:** The entire park is transformed with spooky-ooky decorations, including jack-o'-lanterns, cobwebs, and themed lighting. Fantasyland, in particular, is decorated with a whimsical Halloween overlay, featuring giant pumpkins, ghostly projections, and more.\n2. **Costume Contests:** Guests of all ages are encouraged to dress up in their favorite Halloween costumes. There are even costume contests for kids and adults, with prizes for the best costumes in various categories.\n3. **Trick-or-Treating:** Throughout the park, you'll find trick-or-treat stations where kids (and kids-at-heart) can collect candy and other treats. You can also purchase a special trick-or-treat bag or use your own.\n4. **Exclusive Entertainment:** MHP offers unique entertainment options, such as the \"Frightfully Fun Parade\" featuring Disney characters in Halloween costumes, \"Mickey's Trick & Treat\" stage show, and \"Cadaver Dans\" performances.\n5. **Special Food and Beverages:** Disneyland offers seasonal treats and drinks during MHP, like pumpkin beignets, candy corn ice cream, and \"Witch's Brew\" punch. You can also enjoy specialty menu items at select restaurants.\n6. **Character Meet and Greets:** Meet your favorite Disney characters in their Halloween costumes, including Jack Skellington, Sally, and other beloved characters from The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n7. **Ride Overlays:** Some attractions receive special Halloween-themed overlays, like the \"Haunted Mansion Holiday\" and \"Guardians of the Galaxy - Monsters After Dark.\"\n8. **Photopass Opportunities:** Take advantage of special Halloween-themed backdrops and props for some spook-tacular photos with your friends and family.\n\nIf you're planning to attend Mickey's Halloween Party again this year, I recommend checking the official Disneyland website for dates, ticket prices, and event details. It's usually a very popular event, so be sure to buy your tickets in advance to avoid sell-outs.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a howling good time at Mickey's Halloween Party this year!",
