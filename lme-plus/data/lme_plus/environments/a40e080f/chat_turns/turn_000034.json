The payment structure is designed to help your family meet their basic needs during the initial settlement period. Here's how it typically works:\n\n**Monthly Allowance**: The RAP payment is divided into a monthly allowance, which is based on the size of your family and their specific needs. The monthly allowance is intended to cover essential expenses, such as:\n\n1. Rent and utilities\n2. Food and groceries\n3. Clothing and personal care items\n4. Furniture and household goods\n5. Medical expenses (e.g., prescription medication, medical equipment)\n\n**Fixed Amount per Month**: The monthly allowance is a fixed amount, which is determined by the Service Provider Organization (SPO) based on the family's size and needs. The fixed amount is typically paid monthly, and the exact amount may vary depending on the SPO and the family's specific circumstances.\n\n**Example**: Let's say your family consists of four people (two adults and two children). The monthly allowance might be $1,500 per month for the first six months, and then $1,000 per month for the remaining six months. This would provide a total of $12,000 over the 12-month period.\n\n**Adjustments Based on Needs**: While the monthly allowance is fixed, the SPO may adjust the payment amount based on your family's changing needs. For example, if your family requires additional support for medical expenses or specialized services, the SPO may increase the monthly allowance accordingly.\n\n**Other Expenses Covered**: In addition to the monthly allowance, RAP may also cover other one-time expenses, such as:\n\n1. Start-up costs for furniture and household goods\n2. Security deposits for rent and utilities\n3. Medical expenses (e.g., dental care, glasses, or other essential medical services)\n\nThese one-time expenses are typically paid separately from the monthly allowance and are intended to help your family establish a stable foundation during the initial settlement period.\n\nKeep in mind that the RAP payment structure may vary depending on the SPO and the specific circumstances of your family. It's essential to work closely with your SPO to ensure that your family's needs are being met and to make the most of the RAP benefits.",
