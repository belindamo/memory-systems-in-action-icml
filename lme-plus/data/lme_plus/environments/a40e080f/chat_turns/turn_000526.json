It seems you may have been having conversations with colleagues or acquaintances who are native Spanish speakers.\n\nTo answer your question, I'd recommend prioritizing language exchange partners who are available for regular conversations. Consistency is key when it comes to language practice, and having regular conversations will help you maintain your momentum and improve your skills more quickly.\n\nWhile it's great that you're interested in practicing with native speakers from specific countries, availability and consistency are crucial factors to consider when looking for language exchange partners. You can always try to find partners from a mix of countries, but prioritize those who can commit to regular conversations.\n\nHere are some tips to find language exchange partners who are available for regular conversations:\n\n1. **Clearly state your goals and availability**: When searching for language exchange partners, make sure to specify your language learning goals, your current level, and your availability for conversations.\n2. **Look for partners with similar schedules**: Try to find partners who have a similar schedule to yours, so you can easily coordinate regular conversations.\n3. **Use time-zone friendly filters**: On language exchange platforms, use filters to find partners in time zones that are compatible with yours, making it easier to schedule conversations.\n4. **Communicate with potential partners**: Before committing to a language exchange, communicate with potential partners to discuss your goals, availability, and expectations.\n5. **Be flexible and open-minded**: Be willing to adjust your schedule or try out different conversation formats (e.g., voice, video, or text-based) to accommodate your language exchange partner's needs.\n\nBy prioritizing availability and consistency, you'll be more likely to find language exchange partners who can help you maintain your current level of practice and continue improving your Spanish skills.",
