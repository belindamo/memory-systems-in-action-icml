As I mentioned earlier, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to retain information about our previous conversations or know your personal experiences. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation.\n\nIf you could provide me with the name of the park or its location, I'd be happy to try and help you with information on its habitat and terrain. Alternatively, you can also try checking the park's website, visitor center, or park rangers for more information on the park's trails, habitat, and wildlife.\n\nRemember, I'm here to help with any general questions you may have about birding or wildlife, so feel free to ask!",
