  "content": "As Susan sat in her therapist's office, she couldn't help but feel anxious about the fate of the mirror. She had finally been able to let go of her obsession with the alternate future that it showed her, but she couldn't shake the feeling that it was out there, still wreaking havoc on someone else's life.\n\n\"So, Susan,\" her therapist began, \"it seems like you've made a lot of progress in accepting the loss of your son and moving forward.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" Susan replied. \"But I can't help but think about the mirror. I know I should just let it go, but I can't help but worry about who it might be affecting now.\"\n\nHer therapist nodded sympathetically. \"I understand your concern. But you have to trust that the mirror will find its way to where it needs to be, and that the person who inherits it will find a way to overcome its hold on them.\"\n\nSusan nodded, but she still felt uneasy. Little did she know that the mirror had already found its way to San Francisco, where it now sat in the house of her ex-husband's daughter, Katherine.\n\n\"Hey, Dad,\" Katherine said as she answered the phone. \"What's up?\"\n\n\"I need you to do me a favor,\" her father said. \"I have something that I need you to hold onto for a while.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Katherine replied cautiously. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"It's a mirror,\" her father explained. \"It belonged to your grandfather, and now I've inherited it. But I don't want it in my house. It's too painful of a reminder of your mother.\"\n\nKatherine sighed. She had heard about the mirror from her mother, and she knew that it had caused a lot of pain and suffering for her family. But she couldn't help feeling curious about it.\n\n\"Fine, I'll take it,\" she said. \"But I'm not making any promises about keeping it.\"\n\nAs Katherine hung up the phone, she couldn't help but wonder what kind of power the mirror held, and what kind of impact it would have on her life.",
