It seems like you might enjoy a mix of pop, indie, and alternative sounds.\n\nLet's break down each day of Lollapalooza to see which one might be the best fit for you:\n\n**Thursday, August 3**\n\n* Headliners: Billie Eilish, The 1975, and Lil Baby\n* Notable acts: Tove Lo, Banks, and Hayley Williams (of Paramore)\n* Genre focus: Pop, alternative, and indie\n\nThis day has a strong pop and indie presence, with Billie Eilish and The 1975 as headliners. If you enjoy their music, you might also like Tove Lo and Banks.\n\n**Friday, August 4**\n\n* Headliners: Paul McCartney, Tame Impala, and Aesop Rock\n* Notable acts: Charli XCX, Arlo Parks, and Rina Sawayama\n* Genre focus: Rock, indie, and electronic\n\nWhile Paul McCartney is a legend, this day might not be the best fit for you if you're looking for more contemporary pop sounds. However, Charli XCX and Arlo Parks might be up your alley.\n\n**Saturday, August 5**\n\n* Headliners: Kendrick Lamar, The Lumineers, and ODESZA\n* Notable acts: Kacey Musgraves, Wallows, and Remi Wolf\n* Genre focus: Hip-hop, indie-folk, and electronic\n\nThis day has a mix of genres, but Kendrick Lamar and ODESZA might not be your cup of tea.

Cole, and Phoebe Bridgers\n* Genre focus: Rock, pop, and hip-hop\n\nThis day has a more laid-back, pop-infused vibe, with Lana Del Rey and Phoebe Bridgers being notable acts. If you enjoy more mellow sounds, this might be the best day for you.\n\nBased on your interests, I think **Thursday, August 3** might be the best day for you. Billie Eilish and The 1975 are both popular acts that blend pop and alternative sounds, and the supporting acts like Tove Lo and Banks might also appeal to you.\n\nOf course, this is just a suggestion.
