Here is a continuation of the revised script, including Justine's monologue in her dream:\n\n---\n\n[Justine goes home and goes to sleep]\n\n[Justine dreams]\n\n10:30 [Justine's dream]: Wow, this is amazing! I'm flying through space on my very own spaceship. The stars are so bright and beautiful.\n\n10:33 [Justine's dream]: I can't believe I'm actually going to the moon. I've always dreamed of being an astronaut, and now it's finally happening.\n\n10:36 [Justine's dream]: I wonder what the moon is like. I've heard it's made of cheese, but I'm not sure if that's true. Maybe it's just a big ball of rocks.\n\n10:39 [Justine's dream]: Either way, I can't wait to land and explore. I bet there are all sorts of amazing things to discover.\n\n10:42 [Justine's dream]: I hope I remember to bring my trampoline. That would be so much fun to bounce around on the moon.\n\n10:45 [Justine's dream]: Wait a minute... didn't SuperCollab 9000 say something about the moon not being suitable for trampolines?\n\n10:48 [Justine's dream]: Oh well, I'm sure it'll be fine. After all, it's just a dream. Anything is possible.\n\n10:51 [Justine's dream]: I'm sure the moon will be filled with all sorts of wonders and surprises. I can't wait to see what I'll find.\n\n[Justine wakes up]\n\n---\n\nIn Justine's dream, her childish ideas about space and the moon are brought to life in a fantastical world where anything is possible. However, even in her dream, her misconceptions are challenged by the knowledge and guidance provided by SuperCollab 9000.",
