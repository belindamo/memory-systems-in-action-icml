However, I need to clarify again that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to retain information about our previous conversations or know your personal experiences. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation.\n\nRegarding your question, I can provide you with general information about spotting ospreys and bald eagles. Both species can be found in coastal areas, and the best times to spot them vary depending on the location and time of year.\n\nOspreys typically breed and nest in coastal areas from March to August, with peak activity during April and May. They can be found near bodies of water, such as beaches, estuaries, and coastal wetlands. Look for them near fish-rich areas, as they're fish-eating birds of prey.\n\nBald eagles, on the other hand, can be found in coastal areas year-round, but their activity patterns vary depending on the season. During the spring and summer months (March to August), they tend to be more active during the morning and late afternoon, while during the fall and winter months (September to February), they're more active during the mid-day.\n\nAs for specific trails or areas to focus on, it really depends on the park you're visiting. However, here are some general tips:\n\n* Look for areas with high vantage points, such as observation decks, towers, or hills, which can provide a good view of the surrounding area.\n* Focus on areas with fish-rich waters, such as estuaries, bays, or coastal wetlands, as both ospreys and bald eagles are attracted to these areas.\n* Keep an eye out for nesting sites, such as trees, poles, or platforms, as both species often nest in these areas.\n* Be patient and quiet, as these birds have excellent eyesight and can be easily disturbed by noise.\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the specific park you're visiting, I can't provide more tailored advice. If you could provide me with the name of the park or its location, I'd be happy to try and help you further!",
