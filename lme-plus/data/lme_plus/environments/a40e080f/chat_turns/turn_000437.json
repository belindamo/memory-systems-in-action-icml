And don't forget to keep an eye on it, as air filters typically need to be replaced every 15,000 to 30,000 miles, depending on your driving conditions.\n\nAs for the gas fill-up, it's good that you're keeping track of your fuel costs. Keeping a record of your fuel purchases can help you monitor your car's fuel efficiency and identify any potential issues.\n\nNow, back to the fuel injector cleaner. Since you've recently filled up your tank and replaced your air filter, using a fuel injector cleaner like the STP Fuel Injector Cleaner could be a good idea. It can help remove any deposits or contaminants that may have built up in your fuel system, which can improve your car's performance and fuel efficiency.\n\nRemember to follow the instructions on the product label and use it as directed. It's usually recommended to use a fuel injector cleaner every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, but you can use it more frequently if you notice any performance issues or if you drive in harsh conditions.\n\nDo you have any other questions about fuel injector cleaners or car maintenance in general?",
