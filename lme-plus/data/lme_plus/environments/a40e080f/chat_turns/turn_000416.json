However, I'd be happy to help you plan a fun day at Mickey's Halloween Party with your friend!\n\nRegarding the Cadaver Dans, they are a popular entertainment offering during Mickey's Halloween Party. The Cadaver Dans are a spooky-ooky barbershop quartet that perform Halloween-themed songs and jokes. They're a great addition to the park's atmosphere during the event.\n\nIf Emily is a huge Disney fan, she might enjoy the Cadaver Dans' performances, especially if she appreciates Disney's attention to detail and theming. The group's costumes, makeup, and performances are all carefully designed to fit the Halloween theme, and they add to the overall spooky-ooky atmosphere of the event.\n\nThat being said, everyone's tastes are different, so it ultimately depends on Emily's personal preferences. If she enjoys music, comedy, and Disney's brand of spooky fun, she might have a blast watching the Cadaver Dans. You could also consider asking her about her interests and preferences to get a better sense of whether she'd enjoy the performance.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you and Emily will have a fantastic time at Mickey's Halloween Party!",
