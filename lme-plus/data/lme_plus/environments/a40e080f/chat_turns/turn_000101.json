  "content": "Sure, here are some potential research gaps that could be addressed in future studies on exercise monitoring systems using computer vision for older adults:\n\n1. Limited validation studies: While some studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of computer vision-based exercise monitoring systems for older adults, there is a need for more rigorous validation studies to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of these systems. Future studies could use more diverse populations and compare computer vision-based monitoring with other types of monitoring (such as wearable sensors or manual observation) to determine the strengths and limitations of each approach.\n2. User-centered design: Many of the existing exercise monitoring systems using computer vision were developed with a technology-centered approach, without considering the needs and preferences of older adult users. Future studies could incorporate user-centered design principles to ensure that the systems are intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible to older adults with different levels of technology literacy.\n3. Privacy and security: Computer vision-based exercise monitoring systems may raise privacy and security concerns, particularly if they involve the collection and storage of sensitive health data. Future studies could explore methods for ensuring user privacy and security, such as using local processing rather than cloud-based storage or implementing data encryption protocols.\n4. Long-term adherence: While some studies have demonstrated short-term improvements in physical function and exercise adherence with computer vision-based monitoring, there is a need to evaluate the long-term adherence to these programs. Future studies could explore ways to increase user motivation and engagement with the systems to promote long-term adherence and sustained benefits.\n5. Cost-effectiveness: Computer vision-based exercise monitoring systems may be more costly than traditional monitoring methods, which could limit their adoption in real-world settings. Future studies could evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these systems and explore strategies for reducing costs while maintaining effectiveness.",
