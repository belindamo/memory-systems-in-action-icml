When we write this story, it will always be written in the writing style of Charles Dickens, meaning that the story should include the rich use of language, vivid descripting, and colorful characters, along with intricate plot lines that are filled with suspense, mystery and suprise. We want to captivate readers with compelling stories and characters. Additionallly, wherever possible, we want to have the plot advance through the use of dialog and description, rather than narrative and commentary.",
