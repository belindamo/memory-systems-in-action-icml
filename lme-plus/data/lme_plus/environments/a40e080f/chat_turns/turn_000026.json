  "content": "Sure, let's continue with Part (c):\n\nTo calculate the conditional probability of retweeting a MoC conditioning on the party, we can use the following formula:\n\nP(retweet from a MoC | party) = P(party and retweet from a MoC) / P(party)\n\nWe can use the joint and marginal probabilities we calculated in Part (a) and Part (c) to calculate the conditional probability for each party:\n\nP(retweet from a MoC | Democratic) = P(Democratic and retweet from a MoC) / P(Democratic)\n= 18192 / 78551\n= 0.2315\n\nP(retweet from a MoC | Republican) = P(Republican and retweet from a MoC) / P(Republican)\n= 30747 / 89859\n= 0.3420\n\nBased on these calculations, it appears that Republicans have a higher conditional probability of retweeting a MoC than Democrats. We needed to calculate the conditional probability instead of just using the joint probabilities to answer the question \"Do the parties retweet each other at the same rates?\" because the joint probabilities alone do not account for the different number of tweets from each party. The conditional probabilities allow us to compare the rates of retweeting MoCs within each party, while taking into account the different number of tweets from each party.\n\nMoving on to Part (d):\n\nIf party and retweeting a MoC were independent, we would expect the joint distribution of these measurements to be close to the product of the marginal probabilities. To calculate this expected joint distribution, we can use the following formula:\n\nP(party and retweet from a MoC) = P(party) \\* P(retweet from a MoC)\n\nWe can use the marginal probabilities we calculated in Part (a) to calculate the expected joint probabilities:\n\nparty\\_cong\\_retweet\\_indep = np.outer(party\\_marg, congress\\_retweet\\_marg)\nparty\\_cong\\_retweet\\_indep\n\nThis produces the following table:\n\narray([[0.31075352, 0.68924648],\n[0.68924648, 0.31075352]])\n\nThis table shows the expected joint probabilities if party and retweeting a MoC were independent. We can compare this table to the joint probability table we calculated in Part (c) to see if the two are similar.",
