Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nExtensions of Time \u2013 Basic Rules\n\nEither party, whether the contractor or owner, can request an extension of time on a construction project. Generally, when an extension of time is agreed on and granted, neither party can later claim liquidated damages.\n\nThis reflects a key principle in construction contracts that a party is not able to benefit from a contract by relying on their own breach of the contract. In other words, as a contractor, he cannot request an extension of time (and limit any claim for liquidated damages) when the contractor caused the delay. Therefore, as a contractor, he can claim an extension of time when:\n\nThe contractor is not the cause of any delays; and\nthose delays are out of the Contractor\u2019s control.\nIf the Contractor claim an extension of time, the contractor and the owner will agree to a new completion date, and the other rights under the contract will remain.",
