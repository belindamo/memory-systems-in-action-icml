Plus, it's nice to get some exercise and fresh air while enjoying a round. Speaking of which, I remember watching the Masters golf tournament in April with my family - it was such a fun experience, and we always make a big deal out of it. My mom even made her famous Augusta-themed cookies for the occasion!",
