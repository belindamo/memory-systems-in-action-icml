How many days a week do you want to commit to your morning routine?\n4. What type of reminders would you like to receive? (e.g., notifications on your phone, alarm clock, voice assistant, etc.)\n5. How many reminders would you like to receive, and at what intervals? (e.g., one reminder 30 minutes before waking up, another 15 minutes before, etc.)\n6. Are there any specific exercises or meditation practices you'd like to incorporate into your morning routine?\n7. Do you have any existing habits or routines that you'd like to build upon or avoid conflicting with?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you set up a customized reminder system to support your morning routine and help you get back on track with your sleep schedule.",
