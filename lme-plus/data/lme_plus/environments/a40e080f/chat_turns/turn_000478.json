Here's a revised version:\n\n[TRANSITION]\n\nAfter Sarah's husband finally removed the mirror from their house, he kept it hidden away in his garage, unsure of what to do with it. Eventually, he decided to give it to his daughter Katherine, who lived across the country in San Francisco. He hoped that the distance would keep the mirror from causing any further harm to their family.\n\n[INTRODUCTION]\n\nKatherine lived alone in a small apartment in the city, and it was there that the mirror took up residence. Her father George was staying with her for a few weeks, having come to visit her from the east coast. George was still grieving the loss of his wife, and the sight of the mirror brought back a flood of memories.\n\n\"I don't like that thing,\" George said, eyeing the mirror suspiciously as Katherine helped him unpack his bags. \"It's bad luck, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be silly, Dad,\" Katherine replied with a chuckle. \"It's just a mirror. And it's kind of cool, don't you think? Look at how ornate the frame is.\"\n\nGeorge grunted in response, not convinced. As the days went by, Katherine began to notice that her father was spending more and more time staring into the mirror. She tried to distract him with sightseeing and other activities, but he always found his way back to the mirror, lost in thought.\n\nOne night, as Katherine was cooking dinner, she heard her father talking to himself in the other room. She went to investigate and found him standing in front of the mirror, muttering under his breath.\n\n\"Dad, what are you doing?\" she asked, concerned.\n\nGeorge turned to her, his eyes wild with emotion. \"I saw her, Katie,\" he said, his voice trembling. \"I saw your mother. She was there, in the mirror.\"",
