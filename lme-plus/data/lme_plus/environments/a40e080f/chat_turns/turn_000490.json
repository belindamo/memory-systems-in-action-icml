Research: The group begins by researching the housing market online, looking at different neighborhoods and types of homes. They may use online platforms and tools to compare prices, view virtual tours, and read reviews from other buyers. They may also prioritize environmental sustainability and energy efficiency when researching homes.\n2. Pre-approval: Next, the group applies for pre-approval for a mortgage. They may also begin to research different types of mortgages and compare rates. They may be more likely to use online resources to research and compare mortgage options.\n3. Viewing homes: Once pre-approved, the group begins viewing homes in person. They may prioritize walkability, access to amenities, location, and community when viewing homes. They may also consider alternative forms of homeownership, such as renting or sharing a home with others.\n4. Decision making: After viewing several homes, the group narrows down their options and begins making a decision. They may consult with a real estate agent or attorney for advice. They may also use online tools and resources to help with the decision-making process.\n5. Closing: Once a decision is made, the group begins the process of closing on the home.
