The limited edition print you won at the art auction and the \"Sunset\" painting from the art fair in Brooklyn would make a great starting point.\n\nHere are some tips to consider when creating your mini-gallery wall:\n\n1. **Unify the pieces**: Choose art pieces that share a common theme, style, or color palette to create a cohesive look. Since you're exploring street art and urban themes, you might want to select pieces that reflect that aesthetic.\n2. **Vary the sizes and shapes**: Mix and match different sizes and shapes to add visual interest to your gallery wall. This will also help create a sense of balance and harmony.\n3. **Play with layout options**: Experiment with different layouts before committing to a final arrangement. You can use a digital tool or create a mockup with paper templates to test different configurations.\n4. **Leave some breathing room**: Don't overcrowd the wall. Leave some space between the pieces to create a sense of breathing room and allow each piece to shine.\n5. **Consider the frame styles**: Choose frames that complement the art pieces and the overall aesthetic you're aiming for. You might want to use a mix of frame styles to add visual interest.\n6. **Add some texture and depth**: Incorporate different textures and materials, like canvas, paper, or wood, to add depth and visual interest to your gallery wall.\n7. **Make it personal**: Include pieces that hold sentimental value or personal significance to you. This will make the gallery wall feel more meaningful and reflective of your personality.\n\nSome other ideas to consider:\n\n* Create a focal point: Choose a statement piece, like the limited edition print, to anchor the gallery wall and draw the viewer's attention.\n* Add some greenery: Incorporate some plants or a vase with fresh flowers to bring in a touch of natural beauty and soften the space.\n* Experiment with lighting: Use spotlights or table lamps to highlight specific pieces or create a cozy ambiance in the room.\n\nBy creating a mini-gallery wall, you'll not only showcase your art collection but also add a unique touch to your living room. Have fun with the process, and I hope you'll share a photo of your finished gallery wall!",
