Here is a revised script for the expert's monologue in his car:\n\n---\n\n[Expert is driving home from work in heavy traffic]\n\n17:00 [Expert]: Ugh, this traffic is never-ending. I can't believe it's taken me this long to get home.\n\n17:03 [Expert]: And to top it off, I had to deal with Justine all day. It's so difficult to work with her. She's always coming up with these wild, unrealistic ideas.\n\n17:06 [Expert]: I don't know how much more of this I can take. It's frustrating trying to get her to understand even the most basic concepts.\n\n17:09 [Expert]: But I guess I can't blame her entirely. She's just not as knowledgeable as the rest of us.\n\n17:12 [Expert]: [sighs] I wish there was a way to make it easier to communicate with her and the rest of the team. It's such a struggle sometimes.\n\n17:15 [Expert]: [starts singing a sad song to himself] \"Why can't we all just get along? Why is it so hard to understand? I'm tired of trying to explain, it's driving me insane...\"\n\n[Expert continues to sing and drive through the heavy traffic]\n\n---\n\nIn this scene, the expert is feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the difficulties of working with Justine and the team. His mood is reflected in the sad song he sings to himself as he drives through the heavy traffic.",
