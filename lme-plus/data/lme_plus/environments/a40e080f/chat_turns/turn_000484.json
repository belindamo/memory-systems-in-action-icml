  "content": "The behaviors and interests of Gen Y (people born between 1977 and 1995) and Gen Z (people born between 1996 and 2010) who want to buy a house may differ slightly from previous generations.\n\nGen Y, also known as Millennials, are known for valuing experiences and flexibility over material possessions. They may be more likely to prioritize location, walkability, and access to amenities when buying a house. They may also be more likely to consider alternative forms of homeownership, such as co-living or community land trusts.\n\nGen Z, on the other hand, is known for being tech-savvy and having a strong sense of community. They may be more likely to use online platforms and digital tools to research and purchase a home. They may also prioritize environmental sustainability and energy efficiency when buying a house.\n\nIt's worth noting that these are generalizations and that individuals may have their own unique preferences and priorities when it comes to buying a house.",
