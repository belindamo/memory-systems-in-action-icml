  "content": "Certainly! Here is a revised script with the boss character reflecting on the qualifications of his team:\n\n---\n\n0:00 [Boss]: Our company has a new strategic initiative to increase market penetration, maximise brand loyalty, and enhance intangible assets.\n\n0:08 [Boss]: In pursuit of these objectives, we've started a new project - for which we require 7 red lines.\n\n0:11 [Boss]: I understand your company can help us in this matter.\n\n0:16 [Expert]: Of course! Walter here will be the Project Manager. Walter, we can do this, can't we?\n\n0:22 [Walter]: Yes, of course.\n\n0:23 [Boss]: Anderson here is our expert in all matters related to drawing red lines. We brought him along today to share his professional opinion.\n\n0:26 [Anderson]: Nice to meet you! Well, you all know me.\n\n0:30 [Boss]: This is Justine, our company's design specialist.\n\n0:35 [Justine]: Hallo...\n\n0:36 [Boss]: We need you to draw seven red lines. All of them strictly perpendicular; some with green ink and some with transparent. Can you do that?\n\n0:46 [Anderson]: No. I'm afraid we -\n\n0:47 [Boss]: Let's not rush into any hasty answers, Anderson! The task has been set and needs to be carried out.\n\n0:51 [Boss]: At the end of the day, you are an expert.\n\n0:53 [Anderson]: The term \"red line\" implies the colour of the line to be red. To draw a red line with green ink is - well if it is not exactly impossible, then it is pretty close to being impossible.\n\n1:02 [Boss]: What does it even mean: \"impossible\"?\n\n1:04 [Anderson]: I mean, it is quite possible that there are some people, say suffering from colour blindness, for whom the colour of the lines doesn't really make a difference.\n\n1:10 [Boss]: But I am quite sure that the target audience of your project does not consists solely of such people.\n\n1:15 [Anderson]: So in principle this is possible.\n\n1:19 [Boss]: I'll simplify.\n\n1:21 [Boss]: A line as such can be drawn with absolutely any ink. But if you want to get a red line, you need to use red ink.\n\n1:28 [Boss]: What if we draw them with blue ink?\n\n1:30 [Anderson]: It still won't work. If you use blue ink, you will get blue lines.\n\n1:37 [Boss]: And what exactly did you mean, when you talked about the transparent ink?\n\n1:40 [Anderson]: How to better explain?",
