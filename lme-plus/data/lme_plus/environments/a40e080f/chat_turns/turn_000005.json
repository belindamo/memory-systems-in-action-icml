  "content": "The sentence \"they \\_\\_\\_ out just now\" is not complete and requires a verb to be grammatically correct. Without more context, it's hard to know which verb should be used. But some examples of what could be filled in the blank to make a complete sentence:\n\n* they \"left\" out just now\n* they \"went\" out just now\n* they \"stepped\" out just now\n* they \"logged\" out just now\n* they \"checked\" out just now\n\nIf you provide more context, I could give you a more specific answer.",
