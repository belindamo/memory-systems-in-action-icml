The Specialized Sirrus is a great bike, and regular maintenance is important to keep it running smoothly.\n\nIt's good that you caught the worn-out cables when you did. If you had waited too long, it could have led to more serious problems with your shifting and braking systems. The $40 repair cost is a relatively small price to pay to ensure your safety and the performance of your bike.\n\nI'm curious, have you been riding your bike regularly since the repair? How's the shifting and braking been feeling?\n\n(By the way, I'm glad we could chat about your car and bike maintenance. It's always important to take care of our vehicles, whether they have two wheels or four!)",
