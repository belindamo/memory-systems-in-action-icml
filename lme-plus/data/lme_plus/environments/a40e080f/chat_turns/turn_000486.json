  "content": "In addition, both Gen Y and Gen Z may be more likely to face challenges when it comes to buying a house, such as high levels of student loan debt and a lack of affordable housing options. This may lead to them being more likely to consider alternative forms of homeownership, such as renting or sharing a home with others. They may also be more likely to wait longer to purchase a home, or opt for smaller or more affordable options.\n\nAlso, due to the economic and social changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, these generations might also be more interested in buying houses in suburban areas or in smaller towns and cities, with more space for work and home schooling, and with a better balance between work and life.\n\nIn summary, Gen Y and Gen Z may have different priorities and behaviors when it comes to buying a house, but they may also face similar challenges in the current housing market.",
