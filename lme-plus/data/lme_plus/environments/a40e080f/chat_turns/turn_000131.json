I'll create a collage on the front cover with some of the funniest and most memorable photos, and then add captions and quotes throughout the album. I'll also include some polaroid-style photos and mini photo frames to add some visual interest. Do you think it's a good idea to include some handwritten notes or messages from family members in the album as well?",
