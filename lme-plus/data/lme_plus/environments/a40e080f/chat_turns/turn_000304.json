Set your reminders to recur every Monday to Friday, so you don't have to set them up individually each day.\n2. Make sure your phone is in a convenient location, such as your bedside table, so you can see the reminders as soon as you wake up.\n3. Consider setting your reminders to vibrate or play a gentle sound, so you're not startled awake.\n4. Place your exercise gear and meditation space in an easily accessible location, so you can get started right away.\n5. Try to establish a consistent sleep schedule, aiming for 7-9 hours of sleep each night, to help regulate your body's internal clock.\n6. Be gentle with yourself if you miss a day or two. Don't get discouraged, and simply get back on track as soon as possible.\n\n**Additional Suggestions:**\n\n* Consider adding a 10-15 minute buffer between exercising and meditating to shower, change, or have a quick snack.\n* You might want to set a reminder for the night before to prepare your exercise gear or meditation space, so everything is ready to go in the morning.\n* If you're new to meditation, you might want to start with shorter sessions (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.\n\nI hope this helps you establish a consistent morning routine and gets you back on track with your sleep schedule!",
