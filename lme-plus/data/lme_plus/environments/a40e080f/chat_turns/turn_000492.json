  "content": "Based on the provided web search results, it seems that Gen Z home buyers prefer single-family homes over other types of properties such as townhomes, detached multi-family units, and condominiums [[1](https://www.homes.com/blog/2019/10/what-gen-z-homebuyers-want/)]. This is unusual for young first-time homebuyers, but it may change if single-family home prices continue to rise.\n\nWhen it comes to their home buying power, Gen Zs' experience may differ from the millennial's experience at the same point in their lifetime. According to the source [[2](https://houwzer.com/blog/gen-z-buying-homes)], Gen Zers may have a harder time buying a home due to the rising home prices and interest rates.\n\nThe survey [[3](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1260330/gen-z-reasons-for-wanting-to-buy-a-house-usa/)] found that 72% of Gen Zers wanted to buy a house at some point in the future, and half of them wished to do so due to family reasons. Other reasons stated by respondents were for personal reasons, to have a sense of security, and to have more space.\n\nHere is a possible user journey for a Gen Z group looking to buy a house:\n\n1. Research: The group begins by researching the housing market online, looking at different neighborhoods and types of homes. They may prioritize single-family homes over other options and prioritize environmental sustainability and energy efficiency when researching homes.\n2. Pre-approval: Next, the group applies for pre-approval for a mortgage. They may also begin to research different types of mortgages and compare rates. They may be more likely to use online resources to research and compare mortgage options.\n3. Viewing homes: Once pre-approved, the group begins viewing homes in person. They may prioritize walkability, access to amenities, location, and community when viewing homes. They may also consider alternative forms of homeownership, such as renting or sharing a home with others.\n4. Decision making: After viewing several homes, the group narrows down their options and begins making a decision. They may consult with a real estate agent or attorney for advice. They may also use online tools and resources to help with the decision-making process.\n5. Closing: Once a decision is made, the group begins the process of closing on the home. This may involve finalizing a mortgage, completing inspections and paperwork, and transferring ownership of the property. They may also use digital tools and platforms to facilitate the closing process.\n6. Moving: Finally, the group moves into their new home and begins to make it their own.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is a possible user journey and that the experience may vary depending on individual circumstances and the current market conditions.",
