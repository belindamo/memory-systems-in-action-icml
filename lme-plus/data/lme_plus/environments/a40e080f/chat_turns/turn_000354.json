Seasoning a cast iron skillet is a simple process that creates a non-stick surface and prevents rust. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to season a cast iron skillet:\n\n**Initial Seasoning:**\n\n1. **Clean the skillet**: Wash the skillet with mild soap and warm water. Scrub off any impurities or manufacturing residue using a soft brush or sponge.\n2. **Dry the skillet**: Dry the skillet thoroughly with a towel.\n3. **Apply a thin layer of oil**: Using a paper towel, apply a thin, even layer of cooking oil (such as vegetable oil, canola oil, or flaxseed oil) to the entire skillet, including the handle and underside.\n4. **Bake the skillet**: Place the skillet upside down on the middle rack of your oven and bake at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for an hour. This helps the oil penetrate the metal and polymerize, creating a hard, non-stick surface.\n5. **Let it cool**: Let the skillet cool completely before wiping off any excess oil with a paper towel.\n\n**Ongoing Maintenance:**\n\n1. **Clean the skillet after use**: Wash the skillet with mild soap and warm water after each use. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can strip the seasoning.\n2. **Dry the skillet**: Dry the skillet thoroughly with a towel after cleaning.\n3. **Re-season occasionally**: Re-season the skillet every 1-3 months, or as needed, by applying a thin layer of oil and baking at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for an hour.\n4. **Store the skillet properly**: Store the skillet in a dry place, such as a hook or hanging rack. Do not store it in a humid environment or with a lid, as this can encourage rust.\n\n**Tips and Tricks:**\n\n* Avoid using metal utensils, as they can scratch the seasoning. Instead, use silicone, wooden, or plastic utensils.\n* Don't put your cast iron skillet in the dishwasher, as the high heat and harsh chemicals can damage the seasoning.\n* If you notice rust spots, sand them off using fine-grit sandpaper and re-season the skillet.\n* To remove stubborn food residue, mix equal parts water and white vinegar in the skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes before cleaning.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you'll be able to maintain your cast iron skillet and enjoy a non-stick surface for years to come. Happy cooking!",
