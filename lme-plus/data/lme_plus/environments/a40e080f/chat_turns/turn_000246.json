However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to know which coastal state park you visited last weekend or any specific information about your personal experiences. Each conversation with me is a new start.\n\nTo provide you with helpful information, could you please tell me the name of the coastal state park you're planning to visit on April 16th? That way, I can give you specific information about the best spots to see ospreys and bald eagles, as well as any other relevant details about the park.\n\nAdditionally, April 16th is a great time to spot these birds, as it's during their breeding season in many coastal areas. Ospreys typically start nesting in late March to early April, and bald eagles are often active in coastal areas during this time as well.\n\nLet me know the park's name, and I'll do my best to provide you with valuable insights and tips for your visit!",
