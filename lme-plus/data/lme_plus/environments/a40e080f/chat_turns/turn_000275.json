As a user, I would not ask for a response that provides a detailed explanation of oil pulling or recommendations for coconut oil brands. Instead, I would ask a more specific question or request further clarification on a particular aspect of oil pulling. Here's an example:\n\n\"Can you tell me more about how to properly swish the coconut oil in my mouth during oil pulling? Should I focus on specific areas like my teeth and gums, or just swish it around my whole mouth?\"",
