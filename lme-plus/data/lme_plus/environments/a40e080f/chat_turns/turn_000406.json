  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I think there might be some confusion. There is no \"Snow White's Enchanted Wish\" dark ride in Fantasyland at Disneyland. But, I think I know what might be going on!\n\nThere is a classic Disney dark ride called \"Snow White's Scary Adventures\" located in Fantasyland, which has been a Disneyland staple since the park's opening in 1955. However, in 2020, the attraction underwent a major refurbishment and reopened as \"Snow White's Enchanted Wish\" in May 2021.\n\nIt's possible that you rode the newly refurbished attraction during the Mickey's Halloween Party event on October 10th, and I'm thrilled to hear you enjoyed it! The updated ride features new scenes, state-of-the-art technology, and a more family-friendly tone, while still maintaining the classic charm of the original.\n\nIf you have any more questions or would like to know more about the attraction, feel free to ask! I'd be happy to help you plan your Disneyland trip.",
