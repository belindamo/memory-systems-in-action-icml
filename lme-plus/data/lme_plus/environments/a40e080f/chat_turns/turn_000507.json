There are several characters mentioned in the script, including the expert, Walter (the Project Manager), Anderson (the expert in all matters related to drawing red lines), Justine (the company's design specialist), and the person who set the task (presumably a superior or boss to the other characters).\n\nWithout more information, it is difficult to determine who the boss is in the sketch.
