However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to retain information about our previous conversations or know your personal experiences. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation.\n\nThat being said, I'm happy to help you with your question about Sea Breeze State Park! Unfortunately, I have to break the news to you that there is no Sea Breeze State Park. It's possible that you might be thinking of a different park or location.\n\nIf you could provide me with more information about the park you visited, such as its location or any distinctive features you remember, I might be able to help you identify it. Additionally, I'd be happy to provide you with general tips on spotting ospreys and bald eagles, as well as recommendations for birding journals and binoculars!\n\nAs for your birding journal, it's great that you're keeping track of your birding adventures! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to know your birthday or any personal information about you. If you have any questions about birding or need recommendations for resources, feel free to ask!",
