      "content": "Congratulations on your new Doctor Strange Funko Pop!\n\nCleaning your Funko Pops requires some care to avoid damaging the paint, vinyl, or other materials. Here's a recommended cleaning solution and method to help you keep your Funko Pops in great condition:\n\n**Recommended cleaning solution:**\n\n1. **Mild soap and water**: Mix a small amount of mild soap, such as dish soap or hand soap, with warm water. A 1:10 ratio of soap to water is a good starting point. You can adjust the ratio based on how dirty your Funko Pops are.\n2. **White vinegar and water**: Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. This solution is gentle and effective at removing dirt and grime without leaving residue.\n3. **Funko's recommended cleaning solution**: Funko suggests using a solution of 50% water and 50% white vinegar, applied with a soft-bristled toothbrush.\n\n**Cleaning method:**\n\n1. **Dust removal**: Gently brush off any loose dust or debris from the Funko Pop using a soft-bristled brush or a dry, soft cloth.\n2. **Dampen a cloth**: Dip a soft, lint-free cloth into the cleaning solution, and wring it out so that it's damp, not soaking wet.\n3. **Gently wipe the Funko Pop**: Wipe the Funko Pop with the damp cloth, starting from the top and working your way down. Avoid applying too much pressure, which can damage the paint or vinyl.\n4. **Clean crevices**: Use a soft-bristled toothbrush or a small, soft-bristled paintbrush to gently clean crevices, corners, and small details.\n5. **Dry the Funko Pop**: Use a dry, soft cloth to wipe away any excess moisture and prevent water spots.\n6. **Inspect and repeat**: Inspect your Funko Pop to ensure it's clean. If some areas still need attention, repeat the cleaning process as needed.\n\n**Important tips:**\n\n* Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, or hot water, as they can damage the paint, vinyl, or other materials.\n* Never submerge your Funko Pop in water or expose it to excessive moisture.\n* Don't use compressed air or blow dryers to dry your Funko Pops, as they can create static electricity that attracts dust.\n* For particularly stubborn stains or grime buildup, you can let the cleaning solution sit on the affected area for a few minutes before wiping it clean.\n\nBy following these steps and using the recommended cleaning solutions, you should be able to keep your Funko Pops clean and in great condition. Happy cleaning!"

      "content": "That's a great idea! Organizing your figurines by franchise is a logical and visually appealing way to display your collection. It's also a great way to showcase your love for specific franchises and characters.\n\nGrouping similar items together can create a sense of cohesion and make it easier to appreciate the details of each figurine. By having all your Marvel figurines together, for example, you can see the different characters and their unique designs, and it's easier to compare and contrast them.\n\nPlus, organizing by franchise can help create a sense of storytelling and narrative on your shelf. You can create a \"scene\" with your figurines, where the characters from a particular franchise are posed and arranged to create a dynamic and engaging display.\n\nRemember to have fun with the process and be creative! You could also consider adding some decorative elements, like character logos or franchise-themed backdrops, to really make your display pop.\n\nOne more tip: consider leaving some space between each franchise group to create a clear visual separation between them. This will help the eye move easily from one group to the next and prevent the display from feeling cluttered or overwhelming.\n\nI hope your reorganization project turns out amazing, and I'd love to hear how it goes!"
