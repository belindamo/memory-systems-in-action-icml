      "content": "The Quinoa and Roasted Vegetable Bowls recipe is a fantastic base that can be easily customized to boost the protein content. Here are some suggestions to add protein to your meal prep:\n\n1. **Grilled Chicken**: Marinate chicken breast in your favorite seasonings and grill it along with the vegetables. Slice it into strips and add it on top of the quinoa and roasted veggies.\n2. **Roasted Turkey Sausage**: Add sliced turkey sausage to the roasting pan with the vegetables. This will infuse the veggies with flavor and provide a protein-rich element.\n3. **Black Beans**: Cook black beans and add them to the quinoa mixture. You can season them with cumin, chili powder, and lime juice for extra flavor.\n4. **Tofu**: Marinate and bake tofu cubes with the vegetables. This is a great option for a plant-based protein source.\n5. **Edamame**: Boil or steam edamame and add them to the quinoa mixture. You can season them with soy sauce and sesame oil for added flavor.\n6. **Nuts or Seeds**: Sprinkle chopped nuts or seeds like almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, or chia seeds on top of the quinoa bowls. These provide a crunchy texture and a boost of protein.\n7. **Feta Cheese**: Crumbling feta cheese into the quinoa mixture adds a tangy flavor and a decent amount of protein.\n8. **Greek Yogurt**: Serve a dollop of Greek yogurt on top of the quinoa bowls. This adds protein and creaminess to the dish.\n9. **Protein Powder**: If you prefer a more convenient option, you can mix some protein powder into the quinoa while it's cooking. This will distribute the protein evenly throughout the dish.\n\nFeel free to pick one or a combination of these options to boost the protein content of your Quinoa and Roasted Vegetable Bowls. You can also experiment with different seasonings and spices to complement the added protein sources.\n\nRemember to adjust the cooking time and temperature according to the protein you choose to add.
