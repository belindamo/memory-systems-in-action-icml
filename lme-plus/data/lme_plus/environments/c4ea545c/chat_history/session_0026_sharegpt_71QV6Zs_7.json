      "content": "Jack Nicklaus is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time. Born on January 21, 1940 in Columbus, Ohio, Nicklaus learned the game from his father, Charlie, and began competing as an amateur at a young age.\n\nNicklaus' amateur career was marked by a string of impressive victories. He won the Ohio Open in 1959 and 1960, and the U.S. Amateur in 1959 and 1961. He also finished as the runner-up at the 1960 U.S. Open, where he lost to Arnold Palmer in a memorable playoff.\n\nNicklaus turned professional in 1962, and quickly established himself as one of the dominant players on the PGA Tour. Over the course of his career, he won a record 18 major championships, including six Masters titles, five PGA Championships, four U.S. Opens, and three British Opens.\n\nNicklaus' major championship wins are summarized in the table below, listed in chronological order:\n\n| Year | Major Championship | Venue | Runner-up |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1962 | U.S. Open | Oakmont Country Club | Arnold Palmer |\n| 1963 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club | Dave Marr |\n| 1963 | PGA Championship | Dallas Athletic Club | Dave Hill |\n| 1965 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club | Gay Brewer |\n| 1966 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club | Billy Casper |\n| 1966 | British Open | Muirfield | Tony Jacklin |\n| 1968 | U.S. Open | Pebble Beach Golf Links | Lee Trevino |\n| 1970 | British Open | St. Andrews | Doug Sanders |\n| 1972 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club | Tom Weiskopf |\n| 1972 | British Open | Muirfield | Tom Watson |\n| 1974 | U.S. Open | Winged Foot Golf Club | Hale Irwin |\n| 1975 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club | Raymond Floyd |\n| 1977 | PGA Championship | Southern Hills Country Club | Al Geiberger |\n| 1980 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club | Tom Weiskopf |\n| 1980 | PGA Championship | Firestone Country Club | Dave Stockton |\n| 1980 | PGA Championship | Baltusrol Golf Club | Johnny Miller |\n| 1980 | U.S. Open | Baltusrol Golf Club | Tom Watson |\n| 1986 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club | Fred Couples |\n| 1988 | PGA Championship | Inverness Club | Tom Weiskopf |\n\nNicklaus' main rivals during his playing career included Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, and Tom Watson. Nicklaus and Palmer, known as the \"Big Three\" of golf, had a famously friendly rivalry that helped to popularize the game in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to their memorable duel at the 1960 U.S. Open, the two golfers also went head-to-head at the 1962 Masters, where Palmer came from behind on the final day to edge out Nicklaus by a single stroke.\n\nNicklaus and Watson, meanwhile, had a more intense rivalry that was marked by several memorable battles, including their duel at the 1977 British Open. Nicklaus was trailing Watson by a single stroke heading into the final round, but made up ground with a birdie on the 17th hole to force a playoff. In the end, Watson emerged victorious, sinking a long putt on the final hole to win the tournament.\n\nAfter retiring from professional golf in 2005, Nicklaus turned his attention to golf course design. He has designed over 300 courses around the world, including several that have hosted major championships."
