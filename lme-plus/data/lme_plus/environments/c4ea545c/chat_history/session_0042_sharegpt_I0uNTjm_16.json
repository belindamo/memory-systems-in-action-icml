      "content": "creating attachment security. We know in general what the qualities of being are that promote secure attachment, but each patient will have unique needs for particular configurations and weighting of those qualities. By initially not hearing specific qualities named by the therapist, the patient is primed to access his or her unique needs, which will then be projected as qualities into the construction of the imagined parents, making them \u201cideal\u201d for that particular patient. In this way, the patient\u2019s parent figures have as their foundation the qualities that come from the patient\u2019s deepest knowing of what was most missing during childhood and thus what in the present will best provide for attachment repair.\n\nSHAPE THE PATIENT\u2019S IMAGERY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nThroughout the protocol, the therapist frequently asks the patient to describe the parent figures and his or her experiences of them. The therapist\u2019s responses to the patient\u2019s descriptions include pointing the patient\u2019s attention toward the attachment-promoting qualities of the imagined parent figures and mirroring and enhancing the patient\u2019s descriptions of those qualities. By recognizing and reinforcing these qualities, the patient\u2019s imagery and experience is shaped toward the inner conditions that most efficiently create attachment security.\n\nPoint the patient\u2019s attention to the attachment-promoting qualities of his or her imagined parent figures. Fundamental to this protocol is the patient\u2019s deeply felt experience of the imagined parent figures being and behaving in ways that promote attachment security. Ideally, then, the patient\u2019s attention stays primarily focused on those ways and on his or her felt experience in response. The therapist promotes this attentiveness by frequently making statements such as the following:\n\nNotice the ways that they\u2019re being with you.\n\nNotice how they\u2019re being with you now.\n\nNotice the ways that they\u2019re being with you that feel so very right for you and for your well-being.\n\nNotice the ways that they\u2019re being with you that help you to feel such a clear and strong sense of security with them.\n\nNotice what effect their ways of being with you have on your inner state of being.\n\nNotice how you feel as they\u2019re with you in all the ways that you most need and in all the ways that are so very right for you and your wellbeing.\n\nExpressed throughout the protocol, these statements help the patient to stay on task. In addition to pointing attention to particular aspects of the imagery and the patient\u2019s experience of it, such statements reinforce the creative and generative aspect of the process, encouraging the patient to be curious and open to what will be produced by staying engaged with the imagery.\n\nMirror and enhance the patient\u2019s descriptions of the attachment-promoting qualities of the imagined parent figures. The therapist listens carefully to the patient\u2019s descriptions of the parent figures and chooses to reinforce anything that is consistent with qualities that promote secure attachment. At first, the imagery might be somewhat vague and the patient might be tentative about experiencing it and/or reporting it. Hearing the therapist use the patient\u2019s same words and descriptions with an affirming tone will ratify the imagery and strengthen the patient\u2019s confidence in the imagery and in the overall process. Mirroring also helps to keep attention on the beneficial qualities of the parent figures and the patient\u2019s immediate, felt experience of them.\n\nIt is very important that the therapist use the patient\u2019s words and phrases; then, building upon the patient\u2019s literal expressions, the therapist may incorporate other, closely related words and phrases that are consistent with the principle or spirit of what the patient says. Some examples are as follows:\n\nPatient: They\u2019re both very interactive with me. The mother is reaching out to me; the father isn\u2019t, but he has his own ways of engaging with me. I feel they want to be doing what they\u2019re doing. I just feel they want to be with me.\n\nTherapist: Yes, they really want to be with you, and they engage with you in their own ways. And you can really take in how good it feels that they want to be with you."

      "content": "Thank you for sharing this information with me. It is clear that the therapist in these examples is using a number of strategies to help the patient engage with the ideal parent figure imagery and work towards attachment repair. Some of these strategies include:\n\n* Emphasizing the qualities of being of the ideal parent figures, rather than their actions\n* Helping the patient to establish a calm, relaxed state of awareness as the foundation for the IPF work\n* Responding to the patient's experience in a way that shows attunement and reinforces the experience of the IPFs\n* Pointing the patient's attention towards the attachment-promoting qualities of the IPFs and mirroring and enhancing the patient's descriptions of those qualities\n* Validating the patient's experience and encouraging the patient to express and explore their feelings and needs\n* Helping the patient to identify and connect with the needs and desires that underlie the imagery, in order to promote a deeper sense of security."

      "content": "the general principles of secure attachment formation; and introducing qualities that are the positive opposites of the problematic aspects of the particular patient\u2019s experiences with his or her actual parents.\n\nCorrect for instrumental caretaking by suggesting underlying attachment-promoting qualities. Within the IPF protocol, the therapist often must mirror differentially between what the patient experiences and what among those experiences best supports the formation of secure attachment representations. For example, it is quite common for patients to describe the parent figures engaging in instrumental actions, such as cooking a meal, reading a bedtime story, or playing a game. Even though such actions may be with and for the child in the imagery, it should not be assumed that the actions are done with qualities of being that promote attachment security. Doing \u201call the right things\u201d for a child can be partially or completely devoid of attunement, soothing, delight, support for exploration, and even some aspects of protection. Many insecurely attached patients had parents who objectively did \u201call the right things.\u201d\n\nWhen a patient reports that the parent figures are doing something for him or her, the therapist acknowledges that action, mirroring that it\u2019s present, and then either points attention to or suggests positive, attachment-promoting qualities of being from which the figures are engaging in that doing. For example:\n\nPatient: We\u2019re in the kitchen and my mother is making dinner for me. She seems happy.\n\nTherapist: Yes. Notice what it is about her that lets you know how happy she is to be making dinner for you. She doesn\u2019t want to be anywhere other than there with you now, and she\u2019s happy to be making for you what she knows you enjoy so much.\n\nIn this example, the therapist mirrored both the action of the mother figure making dinner and the patient\u2019s sense that the mother was happy. The therapist also went beyond the patient\u2019s objective statements and suggested that the mother figure was rather than seemed happy, and that the source of her happiness was that she was \u201cmaking dinner for you,\u201d \u201cthere with you now,\u201d and \u201cmaking for you what she knows you enjoy so much.\u201d This linking of the action, the affective state, and the relationship provided both mirroring and suggestive shaping of the imagery toward more attachment-promoting forms.\n\nHere is another example:\n\nPatient: My mother is brushing my hair.\n\nTherapist: And you can feel from her that she\u2019s right there with you, soothing you and brushing your hair with such love for you. You can really feel her interest, and her caring, and her love through the ways she\u2019s with you, whether she\u2019s doing something for you or just simply being with you.\n\nIn this example, too, the therapist mirrored the mother figure\u2019s action and then made suggestions that the action was done from and with specific attachment-promoting qualities of being.\n\nSuggest that the imagined parent figures have qualities that are known in general to support secure attachment. In response to particular attachment-promoting qualities not being included in a patient\u2019s descriptions of the parent figures, the therapist includes suggestions of those qualities, drawing from the \u201cfour general factors\u201d and the behavioral components of the \u201cfive conditions that promote secure attachment.\u201d Some possibilities, from each of these categories, are as follows, with key elements underlined:\n\nGeneral Factors\n\nPHYSICAL PRESENCE\n\n\u2022 These parents are genuinely accessible to you.\n\n\u2022 You can count on these parents to be with you when you need them.\n\n\u2022 This is a special relationship in which they are reasonably available to you when you need them to be.\n\nCONSISTENCY\n\n\u2022 These parents are consistent in their ways of being with you over time.\n\n\u2022 These parents know what helps you to feel secure and safe, and they consistently provide that for you every time you\u2019re with them.\n\n\u2022 You come to know these parents and their helpful ways of being with you.\n\nRELIABILITY"

The therapist can also use these suggestions to help the patient to begin to form new mental models of attachment relationships, which will be useful for the patient outside of the therapy sessions."
