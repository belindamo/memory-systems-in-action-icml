      "content": "1. \"As an ACCA trainee, I collected and evaluated evidence for an audit engagement by reviewing the client's financial statements and comparing them to previous years' statements to identify any discrepancies or unusual transactions. For example, I noticed a significant increase in accounts payable, which prompted me to request additional documentation from the client such as purchase orders and vendor invoices. Upon reviewing these documents, I found that the increase was due to an increase in raw materials purchases for a new product line, which was confirmed by the client's management and was a legitimate transaction.\"\n2. \"During an assurance engagement, I gathered evidence by conducting interviews with management and employees to understand their internal controls and procedures for ensuring accurate financial reporting. For example, I asked questions about how they ensure the proper segregation of duties, how transactions are recorded and approved, and how they manage access to sensitive financial information. The responses I received provided me with valuable insight into the client's internal controls, which I then tested and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in preventing errors or fraud.\"\n3. \"I evaluated the evidence collected from a client's inventory count by comparing it to the amounts reported in their financial statements and performing a physical observation of the inventory to ensure proper documentation and classification. For example, I noticed that the client had reported a higher value of inventory than the physical count indicated. After further investigation, I found that the client had failed to properly adjust the inventory records for damaged or obsolete items, which resulted in an overstatement of the inventory value.\"\n4. \"I collected evidence for a client's revenue recognition by reviewing their sales contracts and comparing them to the amounts reported in their financial statements to ensure compliance with accounting standards. For example, I noticed that the client had reported revenue for a large contract even though it had not yet been completed. Upon further investigation, I found that the client had not followed the revenue recognition guidelines in the accounting standards and"

Additionally, I also suggested the client to establish a proper revenue recognition policy and ensure that all future revenue recognition is done in accordance with the accounting standards\"\n\n5. \"I evaluated the evidence collected from a client's fixed assets by performing a physical inspection of the assets, comparing the findings to the amounts reported in the financial statements, and reviewing the client's depreciation policies to ensure accuracy. For example, I found that the client had reported a higher value for one of their fixed assets than the physical inspection revealed. After investigating further, I discovered that the client had not properly recorded the accumulated depreciation for the asset, resulting in an overstatement of the asset value. I recommended that the client adjust their financial statements to reflect the correct value of the fixed asset and review their depreciation policies to prevent similar errors in the future.\"\n\nOverall, as a ACCA student, these are some of the examples of how I, as an auditor or assurance professional, would collect and evaluate evidence for an audit or assurance engagement, and reflect the working activities of some elements of this objective."

During the engagement, I collected evidence by reviewing the client's purchase orders and comparing them to the corresponding vendor invoices. I also conducted interviews with employees to understand their roles and responsibilities in the purchasing process. After analyzing the evidence, I formed an opinion on the effectiveness of the client's internal controls and procedures for ensuring compliance with company policies. I demonstrated professional scepticism by questioning any unusual or high-value transactions and making sure that my judgements were based on sufficient valid evidence.\"\n2. \"I carried out an external audit for a client's financial statements. I collected evidence by reviewing the client's financial records, such as bank statements, ledgers, and journal entries. I also performed test of controls and substantive procedures to ensure the accuracy of the financial statements.

Through out the engagement I demonstrated professional scepticism by challenging the assumptions and estimates made by management and ensuring that my judgement were based on sufficient valid evidence.\"\n3. \"I performed an assurance engagement for a client's IT system.
