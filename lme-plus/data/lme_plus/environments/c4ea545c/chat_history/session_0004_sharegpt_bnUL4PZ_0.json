Angular is a popular front-end web framework developed by Google for building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs). It is based on TypeScript and provides a rich set of features for creating complex, scalable web applications.\n\nI can assist with questions related to Angular components, services, directives, pipes, modules, routing, forms, and other key features of the framework. Additionally, I can provide advice on best practices for structuring and organizing Angular projects, as well as optimizing performance and ensuring code quality.\n\nIf you have any specific questions related to Angular development, please feel free to ask!"

      "content": "This code appears to be an Angular template that defines the layout and functionality of a user interface for a portfolio management application. Let's break it down line by line and discuss the key Angular concepts that are being used.\n```csharp\n<aux-notification-group\n  type=\"toast\"\n  #toastNotification\n  [overrideToastPositionTop]=\"overrideToastPositionTop\">\n</aux-notification-group>\n```\nThis is a component that displays toast notifications to the user. The `type` attribute specifies the type of notification (in this case, a toast). The `#toastNotification` creates a reference to the component, which can be used in the component's controller code. The `[overrideToastPositionTop]` attribute is a property binding that allows the position of the toast notification to be overridden.\n```php\n<div [hidden]=\"hideLoadingIndicator$ | async\" class=\"loading-bg\">\n  <div class=\"spinner\">\n    <aux-progress-indicator isSpinner=\"true\" size=\"large\" type=\"loading\"></aux-progress-indicator>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\nThis is a loading indicator that is displayed while data is being loaded. The `[hidden]` attribute is a property binding that hides the loading indicator when the `hideLoadingIndicator$` observable emits a value of `true`. The `aux-progress-indicator` component displays a spinning progress icon.\n```php\n<div class=\"container\">\n  ...\n</div>\n```\nThis is a container that holds the main content of the page.\n```scss\n<pm-ui-target-listings\n  [targetMetadata]=\"targetMetadata\"\n  [workspaceId]=\"workspaceId\"\n  [isDraftOrderMode]=\"portfolioDetailsStoreService.isDraftOrderMode$ | async\"\n  moduleId=\"portfolio-details-subscribed-targets\"\n  (selectedMetadata)=\"targetsSelected($event)\"\n  (addedTargets)=\"targetsAdded($event)\"\n  (unsubscribeTargets)=\"unsubscribeTargets($event)\"\n  (editedTargetSubscriptions)=\"editedTargetSubscriptions($event)\"\n></pm-ui-target-listings>\n```\nThis is a custom component `pm-ui-target-listings` that displays a list of target listings. The component is bound to the `targetMetadata` and `workspaceId` properties, and it subscribes to an observable `isDraftOrderMode$` provided by the `portfolioDetailsStoreService`. The component also emits events when the user interacts with it, such as selecting metadata, adding targets, unsubscribing targets, or editing target subscriptions.\n```php\n<div>\n  <aux-notification-group #widgetNotification></aux-notification-group>\n</div>\n```\nThis is another notification group component that is used to display notifications to the user.\n```php\n<div class=\"definitions-and-exposures-container\">\n  <aux-splitter direction=\"horizontal\" sizes=\"40%, 60%\">\n    ...\n  </aux-splitter>\n</div>\n```\nThis is a container that holds a splitter component that divides the content into two parts. The `aux-splitter` component splits the content horizontally and sets the initial sizes of the two parts to 40% and 60%, respectively.\n```csharp\n<div\n  class=\"target-definitions-container pm-ui-combined-grid-container__splitter-horizontal\"\n  slot=\"0\"\n>\n  <pm-ui-target-definitions\n    #targetDefinitionsComponent\n    [selectedTargetDefs]=\"targetDetailList$ | async\"\n    [workspaceId]=\"workspaceId\"\n    moduleId=\"portfolio-details-target-definitions\"\n    [isDoubleHeaderHeight]=\"true\"\n    [multiGridView]=\"true\"\n    [selectedDefinitionCount]=\"false\"\n  ></pm-ui-target-definitions>\n</div>\n```\nThis is a custom component `pm-ui-target-definitions` that displays target definitions in a grid view. The component is bound to the `selectedTargetDefs"

The `workspaceId` property is also bound, as well as several other properties that configure the component's behavior and appearance.\n```csharp\n<div\n  class=\"portfolio-exposures-container pm-ui-combined-grid-container__splitter-horizontal\"\n  slot=\"1\"\n>\n  <div *ngIf=\"showTemplate$ | async\">\n    <pm-ui-widget>\n      <pm-ui-widget-header pmUiWidgetHeader></pm-ui-widget-header>\n      <div class=\"portfolio-exposures-placeholder\" pmUiWidgetContent>\n        To view one or more targets against a portfolio, select and load from the subscribed\n        targets on top.\n      </div>\n    </pm-ui-widget>\n  </div>\n  <div *ngIf=\"!(showTemplate$ | async)\" class=\"portfolio-target-filter\">\n    <span>\n      <pm-ui-view-filter\n        data-cy=\"pm-ui-portfolio-target-view-filter\"\n        moduleId=\"portfolio-target-details-view-filter\"\n        [workspaceId]=\"workspaceId\"\n        [isFaceted]=\"true\"\n        [subscribeToUpdates]=\"true\"\n        (valuesChanged)=\"onValuesChanged($event)\"\n      ></pm-ui-view-filter>\n    </span>\n    <span class=\"aggregation-checkbox\">\n      <aux-checkbox\n        data-cy=\"aggregation-checkbox\"\n        [label]=\"'Show Target Level Aggregation'\"\n        [isChecked]=\"false\"\n        [disabled]=\"!(showTemplate$ | async)\"\n        (checkboxChanged)=\"onTargetLevelAggregationEnabled($event)\"\n      ></aux-checkbox\n    ></span>\n  </div>\n  <pm-ui-portfolio-exposures\n    *ngIf=\"!(showTemplate$ | async)\"\n    data-cy=\"pm-ui-portfolio-target-content-exposure\"\n    name=\"Portfolio Exposures\"\n    [workspaceId]=\"workspaceId\"\n    moduleId=\"portfolio-details-multi-target\"\n    [showTargetName]=\"true\"\n    [showActiveExposuresOnly]=\"portfolioDetailsStoreService.showActiveExposuresOnly$ | async\"\n    [highlightingThreshold]=\"portfolioDetailsStoreService.highlightingThreshold$ | async\"\n    [selectedPortfolios]=\"selectedSubscriptionPortfolio\"\n    [allSubscribedPortfolios]=\"selectedPortfolios\"\n    [targetDefinitions]=\"targetDetailList$ | async\"\n    [childTargetDefinitions]=\"targetDetailsOverrideMap\"\n    [activeExposureSelection]=\"activeExposureSelection$ | async\"\n    [processPositionUpdateOnPortfolioSelectionChange]=\"false\"\n    (selectedActiveExposures)=\"onActiveExposuresSelected($event)\"\n    (selectedRows)=\"onSelectedTargetDefinitions($event)\"\n    (editedExposureRows)=\"onEditedExposureRows($event)\"\n  ></pm-ui-portfolio-exposures>\n</div>\n```\nThis is another custom component `pm-ui-portfolio-exposures` that displays portfolio exposures for one or more targets. The component is bound to several properties, including the `workspaceId`, `targetDetailList$`, `selectedSubscriptionPortfolio`, and `activeExposureSelection$` observables. The component also emits events when the user interacts with it, such as selecting active exposures, selecting rows, or editing exposure rows.\n```python\n<div class=\"footer\">\n  <div class=\"actions-container\">\n    <p class=\"footer-text\">Targets {{ targetsStatus }}</p>\n    <aux-button\n      class=\"footer-left-item\"\n      type=\"secondary\"\n      label=\"Save Changes\"\n      data-cy=\"pm-ui-portfolio-targets-save-changes-button\"\n      (click)=\"onSaveChangesClicked()\"\n      [isDisabled]=\"disableSaveChanges\"\n    ></aux-button>\n    <aux-button\n      class=\"footer-left-item\"\n      type=\"secondary\"\n```"
