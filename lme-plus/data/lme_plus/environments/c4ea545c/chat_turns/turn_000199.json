  "content": "The Reprocessed ViewFlex Xtra Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) Catheter is intended for use in adolescent and adult patients for visualization of cardiac structures and blood flow within the heart. The device boasts a 64-element phased array transducer and 4-way steering capabilities, which can be controlled through the handle featuring two deflection mechanisms corresponding to the movement of the distal shaft in four planes. This version of the catheter is identical to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version offered by Abbott Laboratories, but has undergone sterilization and processing by Sterlimed prior to reuse.\n\nThe ergonomic handle of the Reprocessed ViewFlex Xtra ICE Catheter is designed for single-handed operation with an auto-lock steering mechanism, reducing the need for catheter repositioning. The two deflection mechanisms allow for optimal viewing in four planes, in line with the movement of the distal shaft. The catheter is compatible with ViewMate II, ViewMate Z, ViewMate, and Philips CX50 ultrasound consoles when used with a compatible ViewFlex Catheter interface module.",
