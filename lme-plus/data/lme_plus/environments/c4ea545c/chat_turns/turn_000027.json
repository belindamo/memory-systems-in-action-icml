  "content": "Certainly! Here is an excerpt from William of Tyre's \"A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea\" describing the incident involving Reynald de Chatillon and the Patriarch of Antioch:\n\n\"In the year of the Lord 1182, Reynald, lord of the castle of Kerak, which is situated between the territories of Jerusalem and Damascus, took prisoner the lord Aimery, patriarch of Antioch, who, as is commonly known, was at that time coming to Jerusalem to visit the tomb of our Lord. When this became known to the king, he was sorely grieved, not only because of the scandal which the patriarch's capture would cause in the Christian world, but also because he had reason to fear that a man so bold and impetuous as Reynald would not scruple to commit many other excesses in his vicinity. The king, therefore, sent envoys to Reynald, demanding that he should set the patriarch at liberty. Reynald's reply was that he was quite ready to do so, provided that the king would pay him a sum of money which he named. The king replied that he was willing to pay a reasonable ransom, but that he could not agree to the exorbitant sum demanded by Reynald. At length, however, through the intervention of many persons of high rank, the patriarch was set at liberty upon payment of a large sum of money.\" (Book XVII, Chapter 20)\n\nI hope this quote provides the clarity you were seeking. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
