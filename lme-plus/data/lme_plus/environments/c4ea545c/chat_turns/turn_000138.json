I used this time to reflect everything that has been going on in 2022, all the good things, all the bad things, the easy and the hard things.\n\nAnd now, 1 month later I feel refreshed, like a completely recharged and different person, and that\u2019s what traveling does to you, it recharges your soul.\n\nYou see new things, new cultures, new places, new people and all those are like reading a new book!\n\nSo I advise any creator and solopreneur out there to take some time off and travel as much as you can, wherever you can!\n\nAnd I wish you a happy 2023 \ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73 May this year be full of joy, success, and happiness for you and your families\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9c\n\nYours,\nGent\ud83d\udc9c - rewrite andmake it better",
