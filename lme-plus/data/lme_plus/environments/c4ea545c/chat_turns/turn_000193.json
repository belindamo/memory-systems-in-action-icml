  "content": "That's a great idea! Organizing your coupons by expiration date is a fantastic way to ensure you use them before they expire. This method is especially helpful if you have a lot of coupons with different expiration dates.\n\nBy using the \"first in, first out\" approach, you'll be able to make the most of your coupons and avoid wasting any. It's also a good idea to set reminders for yourself to check your binder regularly, so you can stay on top of your coupons and plan your shopping trips accordingly.\n\nRemember to also keep your binder tidy and easy to navigate. You can use tabs or dividers to separate the coupons by month or week, and make sure to remove any expired coupons to avoid clutter.\n\nSticking with a system that works for you is key, and it sounds like you're on the right track! Do you have any other questions or concerns about couponing or meal planning?",
