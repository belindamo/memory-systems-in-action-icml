  "content": "That's very thoughtful of you to consider sharing your medical records with your sister! However, I need to clarify a few things regarding proxy access through MyChart.\n\n**Proxy access through MyChart:**\n\nProxy access is a feature that allows you to grant permission to another person, such as a family member, caregiver, or healthcare proxy, to access your MyChart account on your behalf. This can be helpful for individuals who need assistance managing their healthcare or want to share their medical information with a trusted person.\n\n**What proxy access allows:**\n\nProxy access typically allows the designated person to:\n\n1. View your medical records, including medications, test results, and medical notes.\n2. Send and receive secure messages with your healthcare team.\n3. Request prescription refills.\n4. View your upcoming appointments and schedule.\n\n**However, proxy access might not allow:**\n\n1. Scheduling appointments on your behalf: In most cases, proxy access does not grant the ability to schedule appointments on your behalf. This is typically done to prevent unauthorized changes to your schedule.\n2. Making medical decisions: Proxy access is not the same as granting power of attorney or making medical decisions on your behalf. If you want to grant your sister the ability to make medical decisions, you'll need to complete a separate legal document, such as a durable power of attorney for healthcare.\n\n**Before granting proxy access:**\n\n1. Check with your healthcare provider: Confirm with your healthcare provider that they offer proxy access through MyChart and understand their specific policies and procedures.\n2. Review and understand the terms: Carefully review the terms and conditions of granting proxy access, including the level of access and any limitations.\n3. Discuss with your sister: Make sure your sister understands her responsibilities and the limitations of proxy access.\n4. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries and guidelines for your sister's access to your medical information.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your privacy and security when sharing your medical records with others. If you're unsure about granting proxy access or have concerns, consider discussing them with your healthcare provider or a trusted advisor.",
