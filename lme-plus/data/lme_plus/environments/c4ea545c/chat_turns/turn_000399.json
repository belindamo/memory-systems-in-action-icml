  "content": "It sounds like you learned a lot of valuable skills in the workshop, and it's great to hear that you're applying them to your own photography practice. The rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing are all essential composition techniques that can make a big difference in the quality of your photos. And playing with light and shadow can add so much depth and interest to an image.\n\nMoMA is an excellent destination for photography enthusiasts, and their collection is one of the most comprehensive in the world. They regularly rotate their exhibits, so there's always something new to see.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff, MoMA has a few photography exhibits and installations coming up that might interest you:\n\n1. **\"Dorothea Lange: Words & Pictures\"** (February 2023 - May 2023): This exhibit explores the work of Dorothea Lange, a pioneering documentary photographer who captured some of the most iconic images of the Great Depression.\n2. **\"Susan Meiselas: On the Frontline\"** (March 2023 - July 2023): This retrospective showcases the work of Susan Meiselas, a Magnum photographer known for her powerful and intimate portraits of conflict, human rights, and social justice.\n3. **\"New Photography 2023\"** (May 2023 - September 2023): This annual exhibit features the work of emerging and established photographers, showcasing a diverse range of styles, themes, and techniques.\n\nPlease note that exhibit dates and titles are subject to change, so it's always a good idea to check MoMA's website or social media for the most up-to-date information.\n\nI hope you enjoy your visit to MoMA and get to see some amazing photography exhibits!",
