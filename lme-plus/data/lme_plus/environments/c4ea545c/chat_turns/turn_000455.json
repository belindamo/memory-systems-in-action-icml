  "content": "Thank you for sharing this information with me. It is clear that the therapist in these examples is using a number of strategies to help the patient engage with the ideal parent figure imagery and work towards attachment repair. Some of these strategies include:\n\n* Emphasizing the qualities of being of the ideal parent figures, rather than their actions\n* Helping the patient to establish a calm, relaxed state of awareness as the foundation for the IPF work\n* Responding to the patient's experience in a way that shows attunement and reinforces the experience of the IPFs\n* Pointing the patient's attention towards the attachment-promoting qualities of the IPFs and mirroring and enhancing the patient's descriptions of those qualities\n* Validating the patient's experience and encouraging the patient to express and explore their feelings and needs\n* Helping the patient to identify and connect with the needs and desires that underlie the imagery, in order to promote a deeper sense of security.",
