  "content": "the general principles of secure attachment formation; and introducing qualities that are the positive opposites of the problematic aspects of the particular patient\u2019s experiences with his or her actual parents.\n\nCorrect for instrumental caretaking by suggesting underlying attachment-promoting qualities. Within the IPF protocol, the therapist often must mirror differentially between what the patient experiences and what among those experiences best supports the formation of secure attachment representations. For example, it is quite common for patients to describe the parent figures engaging in instrumental actions, such as cooking a meal, reading a bedtime story, or playing a game. Even though such actions may be with and for the child in the imagery, it should not be assumed that the actions are done with qualities of being that promote attachment security. Doing \u201call the right things\u201d for a child can be partially or completely devoid of attunement, soothing, delight, support for exploration, and even some aspects of protection. Many insecurely attached patients had parents who objectively did \u201call the right things.\u201d\n\nWhen a patient reports that the parent figures are doing something for him or her, the therapist acknowledges that action, mirroring that it\u2019s present, and then either points attention to or suggests positive, attachment-promoting qualities of being from which the figures are engaging in that doing. For example:\n\nPatient: We\u2019re in the kitchen and my mother is making dinner for me. She seems happy.\n\nTherapist: Yes. Notice what it is about her that lets you know how happy she is to be making dinner for you. She doesn\u2019t want to be anywhere other than there with you now, and she\u2019s happy to be making for you what she knows you enjoy so much.\n\nIn this example, the therapist mirrored both the action of the mother figure making dinner and the patient\u2019s sense that the mother was happy. The therapist also went beyond the patient\u2019s objective statements and suggested that the mother figure was rather than seemed happy, and that the source of her happiness was that she was \u201cmaking dinner for you,\u201d \u201cthere with you now,\u201d and \u201cmaking for you what she knows you enjoy so much.\u201d This linking of the action, the affective state, and the relationship provided both mirroring and suggestive shaping of the imagery toward more attachment-promoting forms.\n\nHere is another example:\n\nPatient: My mother is brushing my hair.\n\nTherapist: And you can feel from her that she\u2019s right there with you, soothing you and brushing your hair with such love for you. You can really feel her interest, and her caring, and her love through the ways she\u2019s with you, whether she\u2019s doing something for you or just simply being with you.\n\nIn this example, too, the therapist mirrored the mother figure\u2019s action and then made suggestions that the action was done from and with specific attachment-promoting qualities of being.\n\nSuggest that the imagined parent figures have qualities that are known in general to support secure attachment. In response to particular attachment-promoting qualities not being included in a patient\u2019s descriptions of the parent figures, the therapist includes suggestions of those qualities, drawing from the \u201cfour general factors\u201d and the behavioral components of the \u201cfive conditions that promote secure attachment.\u201d Some possibilities, from each of these categories, are as follows, with key elements underlined:\n\nGeneral Factors\n\nPHYSICAL PRESENCE\n\n\u2022 These parents are genuinely accessible to you.\n\n\u2022 You can count on these parents to be with you when you need them.\n\n\u2022 This is a special relationship in which they are reasonably available to you when you need them to be.\n\nCONSISTENCY\n\n\u2022 These parents are consistent in their ways of being with you over time.\n\n\u2022 These parents know what helps you to feel secure and safe, and they consistently provide that for you every time you\u2019re with them.\n\n\u2022 You come to know these parents and their helpful ways of being with you.\n\nRELIABILITY",
