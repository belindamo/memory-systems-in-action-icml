  "content": "Yes, the optimal water temperature range for perch breeding is usually between 9 - 18\u00b0C (48 - 64\u00b0F). However, the exact temperature range can vary depending on the specific species of perch and other environmental factors such as the light intensity and dissolved oxygen levels. Typically, perch breeding activity starts when the water temperature reaches 9-10\u00b0C (48-50\u00b0F) in the spring, and it usually ceases when the water temperature goes above 18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F) during the summer. The temperature range and timing are important for creating optimal conditions for perch egg fertilization and subsequent successful hatch.",
