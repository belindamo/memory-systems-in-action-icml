  "content": ", I recommended that the client restate their financial statements to reflect the correct revenue recognition. Additionally, I also suggested the client to establish a proper revenue recognition policy and ensure that all future revenue recognition is done in accordance with the accounting standards\"\n\n5. \"I evaluated the evidence collected from a client's fixed assets by performing a physical inspection of the assets, comparing the findings to the amounts reported in the financial statements, and reviewing the client's depreciation policies to ensure accuracy. For example, I found that the client had reported a higher value for one of their fixed assets than the physical inspection revealed. After investigating further, I discovered that the client had not properly recorded the accumulated depreciation for the asset, resulting in an overstatement of the asset value. I recommended that the client adjust their financial statements to reflect the correct value of the fixed asset and review their depreciation policies to prevent similar errors in the future.\"\n\nOverall, as a ACCA student, these are some of the examples of how I, as an auditor or assurance professional, would collect and evaluate evidence for an audit or assurance engagement, and reflect the working activities of some elements of this objective.",
