  "content": "I did notice a difference in how I felt during the scenes. I felt more relaxed and confident, and my scene partners seemed to respond more positively to me as well. It was like we were all feeding off each other's energy and creating this cohesive, natural performance.\n\nAnd actually, yeah, I have been trying to apply this mindset to other areas of my life. Like, I've been doing some volunteer work backstage at a children's theater production, and I found myself getting anxious about making mistakes. But then I remembered what our instructor said about trusting my instincts, and I took a deep breath and just focused on the task at hand. It really helped me stay calm and focused.\n\nBy the way, speaking of theater productions, I'm thinking of putting together a short play with some friends. We're still brainstorming ideas, but we're considering something by Samuel Beckett. Have you got any experience with his work?",
