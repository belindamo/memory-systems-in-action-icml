Storing coupons can be a challenge, but there are several methods that can help you keep them tidy and ensure they don't expire or get lost. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Binder System**: You're already using a binder, which is a great start! You can organize your coupons by category (e.g., food, household, personal care), expiration date, or alphabetically. Use clear plastic sleeves or pocket pages to protect your coupons and make them easy to flip through.\n2. **Coupon Box or File**: Consider using a small file box or a coupon organizer box with separate compartments. This can help keep your coupons organized and easy to access. You can label each compartment by category or expiration date.\n3. **Envelope System**: Divide your coupons into envelopes based on the store or category. For example, you could have an envelope for grocery store coupons, one for drugstore coupons, and another for restaurant coupons.\n4. **Coupon App**: Consider using a coupon app like Fetch Rewards, Ibotta, or RetailMeNot. These apps allow you to digitally store and organize your coupons, and some even offer additional features like expiration date reminders and coupon matching.\n5. **Spreadsheet or Digital List**: If you're comfortable with digital organization, you can create a spreadsheet or list on your phone or computer to track your coupons. This can help you quickly see what coupons you have, their expiration dates, and which ones you've used.\n\nTips to avoid losing or expiring coupons:\n\n* Check your coupons regularly to ensure they're not expired or about to expire.\n* Set reminders for coupons that are nearing their expiration dates.\n* Keep your coupon storage system in a convenient location, like near your purse or wallet, so you can easily access it when you're planning your shopping trip.\n* Consider implementing a \"first in, first out\" rule, where you use the oldest coupons first to avoid expiration.\n\nWhich method do you think you might try? Or do you have any other questions about coupon organization?",
