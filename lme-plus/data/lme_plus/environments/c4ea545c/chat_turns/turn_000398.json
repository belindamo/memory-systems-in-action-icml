  "content": "I learned about the rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing, which were all really helpful in improving my composition skills. We also did some exercises on playing with light and shadow, which was really interesting. Our instructor gave us some great tips on how to use natural light and artificial light to create different moods and effects.\n\nI've been trying to apply what I learned to my own photography, especially when I'm out taking photos of the city or landscapes. It's amazing how much of a difference it makes when you're mindful of composition and lighting. I feel like my photos have improved a lot since taking the workshop.\n\nBy the way, speaking of photography, I've been thinking about visiting the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) to check out their photography collection. Have you heard about any new exhibits or installations they might have coming up?",
