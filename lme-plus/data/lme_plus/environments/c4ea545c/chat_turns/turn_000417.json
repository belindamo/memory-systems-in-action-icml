Here are some key facts about its mintage and rarity:\n\n**Mintage:** The 1972 Doubled Die Cent is a error coin that occurred during the production of Lincoln cents at the Philadelphia Mint. The exact mintage is unknown, but it's estimated to be around 250,000 to 500,000 coins.\n\n**Rarity:** The 1972 Doubled Die Cent is considered a rare and highly valuable coin. On the Sheldon scale, which grades coins from 1 to 70, a mint-state (MS) 1972 Doubled Die Cent can range from MS-60 to MS-68. The rarity of the coin is due to the fact that the error was caught relatively early in the production process, and many of the coins were likely melted down or destroyed.\n\n**Value:** The value of a 1972 Doubled Die Cent can vary greatly depending on its condition, grade, and rarity. In mint state, values can range from a few hundred dollars to over $10,000. Even circulated examples in good condition can fetch several hundred dollars.\n\n**Identification:** To identify a 1972 Doubled Die Cent, look for a doubling of the \"2\" in the date, as well as a slight doubling of the words \"LIBERTY\" and \"IN GOD WE TRUST\" on the obverse (front) side of the coin. The doubling should be more pronounced on the \"2\" than on the other features.\n\n**Authenticity:** Be cautious when purchasing a 1972 Doubled Die Cent, as counterfeits exist. Make sure to buy from a reputable dealer or have the coin authenticated by a third-party grading service like PCGS or NGC.\n\nI hope this information helps! Enjoy your new vintage camera, and happy collecting!",
