  "content": "I'd be happy to help you plan out your week and allocate tasks to specific days.\n\nTo get started, let's break down the tasks you want to prioritize into categories. You mentioned meal prep and admin stuff, but are there any other tasks you need to fit into your weekly routine? For example:\n\n* Work/school commitments\n* Exercise or self-care activities\n* Household chores\n* Personal projects or hobbies\n* Social commitments (e.g., meetings, appointments, social events)\n\nOnce we have a comprehensive list of tasks, we can start assigning them to specific days of the week.\n\nAlso, consider your personal preferences and schedule:\n\n* Are you a morning person or a night owl?\n* Do you have any fixed commitments on certain days (e.g., work shifts, classes, etc.)?\n* Are there any days when you tend to have more energy or focus?\n\nLet's get started! Share your tasks and preferences, and I'll help you create a personalized plan for your week.",
