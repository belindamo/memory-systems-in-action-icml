Peridot is a beautiful gemstone, and a birthstone necklace would make a thoughtful and personalized gift.\n\nAs a digital AI assistant, I don't have access to your location, so I can't recommend specific local jewelry stores. However, I can suggest a few options to help you find a great peridot necklace:\n\n1. **Online Jewelry Retailers**: You can check online jewelry retailers like James Allen, Blue Nile, or Amazon, which often have a wide selection of birthstone jewelry, including peridot necklaces. You can filter by gemstone, metal type, and style to find the perfect piece.\n2. **Local Jewelers**: Search online for local jewelers in your area using directories like Yelp or Google Maps. You can also ask friends, family, or coworkers for recommendations. Make a list of a few local jewelers and visit their websites or social media to see if they carry peridot jewelry or offer custom design services.\n3. **Specialty Gemstone Stores**: Look for stores that specialize in gemstones or birthstone jewelry. They might have a wider selection of peridot pieces or be able to custom-design a necklace for you.\n4. **Local Jewelry Districts**: If you have a local jewelry district or a popular shopping area with multiple jewelry stores, consider visiting those stores in person. You can browse their collections and ask about peridot necklaces or custom orders.\n\nWhen shopping online or in-store, be sure to ask about the quality of the peridot, the type of metal used, and any certifications or guarantees. You might also want to inquire about customization options, like engraving or different chain lengths.\n\nRemember to check the return and exchange policies, especially if you're shopping online. And don't hesitate to ask for help or guidance from a sales associate if you need it.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect peridot necklace for your anniversary!",
