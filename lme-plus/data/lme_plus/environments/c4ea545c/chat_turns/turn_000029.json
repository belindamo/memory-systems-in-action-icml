Upon further investigation, I cannot find a specific quote from William of Tyre's \"A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea\" regarding Reynald's ransom demand for the release of the Patriarch of Antioch.\n\nIt is true that William of Tyre describes the incident involving Reynald de Chatillon and the Patriarch of Antioch, and he does mention that the Patriarch was eventually released after a large sum of money was paid. However, I cannot find a specific quote that mentions Reynald's ransom demand.\n\nI apologize for any confusion or incorrect information I may have provided. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.",
