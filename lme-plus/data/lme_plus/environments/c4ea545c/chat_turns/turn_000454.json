  "content": "creating attachment security. We know in general what the qualities of being are that promote secure attachment, but each patient will have unique needs for particular configurations and weighting of those qualities. By initially not hearing specific qualities named by the therapist, the patient is primed to access his or her unique needs, which will then be projected as qualities into the construction of the imagined parents, making them \u201cideal\u201d for that particular patient. In this way, the patient\u2019s parent figures have as their foundation the qualities that come from the patient\u2019s deepest knowing of what was most missing during childhood and thus what in the present will best provide for attachment repair.\n\nSHAPE THE PATIENT\u2019S IMAGERY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nThroughout the protocol, the therapist frequently asks the patient to describe the parent figures and his or her experiences of them. The therapist\u2019s responses to the patient\u2019s descriptions include pointing the patient\u2019s attention toward the attachment-promoting qualities of the imagined parent figures and mirroring and enhancing the patient\u2019s descriptions of those qualities. By recognizing and reinforcing these qualities, the patient\u2019s imagery and experience is shaped toward the inner conditions that most efficiently create attachment security.\n\nPoint the patient\u2019s attention to the attachment-promoting qualities of his or her imagined parent figures. Fundamental to this protocol is the patient\u2019s deeply felt experience of the imagined parent figures being and behaving in ways that promote attachment security. Ideally, then, the patient\u2019s attention stays primarily focused on those ways and on his or her felt experience in response. The therapist promotes this attentiveness by frequently making statements such as the following:\n\nNotice the ways that they\u2019re being with you.\n\nNotice how they\u2019re being with you now.\n\nNotice the ways that they\u2019re being with you that feel so very right for you and for your well-being.\n\nNotice the ways that they\u2019re being with you that help you to feel such a clear and strong sense of security with them.\n\nNotice what effect their ways of being with you have on your inner state of being.\n\nNotice how you feel as they\u2019re with you in all the ways that you most need and in all the ways that are so very right for you and your wellbeing.\n\nExpressed throughout the protocol, these statements help the patient to stay on task. In addition to pointing attention to particular aspects of the imagery and the patient\u2019s experience of it, such statements reinforce the creative and generative aspect of the process, encouraging the patient to be curious and open to what will be produced by staying engaged with the imagery.\n\nMirror and enhance the patient\u2019s descriptions of the attachment-promoting qualities of the imagined parent figures. The therapist listens carefully to the patient\u2019s descriptions of the parent figures and chooses to reinforce anything that is consistent with qualities that promote secure attachment. At first, the imagery might be somewhat vague and the patient might be tentative about experiencing it and/or reporting it. Hearing the therapist use the patient\u2019s same words and descriptions with an affirming tone will ratify the imagery and strengthen the patient\u2019s confidence in the imagery and in the overall process. Mirroring also helps to keep attention on the beneficial qualities of the parent figures and the patient\u2019s immediate, felt experience of them.\n\nIt is very important that the therapist use the patient\u2019s words and phrases; then, building upon the patient\u2019s literal expressions, the therapist may incorporate other, closely related words and phrases that are consistent with the principle or spirit of what the patient says. Some examples are as follows:\n\nPatient: They\u2019re both very interactive with me. The mother is reaching out to me; the father isn\u2019t, but he has his own ways of engaging with me. I feel they want to be doing what they\u2019re doing. I just feel they want to be with me.\n\nTherapist: Yes, they really want to be with you, and they engage with you in their own ways. And you can really take in how good it feels that they want to be with you.",
