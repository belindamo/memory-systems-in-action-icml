Controlling algae growth can be a challenge, but with some tips and a little patience, you can get it under control.\n\nFirst, let's address the new fish introduction. It's possible that the new additions could be contributing to the algae growth, but it's not the sole culprit. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Biological load**: The new fish have increased the biological load in your tank, which means they're producing more waste. This excess waste can fuel algae growth.\n2. **Water changes**: During the quarantine period, you might have been doing more frequent water changes, which could have removed excess nutrients. After introducing the new fish, you might not be doing as many water changes, allowing nutrients to build up.\n\nNow, let's dive into some general tips to help control algae growth:\n\n1. **Regular water changes**: Aim for 10-15% water changes weekly to remove excess nutrients and prevent their buildup.\n2. **Monitor water parameters**: Keep an eye on ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels. High nitrate levels can contribute to algae growth. Perform regular water tests to ensure your tank's water parameters are within safe ranges.\n3. **Maintain good water circulation**: Ensure your tank has adequate water circulation to prevent stagnant areas where algae can thrive.\n4. **Provide adequate filtration**: Make sure your filter is properly maintained and capable of handling the biological load of your tank.\n5. **Control lighting**: Excessive lighting can promote algae growth. Consider reducing the duration or intensity of your lighting, especially if you're using high-output lights.\n6. **Limit food**: Avoid overfeeding, as excess food can contribute to algae growth. Only feed your fish what they can consume within a few minutes.\n7. **Add algae-controlling measures**: Consider adding algae-controlling elements like algae-scrubbing fish (e.g., Amano shrimp or Otocinclus catfish), algae-absorbing media, or algae-preventing supplements.\n8. **Clean your tank regularly**: Regularly clean your tank's glass, decorations, and substrate to remove algae and prevent its spread.\n9. **Consider a algae-preventing substrate**: Some substrates, like those containing zeolite or phosphate-removing materials, can help reduce algae growth.\n10. **Be patient**: Algae control is an ongoing process. It may take some time to get your tank balanced, so be patient and persistent.\n\nTo address the algae growth specifically, you can try the following:\n\n* Perform a larger water change (20-25%) to remove excess nutrients.\n* Increase water circulation by adjusting your powerheads or adding additional circulation devices.\n* Reduce lighting duration or intensity for a few days to starve the algae.\n* Add an algae-absorbing media or algae-preventing supplement to your filter.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you should be able to get your algae growth under control. Remember to monitor your tank's water parameters and make adjustments as needed. Good luck!",
