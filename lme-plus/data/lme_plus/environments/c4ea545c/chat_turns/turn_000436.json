I think I'll start with \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" since I've been meaning to read it for a while now. I've heard great things about Junot D\u00edaz's writing style and the way he weaves together different narratives.\n\nBy the way, I've been thinking about starting a book journal to keep track of all the books I've read and the authors I've met. Do you have any tips on how to get started with that? I feel like it would be a great way to reflect on my reading journey and remember the fascinating people I've met along the way.",
