Having some cash on hand is a good idea, especially since not all places in Japan accept credit cards.\n\nYou're right that some traditional shops, restaurants, and vending machines might not accept credit cards, so it's always a good idea to have some cash handy. Additionally, some smaller towns and rural areas might have limited ATM access, so it's a good idea to have some cash for emergencies.\n\nJust remember to inform your bank of your travel plans, so they don't flag your transactions as suspicious. And don't forget to check your bank's foreign transaction fees and exchange rates to minimize any extra charges.\n\nYou're all set for your trip to Tokyo! Enjoy your time in Japan, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further assistance.\n\nSayonara for now, and happy travels!",
