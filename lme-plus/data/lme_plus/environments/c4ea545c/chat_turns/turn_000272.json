  "content": "I cannot speculate about the internal strategies of blumhouse productions as i do not have access to their information. however, changes in regulation may impact the film industry in general, such as changes to content ratings or copyright laws, which could affect distribution strategies. for instance, stricter content regulations may require blumhouse to release films in specific territories or on certain platforms to comply with laws, while changes to copyright laws may give the company more or fewer options for distribution channels. ultimately, the influence of changes in regulation would depend on the specific laws and regulations affecting the film industry at the time.",
