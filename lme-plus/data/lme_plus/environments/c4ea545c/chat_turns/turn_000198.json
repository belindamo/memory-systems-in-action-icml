Don't change much other than the structure of some sentences and word choice. Keep the over all structure and facts the same.\n\n\nThe Reprocessed ViewFlex Xtra Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) Catheter is designed to be inserted into the heart to visualize cardiac structures and blood flow within the heart in adolescent and adult patients. The device features a 64-element phased array transducer as well as 4-way steering that is controllable via the device's handle with two deflection mechanisms that correspond with the movement of the distal shaft in the four planes of movement, which enables optimal viewing planes. This reprocessed device is identical to the OEM version offered by Abbott Laboratories but is sterilized and treated by Sterlimed before being reused. The catheter is intended to have an ergonomic handle with auto-lock steering that is designed to allow for single-handed operation, minimizing catheter repositioning. Furthermore, the handle has two deflection mechanisms that correspond with the movement of the distal shaft in the four planes of movement, which is intended to enable optimal viewing planes.\n\nThe Reprocessed ViewFlex Xtra Ice Catheter is compatible with ViewMate II, ViewMate Z or ViewMate and Philips CX50 ultrasound consoles via the use of a compatible ViewFlex Catheter interface module.2 / 2",
