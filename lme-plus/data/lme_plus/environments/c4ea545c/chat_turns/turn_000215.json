  "content": "1. \"As an ACCA trainee, I carried out an internal audit for a client's purchasing department. During the engagement, I collected evidence by reviewing the client's purchase orders and comparing them to the corresponding vendor invoices. I also conducted interviews with employees to understand their roles and responsibilities in the purchasing process. After analyzing the evidence, I formed an opinion on the effectiveness of the client's internal controls and procedures for ensuring compliance with company policies. I demonstrated professional scepticism by questioning any unusual or high-value transactions and making sure that my judgements were based on sufficient valid evidence.\"\n2. \"I carried out an external audit for a client's financial statements. I collected evidence by reviewing the client's financial records, such as bank statements, ledgers, and journal entries. I also performed test of controls and substantive procedures to ensure the accuracy of the financial statements. After evaluating the evidence, I formed an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements and issued an audit report with my findings. Through out the engagement I demonstrated professional scepticism by challenging the assumptions and estimates made by management and ensuring that my judgement were based on sufficient valid evidence.\"\n3. \"I performed an assurance engagement for a client's IT system. I collected evidence by reviewing the client's IT policies and procedures, performing walkthroughs of the IT system, and testing the controls in place. After evaluating the evidence, I formed an opinion on the effectiveness of the client's IT controls and issued a report with my findings. During the engagement I demonstrated professional scepticism by challenging the existing controls and procedures and ensuring that my judgement were based on sufficient valid evidence.\"\n\nOverall, these are examples of how I, as an ACCA student, would carry out an internal or external audit or assurance engagement, collect evidence, form an opinion and demonstrate professional scepticism while making sure that judgements are based on sufficient valid evidence.",
