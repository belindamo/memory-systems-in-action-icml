  "content": "We're still in the brainstorming phase, so we haven't settled on a specific play yet. We're all fans of Beckett's unique style and tone, so we're thinking of staying true to that. But at the same time, we want to make it our own and bring a fresh perspective to the material.\n\nI think what draws us to Beckett is the way he explores the human condition and the absurdity of life. His plays are so rich and complex, and there's always something new to discover. We're excited to dive in and see what we can create.\n\nBy the way, have you heard about any upcoming theater productions or workshops in the area? I'm always looking to stay involved in the community and learn from other artists.",
