  "content": "1. Production and distribution adjustments:\nBeer industries globally had to adjust their production schedules and distribution strategies to minimize losses. They had to plan for reduced production and focus on distributing high-performing products.\n\n2. Shift from draught to packaged beers:\nWith restrictions on public gatherings and closures of bars and pubs, the demand for draught beer reduced significantly. As a result, beer industries shifted their focus to packaged beer, such as cans and bottles, making it more available in supermarkets, online stores, and delivery services.\n\n3. Safety measures in breweries:\nBreweries implemented safety measures such as social distancing, sanitization, and temperature checks to ensure the safety of their employees and customers. Some limited on-site activities and restricted access to the facilities, while others implemented remote working arrangements.\n\n4. Online sales and delivery:\nWith COVID-19 forcing people to stay indoors, beer industries globally took to online sales and delivery. Breweries that had established online platforms experienced a significant increase in sales as people opted to buy beer online instead of physically visiting stores.\n\n5. Charitable efforts:\nSome breweries took part in charitable activities such as producing hand sanitizer, providing free beer to healthcare workers, and donating funds to COVID-19 relief activities.",
