The game's soundtrack features a mix of electronic, rock, and hip-hop tracks from various artists, while the score is a haunting and atmospheric blend of synth-heavy music that perfectly captures the game's cyberpunk vibe.\n\nAs for accessing the soundtrack and score outside of the game, yes, there are a few ways to do so!\n\nThe official soundtrack for Cyberpunk 2077 is available on various music streaming platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music.
