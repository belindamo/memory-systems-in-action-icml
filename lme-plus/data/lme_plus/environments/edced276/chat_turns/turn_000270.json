Here are some marinating time and temperature recommendations to help you achieve tender, flavorful results:\n\n**Marinating Times and Temperatures:**\n\n**Chicken:**\n\n* **Boneless, skinless chicken breasts:** 2-4 hours at room temperature (68\u00b0F - 72\u00b0F / 20\u00b0C - 22\u00b0C) or 4-6 hours in the refrigerator (39\u00b0F - 41\u00b0F / 4\u00b0C - 5\u00b0C)\n* **Chicken thighs or drumsticks:** 4-6 hours at room temperature or 6-8 hours in the refrigerator\n* **Whole chicken:** 6-8 hours at room temperature or 8-12 hours in the refrigerator\n\n**Pork:**\n\n* **Pork chops:** 2-4 hours at room temperature or 4-6 hours in the refrigerator\n* **Pork tenderloin:** 2-4 hours at room temperature or 4-6 hours in the refrigerator\n* **Pulled pork (shoulder or butt):** 6-8 hours at room temperature or 8-12 hours in the refrigerator\n\n**General Guidelines:**\n\n* Always marinate in the refrigerator if you're planning to marinate for more than 4 hours.\n* If you're short on time, you can marinate at room temperature for 2-4 hours, but make sure to keep the meat at a safe temperature (above 40\u00b0F / 4\u00b0C) to prevent bacterial growth.\n* Acidic ingredients like vinegar or citrus juice can help break down the proteins, making the meat more tender. However, be cautious not to over-marinate, as this can lead to mushy or tough meat.\n* Always pat the meat dry with paper towels before grilling or cooking to prevent flare-ups and promote even browning.\n\n**Grilling and Cooking:**\n\n* Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 375\u00b0F / 190\u00b0C).\n* Grill the meat for 5-7 minutes per side, or until it reaches the recommended internal temperature:\n\t+ Chicken: 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C)\n\t+ Pork: 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C)\n* Let the meat rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To enhance the Korean-Style Gochujang BBQ Sauce flavor, you can add other aromatics like minced garlic, grated ginger, or sliced green onions to the marinade.\n* For a spicy kick, increase the amount of gochujang in the sauce or add some diced Korean chili peppers (gochugaru) to the marinade.\n* Experiment with different types of wood chips or chunks, like apple or cherry, to add smoky flavor to your grilled meats.\n\nNow that you have the marinating and grilling guidelines, go ahead and fire up your grill! I hope your Korean-Style Gochujang BBQ Sauce creations turn out deliciously spicy and savory!",
