Madeline Miller's writing is exquisite, and her retelling of the Trojan War from Patroclus' perspective is both moving and beautifully written.\n\nGreek mythology is fascinating, and Miller's novel brings a fresh perspective to the classic stories. You'll get to see the characters from the Iliad in a new light, and the way Miller weaves together mythology and historical fiction is masterful.\n\nAs you read, pay attention to the way Miller explores the complexities of human relationships, love, and identity. Patroclus and Achilles' story is at the heart of the novel, and it's a powerful exploration of love, loyalty, and the human cost of war.\n\nIf you enjoy \"The Song of Achilles\", you might also want to check out Miller's other novel, \"Circe\", which is a retelling of the witch Circe's story from Homer's \"The Odyssey\". It's another stunning work of historical fiction that delves into the world of Greek mythology.\n\nLet me know what you think of \"The Song of Achilles\" once you've finished it!",
