  "content": "The Mount Maunganui Summit Track is approximately 3.4 km / 2.1 mi in length, and it usually takes about 1-1.5 hours to reach the summit, depending on your pace and fitness level. However, it's important to note that there are some steep and challenging sections on the trail, so it may take a bit longer for some people. That being said, the track is well-maintained and includes several rest stops along the way, offering plenty of opportunities to take a break and enjoy the stunning views of the Bay of Plenty.",
