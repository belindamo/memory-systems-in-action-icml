If you have a playful and lighthearted dynamic in your relationship, including a few funny moments or inside jokes can add a lovely touch to the slideshow. It can also help to break the ice and create a more relaxed atmosphere.\n\nHowever, if you're aiming for a more traditional, romantic, and sentimental vibe, you might want to stick to photos that are more heartfelt and emotional. You know your partner best, so trust your instincts.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider when including funny moments or memes:\n\n1. **Balance is key**: Make sure the funny moments are balanced with more romantic and sentimental photos to avoid overwhelming the slideshow.\n2. **Keep it tasteful**: Avoid including anything that might be embarrassing or offensive to your partner or others who might see the slideshow.\n3. **Make it personal**: Choose memes or funny moments that are specific to your relationship and inside jokes, rather than generic humor that might not resonate with your partner.\n4. **Use them sparingly**: Limit the number of funny moments to avoid detracting from the overall romantic atmosphere.\n\nSome ideas for incorporating funny moments or memes include:\n\n* A photo of a silly face or a funny expression that's just between the two of you\n* A meme that references a inside joke or a quirky aspect of your relationship\n* A photo of a funny misadventure or a silly moment from a trip or vacation\n* A caption or quote that pokes fun at a relatable aspect of your relationship, like a funny argument or a quirky habit\n\nRemember, the goal is to make the slideshow personal and meaningful to your partner. If you're unsure, you can always ask yourself: \"Would my partner laugh or smile when they see this?\"",
