The annual iHeartRadio Music Festival is usually held in September. Thanks for correcting me! Anyway, I'm really excited to see the lineup for this year's festival. I'm hoping to see some of my favorite artists perform live again. Do you think you can help me find out more about the festival schedule and ticket sales?",
