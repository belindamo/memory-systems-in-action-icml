  "content": "Certainly! Here is the definition of a non-deterministic matrix semantics in the beamer style, using the definition given by Arnon Avron, and adapted to include a set of connectives that are being interpreted by the interpretation multi-function:\n\n\\begin{frame}\n\\frametitle{Non-Deterministic Matrix Semantics (Avron)}\n\\begin{definition}\nA \\emph{non-deterministic logical matrix} is a tuple $(X, Y, V, C, \\cdot)$, where:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $X$ is a set of truth-values.\n\\item $Y \\subseteq X$ is a set of \\emph{designated truth-values}.\n\\item $V$ is a set of propositions called the \\emph{universe of discourse}.\n\\item $C$ is a set of logical connectives.\n\\item $\\cdot: V \\cup C \\rightarrow \\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a function that assigns a set of truth-values in $X$ to each proposition in $V$ and logical connective in $C$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{definition}\n\\end{frame}\n\nI hope this helps!
