Simply chop them up and mix with your favorite burger ingredients.\n7. **Veggie Gratin**: Thinly slice the leftover vegetables and layer them in a baking dish with cream, cheese, and breadcrumbs. Bake until golden and bubbly.\n8. **Veggie Hash**: Chop the leftover vegetables and saut\u00e9 them with some potatoes, onions, and bell peppers. Serve as a side dish or add to a breakfast skillet.\n9. **Veggie Tacos**: Saut\u00e9 the leftover vegetables with some taco seasoning and serve them in tacos with your favorite toppings.\n10. **Freeze Them**: If you can't use up all the leftover vegetables immediately, chop and freeze them for future meals. They're perfect for adding to soups, stews, or casseroles.\n\nPick your favorite idea, or feel free to mix and match to create a new dish!",
