  "content": "You're welcome! I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to try out the new flavor combination. Decreasing the brown sugar and adding soy sauce will definitely give your Korean-Style Gochujang BBQ Sauce a more balanced and savory flavor profile.\n\nRemember to taste the sauce as you go and adjust the seasoning accordingly. You can always add more soy sauce or brown sugar if you find the flavor needs a bit more tweaking. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and enjoy the process of experimenting with new flavors! It's all about finding the perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and savory to suit your taste buds.\n\nIf you'd like to share your experience or need any more assistance, feel free to come back and chat with me anytime. I'm always here to help.\n\nHappy grilling and saucing!",
