If you want a desk that makes a statement and adds a touch of elegance to your home office, a glossy finish might be the way to go. However, if you prefer a more understated look and are concerned about fingerprints and scratches, a matte finish could be the better option.\n\nFor a reclaimed wood top, a matte finish might be a good choice, as it can help hide any imperfections and create a more rustic, natural look. Additionally, a matte finish can help to reduce the appearance of scratches and dents, which can be more noticeable on a glossy surface.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could consider a satin or semi-gloss finish, which offers a balance between the two. This finish can provide a subtle sheen while still being easy to clean and maintain.\n\nI hope that helps you make a decision!",
