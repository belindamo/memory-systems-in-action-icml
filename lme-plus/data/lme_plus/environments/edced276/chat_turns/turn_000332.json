  "content": "I'm planning a birding trip to Costa Rica and I'm looking for recommendations on guided tours that focus on spotting raptors. Do you know of any reputable operators that offer this type of tour? By the way, I recently attended a workshop at the local Audubon Society, and one of the activities was a guided walk, but I don't recall how long it lasted - no specific duration was mentioned, but it was a great way to learn about the local bird species.",
