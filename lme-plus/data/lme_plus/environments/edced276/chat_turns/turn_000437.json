  "content": "Yes, global warming has had a significant impact on the fishing industry in Shetland. Rising sea temperatures and changes in ocean currents have affected the migration patterns and behavior of many fish species, including cod and haddock, which are two of the most important species for the local fishing industry in Shetland.\n\nAs a result of the changes in the marine environment, some fish species have moved further north, while others have decreased in numbers or disappeared altogether. For example, in recent years, the number of cod in Shetland's waters has declined significantly, while the number of mackerel has increased.\n\nThese changes have had implications for fishermen in Shetland, who have had to adapt to these new conditions. For example, some fishermen have started to target different species of fish, such as crab and lobster, which have become more abundant in the area. Others have started to use more sustainable fishing practices and fishing methods that are less damaging to the marine environment.\n\nOverall, global warming has brought about significant changes in the fishing industry in Shetland, and it has become crucial for the industry to continue to adapt and evolve in response to these changes.",
