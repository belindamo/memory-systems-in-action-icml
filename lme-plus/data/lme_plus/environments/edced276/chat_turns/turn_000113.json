  "content": "Schnitzel is a classic German dish that's actually quite easy to make at home. Here's a simple recipe for traditional Wiener Schnitzel (Viennese-style breaded and fried pork or veal cutlets):\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 4 pork or veal cutlets (about 1/4 inch thick)\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (preferably Panko)\n* 1/4 cup butter, softened\n* 1 egg, beaten\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the breading station: In one shallow dish, mix together the flour, a pinch of salt, and a few grinds of pepper. In another dish, beat the egg. In a third dish, place the breadcrumbs.\n2. Prepare the cutlets: Trim any excess fat from the cutlets, if needed. Season both sides with salt and pepper.\n3. Dredge the cutlets in flour: Coat each cutlet in the flour mixture, shaking off excess.\n4. Dip in egg: Dip the floured cutlet in the beaten egg, making sure to coat it completely.\n5. Bread the cutlet: Place the egg-coated cutlet in the breadcrumbs and press gently to adhere. Flip the cutlet and coat the other side.\n6. Fry the schnitzel: Heat about 1/2 inch (1 cm) of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter is foamy, add 2-3 breaded cutlets (depending on the size of your skillet). Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Repeat with the remaining cutlets.\n7. Serve: Serve the schnitzel hot with a squeeze of lemon juice, if desired. Traditionally, it's served with a side of fries or potato salad.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use high-quality breadcrumbs, like Panko, for a lighter, crisper coating.\n* Don't overcrowd the skillet, as this can lower the oil temperature and result in a greasy schnitzel.\n* If you want to make it more authentic, use clarified butter (ghee) for frying.\n* For a variation, try using chicken or turkey cutlets instead of pork or veal.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and devouring this delicious schnitzel!",
