The Community of Practice is a space for researchers to share ideas, collaborate and troubleshoot. Gabriella also shares the topics that will be included in the Community of Practice, such as \"Trusty Tips\", Researcher Spotlight Series and \"Your Research\". You express your interest in the Community of Practice, and also ask about the possibility of exporting barcodes and pictures in their original form, rather than as a link. Gabriella also mentions that she would like to touch base with you again in the New Year to discuss in-person training.",
