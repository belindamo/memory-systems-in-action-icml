  "content": "While the Mount Maunganui Summit Track does have some steep sections and stairs that can be challenging, it is still considered a relatively easy hike and is suitable for most beginner hikers. It is a well-maintained track with plenty of rest stops and viewpoints along the way, and the stunning coastal views at the top make it definitely worth the effort. Just be sure to wear appropriate footwear, bring plenty of water, and take breaks as needed.",
