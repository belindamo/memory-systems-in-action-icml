  "content": "The rugged coastline of Shetland has had a significant impact on the local fishing industry. The coastline is marked by cliffs, rocky outcroppings, and shallow waters, which make it difficult for large boats to navigate close to shore. This has made it necessary for fishermen to use smaller boats and fish in more shallow waters than in other regions.\n\nHowever, the rough sea conditions can be challenging for fishermen, especially during the winter months, when storms and rough seas can prevent boats from going out to sea. Therefore, the fishing industry in Shetland has developed new technologies and fishing techniques that are able to adapt to the challenging coastal conditions. For example, fishermen may use creels (trap-like fishing nets) instead of traditional fishing lines to catch shellfish, such as crabs and lobster, in the shallow waters close to the shore.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the rugged coastline, the fishing industry continues to be an important part of Shetland's economy, providing employment for local people and producing some of the finest seafood available in the UK.",
