  "content": "Certainly! Here is an example of a non-deterministic matrix using 3 values (1, 2, 3) with (2, 3) designated, and the only connective being negation with a paraconsistent behavior:\n\nExample:\n\n* $X = {1, 2, 3}$\n* $Y = {2, 3}$\n* $V = {\\text{p}, \\text{q}}$\n* $C = {\\neg}$\n* $\\cdot(\\text{p}) = {2, 3}$\n* $\\cdot(\\text{q}) = {2, 3}$\n* $\\cdot(\\neg\\text{p}) = {1, 2, 3}$\n* $\\cdot(\\neg\\text{q}) = {1, 2, 3}$\n\nIn this non-deterministic matrix, both propositions $\\text{p}$ and $\\text{q}$ can be either 2 or 3, depending on the context in which they are being considered. However, the negation of either proposition can be any of the 3 truth-values, resulting in a paraconsistent behavior where the negation of a proposition does not always result in the opposite truth-value.\n\nI hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
