  "content": "That's really great to know! I'm definitely interested in exploring ThredUp's plus size and petite size options. I've had trouble finding dresses that fit well in the past, so it's good to know they cater to different body types. Since I recently bought a dress from a fast-fashion retailer for $40, I'm hoping to find something similar in quality and style on ThredUp, but at a lower price point. Do you think I could find a gently used dress from a high-end boutique on ThredUp for a similar price point or lower?",
