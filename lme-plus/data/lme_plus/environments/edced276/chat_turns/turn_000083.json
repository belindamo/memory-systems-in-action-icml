  "content": "I'm thrilled to hear that! \"The Song of Achilles\" is a wonderful choice, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Greek mythology is fascinating, and Madeline Miller's retelling of the Trojan War from Patroclus' perspective is both moving and beautifully written.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've been doing a lot of reading lately and that you're happy about it! Reading can be such a wonderful escape, and it's amazing how it can transport us to different worlds and times. Have you found that reading has helped you relax or de-stress?",
