  "content": "\"The Royal We\" is a fantastic choice for your next read.\n\n**Writing Style:**\nThe writing style in \"The Royal We\" is engaging, witty, and conversational. Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, the co-authors, have a strong background in writing for television and magazines, which shows in their snappy dialogue and well-paced narrative. The book is written in the first person from the perspective of Bex Porter, the American college student who falls in love with the future king. The tone is generally light-hearted and humorous, with a touch of sarcasm and irony.\n\n**Light or Heavy Read:**\nI'd say \"The Royal We\" is a relatively light read, but not too fluffy. It's a fun, engaging story that's easy to get lost in, but it also tackles some deeper themes like identity, class, and the challenges of navigating a high-pressure relationship. The book has a strong focus on character development, and the authors do a great job of making you feel invested in Bex's journey.\n\nThe pace is moderate, with a good balance of romance, drama, and humor. It's not a particularly dense or heavy book, so it's a great choice for a vacation or a relaxing weekend. You can easily devour it in a few sittings, just like you did with \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" on your road trip!\n\n**Comparison to \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\":**\nWhile both books share some similarities in their focus on character development and behind-the-scenes looks at glamorous lifestyles, \"The Royal We\" is more of a romantic comedy-drama. It's a bit more lighthearted and humorous than \"Evelyn Hugo\", which deals with some heavier themes like grief, loss, and the darker side of fame.\n\nOverall, I think you'll really enjoy \"The Royal We\" if you liked \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\". It's a fun, engaging read with a strong focus on character development and a dash of humor.",
