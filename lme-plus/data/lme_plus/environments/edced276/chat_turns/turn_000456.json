I also had leftovers from last night's dinner for lunch on Monday and Tuesday - pasta with marinara sauce and vegetables. I'm trying to think of ways to use up the leftover vegetables in a creative way. Maybe I can add them to a stir-fry or make a hearty soup. Do you have any specific suggestions for using up leftover vegetables?",
