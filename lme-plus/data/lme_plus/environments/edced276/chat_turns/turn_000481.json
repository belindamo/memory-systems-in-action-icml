Yes, the iHeartRadio Music Festival is usually held in September, and it's an annual event.\n\nOf course, I'd be happy to help you find more information about the festival schedule and ticket sales! You can check the official iHeartRadio Music Festival website or social media channels for the latest updates on the lineup, schedule, and ticket sales. They usually announce the lineup and ticket information in the summer, so keep an eye out for that.\n\nIn the meantime, you can also sign up for the iHeartRadio newsletter or follow their social media accounts to get notified about ticket pre-sales, lineup announcements, and other festival updates.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check out ticketing websites like Ticketmaster or AXS to see if they have any information about ticket sales or pre-sales for the festival.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions or need help finding information, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you!",
