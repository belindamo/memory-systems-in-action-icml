  "content": "Costa Rica is a fantastic destination for birding, with over 850 species to spot! I'd be happy to help you find a reputable guided tour that focuses on raptors.\n\nHere are a few operators that offer raptor-focused tours in Costa Rica:\n\n1. **Tropical Birding**: They offer a 10-day \"Raptors of Costa Rica\" tour, which focuses on spotting species like the King Vulture, Ornate Hawk-Eagle, and White Hawk. Tropical Birding has an excellent reputation among birders and has been featured in publications like BirdWatching Magazine.\n2. **Birdquest**: Their 14-day \"Costa Rica: Raptors and Endemics\" tour covers a range of habitats, from cloud forests to coastal wetlands, in search of raptors like the Crested Eagle, Solitary Eagle, and Gray-lined Hawk. Birdquest has been leading birding tours for over 30 years.\n3. **Wings Birding Tours**: Wings offers a 10-day \"Costa Rica: Raptors and More\" tour, which targets species like the Hook-billed Kite, White-tailed Kite, and Broad-winged Hawk. They also offer custom tours, so you can tailor the itinerary to your specific interests.\n4. **Costa Rica Birding**: This local operator offers a 7-day \"Raptor Tour\" that covers the central highlands and Pacific coast, focusing on species like the Swallow-tailed Kite, Short-tailed Hawk, and Zone-tailed Hawk.\n5. **Rockjumper Birding Tours**: While not exclusively a raptor-focused tour, Rockjumper's 14-day \"Costa Rica Mega Birding Tour\" covers a wide range of habitats and targets many raptor species, including the aforementioned King Vulture and Ornate Hawk-Eagle.\n\nAll of these operators have experienced guides, good reputations, and a focus on responsible birding practices. Be sure to research each company, read reviews, and ask about their experience with raptor-focused tours before making a decision.\n\nRegarding your Audubon Society workshop, it's great that you had a positive experience! Guided walks are an excellent way to learn about local bird species, and many birding tour operators offer similar experiences in Costa Rica. If you're looking for a more in-depth, guided experience, these tours might be an excellent fit.\n\nRemember to also consider factors like tour size, accommodations, and transportation when choosing a tour operator. Happy birding in Costa Rica!",
