  "content": "If you have set `overflow-y: auto` and `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` on the container element that contains the dropdown menu, and it still cannot be scrolled, there are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Check that the container element has a fixed height: For the scrollbar to appear on the container element, it needs to have a fixed height. If the height is set to `auto`, the scrollbar won't appear.\n2. Check that the container element is not nested inside another element with `overflow: hidden`: If the container element is nested inside another element that has `overflow: hidden`, the scrollbar won't appear because it's being clipped by the parent element. You can try removing `overflow: hidden` from the parent element or adding `position: absolute` to the container element to take it out of the flow.\n3. Check that the z-index of the container element is higher than the z-index of other elements: If the container element is behind another element, you won't be able to interact with it. You can try setting the z-index of the container element to a high value, like `z-index: 9999`.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it's possible that there is an issue with your HTML or JavaScript code that is preventing the dropdown from being scrolled. You may want to check your code and debug any issues.",
