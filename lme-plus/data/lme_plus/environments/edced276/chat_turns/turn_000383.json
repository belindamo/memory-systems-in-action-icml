Brandenburg Gate - This 18th-century neoclassical monument is one of the most famous landmarks of Germany and a symbol of the country's unity and peace.\n\n2. Berlin Wall Memorial - A visit to the Berlin Wall Memorial will provide a glimpse into the divided history of Germany, and the marks of history are still evident in the city's buildings, streets, and artwork.\n\n3.

Reichstag Building - This is the seat of the German parliament, and the glass dome is an iconic symbol of the city's history and democracy.\n\n5. Checkpoint Charlie - This former crossing point between East and West Berlin is now a museum that showcases the city's Cold War history and the tense border that once divided the city.\n\n6.
