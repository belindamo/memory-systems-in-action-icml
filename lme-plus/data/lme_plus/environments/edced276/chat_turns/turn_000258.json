The main storyline is definitely engaging, and it's awesome that you're taking your time to explore the world and complete quests.\n\nAs for additional content and DLC, CD Projekt RED has confirmed that they're working on free DLCs and expansions for Cyberpunk 2077. They've mentioned that these DLCs will add new storylines, characters, and gameplay mechanics to the game.\n\nIn fact, they've already released a few free DLCs, including the \"Holiday Season\" and \"Johnny Silverhand\" packs, which added new cosmetics, quests, and gameplay features to the game.\n\nAs for larger expansions, CD Projekt RED has announced plans to release a paid DLC, but no details have been shared yet. They've mentioned that it will be a significant expansion that will add new storylines, characters, and gameplay mechanics, but we'll have to wait and see what they have in store for us.\n\nIt's worth noting that CD Projekt RED is known for supporting their games with a lot of post-launch content, so I'm sure we can expect to see a lot more added to Cyberpunk 2077 in the coming months and years.\n\nAre you looking forward to exploring more of Night City's side quests and optional activities? There's so much to discover, from gangs and factions to hidden secrets and Easter eggs!",
