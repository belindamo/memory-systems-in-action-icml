However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about the location of the theater or the performance of \"The Sound of Music\" you're referring to. I'm a text-based AI assistant, I don't have real-time information about specific events or locations.\n\nBut I can suggest some general tips to help you find good restaurants near the theater:\n\n1. Check online review sites: Websites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google Reviews can help you find top-rated restaurants near the theater. You can filter by cuisine, price range, and distance from the theater.\n2. Ask the theater staff: If you have a contact at the theater or can visit their website, they might have a list of recommended restaurants nearby.\n3. Use online mapping tools: Google Maps or other mapping services can help you find restaurants near the theater. You can enter the theater's address and explore the surrounding area for dining options.\n4. Check local food blogs or publications: Local food bloggers or publications often have lists of recommended restaurants in specific areas.\n\nRemember to make reservations in advance, especially if you're planning to dine during peak hours or on a weekend.\n\nI hope these tips help, and I wish you a wonderful dinner with your friends before the show!",
