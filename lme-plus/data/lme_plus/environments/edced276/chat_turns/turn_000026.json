I graduated with a degree in Computer Science, so I've had my fair share of project management and collaboration. For my current project, I'm leaning towards using Trello, but I want to make sure I'm utilizing it to its full potential. Can you give me some tips on how to set up a Trello board for a web development project, and how to integrate it with other tools like GitHub and Slack?",
