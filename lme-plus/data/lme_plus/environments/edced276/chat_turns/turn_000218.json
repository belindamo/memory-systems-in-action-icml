Ankle mobility is crucial for tennis players, as it can affect your agility, speed, and overall performance on the court.\n\nHere are some tips to help you improve your ankle mobility:\n\n1. **Calf Stretch**: Tight calf muscles can limit ankle mobility. Make sure to stretch your calf muscles regularly, focusing on both the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.\n2. **Ankle Circles**: Move your ankle through its full range of motion, making small circles with your toes. Start with small circles and gradually increase the size as you become more comfortable.\n3. **Toe Raises**: Stand on the edge of a stair or step with your heels hanging off the edge. Slowly raise up onto your toes and then lower back down. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. **Ankle Mobilization**: Use a resistance band or a tennis ball to mobilize your ankle joint. Place the band or ball under your ankle and move your foot through its range of motion, applying gentle pressure.\n5. **Single-Leg Balance**: Practice standing on one leg, focusing on keeping your ankle stable and your knee straight. Hold for 30 seconds to start, and gradually increase the time as you build balance and stability.\n6. **Agility Drills**: Incorporate agility drills that involve quick changes of direction, such as ladder drills or cone drills. These can help improve your ankle mobility and reaction time.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your stretches and exercises.\n* Listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain or discomfort.\n* Incorporate these exercises into your regular yoga practice or as a separate routine, 2-3 times a week.\n\nBy focusing on these exercises and stretches, you can improve your ankle mobility and reduce the risk of injury. Keep up the good work with your yoga practice, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns!",
