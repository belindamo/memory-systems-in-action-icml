It's a great way to share your achievement with Alex and make the celebration dinner even more meaningful.\n\nRemember to take a moment to reflect on how far you've come and how much you've accomplished. Paying off student loans is no easy feat, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself.\n\nI'm thrilled to have been a part of your celebration planning, and I hope you and Alex have an amazing time tonight. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more ideas or suggestions.\n\nHere's to you, Alex, and your debt-free future! Cheers to many more celebrations and milestones to come!",
