  "content": "As with any fishing industry around the world, the fishing industry in Shetland also has some negative effects on the marine ecosystem. The negative impact on the marine ecosystem can occur due to several factors like overfishing or the type of fishing gear used.\n\nOverfishing can cause a significant disruption in the marine ecosystem by reducing the population of specific species of fish. Overfishing affects not only the targeted species but also the other species that depend on them for food. As a result, it causes an imbalance in the ecosystem, which can cause a cascading effect on the entire food chain.\n\nThe use of certain types of fishing gear like bottom trawling can damage the seafloor and destroy the habitat of various species like corals, sponges, and other marine organisms that live there. The trawl can also crush and kill many organisms, including fish, that are not the target of the catch.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the fishing industry in Shetland has been proactive in minimizing its impact on the marine ecosystem through practices like limiting the catch through quotas, using selective gear, and modifying gear to reduce bycatch. The industry is also focused on improving sustainability through research and technology.\n\nAdditionally, Shetland has a rich marine ecosystem that is monitored and protected by the Scotland Marine Protected Area (MPA) network, which helps to maintain biodiversity and protect essential habitats in the area.",
