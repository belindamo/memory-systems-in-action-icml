  "content": "One good place to stop for a picnic along the Mount Maunganui Summit Track is near the picnic tables located at the halfway point of the track, which offers sweeping views of the coastline and surrounding area. Another option is to bring a picnic blanket and stop at one of the grassy areas along the track with a scenic view. Just be sure to carry out all your rubbish to keep the area clean and beautiful for other hikers.",
