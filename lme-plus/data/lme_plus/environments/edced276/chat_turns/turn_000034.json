This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.\n\nPrior to analysis \u2013 you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.\n\nNext, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.\n\nIn the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform \"sanity checks\" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.\n\nIn the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.\n\nFinal Deliverable\nYour final submission should take the form of a sequence of images \u2013 similar to a comic book \u2013 that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.\nYour observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by \"annotated visualization,\" see this page for some examples.)\nProvide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset. To help gauge the scope of this assignment, see this example report analyzing motion picture data.\n\"\"\"\n[code]\nimport pandas as pd\nbusiness\\_path = \"yelp\\_academic\\_dataset\\_business.json\"\ndf\\_business = pd.read\\_json(business\\_path, lines=True)\ndf\\_business.info()\n\n[output]\n\n RangeIndex: 150346 entries, 0 to 150345\n Data columns (total 14 columns):\n # Column Non-Null Count Dtype \n --- ------ -------------- ----- \n 0 business\\_id 150346 non-null object \n 1 name 150346 non-null object \n 2 address 150346 non-null object \n 3 city 150346 non-null object \n 4 state 150346 non-null object \n 5 postal\\_code 150346 non-null object \n 6 latitude 150346 non-null float64\n 7 longitude 150346 non-null float64\n 8 stars 150346 non-null float64\n 9 review\\_count 150346 non-null int64 \n 10 is\\_open 150346 non-null int64 \n 11 attributes 136602 non-null object \n 12 categories 150243 non-null object \n 13 hours 127123 non-null object \n dtypes: float64(3), int64(2), object(9)\n memory usage: 16.1+ MB\n\nCould you add additional comments to the code so that someone unfamiliar with the project can understand the code?",
