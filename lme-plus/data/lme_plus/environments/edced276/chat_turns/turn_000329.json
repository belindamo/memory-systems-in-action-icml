I used to waste so much time during my commute, just scrolling through social media or listening to music. But then I realized that I could be using that time to learn something new. So, I started listening to language lessons on my way to work, and within a few months, I was able to hold conversations with my colleagues in their native language. It was amazing! Not only did I learn a new skill, but I also felt more confident and connected to my colleagues. Today, I want to share some tips on how you can use your commute to learn a new skill, just like I did.\"\n\nBy sharing your personal anecdotes, you can make your podcast more engaging, relatable, and memorable.
