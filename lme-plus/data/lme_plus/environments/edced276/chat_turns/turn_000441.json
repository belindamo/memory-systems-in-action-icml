  "content": "The fishing industry in Shetland has been adopting various sustainable fishing practices to ensure the long-term viability of the industry. Some of the sustainable fishing practices being adopted in Shetland include:\n\n1. Selective fishing: Selective fishing involves using fishing gear designed to capture only target species while minimizing the catch of non-target species. In Shetland, fishermen are using more selective fishing practices to avoid catching species that are overfished or for which there are low quotas.\n\n2. Use of creels: Creels, or trap-like fishing nets, are commonly used in Shetland to catch shellfish, such as crabs and lobster, instead of using traditional fishing lines. This reduces the amount of bycatch and minimizes the impact of fishing on the seafloor.\n\n3. Quota management: The fishing industry in Shetland is tightly regulated with quota management systems in place to prevent overfishing. Quotas are set for each species of fish, and fishermen are only allowed to catch a certain amount. \n\n4. Gear modification: Some fishermen in Shetland have been modifying their gear to make it more sustainable. For example, fishermen are now using larger mesh size on their nets to allow smaller fish to escape, reducing the amount of bycatch.\n\n5. Certification: Some of the seafood produced in Shetland is certified as sustainably sourced by organizations such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC).\n\nOverall, the fishing industry in Shetland is taking a proactive approach to sustainable fishing, and it is likely that there will be continued efforts to improve fishing practices as global warming and other challenges continue to place pressure on the industry.",
