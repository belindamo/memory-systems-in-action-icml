  "content": "The code above imports the pandas library and reads in the \"yelp\\_academic\\_dataset\\_business.json\" file, which contains information about businesses from Yelp's database. The file is read in using the pandas function \"pd.read\\_json()\" and is stored in a variable called \"df\\_business\". The \"lines=True\" parameter is used to specify that the file is in json format with each line representing a separate entry. The \"df\\_business.info()\" function is then used to display information about the dataframe, including the number of entries, the data types of each column, and the number of non-null values for each column.",
