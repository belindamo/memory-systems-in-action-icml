It's always more enjoyable to explore the game's content when you're not worried about bugs and issues getting in the way.\n\nAs for tracking your progress, yes, Cyberpunk 2077 does have a quest log and journal system that can help you keep track of your progress. You can access it by pausing the game and navigating to the \"Journal\" tab.\n\nIn the Journal, you'll find a list of all the quests you've received, including main quests, side quests, and optional activities. You can filter the list by type, and each quest will have a brief description, objective, and location. You can also use the Journal to track your progress, as it will update automatically as you complete objectives and progress through the quest.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the in-game map to track your objectives and waypoints. The map will show you the location of quest objectives, as well as other points of interest, like vendors, shops, and fast travel points.\n\nIf you're looking for a more detailed breakdown of your progress, you can also check out the \"Character\" tab in the pause menu. This will show you your character's stats, skills, and perks, as well as a list of your completed quests and achievements.\n\nI hope that helps! Do you have a favorite type of quest or activity in Cyberpunk 2077, or is there something specific you're looking forward to exploring in the game?",
