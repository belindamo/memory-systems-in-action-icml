  "content": "Reducing the sweetness level and adding soy sauce will definitely change the flavor profile of the Korean-Style Gochujang BBQ Sauce.\n\n**Adding Soy Sauce:**\n\nWhen it comes to adding soy sauce, a little goes a long way. Soy sauce is a strong umami flavor enhancer, so start with a small amount and taste as you go. Here's a suggestion:\n\n* Add 1-2 teaspoons of soy sauce to the sauce and mix well.\n\nThis will introduce a subtle, savory flavor to the sauce without overpowering the other ingredients. If you find it's not enough, you can always add a little more, but it's better to start with a small amount and adjust to taste.\n\n**Tips for Adding Soy Sauce:**\n\n* Use a high-quality soy sauce: Choose a soy sauce that's brewed naturally, without added preservatives or flavor enhancers. This will ensure a richer, more complex flavor.\n* Consider the type of soy sauce: If you're using a lighter soy sauce, like Japanese soy sauce, you may want to start with 1 teaspoon. If you're using a darker, more robust soy sauce, like Korean soy sauce, you may want to start with 1.5 teaspoons.\n* Taste and adjust: Remember to taste the sauce regularly as you add the soy sauce. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess soy sauce from the sauce.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\nIf you want to further deepen the umami flavor, you could also consider adding other ingredients, such as:\n\n* Miso paste: Mix in 1-2 teaspoons of miso paste to add a savory, slightly sweet flavor.\n* Fish sauce: Add 1-2 teaspoons of fish sauce for a salty, umami flavor.\n* Mushroom extract: Use 1-2 teaspoons of mushroom extract, like porcini or shiitake, to add an earthy, savory flavor.\n\nRemember, when working with strong umami ingredients, it's essential to taste as you go and adjust the seasoning accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps you create a delicious, balanced Korean-Style Gochujang BBQ Sauce!",
