      "content": "I'm so glad you loved \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\"! Taylor Jenkins Reid is a fantastic author, and that book is a favorite among many readers. If you're looking for something similar, I'd be happy to suggest some books that share similar themes, styles, or elements. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **The Royal We** by Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan: This novel follows a similar \"behind-the-scenes\" format, exploring the life of an American college student who falls in love with the future king of a British-inspired royal family. It's a sweeping romance with a strong focus on character development and juicy drama.\n2. **The Devil Wears Prada** by Lauren Weisberger: While not exactly similar in tone, this classic novel shares some of the same themes of glamour, fame, and the highs and lows of working in a demanding industry. It's a fun, fast-paced read with a strong female lead.\n3. **The Address** by Fiona Davis: This novel is set in the iconic Dakota apartment building in New York City and follows the lives of its residents across multiple timelines. Like Evelyn Hugo, it's a story about the secrets and scandals of the rich and famous, with a strong focus on character development and historical detail.\n4. **The Age of Light** by Whitney Scharer: This historical novel tells the story of Lee Miller, a model and photographer who was a muse to Man Ray and a pioneering artist in her own right. It's a beautifully written exploration of art, love, and identity, with a strong focus on the lives of creative women.\n5. **The Last Romantics** by Tara Conklin: This novel follows the lives of four siblings who grow up together, exploring themes of family, love, and identity. It's a sweeping narrative with a strong focus on character development and a touch of magical realism.\n6. **Daisy Jones and The Six** by Taylor Jenkins Reid: If you haven't already read this one, it's another great option! This novel tells the story of a fictional rock band in the 1970s, exploring the highs and lows of fame, love, and creativity.\n\nThese books all share some elements of the glamour, drama, and character-driven storytelling that made \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" so compelling.

      "content": "\"The Royal We\" is a fantastic choice for your next read.\n\n**Writing Style:**\nThe writing style in \"The Royal We\" is engaging, witty, and conversational. Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, the co-authors, have a strong background in writing for television and magazines, which shows in their snappy dialogue and well-paced narrative. The book is written in the first person from the perspective of Bex Porter, the American college student who falls in love with the future king. The tone is generally light-hearted and humorous, with a touch of sarcasm and irony.\n\n**Light or Heavy Read:**\nI'd say \"The Royal We\" is a relatively light read, but not too fluffy. It's a fun, engaging story that's easy to get lost in, but it also tackles some deeper themes like identity, class, and the challenges of navigating a high-pressure relationship. The book has a strong focus on character development, and the authors do a great job of making you feel invested in Bex's journey.\n\nThe pace is moderate, with a good balance of romance, drama, and humor. It's not a particularly dense or heavy book, so it's a great choice for a vacation or a relaxing weekend. You can easily devour it in a few sittings, just like you did with \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" on your road trip!\n\n**Comparison to \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\":**\nWhile both books share some similarities in their focus on character development and behind-the-scenes looks at glamorous lifestyles, \"The Royal We\" is more of a romantic comedy-drama. It's a bit more lighthearted and humorous than \"Evelyn Hugo\", which deals with some heavier themes like grief, loss, and the darker side of fame.\n\nOverall, I think you'll really enjoy \"The Royal We\" if you liked \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\". It's a fun, engaging read with a strong focus on character development and a dash of humor."
