It's going to be Boring candy. I haven't seen any candy yet that's good enough to send out. But I think there are like three companies or something that control all the candy in the world pretty much. It's crazy. And dog food too.\n\nThere's somebody who constructed this crazy conglomerate, and it's like dog food, baby food, and candy, and it's like all under different brands. It's like a rendering. Yeah, you think you're buying from different companies, but it all funnels up to like three companies or something like that. Don't send the rendering food to the candy company. Yeah. Big candy.\n\nSo you want to have a good competitor forcing function so that you have to make"

      "content": "the product better or you'll lose. Like if you make the product better and improve the product for the end consumer, then that company should have less prosperity compared to a company that makes better products. Now the car industry is actually pretty competitive. So that's good. And the good thing about a competitive industry is if you make a product that's better, it's going to do better in the marketplace. Definitely.\n\nSo this is Gene Wilder's old house. Yeah. It's amazing. It's lovely. Thanks for having us here as well. Thanks, it's really special. Yeah, it's a cool spot. It has a solar glass roof. Yeah. So you're just going to go with the solar glass roof? Yeah. I think it's achieved that goal. This is a lovely, quirky little house. I'll show you around afterward. It's got all sorts of weird things. It's exactly what you're saying. Is it Frank Lloyd Wright? No, I don't think so. I think it was just built in increments over time by probably several people. They would have just knocked it down and built a giant house here. I'm so glad they didn't. It's super cool. Gene Wilder is one of my favorite actors.\n\nWhen you come up with a product like the Solar Glass Roof, I think a lot of people misunderstand that your goal is to bring these crazy technologies to market and really create a change in the world. I think it's fascinating that you do it through companies, and it seems like the fastest way to create that feedback loop and to really go from inventing something to millions of people using it right away. It seems like buying a Tesla is almost the best thing you could do to help the climate crisis because you're turbocharging R&D and products and innovation. I feel like not enough people really understand that.\n\nYeah, that is, I think there are lots of good things people can do for the climate, but just generally anything that is moving towards sustainable energy, whether it's sustainable energy generation through solar or with an electric vehicle, actually just things like better insulation in a house is really effective for energy consumption. But if I find it, I think he's more than he is. It's engraving. That's Marvin the Martian."
