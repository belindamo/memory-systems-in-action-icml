  "content": "Completely agreed. It's equally important to encourage more women to take on leadership roles in business and other industries, in addition to politics. Having diverse representation in all areas of society is key to creating a more equitable and inclusive world, where everyone has equal opportunities to achieve their potential regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity or identity. Role models are essential for inspiring the next generation of young girls and women to pursue their dreams and break through the barriers that have traditionally held them back. By having more women in leadership roles across various industries, we can create a culture of gender equality and empower future generations to become leaders in their own right.",
