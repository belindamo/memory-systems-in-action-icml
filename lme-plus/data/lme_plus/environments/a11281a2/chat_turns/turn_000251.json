  "content": "It is difficult to determine the exact impact of the number and diversity of female candidates in local elections on gender representation in the D\u00e1il, as there are several factors at play.\n\nHowever, it can be noted that there has been a gradual increase in the number of women elected to the D\u00e1il in recent years. In the 2020 general election, 36 women were elected to the D\u00e1il, making up 22% of the total number of TDs. This was a slight increase from the previous election in 2016, where 22% of TDs were women.\n\nOne possible reason for this increase is the increase in the number of female candidates running in local elections, which may have helped to identify and encourage more women to run for national office. Additionally, the introduction of gender quotas in 2012 has also played a role in increasing the number of female candidates and elected representatives.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there is still a significant gender imbalance in the D\u00e1il, and more needs to be done to ensure equal representation for women. This may involve addressing issues such as gender bias, sexism, and lack of support for women candidates.",
