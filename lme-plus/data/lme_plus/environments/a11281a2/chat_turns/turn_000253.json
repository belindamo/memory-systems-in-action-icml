  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but I can provide some insights. The trend of an increase in the number of female candidates being elected to the D\u00e1il may continue in future elections. This may be due to several factors, including ongoing efforts to encourage and support more women to run for elected office, as well as the introduction of gender quotas for political parties.\n\nAdditionally, as more women are elected to local and national positions, this may help to normalize the idea of women in politics and inspire more women to consider running for office. However, it's important to note that gender bias and other structural barriers still exist in the political system, and more work needs to be done to address these issues and ensure fair representation for all genders.",
