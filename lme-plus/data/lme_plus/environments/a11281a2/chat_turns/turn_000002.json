  "content": "Section 12 of the Act defines \"classified information\" and establishes the procedures for judicial review. Actions taken by the President and the Secretary under the Act are not subject to administrative or judicial review, except as provided in this section. An aggrieved person may file a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days of the Secretary's or President's action. The court shall not disturb any action taken unless it is unconstitutional or in violation of a clear and mandatory statutory command. The court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under this Act against the United States or any executive department or agency, subject to review by the Supreme Court. The United States shall file an administrative record with the court containing information relied upon in taking the final action under the Act. The court shall review the record in camera and ex parte for sensitive security information, privileged law enforcement information, information obtained or derived from activities authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and information subject to privilege or protection under any other provision of law. Any information that is part of the administrative record filed ex parte and in camera shall be treated by the court consistent with the provisions of this section, and shall not be released to the petitioner or as part of the public record. A determination by the court shall be the exclusive judicial remedy for any claim against the United States, and nothing in this section limits, supersedes, or prevents the invocation of any privileges or defenses available at law or in equity to protect against the disclosure of information.",
