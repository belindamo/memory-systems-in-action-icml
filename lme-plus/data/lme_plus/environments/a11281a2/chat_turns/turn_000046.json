The slightly sweet and tangy flavors in your sauce will balance out the bold, beefy flavor of the tri-tip.\n3. **Chicken Thighs**: Marinate chicken thighs in your BBQ sauce before grilling for a deliciously moist and flavorful dish. The spicy kick will add a nice depth to the chicken.\n4. **Sausages**: Whether you prefer classic pork sausages or more adventurous options like chorizo or bratwurst, your BBQ sauce will add a rich, sweet, and tangy flavor to the grilled sausages.\n5. **Flank Steak**: A leaner cut of beef that's perfect for grilling.
