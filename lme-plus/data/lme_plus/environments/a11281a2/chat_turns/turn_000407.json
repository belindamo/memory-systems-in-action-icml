However, the recent coffee spill could also be a contributing factor. Even if the spill didn't damage the laptop's internal components, it might have affected the battery's performance.\n\nHere are some potential causes and suggestions to help you troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. **Battery Calibration**: As you mentioned, calibrating your laptop battery can help improve its performance. You can try calibrating the battery by letting it drain to 0% and then charging it to 100%. Repeat this process 2-3 times to see if it makes a difference.\n2. **Battery Health**: Check your laptop's battery health using Lenovo's built-in diagnostic tool or a third-party software like BatteryMon or Coconut Battery. This will give you an idea of the battery's capacity and health.\n3. **Power Settings**: Review your power settings to ensure they're not set to aggressively drain the battery. Go to your Power Options in Windows and adjust the settings to balance performance and power consumption.\n4. **Resource-Intensive Programs**: As you mentioned, gaming can be a significant battery drain. Consider closing unnecessary programs or background applications when not in use to conserve battery life.\n5. **Screen Brightness**: Dimming your screen brightness can help extend battery life. You can also adjust the auto-brightness settings to reduce the screen's brightness in low-light environments.\n6. **Battery Driver Updates**: Ensure your laptop's battery drivers are up to date. You can check for updates in the Device Manager or Lenovo's support website.\n7. **Cleaning**: Although you've already had a coffee spill, it's essential to keep your laptop clean and dust-free. Dirt and dust can accumulate and affect airflow, which might impact battery performance.\n8. **Battery Replacement**: If your laptop is 3 years old, the battery might be nearing the end of its lifespan. If none of the above steps improve the battery life, it might be time to consider replacing the battery.\n\nBefore you start troubleshooting, take note of your current battery life and usage patterns. This will help you track any changes or improvements after implementing these suggestions.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like to add. I'm here to help you troubleshoot and optimize your laptop's battery life!",
