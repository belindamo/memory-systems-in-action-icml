  "content": "I'm excited to experiment with whole wheat and rye flours in my sourdough bread. I've been stuck in a rut using all-purpose flour, and I want to try something new. I've heard that whole wheat flour can add a nuttier flavor and denser texture, while rye flour can give the bread a more robust, earthy flavor. I'm looking forward to seeing how these flours will affect the overall character of my sourdough.",
