  "content": "Certainly! Here are a few examples of electronic music producers who have been influenced by Daphni's \"Jiaolong\":\n\n1. Four Tet - British producer Four Tet, also known as Kieran Hebden, has been a close collaborator of Daphni (aka Caribou) for many years. Four Tet's use of diverse and multicultural samples in his music, as well as his incorporation of live instrumentation, is heavily influenced by Daphni's approach.\n\n2. Actress - English producer Darren Cunningham, who performs under the name Actress, often incorporates African and other world music styles into his experimental electronic compositions. His use of unusual percussion sounds and unconventional rhythms can be traced back to Daphni's \"Jiaolong.\"\n\n3. Romare - British producer Romare uses a wide range of African and Caribbean samples to create his unique style of house music. His approach to sampling and layering different rhythms and melodies is influenced by Daphni's approach on \"Jiaolong.\"\n\n4. Nicola Cruz - Ecuadorian producer Nicola Cruz is known for creating electronic music that draws heavily from the traditional music of South America. His use of repetitive rhythms and organic percussion in his tracks is reminiscent of Daphni's style on \"Jiaolong.\"\n\n5. Sango - American producer Sango often incorporates African and Brazilian rhythms into his signature \"bedroom trap\" style of production. His approach to layering different percussion elements and creating complex rhythms is influenced by Daphni's use of African house.",
