The town of Rabaul and its surrounding communities were rebuilt after the 1994 eruption, although many of the buildings and infrastructure were damaged or destroyed. \n\nDespite the risk posed by living near an active volcano, the area remains home to a significant population, and many people rely on the surrounding land for their livelihoods, including agriculture and fishing.
