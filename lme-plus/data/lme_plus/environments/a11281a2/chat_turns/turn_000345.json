Avoid favoring certain groups or individuals.\n3. **Relevant and valuable prize**: Offer a prize that's relevant to your audience and valuable enough to encourage genuine participation.\n4. **Don't overdo it**: Limit the number of contests you run and space them out to avoid fatigue and maintain a sense of exclusivity.\n5. **Monitor and moderate**: Keep an eye on the contest's progress, respond to questions and concerns, and remove any spammy or inappropriate content.\n\nIf you do decide to require followers to tag a friend or share a post, make sure to:\n\n1. **Keep it optional**: Allow followers to enter the contest without tagging a friend or sharing a post, to accommodate those who prefer not to participate in these activities.\n2. **Use a unique hashtag**: Create a unique hashtag for the contest to track entries and encourage user-generated content.\n3. **Set a limit**: Limit the number of friends that can be tagged or the number of posts that can be shared to prevent abuse.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a successful and engaging contest that benefits both your audience and your brand. \ud83c\udf81",
