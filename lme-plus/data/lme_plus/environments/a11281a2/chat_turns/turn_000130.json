  "content": "Thanks for sharing the additional details about your data. As you mentioned, the label distribution is imbalanced, which can sometimes make it difficult to train a machine learning model that performs well across all labels. Here are some additional suggestions that might be helpful:\n\n1. Consider using techniques like oversampling or undersampling to balance the label distribution. Oversampling involves creating more instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class. There are several ways to do this, including random oversampling/undersampling, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), and ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling). You can use libraries like imbalanced-learn in Python to implement these techniques.\n2. Use appropriate evaluation metrics that take into account the imbalanced label distribution, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve). These metrics are more informative than accuracy, which can be misleading in the presence of class imbalance.\n3. Try using a model that is more robust to class imbalance, such as decision trees or random forests, which can handle class imbalance better than some other models like logistic regression. Alternatively, you can also try using models that are specifically designed for imbalanced datasets, such as XGBoost or LightGBM.\n4. Consider using ensemble methods that combine multiple models to improve performance. Ensemble methods like bagging and boosting can help reduce the impact of class imbalance and improve the overall performance of the model.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you to handle the imbalanced label distribution in your data and improve the performance of your model. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with.",
