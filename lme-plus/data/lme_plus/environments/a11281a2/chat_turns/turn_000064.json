The company was founded in 2010 by four friends who were frustrated by the high cost of eyeglasses. They saw an opportunity in the market to provide high-quality, fashionable eyeglasses at a more affordable price.\n\nIn the early days of the company, Warby Parker established a direct-to-consumer business model, allowing them to offer lower prices than traditional eyeglass retailers. However, as the company grew, they faced increased competition from other direct-to-consumer eyeglass companies.\n\nTo stay competitive, Warby Parker continued to innovate and adjust its business model to meet changing market demands. For example, in 2015, the company launched brick-and-mortar retail stores to provide customers with a more traditional shopping experience. They also expanded their product line to include sunglasses and contact lenses.\n\nBy adjusting its business model and product offerings to meet changing market demands, Warby Parker has become a hugely successful company, valued at over $3 billion. Their success serves as a great example of a small business that effectively navigated changing market trends and remained competitive in a crowded industry.",
