  "content": "Sugar-free banana muffins, that's a great application for stevia! It's not uncommon to have mixed results when substituting stevia for sugar, as it can be a bit finicky. Adjusting the ratio of stevia to sugar is a great approach to find the perfect balance.\n\nWhen working with stevia in baked goods, it's essential to remember that it's a highly concentrated sweetener. A little goes a long way, and it's easy to overdo it. Start with a small amount and taste as you go, making adjustments until you reach the desired sweetness level.\n\nIn sourdough bread, stevia can be a bit more forgiving than in sweet baked goods like muffins. The slower fermentation process and the natural sweetness of the bread can help balance out the flavor. However, it's still important to be mindful of the amount of stevia you're using and adjust to taste.\n\nIf you're looking for a general guideline, a good starting point for substituting stevia for sugar in sourdough bread is to use 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of stevia powder for every 1 tablespoon of sugar called for in the recipe. Keep in mind that this is just a rough estimate, and you may need to adjust based on your personal taste preferences and the specific recipe you're using.\n\nRemember to also consider the type of stevia you're using, as some products may have a more intense sweetness or a different flavor profile than others. Experiment with different brands and types to find the one that works best for you.\n\nI'm excited to hear that you're willing to give stevia a try in your sourdough bread! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. And don't hesitate to share your results, whether they're successful or not \u2013 we can all learn from each other's experiences!",
