  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot say for certain what will happen in the future of electronic music. However, it seems likely that producers will continue to explore and incorporate world music styles as the exchange of cultural ideas and sounds becomes more accessible through the internet.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in discovering and preserving traditional music from around the world, and this has led to more producers incorporating these sounds into their own creations. Additionally, as electronic music continues to evolve and shift, incorporating new and different sounds and influences is often seen as a way to keep things fresh and interesting.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible that trends could shift in the opposite direction, with producers moving away from world music influences and focusing more on synthesized sounds or other forms of electronic production. But as long as there are people out there making and listening to electronic music, there will undoubtedly be a wide range of styles and influences represented.",
