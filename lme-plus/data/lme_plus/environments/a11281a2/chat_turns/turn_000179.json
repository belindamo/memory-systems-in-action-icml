Group facilitators are also helping professionals with a range of experience and expertise in supporting individuals recovering from religious trauma. Participants in the group come from a variety of backgrounds, including Christian fundamentalism, Pentecostalism, Islamic faith, Catholicism, Mormonism, and many others. The group offers confidential support, discussion, and twice-monthly Zoom conference calls.
