  "content": "I'm glad you're considering trying on the ankle boots again! It's always a good idea to try on shoes multiple times before making a purchase, especially if you're unsure about the fit.\n\nIf you're willing to make the trip back to Target, I'd recommend trying on the ankle boots again in a different size. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Fit is crucial**: Trying on shoes in person allows you to ensure a comfortable fit. You can walk around, sit down, and get a feel for how the boots will perform in real-life scenarios.\n2. **Size can vary**: Even if you've tried on the same style before, sizes can vary between batches or even within the same store. Trying on a different size might make a big difference in the fit.\n3. **You can ask questions**: If you try on the boots in-store, you can ask the sales associate questions about the material, quality, and any potential issues with the style.\n4. **You might find a better deal**: If you try on the boots and they fit perfectly, you might be able to find a better deal in-store or online.\n\nThat being said, if you're short on time or prefer to shop online, you could try searching for similar boots on online marketplaces like Amazon or Zappos. You can read reviews, check the sizing charts, and even filter by price to find a good deal.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether to try on the boots again in-store or search for a similar pair online. If you do decide to try them on again, I hope they fit perfectly and you end up loving them!",
