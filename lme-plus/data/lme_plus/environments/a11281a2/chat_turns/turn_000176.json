  "content": "Living near an active volcano can be stressful and dangerous, so it's natural that some people living in the vicinity of the Rabaul volcano may not feel completely safe. \n\nHowever, many of the local residents have lived in the area for generations and have learned to adapt to the risk posed by volcanic activity. The authorities have also taken measures such as regular monitoring and evacuation planning to minimize the danger to the local population. \n\nOverall, there is likely a degree of acceptance among the people living near the Rabaul volcano that it is a part of their natural environment and an inherent risk of living in the area. However, this doesn't mean that they are not concerned about the safety of themselves and their families, particularly during times of increased volcanic activity.",
