  "content": "One of the best things about stir-fries is that you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand. The recipe I provided is just a starting point, and you can easily customize it to use up your leftover vegetables.\n\n**Using leftover vegetables:**\n\n* Simply chop the vegetables into bite-sized pieces and add them to the wok in the same order as the recipe: onions and garlic first, then the harder vegetables (like carrots, broccoli, or bell peppers), and finally the softer vegetables (like mushrooms, snow peas, or spinach).\n* Adjust the cooking time based on the vegetables you're using. For example, if you're using frozen vegetables, they may cook more quickly. If you're using harder vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes, they may take a few extra minutes to cook through.\n* Keep in mind that some vegetables, like leafy greens, may release more water than others. You can either cook them for a shorter time to preserve their texture or add a little more oil to the wok to help them cook more quickly.\n\nSome vegetables that work well in a stir-fry include:\n\n* Leafy greens: spinach, kale, collard greens\n* Cruciferous vegetables: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage\n* Root vegetables: carrots, sweet potatoes, bell peppers\n* Mushrooms: button, cremini, shiitake\n* Alliums: onions, garlic, shallots\n* Other vegetables: zucchini, yellow squash, green beans, snap peas\n\n**Tips for using leftover vegetables:**\n\n* If you're using leftover roasted or grilled vegetables, you can add them towards the end of the stir-fry cooking time, as they're already cooked.\n* If you're using frozen vegetables, make sure to thaw them first and pat them dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.\n* If you're using vegetables with different cooking times, you can cook them in batches to ensure they're all cooked to your liking.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more specific guidance on using your leftover vegetables.",
