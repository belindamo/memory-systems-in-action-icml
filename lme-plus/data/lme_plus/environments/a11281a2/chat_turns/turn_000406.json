  "content": "My laptop is about 3 years old, and it's a Lenovo ThinkPad. I've been using it for work and some light gaming. I haven't noticed any changes in my usage habits, but I did spill coffee on my keyboard recently, which made me realize I need to be more careful. I've had to recharge my laptop multiple times a day, and it's been a concern for me for a few weeks now. I haven't checked the battery health or calibration recently, but I'm considering doing so to see if it makes a difference.",
