Overmixing can lead to a dense, tough cake.\n5. **Respect the recipe**: Don't overbake or underbake your cake. Check the recipe for the recommended baking time and temperature.\n6. **Check for doneness**: Use a toothpick or cake tester to check if the cake is cooked through. If it's not done, bake for a few more minutes and check again.\n7. **Let it rest**: Let your cake cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. This helps the cake to set and prevents it from breaking apart.\n\n**Oven Temperature and Cake Texture:**\n\n* **Incorrect oven temperature**: If your oven is running too hot or too cold, it can affect the texture of your cake. Invest in an oven thermometer to ensure your oven is at the correct temperature.\n* **Overbaking**: If your cake is overbaked, it can become dry and dense. Check your cake frequently towards the end of the recommended baking time to prevent overbaking.\n* **Underbaking**: If your cake is underbaked, it can be soggy or raw in the center. Make sure to check the cake's doneness using a toothpick or cake tester.\n\n**Troubleshooting Common Cake Texture Issues:**\n\n* **Dense cake**: Overmixing, using old baking powder, or not enough leavening agents can cause a dense cake.\n* **Dry cake**: Overbaking, using too much flour, or not enough liquid can cause a dry cake.\n* **Soggy cake**: Underbaking, using too much liquid, or not enough leavening agents can cause a soggy cake.\n\nBy following these general tips and troubleshooting common issues, you'll be well on your way to achieving the perfect cake texture!\n\nIf you have any specific questions about your cake recipe or would like more detailed guidance, feel free to ask.",
