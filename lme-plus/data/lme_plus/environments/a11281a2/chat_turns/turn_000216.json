I'm trying to be honest with myself about which items I really wear and love, and which ones I can let go of. It's not always easy, but it feels great to be making progress towards a more organized and sustainable closet.\n\nI've also been thinking about how I can make more intentional purchasing decisions in the future. I want to focus on buying high-quality, timeless pieces that will last, rather than fast fashion items that might only be worn a few times. Do you have any tips on how to make more sustainable purchasing decisions?",
