  "content": "Certainly! However, please note that a full Cisco UCS 6454 configuration is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of networking and Cisco UCS architecture. It's highly recommended that you have a professional network engineer with Cisco UCS experience to assist you with the configuration. That being said, I can provide you with a sample configuration that you can use as a reference.\n\nHere is a sample configuration for a Cisco UCS 6454:\n\n1. Configure the fabric interconnect:\n* Configure the management IP address:\n```bash\nUCS-A# scope fabric-interconnect a\nUCS-A /fabric-interconnect # create-mgmt-network 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0\n```\n* Configure the fabric interconnect to use a virtual IP address:\n```bash\nUCS-A# scope fabric-interconnect a\nUCS-A /fabric-interconnect # create-virtual-ip 10.0.0.100\n```\n* Configure the fabric interconnect to use NTP:\n```bash\nUCS-A# scope fabric-interconnect a\nUCS-A /fabric-interconnect # set ntp server 1.1.1.1\n```\n1. Configure the fabric extender:\n* Configure the FEX to use the correct Fabric Interconnect:\n```bash\nUCS-A# scope fabric-interconnect a\nUCS-A /fabric-interconnect # scope fabric-extender 101\nUCS-A /fabric-interconnect/fabric-extender # associate-uplink Eth1/1\n```\n* Configure the FEX to use the correct VLAN:\n```bash\nUCS-A# scope fabric-interconnect a\nUCS-A /fabric-interconnect # scope fabric-extender 101\nUCS-A /fabric-interconnect/fabric-extender # create-vlan 100\nUCS-A /fabric-interconnect/fabric-extender # set vlan 100 native\n```\n1. Configure the server:\n* Configure the server to use the correct VLAN:\n```bash\nUCS-A# scope server 1\nUCS-A /server # create-vnic vnic1\nUCS-A /server/vnic # set vlan 100\n```\n* Configure the server to use the correct IP address:\n```bash\nUCS-A# scope server 1\nUCS-A /server # create-vnic vnic1\nUCS-A /server/vnic # create-adapter-profile eth0\nUCS-A /server/adapter-profile # set ip 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0\n```\nPlease note that this is just a sample configuration and may not be suitable for your specific network environment. It's highly recommended that you have a professional network engineer with Cisco UCS experience to assist you with the configuration.",
