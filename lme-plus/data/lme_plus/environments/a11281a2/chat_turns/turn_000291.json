I appreciate your awareness and willingness to correct course.\n\nNo worries, though - I'm designed to adapt to conversations, and it's all part of the learning process. Thank you for the opportunity to chat with you, and I'm glad I could assist with your questions about pizza and TVs.\n\nIf you have any other topics you'd like to discuss or questions to ask in the future, feel free to reach out. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your pizza and TV-watching experiences!",
