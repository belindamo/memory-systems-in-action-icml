  "content": "Religion is supposed to be good for you. Yet people get hurt in religious systems,\nsometimes seriously. I used to think that although damage was done by so-called\ncults, most religion is essentially benign. It could give you some comfort as a child\nand teach you some values, but then you grew up and away from it. It wasn\u2019t until I\nlooked back on my struggle to grow free of my own indoctrination, and heard the\nstories of others, that I realized that this kind of emotional and mental damage can\nbe profound.\nIn conservative Christianity you are told you are unacceptable. You are judged with\nregard to your relationship to God. Thus you can only be loved positionally, not\nessentially. And, contrary to any assumed ideal of Christian love, you cannot love\nothers for their essence either. This is the horrible cost of the doctrine of original\nsin. Recovering from this unloving assumption is perhaps the core task when you\nleave the fold. It is also a discovery of great joy \u2013 to permit unconditional love for\nyourself and others.\nThe problem of religious damage has not received much attention, perhaps because\nChristianity is so much a part of our culture and real criticism is taboo. Just consider\nwhat we have done to so-called heretics throughout history. Religious damage may\nalso seem less serious than other recovery issues such a alcoholism or child abuse.\nAnd since faith is thought of as a good thing in a world brimming with materialism,\nselfishness, and violence, many feel strange when complaining of church attendance\nor growing up in a religious home.\nBut leaving your faith is not like letting your library card expire or no longer believing\nin Santa Claus. It can be shattering to realize that your religion is creating problems\nin your life. Whether you leave abruptly or drift away over a long period of time, you\nmay experience profound sadness and confusion about what to do, think, and\nbelieve. You may also feel the rage of betrayal or struggle with persistent\ndepression.\nMany people are reluctant to talk about this subject for fear of hurting loved ones, of\nalienating others, of appearing foolish and self-centered. They sometimes fear\ndiving retribution. I have known therapists who were afraid to work openly with\npeople on these issues because they were concerned they might be labeled antireligious or anti-God. However, more often, therapists who have not been through\nthe experience themselves do not understand the difficulty of recovering from an\nauthoritarian religion.",
