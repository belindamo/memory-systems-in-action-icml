It's always a good idea to measure twice and buy once, especially when it comes to furniture.\n\nRemember to take note of any obstacles or constraints in the room, such as windows, doors, or electrical outlets, that might affect the placement of your new desk. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.\n\nGood luck with your measuring and shopping, and I hope you find the perfect desk and recliner for your needs!",
