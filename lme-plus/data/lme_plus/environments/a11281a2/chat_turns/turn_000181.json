  "content": "To address my recovery from religious trauma, I would first seek out resources and support from others who have gone through similar experiences. Joining a support group like RELEASE and RECLAIM Religious Recovery Group would provide me with a safe and understanding space to process my feelings and experiences. I would also look into working with a therapist or counselor who has experience in helping individuals recover from religious trauma.\n\nI would also focus on self-care and self-compassion, allowing myself time to grieve the loss of my former beliefs and understanding that it is a process. I would engage in activities that bring me joy and help me feel grounded in my identity and values.\n\nI would also aim to educate myself on the topic of religious trauma and the effects it can have on individuals, to better understand my own experiences and work through them. This may include reading books such as Dr. Marlene Winell's \"Leaving the Fold\" and exploring online resources.\n\nLastly, I would try to focus on building a new sense of community and connection, whether it be through friends, hobbies or volunteering. It is important for me to find people and activities that align with my new values and beliefs, and who support my journey of recovery.",
