Here's what you can expect:\n\n* Legroom: Extra Comfort seats provide an additional 4-6 inches of legroom compared to Main Cabin seats, with a total of 36-37 inches of pitch (the distance between your seat and the one in front of you).\n* Seat width: The seats are the same width as Main Cabin seats, but with more recline and adjustable headrests.\n* Priority boarding: As an Extra Comfort passenger, you'll enjoy priority boarding, which means you'll be among the first to board the plane and stow your carry-on luggage.\n* Dedicated overhead bin space: You'll have dedicated overhead bin space, so you won't have to worry about finding a spot for your carry-on.\n* Priority deplaning: When the flight lands, you'll be among the first to exit the plane.\n* Complimentary amenities: You'll receive complimentary access to Hawaiian Airlines' in-flight entertainment system, as well as a souvenir blanket and pillow.\n* Meal service: You'll be offered a complimentary meal and drink service, including Hawaiian Airlines' signature Mai Tai cocktail.\n\nKeep in mind that Extra Comfort seats are located in the front of the aircraft, near the Main Cabin section. While they don't offer lie-flat beds or suites like some other airlines' premium cabins, they do provide a more comfortable and convenient flying experience.\n\nRegarding your American Airlines upgrade, that's great to hear! As a frequent flyer, you likely have a higher status tier, which can increase your chances of getting upgraded. Even if you're not a frequent flyer with American Airlines, having status with another airline can sometimes be recognized by other carriers, leading to unexpected upgrades like the one you experienced. Enjoy your perks!",
