Look for baklava that has been made that day or within the last few days. 2. Check the layers - Traditional baklava should have multiple layers of crispy phyllo pastry that have been brushed with butter or oil. The layers should be delicate and not too thick. 3. Inspect the filling - The filling of the baklava is typically made with chopped nuts, such as pistachios or walnuts, and held together with a sweet syrup. The nuts should be fresh and flavorful, and the syrup should be thick and not too sugary. 4. Choose a reputable bakery - Visit a bakery that is known for its baklava, or that has good reviews from customers. This will ensure that you are getting a high-quality product. 5. Pay attention to the shape - Traditional baklava is often shaped into diamond shapes, but some bakeries may also make baklava in square or rectangular shapes. The shape should be uniform and tidy. By following these tips, you should be able to find delicious, high-quality baklava to enjoy!",
