      "content": "The Ethereum white paper, which was published in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, identifies several limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain that Ethereum aims to address. Here is a summary of those limitations and how Ethereum addresses them:\n\n1. Limited programming capabilities: Bitcoin's scripting language is not Turing-complete, which means that it cannot execute all possible computational steps. This limits the types of applications that can be built on the Bitcoin blockchain. In contrast, Ethereum's virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is Turing-complete, which enables developers to build more complex decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain.\n2. Difficulty of making changes to the protocol: Because Bitcoin is decentralized and has no formal governance structure, it can be difficult to make changes to the protocol. This has led to debates and forks in the community when changes are proposed. In contrast, Ethereum has a formal governance structure that allows for changes to be proposed, discussed, and implemented in a more orderly fashion.\n3. High barriers to entry for developers: Bitcoin's limited programming capabilities and lack of formal governance structure make it difficult for new developers to contribute to the platform. In contrast, Ethereum has a more flexible programming language and a formal governance structure, making it easier for new developers to build on the platform.\n4. Difficulty of implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. Bitcoin's limited scripting language makes it difficult to implement smart contracts on the platform. In contrast, Ethereum's EVM enables the implementation of smart contracts on the platform.\n5. High energy consumption: Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which is used to secure the network and validate transactions, is very energy-intensive. In contrast, Ethereum is currently planning to transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is expected to be less energy-intensive.\n\nIt's worth noting that since Ethereum white paper, several improvements have been made to bitcoin, like segwit and lightning network, which improves the scalability and transaction speed, also new consensus mechanisms, like proof of stake, are being tested on the bitcoin network to reduce energy consumption.\nIt's worth to mention that the advantages and disadvantages of each blockchain are not absolute and depend on the use case and purpose."

      "content": "Explain \"Value-blindness - there is no way for a UTXO script to provide fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn. For example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD, but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure requirement over the fully centralized solutions that are available now. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the only way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO of 2k for every k up to 30) and having O pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B.\""

      "content": "The concept of \"value-blindness\" refers to a limitation of the Bitcoin blockchain's transaction model, specifically the use of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to control the movement of funds.\n\nIn Bitcoin, when a user wants to make a transaction, they must specify the exact UTXOs they want to spend, along with the destination address and the amount they want to send. These UTXOs are all-or-nothing, meaning that they can only be spent in their entirety; there is no way to split or divide them.\n\nThis limitation can be a problem for certain types of transactions, such as hedging contracts. A hedging contract is a type of financial contract where two parties (A and B) agree to exchange a fixed amount of money after a certain period of time, with the exchange rate being determined by the market value of a specific asset (e.g. 1 BTC = $1000 USD).\n\nFor example, if A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC each into a hedging contract, and after 30 days, the script should send $1000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the only way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having many UTXO of varying denominations (e.g. one UTXO of 2k for every k up to 30) and having the oracle contract pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B.\n\nThis issue can be solved by the use of smart-contracts which Ethereum provides, where the amount of transaction and the exchange rate can be programmed in the contract, so the funds can be automatically divided among the participants in the contract without relying on the inefficient hack of having many UTXOs."

On a Bitcoin-based system, in order to achieve this type of contract, one would have to create many UTXOs of varying denominations, and have an oracle contract pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B.

      "content": "In the context of Bitcoin and the sentence you quoted, \"denominations\" refers to the amount of value associated with a single UTXO.\n\nIn Bitcoin, transactions are made up of one or more UTXOs that the sender is spending, and each UTXO represents a certain amount of value in Bitcoin. These amounts are typically measured in satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin (equivalent to 0.00000001 BTC), and typically come in whole numbers. So you might have UTXOs with values of 10,000 satoshis, 20,000 satoshis, 100,000 satoshis, and so on.\n\nIn the sentence you quoted, the example used is of creating many UTXOs of varying denominations (e.g. one UTXO of 2k for every k up to 30). This means creating many UTXOs each with different values in the range of 2,000 to 30,000 satoshis (or 2 to 30 Bitcoins) so that the oracle can pick and use the exact amount needed for the transaction.\n\nThis is considered as inefficient hack because it increases the complexity and resource usage of the system, as it would require a lot of UTXOs to be created to cover all possible scenarios and also the oracle would need to go through all the UTXOs to find the correct one to use."

This is because the oracle is responsible for determining the market value of the asset and deciding how much should be sent to each participant.\n\nThe oracle would need to determine how much the asset is worth in the current market, and then determine how much of that value should be sent to each party. In order to accomplish this on a Bitcoin-based system, where the UTXOs are all-or-nothing and can only be spent in their entirety, the oracle would need to go through each UTXO of varying denominations to find the one with the exact value needed for the transaction.\n\nFor example, if the oracle determines that the market value of the asset is $1000 and the contract states that party A should receive $800 and party B should receive $200, the oracle would need to go through all the UTXOs to find the one with the exact value of $800 and the exact value of $200, and then send them to the appropriate parties.\n\nThis is inefficient because it would require a lot of UTXOs to be created to cover all possible scenarios and also the oracle would need to go through all the UTXOs to find the correct one to use, which would increase the complexity and resource usage of the system. On the other hand, with smart contract on Ethereum, the oracle can automatically divide the funds based on the programmed exchange rate, and the contract will handle the transaction, so it's a more efficient and less complex way."
