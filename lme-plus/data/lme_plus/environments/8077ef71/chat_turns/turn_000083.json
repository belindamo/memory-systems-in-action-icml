  "content": "Using soap to clean a cast iron pan can damage the seasoning that gives it its non-stick and rust-resistant properties. This is because the soap can strip off the seasoning, making the pan more prone to rust and food sticking to its surface. While some people choose to use soap on their cast iron pans, it is generally not recommended if you want to maintain the pan's non-stick and rust-resistant qualities. If you find that using soap is the easiest and most convenient method for you, just be prepared to re-season your pan more frequently to keep it in good condition.",
