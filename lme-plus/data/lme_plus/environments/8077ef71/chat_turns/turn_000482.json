  "content": "A third reason for the changes in crop production in sub-Saharan Africa due to a temperature rise of 2\u00b0C could be increased frequency and severity of drought and water scarcity. As temperatures rise and evaporation rates increase, water sources such as rivers and aquifers may become depleted, making it more difficult for farmers to irrigate their crops and leading to reduced crop yields. Additionally, in regions where water scarcity is already a problem, the increased competition for limited water resources could lead to further conflict and social upheaval, exacerbating the already serious challenges faced by communities in sub-Saharan Africa.",
