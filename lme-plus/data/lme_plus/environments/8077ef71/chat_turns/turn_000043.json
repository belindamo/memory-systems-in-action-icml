For the Charitable Giving category, you can log the date, description, and amount of the groceries you purchased for Mrs. Johnson.\n\nRemember to update your spreadsheet regularly to keep track of your expenses and stay organized!\n\nTips:\n\n* Consider setting up separate columns for the category total, so you can easily calculate the total amount spent in each category.\n* You can also add a \"Running Total\" column to keep track of your overall expenses.\n* If you want to get more detailed, you can create subcategories within each category (e.g., \"Birthdays\" and \"Baby Showers\" under **Gifts**).\n* Don't forget to save your spreadsheet regularly, and consider setting up automatic backups to ensure your data is safe.",
