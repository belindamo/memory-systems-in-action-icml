I've been getting a lot of inspiration from their photos and stories, and it's helping me to plan my own trip. I've also been saving posts about specific destinations, food, and cultural experiences that I want to have while I'm there. It's been really helpful in getting me excited for my trip and giving me ideas for things to do and see.",
