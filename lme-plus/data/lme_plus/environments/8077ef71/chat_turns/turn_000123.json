  "content": "Perfect timing! The Sephora VIB Sale is an amazing opportunity to try out new high-end products without breaking the bank.\n\nBefore we dive into product recommendations, let's start with a few questions to help me better understand your skin type and concerns:\n\n1. What is your skin type (normal, dry, oily, combination, sensitive, acne-prone)?\n2. What are your main skin concerns (acne, hyperpigmentation, fine lines, dullness, dehydration)?\n3. Are there any specific skin goals you want to achieve with your new skincare routine (e.g., brighter complexion, reduced pores, improved texture)?\n4. Are you currently using any products that you love and wouldn't want to replace, or are you open to switching everything up?\n5. Do you have a preferred skincare philosophy or ingredient preferences (e.g., natural, vegan, fragrance-free, retinol-based)?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your skin and preferences, I can offer personalized recommendations on which high-end products to consider during the VIB Sale.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that it's essential to patch test new products, even if you're buying from a reputable brand. This will help you ensure that you don't have any adverse reactions or sensitivities to new ingredients.\n\nGet ready to splurge and treat your skin to some amazing new products!",
