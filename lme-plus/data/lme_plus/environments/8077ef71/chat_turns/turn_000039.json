Based on the examples you provided, here are some categories that might be relevant:\n\n1. **Gifts**: This category can include expenses related to birthday gifts, holiday gifts, and other occasions where you're purchasing something for someone else.\n2. **Personal Care/Fashion**: This category might include expenses like clothing, accessories, beauty products, and other personal items. In this case, the silver necklace with a tiny pendant could fit into this category, but since it was a gift, we'll keep it under **Gifts**.\n3. **Social Obligations**: This category can include expenses related to social events, such as baby showers, weddings, and other celebrations. The baby onesie and baby blocks could fit into this category.\n\nHere's a breakdown of your expenses:\n\n* **Gifts**:\n\t+ Silver necklace with tiny pendant for sister's 25th birthday: $40\n* **Social Obligations**:\n\t+ Baby onesie and baby blocks for colleague's wife's baby shower: $20\n\nFeel free to add more categories or subcategories as needed to fit your specific spending habits. For example, you might have categories for:\n\n* **Food and Dining**\n* **Entertainment** (movies, concerts, hobbies)\n* **Transportation** (gas, parking, public transit)\n* **Housing** (rent, utilities, maintenance)\n* **Savings** (emergency fund, retirement, specific goals)\n\nAs you continue to track your expenses, you can refine your categories and gain a better understanding of where your money is going.",
