Game Event Triggering\n\nOCR can be used to detect game state changes in real-time, and trigger the relevant events. OCR libraries like Tesseract.js can be used to recognize text from screenshots or live video feeds of gameplay. You can write a script that takes a screenshot at regular intervals, runs it through the OCR engine, and detects any changes in the game state.\n\nAlternatively, the game can be modified to send real-time game state updates to a backend server, which can then be processed and stored in the database. The server can then trigger an event when the game ends or when a winner is determined.\n\n2. Smart Contract\n\nTo build a smart contract, you can use a framework like Solidity. The contract will need to handle the following functions:\n\n* Accepting bets from users and holding the funds in escrow until the game is over\n* Verifying the results of the game through a decentralized oracle\n* Distributing winnings to the correct users\n* Handling edge cases like disputes, late bets, or game cancellations\n\nTo ensure that the smart contract is secure, it should be thoroughly tested and audited by security experts.\n\n3. Web3 Integration\n\nTo interact with the smart contract, you can use a web3 library like Web3.js. The library can be used to send transactions to the blockchain, check user balances, and collect winnings. You can create a simple UI that allows users to connect their wallets (e.g. MetaMask), place bets, and view their past betting history.\n\n4. MongoDB\n\nTo store user data, transaction history, and other information, you can use MongoDB. MongoDB can be easily integrated with Node.js using the Mongoose library. You can create a schema to define the structure of your data, and use the relevant Mongoose functions to insert, update, or query the data.\n\n5. MERN Stack Integration\n\nTo build a full-stack application, you can use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). Express can be used to create a server that interacts with the smart contract and MongoDB. React can be used to create a user interface that communicates with the server, and Node.js can be used to handle the backend logic.\n\nIn summary, building a P2P betting system with web3, OCR, and MongoDB/MERN stack requires expertise in several different areas, including blockchain development, OCR, web development, and database design. While it can be a challenging task, the end result can be a powerful, decentralized platform that allows users to place bets on their favorite games in a secure and transparent manner.",
