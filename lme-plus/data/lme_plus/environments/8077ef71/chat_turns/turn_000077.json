  "content": "Cleaning a Cast Iron Pan:\n\n1. Start by wiping out any excess food from the pan. If there is still food sticking to the pan, you can use a plastic scraper to loosen it up.\n\n2. Rinse the pan under hot water. Do not use soap, as it can strip the pan of its seasoning. \n\n3. Use a soft-bristled brush to gently scrub any remaining bits of food off of the pan. \n\n4. Once the pan is clean, dry it thoroughly, making sure there is no moisture left on the surface.\n\n5. Optionally, you can use a little bit of vegetable oil to rub onto the surface of the pan, this will help keep it from rusting.\n\nSeasoning a Cast Iron Pan:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F.\n\n2. Apply a thin layer of vegetable oil to the entire surface of the pan, both inside and out.\n\n3. Place the pan upside down on a baking sheet and place it in the oven.\n\n4. Allow the pan to bake for 30-40 minutes, until it appears darker and the oil has fully absorbed.\n\n5. Turn off the oven and let the pan cool down in the oven.\n\n6. Once the pan has cooled down, you can use it as normal. Repeat this seasoning process as needed to keep your pan nonstick and rust-resistant.",
