  "content": "The Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 marked the end of British control over Afghanistan. The war was fought between the British Indian Empire and Afghanistan, and resulted in Afghanistan regaining its independence from British control.\n\nThe war had a significant impact on the relationship between Great Britain and Afghanistan. It demonstrated that Afghanistan was no longer willing to be subservient to British rule, and that it could stand up to British military might.\n\nThe Third Anglo-Afghan War also led to the signing of the Treaty of Rawalpindi, which defined the borders between Afghanistan and British India. The treaty recognized Afghanistan as an independent state, which helped to improve relations between the two countries.\n\nOverall, the Third Anglo-Afghan War marked a turning point in the relationship between Great Britain and Afghanistan, and paved the way for future diplomatic relations between the two nations.",
