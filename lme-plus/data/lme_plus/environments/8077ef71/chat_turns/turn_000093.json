  "content": "Mini quiches and fruit skewers will pair nicely together.\n\nFor a red wine to complement your snacks, I'd recommend a light- to medium-bodied wine with moderate acidity and tannins. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Pinot Noir**: A light-bodied wine with flavors of cherry, raspberry, and earthy notes that will complement the savory quiches and sweetness of the fruit.\n2. **Beaujolais**: A fruity and approachable wine with low tannins, perfect for a casual movie night. Its bright acidity will cut through the richness of the quiches.\n3. **Valpolicella**: An Italian red wine with a mix of cherry, plum, and spice flavors. Its moderate acidity and soft tannins make it a great pairing for the fruit and quiches.\n\nRemember, when serving wine, it's always a good idea to have a few wine wipes or a wine cleaning solution on hand, just in case of any accidents!\n\nGlad to hear that you were able to clean up the spill quickly last weekend. To avoid any future mishaps, you might consider using a wine glass with a wide base and a narrow rim, as they're less likely to tip over.\n\nEnjoy your movie night, and cheers to a spill-free evening!",
