Downward-facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana): This pose stretches the spine, arms, and legs. Begin on your hands and knees and lift your hips up and back until you form an upside-down V-shape with your body.\n\n3. Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I): This pose strengthens and lengthens the spine and stretches the hips and shoulders.
