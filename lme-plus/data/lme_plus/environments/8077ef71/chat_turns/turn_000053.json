  "content": "The Third Anglo-Afghan War was a violent conflict fought between the British Indian Empire and Afghanistan. The war lasted from May to August 1919 and resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.\n\nThe cause of the war was the refusal of King Amanullah Khan of Afghanistan to accept the terms of the Treaty of Gandamak of 1879, which had made Afghanistan a British protectorate. The British demanded that Afghanistan accept their terms, but King Amanullah refused, resulting in the outbreak of war.\n\nThe war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Rawalpindi on August 8, 1919, which recognized Afghanistan as an independent state. However, the war was not resolved peacefully, as it had led to significant loss of life and destruction on both sides.",
