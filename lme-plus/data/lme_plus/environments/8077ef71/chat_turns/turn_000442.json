  "content": "The tomato and mozzarella salad sounds great. I love the simplicity of it. I was just thinking about my family picnic in June, and we had a similar salad that was a big hit. We also had a big potluck, and I made my famous mac and cheese, which was a hit with the kids. Anyway, back to the salad - do you have any tips on how to keep it fresh and prevent it from getting soggy?",
