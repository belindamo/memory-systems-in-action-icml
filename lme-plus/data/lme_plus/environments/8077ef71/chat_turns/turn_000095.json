Dimming the lights and using candles will create a warm and inviting ambiance, perfect for a cozy movie night.\n\nFor scents, you'll want something that complements the wine and snacks without overpowering them. Here are some recommendations that fit your cozy living room atmosphere:\n\n1. **Vanilla**: A warm, comforting scent that pairs well with the sweetness of the fruit skewers and the richness of the quiches. It's also a calming scent that will help create a relaxing atmosphere.\n2. **Cinnamon**: A classic winter spice that evokes feelings of coziness and warmth. It will complement the fruit and quiches nicely, and its spicy aroma will add a nice depth to the room.\n3. **Lavender**: A calming and soothing scent that will help create a peaceful ambiance. It's a gentle, subtle scent that won't overpower the wine or snacks, and it's known to promote relaxation.\n4. **Caramel**: A sweet, comforting scent that will pair nicely with the fruit and quiches. It's a warm, inviting aroma that will make your living room feel cozy and welcoming.\n5. **Woodland Berries**: A scent that captures the essence of berries, woods, and spices, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. It's a great choice if you want a scent that's reminiscent of a crackling fireplace.\n\nWhen it comes to candle choices, you can opt for:\n\n* Soy wax candles: They're a great eco-friendly option and tend to have a cleaner, more subtle burn.\n* Beeswax candles: They have a warm, natural glow and a gentle, honey-like scent.\n* Essential oil candles: They're infused with essential oils and can provide a more intense, therapeutic scent.\n\nRemember to place the candles strategically around the room to create a warm and inviting ambiance. Just be sure to keep them at a safe distance from any flammable materials, and never leave them unattended.\n\nEnjoy your cozy movie night, and I hope these recommendations help create a warm and inviting atmosphere!",
