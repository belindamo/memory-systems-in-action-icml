Crouch or crawl to reduce your visibility and avoid running, as it can attract unwanted attention.\n2. **Use your senses**: Use Ellie's listening mode (press the R3 button on PS4) to detect the infected's location and movement. This will help you plan your route and avoid them.\n3. **Stay low and hidden**: Make use of the environment to stay hidden. Use walls, crates, and other obstacles to conceal yourself from the infected. Stay low to the ground and avoid standing upright, as this can make you more visible.\n4. **Take it slow**: Don't rush through the area. Take your time to observe the infected's patrol routes and wait for them to move away from your desired path.\n5. **Use distractions**: If you need to distract an infected, throw a bottle or a brick to divert their attention. This can give you a window of opportunity to sneak past them.\n6. **Use narrow paths**: Stick to narrow paths and alleys, as these can funnel the infected into a smaller area, making it easier to sneak past them.\n7. **Keep an eye on your mini-map**: The mini-map will show you the infected's location and movement. Use this to plan your next move and avoid getting caught.\n8. **Stay patient and quiet**: If you're spotted, don't panic. Sometimes, the infected will lose interest if you remain still and quiet. If you're caught, try to stay calm and wait for an opportunity to escape or take them down silently.\n9. **Use your melee weapon**: If you need to take down an infected, use your melee weapon to take them out silently. Aiming for the head or neck will usually result in a quick and quiet takedown.\n10. **Save often**: It's always a good idea to save your progress frequently, especially before attempting to sneak past a group of infected.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect. Don't be discouraged if you fail a few times \u2013 it's all part of the learning process. Take your time, stay patient, and you'll eventually make it through the Seattle Day 1 chapter.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!",
