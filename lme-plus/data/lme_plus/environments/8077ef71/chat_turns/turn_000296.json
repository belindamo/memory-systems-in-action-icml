  "content": "I'm most looking forward to experiencing the new dimensional rift mechanics and seeing how they affect the gameplay. I've heard that the rifts will allow for some really creative and dynamic level design, and I'm excited to explore the different dimensions and see what kind of challenges and opportunities they present. I'm also interested in seeing how the new female Lombax character, Rivet, fits into the story and how she plays differently from Ratchet. What about you, do you have any insights into the dimensional rift mechanics or Rivet's character?",
