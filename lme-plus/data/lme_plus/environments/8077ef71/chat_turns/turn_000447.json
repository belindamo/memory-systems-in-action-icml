They're refreshing, unique, and easy to make in large quantities.\n\nNow, about keeping drinks cold at an outdoor BBQ:\n\n1. **Ice, ice, baby!**: As you mentioned, having plenty of ice on hand is crucial. You can never have too much ice at an outdoor BBQ. Consider investing in a few large coolers or ice chests to keep drinks cold.\n2. **Coolers with wheels**: If you have a large quantity of drinks to keep cold, consider using coolers with wheels. They're easy to transport and can be moved around the party area as needed.\n3. **Shaded area**: Place coolers and drinks in a shaded area to keep them out of direct sunlight. This will help keep them colder for longer.\n4. **Cold packs or frozen gel packs**: Use cold packs or frozen gel packs to keep drinks cold. These can be placed in coolers or even in the drinks themselves (like in a large pitcher).\n5. **Pre-chill drinks**: Pre-chill drinks in the refrigerator before bringing them to the BBQ. This will help keep them cold for longer.\n6. **Use insulated drink containers**: Use insulated drink containers or cups with built-in coolers to keep drinks cold. These are perfect for individual servings.\n7. **Frozen drinks**: Consider serving frozen drinks, like popsicles or slushies, which can be made in advance and kept frozen until the party.\n8. **Keep drinks away from heat sources**: Keep drinks away from heat sources like grills, smokers, or direct sunlight, which can quickly warm up drinks.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep your drinks cold and refreshing throughout the BBQ.\n\nI'm glad to hear that your mac and cheese was a hit at the family picnic! It's always great to share delicious food with loved ones.\n\nDo you have any other questions or concerns about the BBQ or drinks?",
