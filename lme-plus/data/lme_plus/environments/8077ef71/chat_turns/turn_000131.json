The Littles kit could be a great way to try out other Drunk Elephant products, like the Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser or the T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Night Serum, without committing to full-size products.\n\nUltimately, it depends on your personal preferences and skincare goals. If you want to try out multiple products and don't mind using smaller sizes, The Littles kit is an excellent choice. If you know exactly what you want and need a complete routine, buying full-size products might be the better option.",
