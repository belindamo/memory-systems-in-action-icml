  "content": "In the example given, the oracle would need to go through every UTXO of varying denominations in order to find the one with the exact value needed for the transaction. This is because the oracle is responsible for determining the market value of the asset and deciding how much should be sent to each participant.\n\nThe oracle would need to determine how much the asset is worth in the current market, and then determine how much of that value should be sent to each party. In order to accomplish this on a Bitcoin-based system, where the UTXOs are all-or-nothing and can only be spent in their entirety, the oracle would need to go through each UTXO of varying denominations to find the one with the exact value needed for the transaction.\n\nFor example, if the oracle determines that the market value of the asset is $1000 and the contract states that party A should receive $800 and party B should receive $200, the oracle would need to go through all the UTXOs to find the one with the exact value of $800 and the exact value of $200, and then send them to the appropriate parties.\n\nThis is inefficient because it would require a lot of UTXOs to be created to cover all possible scenarios and also the oracle would need to go through all the UTXOs to find the correct one to use, which would increase the complexity and resource usage of the system. On the other hand, with smart contract on Ethereum, the oracle can automatically divide the funds based on the programmed exchange rate, and the contract will handle the transaction, so it's a more efficient and less complex way.",
