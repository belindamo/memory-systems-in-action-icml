Monitoring your expenses can help you stay within your budget, identify areas where you can cut back, and make more intentional purchasing decisions. Adding a column to your spreadsheet to track the total amount spent each month can be incredibly valuable.\n\nHere are some tips to consider when tracking your monthly spending:\n\n1. **Create a budget category**: Set up a separate column or sheet in your spreadsheet to track your monthly spending by category (e.g., clothing, electronics, home goods, etc.).\n2. **Set a budget target**: Determine how much you want to allocate for online purchases each month and set a target amount. This will help you stay mindful of your spending and make adjustments as needed.\n3. **Update regularly**: Regularly update your spreadsheet with each new purchase, and calculate the total amount spent for the month.\n4. **Analyze and adjust**: Review your spending at the end of each month to identify areas where you can cut back or make adjustments for the next month.\n5. **Consider using formulas**: Use formulas in your spreadsheet to automatically calculate the total amount spent, percentages, or averages. This will make it easier to track your spending and identify trends.\n6. **Keep it realistic**: Be realistic about your budget and spending habits. Don't set unrealistic targets that you can't stick to, and be kind to yourself if you need to make adjustments.\n\nSome example columns you could add to your spreadsheet to track your monthly spending include:\n\n* Date\n* Category\n* Item/Description\n* Price\n* Total Spent (for the month)\n* Budget Target (for the month)\n* Difference (between total spent and budget target)\n\nBy tracking your monthly spending, you'll gain a better understanding of your purchasing habits and be able to make more informed decisions about your online shopping.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and to be consistent in tracking your purchases and spending. Good luck, and happy tracking!",
