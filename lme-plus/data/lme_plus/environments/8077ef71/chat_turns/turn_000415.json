I'm a virtual assistant, and I don't have knowledge about specific locations or their schedules.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you need:\n\n1. Check the recreation center's website: You can visit the recreation center's website to check their hours of operation, including Monday's schedule.\n2. Call the recreation center: Give the recreation center a call to ask about their hours of operation on Mondays. They should be able to provide you with the information you need.\n3. Check your Zumba class schedule: If you have a Zumba class schedule or a confirmation email, it might mention the recreation center's hours of operation or recommend arrival times.\n\nOnce you find out the recreation center's hours, you can plan your day accordingly to ensure you arrive with enough time to spare before your 6:30 pm Zumba class.",
