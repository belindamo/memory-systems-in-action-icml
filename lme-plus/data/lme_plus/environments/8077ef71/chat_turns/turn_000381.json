However, I have to point out that you're a bit overdue for an oil change. You're currently at 24,789 miles, and your recommended oil change interval is every 5,000 miles. That means you've gone about 4,789 miles over the recommended limit.\n\nIt's generally not a big deal to go a little over the recommended oil change interval, but it's still important to get your oil changed as soon as possible to keep your engine running smoothly and prevent any potential damage.\n\nI would recommend prioritizing the oil change over your Sunday routine, especially since you've gone so many miles over the recommended limit. You can always do your grocery shopping and fill up your gas tank another day.\n\nRemember, regular oil changes are essential for the health and longevity of your vehicle's engine. It's a small maintenance task that can save you a lot of trouble and expense in the long run.",
