While the pan is still warm, scrape out any excess food particles using a soft-bristled brush or a plastic scraper.\n\n2. Rinse the pan under hot water. If you choose to use soap, add a small amount of soap to the water and then rinse the pan thoroughly. Make sure to remove all soap residue.\n\n3. Dry the pan using a clean towel or by placing it over low heat on the stovetop.\n\n4.
