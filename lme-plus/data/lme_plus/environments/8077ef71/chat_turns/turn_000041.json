Adding a **Charitable Giving** category is a great way to track your kindness.\n\nYou can track your expenses for Mrs. Johnson's groceries in a few ways:\n\n1. **Keep receipts**: Yes, keeping receipts is a great idea. You can store them in a designated folder or envelope, and then log the expenses periodically. This way, you'll have a paper trail in case you need to refer back to the expenses.\n2. **Mobile apps**: Consider using a mobile app like Shoeboxed, Receipt Hog, or Fetch Rewards to scan and store your receipts digitally. These apps can help you organize and categorize your expenses, and some even offer rewards or cashback.\n3. **Spreadsheets or budgeting tools**: You can log your expenses in a spreadsheet like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, or use a budgeting tool like Mint, Personal Capital, or YNAB (You Need a Budget). These tools allow you to categorize and track your expenses, and some even offer features for tracking charitable giving.\n4. **Note-taking apps**: If you prefer a more low-tech approach, you can use a note-taking app like Evernote or Simplenote to log your expenses. Create a note for each purchase, including the date, amount, and a brief description.\n\nWhen logging your expenses, be sure to include the following information:\n\n* Date\n* Amount\n* Description (e.g., \"Groceries for Mrs. Johnson\")\n* Category (Charitable Giving)\n\nBy tracking your expenses, you'll have a clear record of your kindness and can see the impact of your charitable giving over time.",
