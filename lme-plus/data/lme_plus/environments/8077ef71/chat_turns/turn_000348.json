  "content": "In the context of Bitcoin and the sentence you quoted, \"denominations\" refers to the amount of value associated with a single UTXO.\n\nIn Bitcoin, transactions are made up of one or more UTXOs that the sender is spending, and each UTXO represents a certain amount of value in Bitcoin. These amounts are typically measured in satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin (equivalent to 0.00000001 BTC), and typically come in whole numbers. So you might have UTXOs with values of 10,000 satoshis, 20,000 satoshis, 100,000 satoshis, and so on.\n\nIn the sentence you quoted, the example used is of creating many UTXOs of varying denominations (e.g. one UTXO of 2k for every k up to 30). This means creating many UTXOs each with different values in the range of 2,000 to 30,000 satoshis (or 2 to 30 Bitcoins) so that the oracle can pick and use the exact amount needed for the transaction.\n\nThis is considered as inefficient hack because it increases the complexity and resource usage of the system, as it would require a lot of UTXOs to be created to cover all possible scenarios and also the oracle would need to go through all the UTXOs to find the correct one to use.",
