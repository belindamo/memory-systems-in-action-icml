  "content": "The sentence you quoted is describing the inefficiency of using the all-or-nothing UTXOs in Bitcoin to achieve more complex financial transactions, like hedging contracts.\n\nIn order to accomplish a hedging contract, where two parties agree to exchange a fixed amount of money after a certain period of time, with the exchange rate being determined by the market value of a specific asset, an oracle is needed to determine the market value of the asset. On a Bitcoin-based system, in order to achieve this type of contract, one would have to create many UTXOs of varying denominations, and have an oracle contract pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B. This is considered an inefficient hack because it requires creating many UTXOs of varying denominations, which increases the complexity and resource usage of the system.\n\nThis is in contrast to using smart contracts, like in Ethereum, where the amount of transaction and the exchange rate can be programmed in the contract, so the funds can be automatically divided among the participants in the contract without relying on the inefficient hack of having many UTXOs.\nThis makes smart contracts more suitable for creating more complex and flexible financial transactions, like hedging contracts.",
