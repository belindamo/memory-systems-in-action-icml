  "content": "The Third Anglo-Afghan War had several long-term effects on the British Empire. The war marked the end of British control over Afghanistan and signaled the decline of the British Empire's influence in the region.\n\nThe war was also costly for the British Empire in terms of both lives and resources. This, coupled with other factors such as the cost of maintaining the empire, contributed to the eventual decline and dissolution of the British Empire.\n\nAdditionally, the war and its aftermath contributed to a shift in British foreign policy, with a greater emphasis on diplomacy and alliances rather than military intervention. This can be seen in the creation of the League of Nations, which sought to resolve conflicts between nations peacefully.\n\nOverall, the Third Anglo-Afghan War played a role in the decline of the British Empire and contributed to a shift in British foreign policy.",
