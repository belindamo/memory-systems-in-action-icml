Here are some possible ways apps can impact your phone's performance:\n\n1. **Resource-intensive apps**: Apps that consume a lot of system resources (CPU, RAM, and GPU) can cause battery drain. These apps might include games, video editing software, or apps with complex graphics.\n2. **Background activities**: Apps that run in the background can continue to consume system resources, leading to battery drain. Some apps might be running background services, syncing data, or performing other tasks without your knowledge.\n3. **Push notifications**: Frequent push notifications can wake up your screen and consume battery power. If an app is sending you a high volume of notifications, it could contribute to battery drain.\n4. **Screen wake locks**: Some apps, especially those that require continuous screen activity (e.g., video players, games, or navigation apps), can keep your screen awake, leading to increased battery consumption.\n5. **In-app advertisements**: Ads within apps can be resource-intensive and cause battery drain, especially if they're playing videos or animations.\n6. **Malware or bugs**: In rare cases, a malicious app or a buggy app can cause system instability, leading to battery drain or screen sensitivity issues.\n\nRegarding your new social media app, it's possible that it's causing the issue. Here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. **Check the app's settings**: Look for any settings that might be causing the issue, such as push notifications, location services, or background refresh.\n2. **Limit background activity**: Go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **[App name]** > **Battery** and restrict the app's ability to run in the background.\n3. **Uninstall and reinstall**: Try uninstalling the app and reinstalling it to see if that resolves the issue.\n4. **Monitor the app's performance**: Use your phone's built-in battery monitor or a third-party app like Greenify to track the app's battery consumption and identify any potential issues.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps, you might want to consider reaching out to the app's developer or seeking help from a phone support specialist.\n\nKeep me updated on your progress, and let me know if you have any other questions or concerns!",
