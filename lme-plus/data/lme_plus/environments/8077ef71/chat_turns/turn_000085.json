  "content": "Yes, you can use soap to clean your cast iron pan if that is what you prefer. However, keep in mind that using soap can remove the pan's seasoning, which will make it more prone to rusting and food sticking. If you just want your pan to be clean and don't care too much about the other qualities, then soap is probably fine. Just make sure to dry the pan thoroughly after cleaning and apply a light coating of vegetable oil to help prevent rusting.",
