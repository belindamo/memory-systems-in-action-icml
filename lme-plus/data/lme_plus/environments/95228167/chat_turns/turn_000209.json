CSV (Comma Separated Values): a simple text file format that can be easily imported into spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets for analysis.\n2. Excel: a proprietary spreadsheet software that offers powerful data analysis tools, including pivot tables and chart creation.\n3. SQL database: a structured database format that can be queried using SQL (Structured Query Language) to extract specific data and perform complex analysis.\n\nUltimately, the best format for your data will depend on your specific needs and the tools you have available. If you plan to use spreadsheet software for analysis, CSV or Excel may be the best option. If you have access to a SQL database, that may also be a good choice for storing and analyzing your data.",
