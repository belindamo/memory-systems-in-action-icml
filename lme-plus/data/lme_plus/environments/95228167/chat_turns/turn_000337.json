Proper storage is crucial to maintaining the quality and safety of your food. Here are some tips to help you store your leftovers:\n\n1. **Cooling:** Cool the leftovers to room temperature within 2 hours of cooking. This helps prevent bacterial growth.\n2. **Containers:** Use airtight, shallow containers to store leftovers. Glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids are ideal. Avoid using aluminum or copper containers, as they can react with acidic foods.\n3. **Portioning:** Divide the leftovers into smaller portions to make them easier to reheat and consume. This also helps prevent having to reheat large quantities of food multiple times.\n4. **Labeling:** Label each container with the date, contents, and any reheating instructions. This ensures you can easily identify what you have and how long it's been stored.\n5. **Refrigeration:** Store the containers in the refrigerator at a temperature of 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below.
