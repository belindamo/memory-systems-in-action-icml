  "content": "The autofocus system on the Nikon Z6 is one of its strongest features, and it's a significant improvement over previous Nikon mirrorless cameras. Here's how it compares to the D850's autofocus system:\n\n**Autofocus Points:**\n\n* The Z6 has 273 phase-detection points, covering 90% of the frame. This is a significant increase from the D850's 153 phase-detection points.\n* The Z6's points are also more densely packed, allowing for more accurate subject tracking and better performance in low light.\n\n**Autofocus Modes:**\n\n* The Z6 offers several autofocus modes, including Single AF, Continuous AF, and Auto AF. It also features a new \"Wide-Area AF\" mode, which allows you to select a larger area of the frame for autofocus.\n* The D850 also offers similar autofocus modes, but with some differences in implementation.\n\n**Eye-Detection AF:**\n\n* The Z6 has advanced eye-detection AF, which can detect and track eyes even when the subject is not looking directly at the camera. This is particularly useful for portraits and close-up shots.\n* The D850 also has eye-detection AF, but it's not as advanced as the Z6's system.\n\n**Low-Light Autofocus:**\n\n* The Z6's autofocus system is designed to perform well in low-light conditions, with a rating of -2 EV to +19 EV. This is similar to the D850's rating, but the Z6's phase-detection points are more sensitive, allowing for better performance in very low light.\n\n**Autofocus Speed:**\n\n* The Z6's autofocus system is generally faster and more responsive than the D850's, especially in good lighting conditions.\n* However, in very low light or when using certain lenses, the D850's autofocus system might be slightly faster and more accurate.\n\n**Subject Tracking:**\n\n* The Z6's subject tracking is excellent, thanks to its advanced autofocus system and the ability to use the camera's phase-detection points to track subjects.\n* The D850's subject tracking is also very good, but it might not be quite as accurate or responsive as the Z6's system.\n\nIn summary, the Z6's autofocus system is a significant improvement over the D850's in many ways. It offers more autofocus points, better low-light performance, and advanced eye-detection AF. However, the D850's autofocus system is still very capable and might be slightly faster in certain situations.\n\nIf you're heavily invested in F-mount lenses and love the autofocus performance of your D850, you might not notice a significant difference with the Z6. However, if you're looking for a more advanced autofocus system with better low-light performance and advanced features like eye-detection AF, the Z6 is definitely worth considering.",
