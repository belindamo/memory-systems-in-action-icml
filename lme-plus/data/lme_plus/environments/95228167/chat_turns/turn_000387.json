Dr. Martens are known for their durability, but they still require some TLC to keep them looking their best. Here are some tips to help you care for your new boots:\n\n1. **Condition the leather**: Use a leather conditioner or a waterproofing spray to protect the leather and keep it soft. Apply a small amount to a clean cloth and gently rub it into the leather.\n2. **Avoid harsh chemicals**: Never use harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or conditioners that contain silicone or wax, as they can damage the leather.\n3. **Clean them regularly**: Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe away dirt and debris. For tougher stains, use a damp cloth with a mild soap. Avoid getting the boots soaking wet, as this can cause the leather to stretch or lose its shape.\n4. **Protect them from water**: If you need to wear your Dr. Martens in wet conditions, apply a waterproofing spray or cream to help repel water. However, avoid submerging them in water or wearing them in extreme wet conditions.\n5. **Store them properly**: When not in use, store your Dr. Martens in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Use shoe trees or stuff the boots with paper to maintain their shape.\n6. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Avoid exposing your Dr. Martens to extreme temperatures, such as near a radiator or in a hot car. This can cause the leather to dry out or crack.\n7. **Use a leather protector**: Consider applying a leather protector or waterproofing spray to the boots before wearing them for the first time. This will help protect the leather from stains and spills.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your Dr. Martens for a long time and keep them looking their best.\n\nI hope that helps! If you have any more questions or need further advice, feel free to ask. Good luck with your outfit tomorrow, and I hope you get tons of compliments!",
