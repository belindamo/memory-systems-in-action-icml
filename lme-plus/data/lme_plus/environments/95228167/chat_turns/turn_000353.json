And kudos to you for wanting to use up the ingredients you already have on hand to reduce food waste and save money!\n\nTo get started, can you please tell me what ingredients you already have at home from your last Walmart trip? This will help me suggest recipes that incorporate those items and minimize additional purchases.\n\nAlso, do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., gluten-free, dairy-free, spicy, etc.)?\n\nLastly, how many meals are you planning to prepare for the week, and how many people are you cooking for?",
