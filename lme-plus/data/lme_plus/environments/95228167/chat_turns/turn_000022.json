  "content": "I'm actually thinking of volunteering backstage at a local theater production soon. I've had some experience with backstage work before, like when I helped out at a children's theater production of \"The Wizard of Oz\" about a month ago. I was impressed by how professionally the kids performed, considering they were all under 12 years old. Do you have any advice on how to make a good impression as a volunteer backstage?",
