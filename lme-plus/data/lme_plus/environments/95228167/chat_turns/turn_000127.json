  "content": "Prioritizing tasks is a crucial step in successfully managing a project. Categorizing tasks into must-haves, should-haves, and nice-to-haves is a great way to focus on the most critical tasks first. Here's a brief explanation of each category to help you get started:\n\n**Must-haves**:\n\n* Critical tasks that are essential to the project's success\n* Failure to complete these tasks would significantly impact the project's outcome or timeline\n* Typically, these tasks have a direct impact on the project's goals, objectives, or key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\n**Should-haves**:\n\n* Important tasks that are highly desirable but not crucial to the project's success\n* These tasks are still important, but the project can still move forward without them (at least in the short term)\n* Should-haves often provide significant value or benefits, but the project can still achieve its primary objectives without them\n\n**Nice-to-haves**:\n\n* Desirable tasks that are not essential to the project's success\n* These tasks are often \"nice\" to have, but the project can still succeed without them\n* Nice-to-haves often provide additional value or benefits, but they are not critical to the project's primary objectives\n\nNow, let's categorize your tasks! Please provide the tasks you need to prioritize, and I'll help you categorize them into must-haves, should-haves, and nice-to-haves.\n\n(Remember to consider the project's goals, objectives, timelines, and stakeholders' expectations when categorizing your tasks.)",
