Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Having a physical copy**: Having a script in hand can be a great conversation starter and show that you're serious about your work.\n2. **Impromptu meetings**: You never know when you might meet someone who's interested in reading your script. Having a copy with you can be a great opportunity to capitalize on the moment.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Coming on too strong**: If you're too pushy or aggressive about sharing your script, it can be off-putting to industry professionals. You want to build relationships, not just pitch your script.\n2. **Unsolicited materials**: Many industry professionals, especially at festivals, are bombarded with scripts and materials. They might not appreciate receiving unsolicited scripts, especially if they're not actively looking for new projects.\n\nHere's a balanced approach:\n\n1. **Bring a few copies**: Bring a limited number of scripts (e.g., 5-10) in case you meet someone who's genuinely interested in reading your work.\n2. **Don't push it**: Don't force your script on anyone or try to pitch it to everyone you meet. Focus on building relationships and having conversations about the industry, films, and storytelling.\n3. **Be prepared to discuss your work**: If someone expresses interest in your script, be prepared to discuss your project, its themes, and your inspiration. This shows you're passionate about your work and willing to engage in a conversation.\n4. **Follow up**: If you do share your script with someone, be sure to follow up with a polite email or message to thank them for their time and interest.\n\nRemember, AFI Fest is a great opportunity to network, learn, and build relationships. Focus on being genuine, respectful, and open to feedback, and you'll be more likely to make meaningful connections that can help your career in the long run.",
