Here are some thoughts to help you decide:\n\n**Think Tank Photo Airport Advantage:**\n\n* The Airport Advantage is a larger bag, designed to accommodate more gear and provide better organization.\n* It features a larger capacity, with multiple compartments and pockets to keep your gear organized and easily accessible.\n* The bag is designed for travel, with a TSA-approved laptop sleeve and a dedicated tablet pocket.\n* It's built with durability in mind, with a weather-resistant design and reinforced seams.\n* The bag has a comfortable shoulder strap and a sturdy handle, making it easy to carry, even when fully loaded.\n\n**Pros of upgrading to the Airport Advantage:**\n\n* More space: If you're finding that your current bag is getting too full, the Airport Advantage provides more room to store your gear, including additional lenses, batteries, and accessories.\n* Better organization: The bag's multiple compartments and pockets will help you stay organized, making it easier to find what you need quickly.\n* Travel-friendly: If you travel frequently, the Airport Advantage is designed to make it easier to get through airport security checks and protect your gear during transit.\n\n**Cons of upgrading to the Airport Advantage:**\n\n* Size: The Airport Advantage is a larger bag, which may make it more difficult to carry in certain situations, such as hiking or traveling in tight spaces.\n* Weight: The bag is heavier than the Urban Disguise 40L, which may be a concern if you're planning to carry it for extended periods.\n\n**Alternatives to consider:**\n\n* Think Tank Photo Airport Essentials: This bag is similar to the Airport Advantage but has a slightly smaller capacity. It's a great option if you need a bit more space than the Urban Disguise 40L but don't need the full capacity of the Airport Advantage.\n* Think Tank Photo Urban Disguise 60L: This bag is a larger version of your current Urban Disguise 40L. It offers more space while still maintaining a similar design and feature set.\n\nBefore making a decision, consider the following:\n\n* How often do you travel with your gear?\n* How much gear do you need to carry?\n* Do you prioritize organization and accessibility over size and weight?\n* Are there any specific features you need in a camera bag that the Airport Advantage offers?\n\nIf you've outgrown your current bag and need more space, better organization, and travel-friendly features, the Think Tank Photo Airport Advantage is an excellent choice. However, if you're looking for a smaller upgrade or a more compact option, consider the Airport Essentials or the Urban Disguise 60L.",
