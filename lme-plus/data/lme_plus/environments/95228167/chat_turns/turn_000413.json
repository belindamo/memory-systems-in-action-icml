However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information. But I can suggest a few ways to find a great coffee shop near your office:\n\n1. **Google Search:** Simply type \"coffee shops near me\" or \"coffee shops near [your office address]\" and Google will show you a list of nearby coffee shops along with their ratings and reviews.\n2. **Yelp:** Yelp is a great platform to find and review local businesses, including coffee shops. You can search for coffee shops in your area and filter the results by rating, distance, and hours of operation.\n3. **Ask Colleagues or Friends:** Ask your colleagues or friends who work or live near your office for recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge on the best coffee shops in the area.\n4. **Coffee Shop Chains:** If you're looking for a familiar brand, you can search for coffee shop chains like Starbucks, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, or Peet's Coffee near your office.\n\nRemember to check the coffee shop's hours of operation, menu, and reviews before stopping by to ensure it fits your needs and preferences.\n\nEnjoy your smoothie bowl and coffee, and have a fantastic day!",
