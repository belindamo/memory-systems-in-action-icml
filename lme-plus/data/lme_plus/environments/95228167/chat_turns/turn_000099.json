According to the IRS, you can deduct the excess amount as a charitable contribution.\n\nTo calculate the deductible amount, you'll need to determine the fair market value of the meal and any other benefits. You can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the total cost of the ticket ($100).\n2. Estimate the fair market value of the meal (e.g., $50).\n3. Subtract the fair market value of the meal from the total cost of the ticket ($100 - $50 = $50).\n\nIn this example, you may be able to deduct $50 as a charitable contribution. Be sure to keep your ticket stub, receipt, or any other documentation from the event, as you'll need to prove the donation amount and the value of any benefits received.\n\nRemember to consult with a tax professional or the IRS website for specific guidance on charitable deductions and record-keeping requirements.",
