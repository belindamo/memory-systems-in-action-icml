Here are a few tips that may help:\n\n1. Prepare ahead of time: Before your call with the recruiter, take some time to research the company and the job you are applying for. Review your resume and think about your skills and experiences that are relevant to the position. This will help you feel more confident and prepared during the call.\n2. Practice active listening: When you are on the call, make sure to listen carefully to what the recruiter is saying. Take notes if it helps you remember important details. Ask clarifying questions if you are unsure about something they said.\n3. Be clear and concise: When you are speaking, try to be clear and concise in your responses. Avoid rambling or going off on tangents. Stick to the point and focus on highlighting your relevant skills and experiences.\n4. Use confident body language: Even though the recruiter cannot see you, your body language can still affect how you come across on the call. Sit up straight and use confident, assertive tones of voice.\n5. Follow up after the call: After the call, send a thank-you email to the recruiter to express your gratitude for their time and reiterate your interest in the position. This can help keep you top of mind for the recruiter and show that you are a proactive candidate.\n\nRemember that practice makes perfect, so keep working on your communication skills and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get it right on the first try.",
