Both simple stud earrings and drop earrings can work well with a sundress, but it ultimately depends on the style of the dress and the overall vibe you're going for.\n\n**Simple stud earrings**:\n\n* Would work well if the sundress has a lot of details, like intricate embroidery or beading, and you don't want to distract from the dress.\n* Can add a touch of understated elegance to your overall look.\n* Are a great choice if you want to keep the focus on the dress and not draw attention away from it.\n\n**Drop earrings**:\n\n* Can add a playful, whimsical touch to your overall look, which can be perfect for a summer wedding.\n* Can draw attention to your face and add a touch of glamour to your overall look.\n* Can work well if the sundress has a simpler design and you want to add some visual interest to your overall look.\n\nConsidering your sundress has white flowers, I think a pair of drop earrings with a natural or floral motif could be a lovely choice. The movement of the earrings can add a playful touch to your overall look, and the floral motif can tie in nicely with the flowers on the dress.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to keep things simple, a pair of small, delicate stud earrings in a neutral color like pearl, gold, or silver can complement the dress without overpowering it.\n\nUltimately, the choice between stud earrings and drop earrings depends on your personal style and the overall vibe you're going for. You can't go wrong with either choice, as long as you feel confident and comfortable in what you're wearing!",
