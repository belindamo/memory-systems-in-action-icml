I'm comfortable handling customer complaints and always strive to provide excellent service.\n\nRecruiter: Great, can you give me an example of a time when you went above and beyond for a customer?\n\nYou: Sure, one time a customer came in looking for a specific product that we were out of stock on. I offered to check other stores in the area and ended up finding the product at a different location. I drove to the other store and picked up the product for the customer, who was very grateful for my help.\n\nRecruiter: Thanks for sharing that. Is there anything else you want me to know about your customer service experience?\n\nYou: Just that I enjoy working with people and am always willing to go the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction.",
