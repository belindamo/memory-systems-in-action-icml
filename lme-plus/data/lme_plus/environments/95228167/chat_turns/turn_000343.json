I've got some cleaning tips to help you get rid of them:\n\n**Snack Crumbs:**\n\n1. **Vacuum or sweep**: Use a handheld vacuum or a soft-bristled brush to gently remove loose crumbs.\n2. **Damp cloth**: Dampen a microfiber cloth with water, and then wipe down the table. This will help pick up crumbs and dust.\n3. **Dry the surface**: Use a dry section of the cloth to wipe away any excess moisture and prevent water spots.\n\n**Stains:**\n\n1. **Blot, don't wipe**: For liquid spills or stains, blot the area gently with a clean, damp cloth. Avoid wiping, as this can spread the stain.\n2. **White vinegar and water**: Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a small bowl. Dip a clean cloth into the solution, blot the stain, and then wipe clean with a dry cloth.\n3. **Baking soda and water**: For tougher stains, make a paste by mixing 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of water. Apply the paste to the stain, let it sit for 30 minutes, and then wipe clean with a damp cloth.\n4. **Glass cleaner**: If the stain is on a glass surface, use a gentle glass cleaner and a lint-free cloth to wipe away the stain.\n\n**General Coffee Table Cleaning Tips:**\n\n1. **Dust regularly**: Use a soft, dry cloth to dust your coffee table regularly to prevent crumbs and dust from building up.\n2. **Use coasters**: Place coasters under your drinks to prevent water rings and spills.\n3. **Clean spills immediately**: The sooner you clean a spill, the less likely it is to leave a stain.\n4. **Condition your wood table**: If you have a wood coffee table, consider conditioning it every 3-6 months to protect the finish and make cleaning easier.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to get your coffee table looking like new again!\n\nEnjoy your movie night, and I hope you love Crazy Rich Asians!",
