Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Bear Canisters:**\n\n* In the John Muir Wilderness, bear canisters are highly recommended for storing food and scented items.\n* If you plan to camp overnight, bear canisters are mandatory in certain areas, including the entire John Muir Wilderness above 10,000 feet.\n* Bear canisters must be specifically designed for bear resistance and have a minimum capacity of 408 cubic inches (6.7 liters).\n\n**Food Storage:**\n\n* Store all food, trash, and scented items (e.g., toothpaste, soap, lotion) in a bear canister or hang them from a tree at least 10 feet off the ground and 4 feet out from the trunk.\n* Keep a clean campsite, and dispose of trash and food waste in bear-proof trash cans or by packing it out with you.\n\n**Other Bear Safety Tips:**\n\n* Hike in groups of three or more whenever possible.\n* Make noise while hiking to avoid surprising bears. Talk, sing, or wear bear bells to alert them to your presence.\n* Avoid hiking at dawn, dusk, or night when bears are most active.\n* Stay on designated trails and avoid taking shortcuts or wandering off-trail.\n* Be aware of your surroundings and watch for signs of bears, such as tracks, scat, or digging.\n\n**Bear-Resistant Food Containers:**\n\n* If you don't have a bear canister, you can rent or purchase bear-resistant food containers at local outfitters or visitor centers.\n* Make sure the container is specifically designed for bear resistance and meets the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee (IGBC) standards.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* Check with the Inyo National Forest website or visitor centers for up-to-date bear safety information and regulations.\n* Consult the John Muir Wilderness website for more information on bear safety and camping regulations.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to bear safety. By following these guidelines and using your bear canister, you'll minimize the risk of attracting bears to your campsite and ensure a safe and enjoyable trip in the John Muir Wilderness.",
