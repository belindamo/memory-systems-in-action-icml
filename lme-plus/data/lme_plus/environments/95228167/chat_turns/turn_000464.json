  "content": "Despite the initial charge and attraction, Val and Momo\u2019s relationship remained mostly casual due to their busy schedules and the fact that Momo had other lovers. Val found herself content with the arrangement, enjoying the occasional physical connection with Momo but not expecting anything more. Momo was more socially active than Val and was involved in a variety of activities and groups, which Val found interesting to hear about but didn't feel inclined to participate in herself.\n\nOver time, Val realized that there were deeper longings she had that she was never able to express with Momo, and it began to bother her more and more. She found herself wanting something more substantial, a deeper emotional connection with someone who understood her better. It wasn't until she met Odyl on a mission that she realized what she had been missing all along.",
