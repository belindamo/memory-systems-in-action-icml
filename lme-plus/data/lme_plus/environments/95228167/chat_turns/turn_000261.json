Here's a brief comparison with the D500 and D5 to help you decide:\n\n**Nikon Z6:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Smaller and lighter than the D850, making it a great travel companion.\n\t+ Excellent video capabilities, which might be useful if you're expanding your services to include more video work.\n\t+ Lower cost compared to the D5.\n\t+ Can use your existing F-mount lenses with the FTZ Adapter.\n* Cons:\n\t+ Different mount and lens ecosystem compared to your D850, which might lead to some duplication of lenses if you decide to invest in native Z-mount lenses.\n\t+ Autofocus system, while excellent, might not be as robust as the D850's or D5's in certain situations.\n\n**Nikon D500:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Shares the same mount and lens ecosystem as your D850, making it a more seamless transition.\n\t+ Excellent autofocus system, ideal for fast-paced shooting, such as wildlife or sports photography.\n\t+ Similar build quality and weather sealing to the D850.\n* Cons:\n\t+ APS-C sensor, which might not provide the same level of image quality as the full-frame D850 or Z6.\n\t+ No 4K video capabilities, which might be a limitation if you're interested in video work.\n\n**Nikon D5:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Flagship-level autofocus system, ideal for the most demanding shooting situations.\n\t+ Excellent low-light performance and high ISO capabilities.\n\t+ Shares the same mount and lens ecosystem as your D850.\n* Cons:\n\t+ Higher cost compared to the Z6 and D500.\n\t+ Larger and heavier than the Z6, which might make it less appealing for travel.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you make a decision:\n\n1. Are you invested in the F-mount lens ecosystem, and do you plan to continue using those lenses? If so, the D500 or D5 might be a more seamless choice.\n2. Do you prioritize video capabilities, and do you plan to expand your services to include more video work? If so, the Z6 might be the better choice.\n3. Are you looking for a more compact and lightweight backup camera body? If so, the Z6 is an excellent option.\n4. Do you need the absolute best autofocus performance and low-light capabilities for your backup camera? If so, the D5 might be the better choice.\n\nUltimately, the Nikon Z6 can make a great backup camera body, especially if you're looking for a more compact and lightweight option with excellent video capabilities. However, if you're deeply invested in the F-mount ecosystem and prioritize autofocus performance, the D500 or D5 might be a better fit.",
