  "content": "Certainly! Here are some examples from \"The Meaning of Meaning\" to illustrate their theory:\n\n* \"The cat sat on the mat\" has a different meaning from \"The mat sat on the cat.\" This demonstrates that the meaning of a sentence depends not only on the individual meanings of the words, but also on their arrangement in the sentence.\n* Ogden and Richards use the example of the word \"red\" to illustrate the difference between a symbol and a signal. The word \"red\" is a symbol because its meaning is arbitrary and conventionally agreed upon by speakers of the language, whereas a signal like a red traffic light has a direct and non-arbitrary relationship with the action it signifies.\n* They argue that the meaning of a word is not simply its referent in the external world, but also the associations and connotations that it carries. For example, the word \"snake\" may elicit feelings of fear or danger in some people due to its negative cultural associations, even if the specific referent of the word is not actually present.\n* Ogden and Richards also introduce the concept of \"contextual definition,\" where the meaning of a word is defined in relation to the specific context in which it is used. They use the example of the word \"line,\" which can have different meanings depending on the context: a line on a map, a line of text, a line in a play, etc.",
