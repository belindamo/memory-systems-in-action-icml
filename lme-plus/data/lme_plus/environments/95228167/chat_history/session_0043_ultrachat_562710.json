Connection to culture: First-generation Latinos may be more connected to their original culture, while third-generation Latinos may have a more diluted connection due to assimilation.\n\n3. Acculturation: First-generation Latinos may struggle with acculturation, while third-generation Latinos may have fully assimilated to American culture.\n\n4.
