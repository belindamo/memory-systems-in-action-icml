      "content": "The Nikon Z6 is an excellent choice as a backup camera body, and its video capabilities are one of its strong suits. Here's a rundown of its video features and how they compare to the D850:\n\n**Video Resolution and Frame Rates:**\n\n* The Nikon Z6 can record 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) video at 30p, 25p, and 24p, with a maximum bitrate of 100 Mbps.\n* It can also record 1080p at up to 120p for slow-motion footage.\n* The D850, on the other hand, can record 4K UHD at 30p, but only in a cropped mode (DX mode), which reduces the sensor size. In full-frame mode, it's limited to 1080p at 60p.\n\n**Image Stabilization:**\n\n* The Z6 has in-body image stabilization (IBIS), which provides up to 5 stops of stabilization. This is a significant advantage over the D850, which relies on lens-based stabilization.\n* IBIS allows for smoother handheld footage and more effective stabilization when using lenses without VR (vibration reduction).\n\n**Autofocus and Subject Tracking:**\n\n* The Z6 features advanced autofocus with 273 phase-detection points, covering 90% of the frame. This leads to faster and more accurate subject tracking, especially in video mode.\n* The D850, on the other hand, uses a 153-point phase-detection system, which is still excellent but not as advanced as the Z6's system.\n\n**Rolling Shutter and Moir\u00e9:**\n\n* The Z6 has a faster readout speed, which reduces rolling shutter artifacts, making it better suited for capturing fast-moving subjects.\n* The Z6 also has a more effective moir\u00e9 reduction system, which helps minimize the occurrence of moir\u00e9 patterns in video footage.\n\n**Other Video Features:**\n\n* Both cameras offer zebra stripes, focus peaking, and timecode support.\n* The Z6 has a built-in interval timer and can create 4K time-lapses in-camera.\n* The Z6 also has a more advanced audio system, with a built-in stereo microphone and the option to attach an external microphone via the 3.5mm jack.\n\n**Comparison Summary:**\n\n* The Nikon Z6 is a more capable video camera than the D850, with advanced autofocus, better image stabilization, and reduced rolling shutter artifacts.\n* The Z6's 4K video capabilities are more robust, with a higher maximum bitrate and the ability to record 4K in full-frame mode.\n* However, the D850 still excels in still photography, with its high-resolution 45.7MP sensor and excellent low-light performance.\n\nAs a backup camera body, the Z6 is an excellent choice to complement your D850. You can use the Z6 for video-centric shoots or when you need the advantages of mirrorless technology, while still relying on your D850 for high-resolution still photography."

      "content": "The Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens is a fantastic piece of glass, and you'll be happy to know that it's compatible with the Nikon Z6, but with some limitations.\n\nThe Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens is a DSLR lens, designed for Nikon F-mount cameras like your D850. The Nikon Z6, being a mirrorless camera, has a different mount called the Z-mount. To use your Sigma lens on the Z6, you'll need an adapter.\n\nNikon offers an official adapter, the FTZ Adapter, which allows you to mount F-mount lenses on Z-mount cameras. This adapter is compatible with a wide range of F-mount lenses, including the Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens.\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind when using the FTZ Adapter with your Sigma lens on the Z6:\n\n1. **Autofocus:** Autofocus performance might be slightly slower and less accurate compared to using a native Z-mount lens. However, the FTZ Adapter does support phase-detection autofocus, which is still quite reliable.\n2. **Image Stabilization:** The Sigma lens has Optical Stabilization (OS), which will work on the Z6 when using the FTZ Adapter. However, the camera's in-body image stabilization (IBIS) will not be available when using the adapter.\n3. **Aperture Control:** The FTZ Adapter allows for electronic aperture control, so you can adjust the aperture from the camera body.\n4. **Lens Corrections:** The Z6 can apply lens corrections for distortion, chromatic aberration, and vignette correction, but these might not be as accurate as they would be with a native Z-mount lens.\n\nIn terms of compatibility, Sigma has confirmed that their Art-series lenses, including the 24-70mm f/2.8, are compatible with the Nikon FTZ Adapter. However, it's always a good idea to check for any firmware updates for both the lens and the adapter to ensure optimal performance.\n\nIn summary, you can use your Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens on the Nikon Z6 with the FTZ Adapter, but be prepared for some minor limitations. The adapter will allow you to take advantage of the Z6's features, and you'll still be able to capture fantastic images with your lens."
