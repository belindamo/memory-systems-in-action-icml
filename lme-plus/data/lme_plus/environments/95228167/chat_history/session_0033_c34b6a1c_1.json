A general rule of thumb is to pair red wine with beef and white wine with the bright, fresh flavors of the bell peppers and avocado. You can't go wrong with a classic pairing like Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot with the beef, or a Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio with the bell peppers and avocado.\n\nRemember, personal taste plays a significant role in wine pairings, so don't be afraid to experiment and find your perfect match!"

Cooked leftovers can be safely stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.\n6. **Freezing:** If you don't plan to consume the leftovers within 3-4 days, consider freezing them.
