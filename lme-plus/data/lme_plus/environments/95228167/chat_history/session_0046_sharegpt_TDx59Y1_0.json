After much hard work and dedication, they finally released the anime to critical acclaim and gained a dedicated fan base.\n\nHowever, decades later, the anime was bought by a corrupt company known for producing low-quality content and milking successful properties for profit.

They tried to fight back, but ultimately had no power to stop the company's exploitation of their work."
