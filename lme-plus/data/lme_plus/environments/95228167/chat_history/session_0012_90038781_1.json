      "content": "What a wonderful gesture! Tracking your charitable donations is a great idea, and there are several apps and websites that can help you with that. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **ItsDeductible** (Web, iOS, Android): This app allows you to track donations, calculate their value, and generate reports for tax purposes. It's free, with optional premium features.\n2. **Charity Navigator** (Web): While primarily a charity evaluator, Charity Navigator also offers a donation tracking tool. You can create an account, log your donations, and access your donation history.\n3. **DonorPerfect** (Web): A comprehensive donor management platform that allows you to track donations, generate receipts, and access reports. It's free for individual use, with optional paid features.\n4. **GiveLively** (Web, iOS, Android): A donation platform that enables you to track your giving, set reminders, and access receipts. It's free, with optional premium features.\n5. **H&R Block's Deduction Tracker** (Web, iOS, Android): A free tool from H&R Block that helps you track charitable donations, as well as other deductions, throughout the year.\n\nRegarding your attendance at the \"Gala for the Homeless,\" you may be able to claim a charitable deduction for the portion of the ticket price that exceeds the fair market value of the meal and any other benefits you received. According to the IRS, you can deduct the excess amount as a charitable contribution.\n\nTo calculate the deductible amount, you'll need to determine the fair market value of the meal and any other benefits. You can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the total cost of the ticket ($100).\n2. Estimate the fair market value of the meal (e.g., $50).\n3. Subtract the fair market value of the meal from the total cost of the ticket ($100 - $50 = $50).\n\nIn this example, you may be able to deduct $50 as a charitable contribution. Be sure to keep your ticket stub, receipt, or any other documentation from the event, as you'll need to prove the donation amount and the value of any benefits received.\n\nRemember to consult with a tax professional or the IRS website for specific guidance on charitable deductions and record-keeping requirements."
