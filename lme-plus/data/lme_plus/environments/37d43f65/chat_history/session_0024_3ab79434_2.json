Here are some tips to help you navigate the city:\n\n**Public Transportation:**\n\n1. **Metro**: The metro is an excellent option, with 12 lines that cover much of the city.

They're a cheap and convenient way to get around, but be prepared for crowded conditions.\n\n**Taxis and Ride-hailing:**\n\n1. **Authorized Taxis**: Look for taxis with a license and a meter. You can hail one on the street or find them at designated taxi stands. Always check the meter is working and the driver's ID before you start your journey.\n2. **Ride-hailing Apps**: Uber, Didi, and Cabify are popular options in Mexico City.
