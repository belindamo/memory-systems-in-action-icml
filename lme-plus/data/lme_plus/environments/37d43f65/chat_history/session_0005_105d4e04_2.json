You can do this by clicking on the gear icon in the top-right corner and selecting \"Settings.\"\n* In the Settings page, click on \"Time zone\" and select your city or time zone from the dropdown list.\n\n**Step 3: Create a new event**\n\n* Click on a day and time when you want to schedule your gaming session. You can also use the \"Quick add\" feature by typing in the event details in the top-right corner of the calendar.\n* Enter the event title, such as \"Gaming Session with [Partner's Name].\"\n* Set the start and end time for your gaming session. Make sure to consider the time difference with your gaming partner. You can use a world clock or time zone converter to ensure you're scheduling the event at the correct time.\n\n**Step 4: Set the recurring event**\n\n* Click on the \"Repeat\" dropdown menu and select \"Custom.\"\n* Choose the frequency of your gaming sessions (e.g., every week, every 2 weeks, etc.).\n* Set the duration of the recurring event (e.g., until a specific date or indefinitely).\n* Click \"Save\" to create the recurring event.\n\n**Step 5: Add your gaming partner's time zone**\n\n* Click on the \"Time zone\" dropdown menu and select \"Add a time zone.\"\n* Enter your gaming partner's city or time zone. This will display both your local time and your partner's time in the event details.\n\n**Step 6: Invite your gaming partner (optional)**\n\n* If you want to invite your gaming partner to the event, click on the \"Add guests\" field and enter their email address.\n* Google Calendar will send them an invitation, and they can RSVP to the event.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* To avoid confusion, consider adding a note or description to the event with the correct time in your partner's time zone.\n* If you need to adjust the schedule or cancel a gaming session, you can easily edit or delete the event in Google Calendar.\n* You can also use Google Calendar's \"Find a time\" feature to suggest alternative times for your gaming sessions based on your and your partner's availability.\n\nThat's it!
