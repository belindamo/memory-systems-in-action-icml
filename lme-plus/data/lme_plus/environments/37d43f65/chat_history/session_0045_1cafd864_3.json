      "content": "You're really getting into the Shibuya spirit! Yes, I'm familiar with the Shibuya Sky observation deck. It's a relatively new attraction that opened in 2019, and it's been gaining popularity ever since.\n\nShibuya Sky is an observation deck located on the rooftop of the Shibuya Scramble Square building, which is connected to Shibuya Station. The deck offers breathtaking 360-degree views of Tokyo's skyline, including iconic landmarks like Tokyo Tower, Tokyo Skytree, and Mount Fuji on a clear day.\n\nThe observation deck is designed to provide a unique and immersive experience, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows, outdoor viewing areas, and even a \"Sky Gate\" glass floor that allows you to stand over the city streets below. You can also enjoy the views while sipping on a drink or snack from the on-site caf\u00e9.\n\nTickets for Shibuya Sky can be purchased online in advance, and I recommend doing so, especially during peak seasons or weekends. The observation deck is open from 10:00 AM to 11:00 PM, with last entry at 10:00 PM.\n\nAs a new resident of Shibuya, I think you'll really enjoy the Shibuya Sky experience. It's a great way to get a sense of the city's layout, and it's a fantastic spot to take some amazing photos.\n\nHave you considered visiting Shibuya Sky during the evening or at night? The views of Tokyo's city lights are truly stunning!"
