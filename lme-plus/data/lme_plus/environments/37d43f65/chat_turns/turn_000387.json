  "content": "Yes, Lady Macbeth is shown to be just as power-hungry as Macbeth, if not more so. She is the one who initially convinces Macbeth to kill Duncan, and she even questions his manhood and bravery when he hesitates. Lady Macbeth is willing to do whatever it takes to make sure Macbeth becomes king, manipulating him and even covering up his crimes. She is shown to be cruel and ruthless, even to herself, as she becomes consumed with guilt and ends up taking her own life. Overall, Lady Macbeth's ambition and desire for power are what drives her actions and lead to the tragic events of the play.",
