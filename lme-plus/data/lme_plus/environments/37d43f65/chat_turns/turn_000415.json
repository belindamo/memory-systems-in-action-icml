Set a cleaning schedule: Create a weekly or monthly cleaning schedule that includes tasks such as vacuuming, dusting, and cleaning bathrooms. Stick to your schedule as much as possible to stay on top of regular cleaning tasks.\n\n2. Develop good habits: Establishing good cleaning habits, such as doing dishes right after meals, wiping down counters every night, and putting things away as soon as you're done using them, can help prevent clutter and keep your home clean.\n\n3. Divide chores among family members: Divide up cleaning tasks among family members to make sure everyone pitches in.\n\n4. Clean as you go: Whether you're cooking or doing laundry, try to clean up as you go. This will prevent messes from piling up and make the overall cleaning process more manageable.\n\n5. Store cleaning supplies in easy-to-reach places: Keep cleaning supplies in the areas you use them most so that they're easily accessible when you need them.\n\n6. Make it part of your routine: Incorporate cleaning into your daily or weekly routine, just like you would any other task. \n\nRemember that regular cleaning, while not always fun or glamorous, is essential in maintaining a healthy and welcoming home environment.",
