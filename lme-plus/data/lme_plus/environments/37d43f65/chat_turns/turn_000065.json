Here are some tips for choosing the right piece:\n\n1. **Consider the theme:** Choose a piece that resonates with your personal style, interests, or the room's theme. This will help create a cohesive look and make the artwork feel more meaningful.\n2. **Scale it up or down:** Ensure the artwork is proportional to the desk or console table. A large piece can overwhelm the space, while a small piece might get lost. Aim for a size that's around 1/3 to 2/3 the width of the desk or table.\n3. **Think about the frame:** The frame can greatly impact the overall look of the artwork. Choose a frame that complements the piece, the room's style, and the desk or console table's design. Consider a frame that's simple, ornate, or even a mix of both.\n4. **Color palette:** Select a piece that incorporates colors that complement the room's palette. This will help create a harmonious look and tie the space together.\n5. **Personal connection:** Choose a piece that speaks to you, whether it's a favorite quote, a beautiful landscape, or a unique abstract design. This will make the artwork feel more personal and meaningful.\n6. **Mix and match:** Don't be afraid to combine different pieces or styles to create a unique look. This can add visual interest and create a more dynamic space.\n7. **Consider the lighting:** Think about the lighting in the room and how it will affect the artwork. If the space is dimly lit, choose a piece with bright colors or a high-contrast design to make it stand out.\n8. **Budget-friendly options:** Don't break the bank! Consider prints, reproductions, or emerging artists for more affordable options.\n\nSome popular styles and themes for artwork above a desk or console table include:\n\n1. **Botanicals:** Delicate illustrations of plants, flowers, or trees can add a touch of elegance and serenity to the space.\n2. **Abstracts:** Unique, colorful, or textured abstract pieces can add visual interest and energy to the room.\n3. **Typography:** Inspirational quotes, funny sayings, or playful typography can add personality and whimsy to the space.\n4. **Landscapes:** Beautiful photographs or paintings of landscapes can create a sense of calm and connection to nature.\n5. **Pop art:** Bold, colorful, and playful pop art pieces can add a touch of fun and personality to the room.\n\nSome popular online marketplaces and retailers for artwork and prints include:\n\n1. Society6\n2. Minted\n3. Etsy\n4. Redbubble\n5. AllPosters\n6. Art.com\n7.
