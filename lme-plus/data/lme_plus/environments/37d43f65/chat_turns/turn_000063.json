Adding a small, circular mirror above the desk or console table can be a fantastic way to add visual interest, create the illusion of a larger space, and even enhance the ambiance of the room. Here are some benefits to consider:\n\n1. **Adds visual interest:** A circular mirror can add a touch of elegance and sophistication to the space, creating a beautiful focal point above the desk or console table.\n2. **Creates the illusion of a larger space:** A mirror can make the room feel larger by reflecting light and images, creating the illusion of more space. This is especially effective in smaller rooms or areas with limited natural light.\n3. **Enhances ambiance:** A mirror can help distribute natural light more evenly throughout the room, making the space feel brighter and more welcoming.\n4. **Adds depth:** A circular mirror can create the illusion of depth, making the space feel more dimensional and interesting.\n5. **Reflects positive energy:** In feng shui, mirrors are believed to reflect positive energy and attract abundance. Adding a mirror above the desk or console table can help create a more positive and uplifting atmosphere.\n\nWhen choosing a small, circular mirror for your workspace, consider the following:\n\n1. **Size:** Opt for a mirror that's proportional to the size of your desk or console table. A smaller mirror (around 12-18 inches in diameter) can work well for a compact workspace.\n2. **Frame style:** Choose a frame style that complements the surrounding decor. A simple, minimalist frame can work well in a modern space, while a more ornate frame can add a touch of elegance to a traditional or vintage-inspired room.\n3. **Glass type:** Consider a mirror with a beveled edge or a subtle texture to add visual interest and depth.\n4. **Hang it correctly:** Hang the mirror at a comfortable viewing height, about 57-60 inches from the floor. This will allow you to see yourself and the surrounding area without straining your neck.\n5. **Balance with other decor:** Balance the mirror with other decorative elements in the room, such as artwork, plants, or accessories, to create a visually appealing and harmonious space.\n\nSome popular brands and retailers for small, circular mirrors include:\n\n* West Elm\n* Crate & Barrel\n* CB2\n* AllModern\n* Amazon (for a wide range of options)\n\nRemember to measure your space carefully before making a purchase, and consider the mirror's style and functionality to ensure it fits your needs and decor. Happy shopping!",
