  "content": "To transfer your relational data from Microsoft Azure SQL to a Neo4j graph database and visualize group memberships, you'll need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Export data from Azure SQL:\nYou can use tools like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio to export the required tables (Account, Group, GroupAccount, and GroupMemberGroup) as CSV files. You can run the following queries to save each table as a CSV file:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Account\nSELECT * FROM Group\nSELECT * FROM GroupAccount\nSELECT * FROM GroupMemberGroup\n```\n1. Set up a Neo4j instance:\nCreate a new Neo4j instance using either Neo4j Desktop, Docker, or a cloud-based service like AuraDB. Make sure the instance is running and accessible.\n2. Import the CSV files into Neo4j:\nFirst, move the CSV files into the 'import' folder of your Neo4j instance. Then, execute the following Cypher queries in the Neo4j Browser or any other Cypher execution environment:\n```sql\nLOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///Account.csv' AS row\nCREATE (a:Account {accountID: toInteger(row.accountID), AccountGUID: row.AccountGUID})\n\nLOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///Group.csv' AS row\nCREATE (g:Group {GroupID: toInteger(row.GroupID), GroupGUID: row.GroupGUID})\n\nLOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///GroupAccount.csv' AS row\nMATCH (a:Account {accountID: toInteger\n```",
