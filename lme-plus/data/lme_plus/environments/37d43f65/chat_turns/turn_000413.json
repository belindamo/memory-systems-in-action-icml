  "content": "Sure, here are some tips for getting started on cleaning when you're feeling overwhelmed:\n\n1. Start with a small task: Choose a small task you can complete in 5-10 minutes, such as wiping down the kitchen counters or cleaning out a single drawer. Getting one task out of the way can give you momentum to tackle larger ones.\n\n2. Break down tasks into smaller parts: Instead of looking at your entire to-do list, break down each task into smaller, more manageable parts. For example, instead of \"clean the bathroom,\" break it down to \"clean the mirror,\" \"scrub the toilet,\" \"wipe the sink,\" and so on. Tackling one small task at a time can make the overall project feel less daunting.\n\n3. Use a timer: Set a timer for a specific amount of time (such as 20 minutes) and focus on working on one task during that time. When the timer goes off, take a break and then set the timer again.\n\n4. Focus on one room at a time: Start with the room that bothers you the most and work your way down. When you complete one room, take a break before moving on to the next one.\n\n5. Enlist help: Get family members or roommates to help you. Set up a cleaning schedule or work together to get the chores done faster.\n\nRemember to take breaks often and reward yourself for progress. Small steps can lead to big achievements, and ultimately feeling productive can give you the motivation to continue.",
