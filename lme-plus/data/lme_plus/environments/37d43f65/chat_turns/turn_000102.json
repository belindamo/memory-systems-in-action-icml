  "content": "Yes, here are some statistics on the current state of mental health care access worldwide, especially in developing countries:\n\n1. According to the World Health Organization, around 1 in 4 people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.\n\n2. In developing countries, approximately 75% of people with severe mental disorders receive no treatment.\n\n3. According to the World Health Organization, the average government expenditure on mental health is less than 2% in most low-income countries and less than 6% in middle-income countries.\n\n4. Around 90% of people with mental health disorders in low-income countries receive no treatment, while around 76% in middle- and high-income countries also receive no treatment because of a lack of resources or inadequate accessibility to care.\n\n5. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is just one mental health professional per 100,000 people, compared to 70 professionals per 100,000 people in high-income countries.\n\n6. Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, with more than 300 million people affected, yet only a small percentage receive appropriate treatment.\n\n7. According to the Mental Health Commission in Australia, more than half of Australians with mental health issues do not seek treatment due to fear of stigma, discrimination or concerns about confidentiality.\n\nThese statistics highlight the disparities in mental health care access worldwide, especially in developing countries. It is crucial for governments and policymakers to prioritize mental health care as a fundamental aspect of public health in order to reduce these disparities and ensure adequate care for all.",
