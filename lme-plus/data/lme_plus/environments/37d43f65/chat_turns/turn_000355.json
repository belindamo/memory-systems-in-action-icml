As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or attend cooking classes, but I can tell you that many people find that making a vegan lasagna is a game-changer in terms of understanding vegan cooking.\n\nLasagna is a classic comfort food dish that's often associated with rich, cheesy, and meaty flavors. When people learn to make a vegan version that's just as delicious and satisfying, it can be a real \"aha\" moment. It shows that vegan cooking isn't just about substituting ingredients, but about understanding how to combine flavors and textures to create something new and exciting.\n\nMaking a vegan lasagna requires some creativity and experimentation, but it can also be a great way to develop skills and confidence in the kitchen. By learning to work with plant-based ingredients and finding ways to replicate the creamy, cheesy flavors of traditional lasagna, you can develop a deeper understanding of vegan cooking and feel more empowered to try new recipes and experiment with different flavors.\n\nPlus, the sense of accomplishment you get from creating a delicious vegan lasagna can be incredibly motivating and inspiring. It's a great way to show yourself and others that vegan cooking can be just as tasty and satisfying as traditional cooking.\n\nSo, did you find that making the vegan lasagna in class was a game-changer for you? Did it inspire you to try new recipes and experiment with different flavors?",
