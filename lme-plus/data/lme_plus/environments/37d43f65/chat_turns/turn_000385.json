  "content": "Yes, Macbeth's character is influenced heavily by the witches' prophecies, and his ambition ultimately leads to his downfall. The witches' prophecies plant the seed of ambition in Macbeth's mind, and he becomes more and more consumed with the idea of power and fulfilling the prophecy. Macbeth initially shows reluctance to take action to become king, but his wife, Lady Macbeth, encourages him to go through with the plan.
