Look for roads that appear to be smaller, less traveled, and more rural.\n2. **Avoid highways**: Steer clear of major highways and busy roads, as they're likely to have more traffic and less scenic views.\n3. **Look for county roads**: County roads, often denoted by a \"CR\" or \"Rd\" designation, can be a great option.
