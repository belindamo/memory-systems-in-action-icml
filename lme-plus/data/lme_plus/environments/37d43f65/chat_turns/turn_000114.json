Don't get discouraged if you find it challenging to focus \u2013 simply acknowledge the thought and refocus on your breath.\n7. **Make it a habit**: Incorporate meditation into your daily routine, so it becomes a consistent habit.\n\n**Aim for a Daily Meditation Goal:**\n\nAim to meditate for at least 10-15 minutes a day, but start with a goal that feels achievable for you.
