If you succeed, you'll earn rewards and experience points.\n4. **Rewards:** Defeating the Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon will reward you with items, experience points, and sometimes even rare Pok\u00e9mon.\n5. **Repeatable:** You can revisit Pok\u00e9mon Dens multiple times, and the Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon will respawn, allowing you to battle them again and earn more rewards.\n\n**Tips for Pok\u00e9mon Dens:**\n\n* Make sure your team is at a high enough level to take on the Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon.
