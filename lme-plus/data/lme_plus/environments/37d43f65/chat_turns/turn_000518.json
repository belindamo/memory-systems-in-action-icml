  "content": "Yes, it can be difficult to break away from traditions and cultural values that have been entrenched in society for generations. Still, small changes, whether at an individual level or through entities organized for change, contribute towards achieving a more equitable and merit-based society. It is essential to provide equal opportunities, such as access to education and other valuable resources, irrespective of someone's family background, race, religion or gender, thus lessening the impact that social status and titles hold on an individual's identity. \n\nMoreover, creating public awareness of the importance of individual merit and promoting a culture of inclusivity, diversity, and equality can push societies towards reducing emphasis on titles and traditional structures that perpetuate elitism, misogyny, or discrimination. \n\nSo, although challenging, with collective efforts and a sustained commitment, we can leverage traditions as a means for change, and transform cultures to embrace newer values.",
