  "content": "Sure, here are some tips for making laundry less overwhelming:\n\n1. Create a schedule: Establish a regular laundry schedule (such as doing a load each day) to keep the pile from becoming too overwhelming. \n\n2. Sort as you go: Sorting laundry as you go can save time on laundry day. This way, you can simply throw in the ready-to-go piles and wash them right away.\n\n3. Invest in a hamper or sorting system: Having a hamper with separate compartments for different types of clothes (such as whites and darks) can make it easier to sort laundry as you go. \n\n4. Use time-saving machines: Consider investing in a washer and dryer with time-saving features like a large capacity or quick wash/dry options.\n\n5. Multitask: While your laundry is washing, use the time to do other tasks like cleaning or organizing.\n\n6. Enlist help: Ask family members or roommates to help with the laundry. Make a schedule and divide up the tasks, so everyone knows their responsibilities.\n\n7. Fold and put away immediately: As soon as your laundry cycle is done, make sure to fold and put away your clothes. This will help prevent wrinkles and keep your clothes organized.\n\nRemember, staying on top of laundry can feel challenging at times, but by implementing small changes and making it a part of your routine, it can become a lot more manageable.",
