  "content": "What a wonderful idea! Adding plants to your living room can not only purify the air and improve the aesthetic, but they can also boost mood and productivity. Since you have big windows, you'll want plants that can tolerate bright light and require minimal care. Here are some low-maintenance plants that would thrive in your living room:\n\n1. **Snake Plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata)**: This plant is known for its ability to purify the air and can survive in low-light conditions, but it will do even better with bright indirect light. It's also low-maintenance and can go weeks without watering.\n2. **ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia)**: The ZZ Plant is a low-maintenance plant that can tolerate a range of lighting conditions and infrequent watering. It's also a great air purifier and can survive with neglect (but don't neglect it too much!).\n3. **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**: Spider plants are easy to care for and produce beautiful white flowers. They prefer bright, indirect light and consistent watering. Plus, they're great air purifiers and can be propagated easily by dividing the plantlets that grow on the ends of their stems.\n4. **Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)**: Pothos is a versatile, low-maintenance plant that can thrive in a variety of lighting conditions. It's also a great air purifier and can be trained to climb up walls or trellises.\n5. **Succulents (e.g., Aloe, Echeveria, Crassula)**: Succulents are perfect for busy people because they're extremely low-maintenance. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors and can tolerate bright, indirect light. Just be sure to water them sparingly, as they're prone to overwatering.\n6. **Dracaena (Dracaena spp.)**: Dracaena is a versatile plant that can thrive in a range of lighting conditions. They're also known to purify the air and can grow quite tall, making them a great addition to a living room.\n7. **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii)**: Peace Lilies are known for their elegant white blooms and ability to purify the air. They prefer well-draining soil and moderate watering, but can tolerate some neglect.\n8. **Bromeliads (e.g., Aechmea, Guzmania, Nidularium)**: Bromeliads are a family of plants that include pineapples and air plants. They're low-maintenance, produce beautiful flowers, and can thrive in bright, indirect light.\n\nRemember to choose plants that fit your lifestyle and the specific conditions of your living room. If you're new to plant parenthood, start with one or two plants and observe their needs before adding more.\n\nTips for keeping your plants happy:\n\n* Water them when the soil feels dry to the touch (avoid overwatering!).\n* Fertilize sparingly, as most houseplants don't require a lot of nutrients.\n* Prune or trim plants regularly to maintain their shape and encourage healthy growth.\n* Monitor the temperature and humidity levels in your living room, as some plants may require specific conditions.\n\nHappy planting!",
