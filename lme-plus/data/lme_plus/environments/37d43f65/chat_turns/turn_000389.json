  "content": "Yes, Lady Macbeth's actions were driven by her own desire for power and her obsession with ensuring Macbeth's success. Lady Macbeth's guilt and remorse become more and more evident as the play progresses, particularly after the murder of Duncan. She tries to convince herself and Macbeth that they will get away with their actions; however, as the guilt and pressure of their actions start to take a toll on her, she becomes consumed by her own guilt. Lady Macbeth is eventually driven to madness, which leads to her suicide. So, it is possible that Lady Macbeth regrets her actions, particularly as she becomes aware of their consequences.",
