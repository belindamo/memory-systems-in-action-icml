I've been keeping a journal myself, and it's been really helpful in clarifying my own thoughts and goals. I'm hoping that by writing from Emily's perspective, I'll be able to tap into her emotions and motivations more effectively.\n\nI'm also thinking about including some journal entries from other characters' perspectives, like her best friend or love interest, to add more depth and complexity to the story.\n\nDo you have any tips on how to write effective journal entries or diary excerpts? Should I focus on specific themes or emotions, or just let the character's thoughts flow onto the page?",
