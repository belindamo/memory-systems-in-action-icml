Remember to always use it gently and in the direction of the hair growth to avoid causing any discomfort or skin irritation to Luna.\n\nIn addition to using the Furminator, here are a few more tips to help reduce Luna's shedding:\n\n1. **Brush, brush, brush!**: Regular brushing can help remove loose hair and reduce shedding. Try to brush Luna daily, or at least every other day, using a brush or comb specifically designed for cats.\n2. **Bathe regularly**: Bathing Luna regularly can help remove loose hair and reduce shedding. However, be careful not to over-bathe, as this can strip her coat of its natural oils and lead to dryness.\n3. **Change her diet**: In some cases, shedding can be caused by food allergies or sensitivities. If you haven't already, consider switching Luna to a high-quality, balanced diet that's formulated to reduce shedding.\n4. **Keep her hydrated**: Make sure Luna has access to plenty of fresh water to keep her skin and coat healthy.\n5. **Consider a humidifier**: Dry air can contribute to shedding, so using a humidifier in your home can help keep the air moist and reduce shedding.\n\nBy following these tips and continuing to use the Furminator regularly, you should be able to keep Luna's shedding under control.\n\nHow's Max doing, by the way?
