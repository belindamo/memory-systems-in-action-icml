  "content": "Yes, absolutely! If you don't have a grill, you can still make delicious grilled chicken using a grill pan or a cast-iron skillet. Here's how:\n\nIngredients:\n\n- 4-6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 1/4 cup olive oil\n- 1/4 cup lemon juice\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 teaspoons dried oregano\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and black pepper to make the marinade.\n\n2. Add the chicken breasts to the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the chicken marinate for 20-30 minutes at room temperature.\n\n3. Heat a grill pan or a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.\n\n4. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for 6-7 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken, which should be at least 165\u00b0F.\n\n5. Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, making it juicier and more flavorful.\n\n6. Slice the chicken breasts into pieces and serve with your favorite sides.\n\nEnjoy your homemade grilled chicken even without a grill!",
