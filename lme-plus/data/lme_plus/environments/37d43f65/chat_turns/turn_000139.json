However, I can guide you through the process:\n\n1. Open your calendar app (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Microsoft Outlook) on your phone, tablet, or computer.\n2. Create a new event or reminder for this Sunday at the time you want to dedicate to your writing session.\n3. Enter a title for the event, such as \"Sunday Writing Session\" or \"Journaling Time.\"\n4. Set the reminder to repeat weekly, so it will appear every Sunday at the same time.\n5. Choose a notification method, such as a pop-up alert, email, or notification on your device.\n\n**Writing Prompts and Exercises for Sundays:**\n\nHere are some prompts and exercises to help you get started on Sundays when you're feeling stuck:\n\n1. **Freewriting:** Set a timer for 10-15 minutes and write whatever comes to mind without stopping. This helps loosen up your writing muscles and gets your creative juices flowing.\n2. **Stream-of-Consciousness Journaling:** Similar to freewriting, but focus on journaling about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences from the past week. Write without editing or censoring yourself.\n3. **Sense Memory Exercise:** Describe a memory from your childhood or a recent experience that's linked to one of the senses (e.g., a favorite smell, a vivid dream, or a memorable meal). Try to engage as many senses as possible in your description.\n4. **Word Association Game:** Write down a word, and then brainstorm 10-15 words associated with it. This can help spark new ideas and get your creative wheels turning.\n5. **Weekly Reflection:** Reflect on the past week, and write about:\n\t* What you're grateful for\n\t* What you've accomplished\n\t* What challenges you faced\n\t* What you're looking forward to in the coming week\n6. **Prompt from a Quote:** Choose a quote that resonates with you, and write a reflection or a short story inspired by it.\n7. **Character Development:** Write a character sketch of someone you've met recently or a fictional character you're interested in. Explore their traits, motivations, and backstory.\n\nFeel free to pick one or combine a few of these exercises to get started on your Sunday writing session. Remember, the goal is to make progress, not perfection!\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Do you have any specific writing goals or genres you're working on that I can help with?",
