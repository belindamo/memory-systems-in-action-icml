Since I've been waking up at 6:30 AM every day since the start of the month, I think I can fit in a 10-15 minute meditation session before getting ready for work. I'll try to aim for 10 minutes a day, 5 days a week, and adjust as needed. Do you have any suggestions on how I can track my progress and stay motivated with meditation?",
