  "content": "Yes, the transportation infrastructure projects in Mexico City have also helped with air pollution in the city. The reduction of traffic congestion has led to a decrease in vehicle emissions, which is the main cause of air pollution in the city.\n\nFor example, the Second Level Perif\u00e9rico has reduced the number of cars on the main ring road, thus decreasing the amount of vehicle emissions in the area. Similarly, the expansion of the Metrob\u00fas system has provided an alternative to private cars, which are a major contributor to air pollution. In addition, the implementation of the Ecobici program has resulted in an increase in the use of bicycles for short trips, which has further reduced the number of cars on the road and the associated emissions.\n\nMexico City has also implemented other measures to reduce air pollution, such as the establishment of low-emission zones and stricter emissions standards for vehicles. The combination of these measures has led to a significant improvement in air quality in the city in recent years.",
