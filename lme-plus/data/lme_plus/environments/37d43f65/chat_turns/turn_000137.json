Don't worry about making up for the lost day; just focus on moving forward.\n\nTo help you remember your Sunday writing session, I can suggest a few options:\n\n1. **Digital Reminder**: Set a reminder on your phone or computer for this Sunday at a specific time that works for you. You can use a calendar app, alarm clock, or even a reminder app like Any.do or Todoist.\n2. **Physical Reminder**: Place a note or a sticky note in a visible spot where you'll see it, such as on your fridge, desk, or mirror. Write \"Sunday Writing Session\" or a similar reminder to catch your attention.\n3. **Accountability Partner**: Share your writing goals with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. You can even schedule a check-in with them on Sunday to ensure you've completed your writing session.\n4. **Routine Habit**: Try to associate your Sunday writing session with a regular routine or habit, such as right after breakfast, before a walk, or during your favorite coffee time. This can help make the activity feel more automatic.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and you'll be back on track with your writing routine in no time!",
