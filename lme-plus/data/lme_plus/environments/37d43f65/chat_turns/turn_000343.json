Line 1 of the Cableb\u00fas system: This cable car system will provide an alternative method of transportation between different parts of the city, with four stations starting from Santa Catarina to Cuautepec.\n\n2. Expansions to Line 5 and Line 9 of the Metro subway system: These expansions will increase the number of stations and overall length of the lines, improving connectivity in the southern and eastern parts of the city.\n\n3. Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de M\u00e9xico (NAIM): This new airport, currently under construction in a neighboring municipality of Mexico City, will serve as the primary airport replacing the current airport. It will have a capacity of 120 million passengers a year and be connected to the city center by several transportation modes, including the Metro and a high-speed train.\n\n4. The extension of the Tren Suburbano to Chalco: When completed, this extension will provide a more direct transportation route from southern areas of Mexico City to the northern suburbs.\n\nThese projects are expected to improve transportation connectivity, reduce travel times and traffic congestion, and reduce air pollution over time.",
