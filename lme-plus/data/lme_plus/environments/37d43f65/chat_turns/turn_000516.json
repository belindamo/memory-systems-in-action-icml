  "content": "Yes, societal attitudes and values can evolve over time, and it is possible for a society to shift away from placing so much importance on titles and social status. This shift can be enforced by conscious efforts from the individuals, activists, local leaders, and government.\n\nIn the modern era, there is a growing emphasis on individual merit, equality, and diversity, and many people are speaking out against elitism and social barriers in various forms. As societal transformations towards merit-based systems persist, we see structures created like reducing nepotism and institutionalizing merit-based opportunities, financially or through opportunities in career growth. Education systems are also emphasizing more holistic development and development of soft skills that many believe are better indicators of success than academic qualifications alone.\n\nHowever, while individual efforts can lead to a positive shift, such as on social media movements towards gender and racial equality, social status, and titles are still significantly tied to the financial backing, and sometimes the cultural heritage of an individual. Thus, there is still much to be done to enable societies to shift toward equality and a merit-based system that is more inclusive for everyone.",
