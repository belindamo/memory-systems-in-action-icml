  "content": "You've been preparing diligently, and that's excellent! Reviewing your application and gathering all the necessary documents is crucial to ensure a smooth interview process.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've had your application pending for 6 months, and you're hoping the interview will be the final step. In many cases, the interview is the last step before the green card is approved.\n\nJust to reiterate, make sure you have all the necessary documents, including:\n\n1. **Passport**: Your valid passport, with at least six months' validity.\n2. **Birth certificate**: Your original birth certificate, with a certified English translation if it's not in English.\n3. **Marriage certificate**: Your original marriage certificate, with a certified English translation if it's not in English.\n4. **Other supporting documents**: Any other documents you've submitted with your application, such as proof of income, employment, or education.\n\nDouble-check that you have all the required documents and that they're in order. It's better to be over-prepared than to risk delays or issues during the interview.\n\nAdditionally, take some time to review your application and familiarize yourself with the information you provided. This will help you feel more confident and prepared to answer any questions the officer may ask.\n\nRemember, the officer's goal is to verify the information in your application and assess your eligibility for a green card. Be honest, answer questions truthfully, and provide supporting documentation as needed.\n\nStay calm, be confident, and you'll get through this interview successfully!",
