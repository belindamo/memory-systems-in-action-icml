  "content": "Sure, there are many side dishes that would pair well with grilled chicken! Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Grilled vegetables: You can grill some bell peppers, zucchini, and eggplant to serve alongside the grilled chicken. Season them with some salt, pepper, and olive oil for a simple and tasty side dish. 2. Fresh salad: A refreshing salad can balance out the richness of the grilled chicken. You can make a classic Caesar salad or a Greek salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, feta cheese, and olives. 3. Corn on the cob: Grilled corn on the cob is a classic summer side dish that goes well with grilled chicken. You can slather some butter on the corn and sprinkle it with some salt and paprika. 4. Baked sweet potato: You can bake some sweet potatoes in the oven and serve them with the grilled chicken. Top them with some butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar for a sweet and savory side dish. 5. Quinoa salad: Quinoa is a nutritious grain that can make a delicious salad. You can mix cooked quinoa with some chopped veggies (cucumbers, tomatoes, bell peppers) and a lemony vinaigrette for a healthy and tasty side dish. I hope this gives you some inspiration for your summer barbecue!",
