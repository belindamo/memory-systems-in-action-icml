  "content": "Here is a simple case study that you could provide to the group to practice on:\n\nCase Study: A small business, XYZ Inc, is facing a decline in sales. The owner, Jane, is unsure of the cause and is seeking feedback on how to improve the situation.\n\nExercise: Divide the group into small teams, and have each team act as consultants for Jane and XYZ Inc. Ask them to review the case study, gather information and come up with specific and actionable feedback on how Jane and the company could improve their sales. Encourage the teams to consider factors such as market trends, competition, marketing strategies, customer service and product/service offering.\n\nAfter the exercise, have the teams present their feedback to the group, and discuss the different approaches they took and what they learned from the exercise.\n\nThis case study is a common issue that many businesses face and it allows the group to practice giving feedback in a realistic and practical way. It also allows them to apply their knowledge, skills, and creativity to come up with solutions for the problem. Additionally, it allows the group to have a deeper understanding of the business case and how to approach it.\n\nYou can also adapt the case study to fit the group's need, for example, a company that is struggling to attract new customers, a company that is facing high staff turnover, or a company that is facing a decline in productivity.",
