Since I'll be riding on rural roads, I'll also keep an eye out for wildlife and farm animals. Speaking of which, I remember participating in a charity cycling event, Pedals for a Purpose, where our team raised over $2,000 for a local children's hospital, and we had to navigate through some rural roads with horse farms. It was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to this ride as well.",
