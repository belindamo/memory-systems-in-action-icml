Here's a step-by-step guide to make perfectly grilled chicken:\n\nIngredients:\n\n- 4-6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 1/4 cup olive oil\n- 1/4 cup lemon juice\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 teaspoons dried oregano\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400-450\u00b0F).\n\n2. In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and black pepper to make the marinade.\n\n3. Add the chicken breasts to the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the chicken marinate for 20-30 minutes at room temperature.\n\n4. Once the grill is preheated, carefully oil the grates to prevent the chicken from sticking.\n\n5. Place the chicken on the grill, starting with the smooth side down. Cook for 6-7 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken, which should be at least 165\u00b0F.\n\n6. Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, making it juicier and more flavorful.\n\n7. Slice the chicken breasts into pieces and serve with your favorite sides, such as grilled vegetables or a fresh salad.\n\nEnjoy your perfectly grilled chicken at your summer barbecue!",
