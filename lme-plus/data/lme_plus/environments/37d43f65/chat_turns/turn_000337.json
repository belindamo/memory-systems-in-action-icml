  "content": "Several infrastructure projects have been completed in Mexico City to reduce traffic congestion, including:\n\n1. The construction of the Second Level Perif\u00e9rico (Perif\u00e9rico Segundo Piso), a 20-kilometer highway built on top of the existing Perif\u00e9rico ring road. This highway provides an alternative route for vehicles and reduces the travel time between destinations.\n\n2. The expansion of Line 12 of the Metro subway system, which is now the largest and most modern line in the city. The line covers more than 24 kilometers and has 20 stations.\n\n3. The construction of the Elevated Viaduct \u201cTransbordo\u201d (Viaducto Elevado Transbordo) that runs above Avenida 602 in the borough of Iztapalapa, connecting two Metro Light stations and facilitating the flow of passengers.\n\n4. The expansion of the Metrob\u00fas bus rapid transit system, which now has more than 160 kilometers of dedicated bus lanes in the city. This system has reduced travel times for commuters and improved air quality.\n\n5. The implementation of the Ecobici bike-sharing program, which has increased the use of bicycles for short trips and reduced the number of motor vehicles on the road.\n\n6. The construction of the Tren Suburbano commuter train line, which connects the northern suburbs of the city to the downtown area. This line has reduced the travel time for commuters and improved accessibility to the city center.",
