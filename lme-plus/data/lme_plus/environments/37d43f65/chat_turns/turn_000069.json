  "content": "With your application being 6 months old, it's likely that the interview will be the final step in the process.\n\nRegarding your question, it's possible that the officer may ask about your current job and how it relates to your field of study, but it's not a guaranteed topic. The officer's primary focus will be on verifying the information in your application and assessing your eligibility for a green card.\n\nHowever, if you're applying for a green card through a family-based or employment-based category, the officer might ask about your job to ensure that:\n\n1. You're not working in the United States without authorization.\n2. You're not engaging in unauthorized employment.\n3. Your job is related to your field of study (if applicable).\n\nIf you're asked about your job, be prepared to discuss:\n\n* Your current job title, duties, and employer.\n* How your job relates to your field of study (if applicable).\n* Your salary and how it compares to the prevailing wage for your occupation.\n* Your job's relevance to your green card category (e.g., if you're applying through an employment-based category).\n\nTo prepare, review your application and be familiar with the information you provided about your education, work experience, and job history. If you've changed jobs or had any significant changes in your employment since submitting your application, be prepared to explain the changes and provide supporting documentation.\n\nSome potential questions the officer might ask include:\n\n* Can you tell me about your current job and how it relates to your field of study?\n* How does your current job align with the job you listed on your application?\n* Have you changed jobs or had any significant changes in your employment since submitting your application?\n* Can you provide proof of your current employment, such as a letter from your employer or recent pay stubs?\n\nRemember to answer these questions confidently and truthfully, and provide supporting documentation if requested.",
