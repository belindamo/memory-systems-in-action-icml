  "content": "That's a common sentiment among viewers. Streaming services offer an ad-free viewing experience, which is a significant advantage over traditional TV networks. Cable TV often forces viewers to watch commercials, which can be repetitive and time-consuming. Streaming services, on the other hand, offer uninterrupted viewing, making it easier to binge-watch a series or enjoy a movie without constant interruptions.
