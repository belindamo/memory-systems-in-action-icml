I'd be happy to guide you through setting up recurring events for your gaming sessions, taking into account the time difference with your gaming partner.\n\n**Step 1: Create a new calendar**\n\n* Open Google Calendar on your computer or mobile device.\n* Click on the \"+\" icon in the top-right corner to create a new calendar.\n* Name your calendar something like \"Gaming Sessions\" or \"Online Gaming\" to keep your gaming events separate from your personal or work calendar.\n\n**Step 2: Set up your time zone**\n\n* Make sure your Google Calendar is set to your local time zone. You can do this by clicking on the gear icon in the top-right corner and selecting \"Settings.\"\n* In the Settings page, click on \"Time zone\" and select your city or time zone from the dropdown list.\n\n**Step 3: Create a new event**\n\n* Click on a day and time when you want to schedule your gaming session. You can also use the \"Quick add\" feature by typing in the event details in the top-right corner of the calendar.\n* Enter the event title, such as \"Gaming Session with [Partner's Name].\"\n* Set the start and end time for your gaming session. Make sure to consider the time difference with your gaming partner. You can use a world clock or time zone converter to ensure you're scheduling the event at the correct time.\n\n**Step 4: Set the recurring event**\n\n* Click on the \"Repeat\" dropdown menu and select \"Custom.\"\n* Choose the frequency of your gaming sessions (e.g., every week, every 2 weeks, etc.).\n* Set the duration of the recurring event (e.g., until a specific date or indefinitely).\n* Click \"Save\" to create the recurring event.\n\n**Step 5: Add your gaming partner's time zone**\n\n* Click on the \"Time zone\" dropdown menu and select \"Add a time zone.\"\n* Enter your gaming partner's city or time zone. This will display both your local time and your partner's time in the event details.\n\n**Step 6: Invite your gaming partner (optional)**\n\n* If you want to invite your gaming partner to the event, click on the \"Add guests\" field and enter their email address.\n* Google Calendar will send them an invitation, and they can RSVP to the event.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* To avoid confusion, consider adding a note or description to the event with the correct time in your partner's time zone.\n* If you need to adjust the schedule or cancel a gaming session, you can easily edit or delete the event in Google Calendar.\n* You can also use Google Calendar's \"Find a time\" feature to suggest alternative times for your gaming sessions based on your and your partner's availability.\n\nThat's it! With these steps, you've set up recurring events for your gaming sessions, taking into account the time difference with your gaming partner. Happy gaming!",
