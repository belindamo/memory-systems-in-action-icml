  "content": "I'm thinking of planning a trip to New York City to catch some Broadway shows. I've been really into theater lately, and I just watched the entire Harry Potter series on HBO Max about a month ago, which got me in the mood for more storytelling. Now, I'm particularly interested in the new revival of West Side Story and the musical adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird. Can you help me find information on ticket prices and show schedules?",
