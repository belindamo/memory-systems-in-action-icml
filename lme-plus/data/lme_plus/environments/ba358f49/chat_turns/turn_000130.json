Conduct a comprehensive literature review of AI applications in healthcare (week 1-2)\n\t* Identify relevant research papers, articles, and books\n\t* Take notes and organize findings using a tool like Zotero, Mendeley, or Excel\n2. Analyze and synthesize the literature (week 3-4)\n\t* Identify patterns, trends, and gaps in current research\n\t* Develop a conceptual framework or research question for your thesis\n\n**Research Design and Methodology (Weeks 5-6)**\n\n1. Develop a research design and methodology (week 5)\n\t* Determine the type of study (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods)\n\t* Identify data sources, collection methods, and sampling strategies\n2. Create a detailed research protocol (week 6)\n\t* Outline data analysis procedures and statistical methods\n\t* Develop a plan for data visualization and presentation\n\n**Data Collection and Analysis (Weeks 7-10)**\n\n1. Collect and clean data (week 7-8)\n\t* Gather data from identified sources (e.g., surveys, interviews, datasets)\n\t* Clean and preprocess data for analysis\n2.
