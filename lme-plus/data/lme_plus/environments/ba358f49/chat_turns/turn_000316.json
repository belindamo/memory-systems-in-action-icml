There are several good airlines and routes to consider. Here are a few options:\n\n**Airlines:**\n\n1. **Air France**: As the national carrier of France, Air France offers multiple daily flights from New York (JFK or EWR) to Paris (CDG). They're a great option if you want a direct flight and a taste of French hospitality.\n2. **Delta Air Lines**: Delta operates multiple daily flights from New York (JFK or LGA) to Paris (CDG). They're a popular choice for transatlantic flights, and their SkyTeam alliance can offer convenient connections.\n3. **American Airlines**: American operates multiple daily flights from New York (JFK) to Paris (CDG). They're another major carrier with a strong presence in Europe.\n4. **Norwegian Air**: If you're on a budget, Norwegian Air offers affordable fares from New York (JFK) to Paris (ORY). Keep in mind that they're a low-cost carrier, so amenities might be limited.\n5. **OpenSkies**: OpenSkies is a subsidiary of British Airways, offering flights from New York (JFK) to Paris (ORY). They offer a more premium experience at a lower cost than traditional carriers.\n\n**Routes:**\n\n1. **New York (JFK) to Paris (CDG)**: This is the most popular route, with multiple daily flights from various airlines. CDG is a larger airport, but it's well-connected to the city center.\n2. **New York (LGA) to Paris (CDG)**: If you prefer to fly out of LaGuardia, you can still find flights to CDG with Delta or American Airlines.\n3. **New York (EWR) to Paris (CDG)**: If you're coming from New Jersey or prefer to avoid the NYC airports, you can fly from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) with Air France or United.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Book in advance**: Prices tend to increase closer to the departure date, so book your flight as soon as possible to secure the best rates.\n2. **Be flexible**: Consider flying on off-peak days (e.g., Tuesdays, Wednesdays) or during the off-season (usually November to March) for better deals.\n3. **Check for error fares**: Keep an eye on flight deal websites or follow airline accounts on social media to catch error fares, which can be significantly cheaper.\n4. **Look for package deals**: Sometimes, booking a flight and hotel together as a package can be cheaper than booking flights separately.\n\nNow that you have your new passport, make sure to double-check the entry requirements for France and any travel restrictions before booking your flight.\n\nWhich airline and route are you leaning towards? Do you have any specific preferences or budget constraints I can help with?",
