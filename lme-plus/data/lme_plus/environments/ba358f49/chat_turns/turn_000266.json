  "content": "Demos can be a great way to try before you buy, and I'm happy to help you with that.\n\n**Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart:**\nThere is no public demo available for Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. However, if you have a PlayStation Plus subscription, you can try out the game's demo through the PlayStation Plus Free Trial program. This will give you a limited-time access to the game, allowing you to try it out before deciding to purchase.\n\n**Returnal:**\nUnfortunately, there is no demo available for Returnal. The game's developer, Housemarque, has mentioned that they didn't create a demo due to the game's complex narrative and gameplay mechanics. However, you can check out gameplay videos and reviews to get a better understanding of the game's mechanics and tone.\n\n**Deathloop:**\nThere is no demo available for Deathloop, but you can try out the game's \"Deathloop: The Arkham Killer\" interactive trailer, which gives you a sense of the game's tone, art style, and gameplay mechanics. Additionally, you can watch gameplay videos and developer diaries to learn more about the game.\n\n**Other Demos:**\nIf you're interested in trying out other games, you can check the PlayStation Store for demos of popular titles like:\n\n* Cyberpunk 2077\n* Ghost of Tsushima\n* Resident Evil Village\n* Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\n* Assassin's Creed Valhalla\n\nKeep in mind that demo availability can change over time, so it's always a good idea to check the PlayStation Store or the game's official website for the latest information.\n\nI hope that helps, and happy gaming!",
