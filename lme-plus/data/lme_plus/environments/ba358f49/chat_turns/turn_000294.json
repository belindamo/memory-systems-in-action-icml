However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location. But I can suggest a few ways to find a reputable and reliable mechanic or service center in your area:\n\n1. **Online Review Sites**: Check websites like Yelp, Google Reviews, or Facebook Reviews to find highly-rated mechanics or service centers in your area. Pay attention to the overall rating, number of reviews, and feedback from previous customers.\n2. **Dealer Service Center**: If you purchased your Honda Civic from a dealership, you can consider taking it back to their service center for the oil change. They'll have the necessary expertise and knowledge about your specific vehicle.\n3. **AAA-Approved Auto Repair**: If you're a AAA member, you can search for AAA-approved auto repair shops in your area. These shops have met AAA's standards for quality and reliability.\n4. **Word of Mouth**: Ask friends, family, or coworkers for recommendations. They can provide valuable insights and referrals to trusted mechanics or service centers.\n5. **Certifications**: Look for mechanics or service centers with certifications like ASE (Automotive Service Excellence) or NAPA AutoCare. These certifications indicate a certain level of expertise and training.\n\nOnce you find a potential mechanic or service center, make sure to:\n\n* Check their website or call them to confirm their hours, prices, and services offered.\n* Ask about their experience with Honda vehicles and oil changes.\n* Inquire about any warranties or guarantees they offer.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your vehicle's maintenance and choose a reputable mechanic or service center to ensure your Honda Civic receives the best care.",
