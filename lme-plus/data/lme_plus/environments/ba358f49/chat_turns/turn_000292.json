  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I have to clarify that it's not possible for your Honda Civic to have had its last oil change at 0 miles, since it would have been brand new and never driven.\n\nAssuming you meant to say that the last oil change was at a certain mileage, the recommended oil change interval for your Honda Civic depends on various factors, including the model year, engine type, and driving conditions.\n\nAccording to the Honda maintenance schedule, the typical recommended oil change interval for most Honda Civic models is:\n\n* Every 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km) for conventional oil\n* Every 10,000 to 15,000 miles (16,000 to 24,000 km) for synthetic oil\n\nHowever, it's best to consult your owner's manual or speak with a trusted mechanic or Honda dealership to determine the specific recommended oil change interval for your vehicle, as it may vary.\n\nRemember to also check your owner's manual for any specific recommendations for your vehicle's maintenance schedule, including oil changes, tire rotations, and other services.",
