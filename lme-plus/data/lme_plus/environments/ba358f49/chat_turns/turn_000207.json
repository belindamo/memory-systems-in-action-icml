  "content": "I'm so excited about the tour! Since I just watched the entire Harry Potter series on HBO Max about a month ago, I'm really in the mood for an immersive experience like this. I'm looking forward to learning more about the history of Broadway and getting a behind-the-scenes look at the theaters. Can I ask, are there any specific theaters that the tour typically visits, or does it vary depending on the day and time of the tour?",
