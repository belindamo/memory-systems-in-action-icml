  "content": "I'd be happy to help you organize your streaming services and create a list of the shows you're currently watching.\n\nTo get started, can you please provide me with the following information:\n\n1. Which streaming services do you currently subscribe to (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Apple TV+, etc.)?\n2. For each service, can you list the shows you're currently watching or have recently watched (even if you're not caught up)?\n3. Are there any shows you've paused or put on hold, but plan to continue watching in the future?\n\nYou can share this information with me in any format you prefer, such as:\n\n* A simple list with the service name followed by the show titles (e.g. \"Netflix: Stranger Things, The Crown, Narcos\")\n* A table with columns for the service, show title, and current season/episode (if applicable)\n* A paragraph or two describing your current watchlist\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you organize your shows into a neat and tidy list, and even provide some suggestions for managing your watchlist across different platforms!",
