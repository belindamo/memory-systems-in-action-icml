I'm planning to hit up some of the main tourist spots like the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and Times Square. I'm also thinking of checking out some of the museums, like the Met or MoMA. And of course, I want to try some of the amazing food NYC has to offer! Do you have any recommendations for must-try restaurants or cafes?",
