Here are a few options:\n\n**Morning Flights from New York (JFK) to Paris (CDG) with Air France:**\n\n1. **AF011**: Departs JFK at 8:30 AM (EST) and arrives at CDG at 10:35 AM (CET)\n2. **AF017**: Departs JFK at 9:30 AM (EST) and arrives at CDG at 11:35 AM (CET)\n3. **AF021**: Departs JFK at 10:30 AM (EST) and arrives at CDG at 12:35 PM (CET)\n\nPlease note that flight schedules are subject to change, and it's always best to check with Air France's website or a travel agent for the most up-to-date information.\n\nWhen booking your morning flight, keep in mind:\n\n* You'll need to arrive at JFK airport at least 2 hours prior to your scheduled departure time to allow for check-in, baggage drop-off, and security screening.\n* Paris is 6 hours ahead of New York, so you'll lose 6 hours when you travel. Plan your arrival accordingly, and consider booking a hotel or accommodation with an early check-in option.\n* If you're not a morning person, consider the jet lag and plan your activities accordingly. You might want to take a power nap or relax at your hotel before exploring the city.\n\nAre you ready to book your morning flight and start your Parisian adventure?",
