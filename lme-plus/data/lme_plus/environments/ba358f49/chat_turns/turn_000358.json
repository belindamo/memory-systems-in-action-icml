  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! You can definitely use oat milk as a substitute in the chocolate chip cookie recipe I provided, but you wouldn't be substituting it for oat milk, since oat milk is already the milk of choice in that recipe.\n\nHowever, if you're asking if you can use oat milk as a substitute for other non-dairy milks in general, the answer is yes! Oat milk can be a great substitute in many recipes, especially those that require a creamy texture.\n\nKeep in mind that oat milk has a slightly thicker and creamier consistency than some other non-dairy milks, so you might need to adjust the ratio of liquid ingredients or the cooking time in some recipes. But in the case of the chocolate chip cookie recipe I provided, oat milk works beautifully as is.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need help with substituting oat milk in a specific recipe, feel free to ask!",
