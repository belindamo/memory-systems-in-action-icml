I've had a similar experience when I helped my friend launch her social media campaign for her sustainable fashion brand. We made sure to create content that was authentic and aligned with her brand values, and it really paid off. The campaign was a huge success, and her followers increased by over 50% in just one week. I think it's essential to find influencers who genuinely care about the products or services they're promoting.",
