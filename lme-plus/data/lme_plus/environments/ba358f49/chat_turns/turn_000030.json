  "content": "Dr. Jonathan Overpeck has made significant contributions to our understanding of climate change impacts, particularly on sea-level rise. Here are some research papers and projects he's led on this topic:\n\n**Research Papers:**\n\n1. **\"Implications of recent sea-level rise science for coastal protection\"** (2019): In this paper, Dr. Overpeck and colleagues discussed the implications of recent sea-level rise research for coastal protection and adaptation planning. They highlighted the need for more accurate sea-level rise projections and more effective adaptation strategies.\n2. **\"Sea level rise and implications for coastal erosion\"** (2017): This paper, co-authored with Dr. Overpeck, examined the impacts of sea-level rise on coastal erosion and the resulting losses to ecosystems and human communities.\n3. **\" Attribution of anthropogenic influence on sea level rise from 1993 to 2012\"** (2015): Dr. Overpeck and colleagues used statistical analysis to attribute the observed sea-level rise from 1993 to 2012 to anthropogenic influence, particularly greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Research Projects:**\n\n1. **Sea Level Rise Technical Report** (2017): Dr. Overpeck was the lead author of this report, which provided a comprehensive assessment of sea-level rise science and its implications for the United States. The report was commissioned by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n2. **The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Impacts (SLRCI) Project** (2014-2017): Dr. Overpeck led this project, which aimed to improve sea-level rise projections and develop more effective adaptation strategies for coastal communities. The project involved collaboration with researchers from multiple institutions and stakeholders from various sectors.\n3. **The Climate and Sea-Level Rise (C&SLR) Initiative** (2010-2014): Dr. Overpeck was a co-lead on this initiative, which focused on understanding the impacts of climate change on sea-level rise and developing strategies for coastal adaptation and resilience.\n\n**Other Relevant Work:**\n\nDr. Overpeck has also contributed to several other projects and initiatives related to sea-level rise, including:\n\n* The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2013), where he was a Coordinating Lead Author for the chapter on Sea Level Rise.\n* The National Climate Assessment (NCA) Technical Report on Sea Level Rise (2014), where he was a lead author.\n* The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Change Project, where he served as an advisor.\n\nDr. Overpeck's work on sea-level rise has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of this critical aspect of climate change and informing policy and decision-making at the local, national, and international levels.",
