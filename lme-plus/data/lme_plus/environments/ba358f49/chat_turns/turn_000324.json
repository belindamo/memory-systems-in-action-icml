However, it's always a good idea to bring:\n\n1. **Government-issued ID:** A government-issued ID, such as a driver's license or state ID, can be useful in case you need to prove your identity.\n2. **Travel itinerary:** Bring a printed or digital copy of your flight itinerary, which includes your flight number, departure and arrival airports, and travel dates.\n3. **Travel insurance documents:** If you have travel insurance, bring the documents or policy number, in case you need to make a claim.\n\n**Important:** Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your return date. If your passport is due to expire soon, you might need to renew it before your trip.\n\n**Name Change:** Since you've recently updated your name, ensure that your passport, boarding pass, and any other travel documents reflect your new name. If there are any discrepancies, contact Air France or the relevant authorities to resolve the issue.\n\nNow that you've got all your documents in order, you're ready to embark on your Parisian adventure!",
