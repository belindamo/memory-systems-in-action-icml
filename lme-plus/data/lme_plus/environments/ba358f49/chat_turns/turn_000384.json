Considering your friends are also interested in the topic, I think any of the documentaries I mentioned earlier would be suitable for a group watch. However, I'd recommend the following three documentaries that are particularly engaging and thought-provoking:\n\n1. **Before the Flood (2016)**: This documentary is a great choice because it's well-produced, easy to follow, and features Al Gore, who is a well-known and respected figure in the climate change discussion. The film's message is clear, and it's an excellent introduction to the topic for those who might not be as familiar with the subject.\n2. **Chasing Coral (2017)**: This documentary is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful film that explores the decline of coral reefs. It's a great choice for a group watch because it's a story-driven documentary that's easy to follow, and the imagery is breathtaking. The film's message about the importance of protecting our oceans will likely resonate with your friends.\n3. **Ice on Fire (2019)**: This documentary is a great choice because it's a more recent release, and it explores the latest climate change research and solutions. The film features a mix of stunning visuals, interviews with experts, and innovative solutions to the climate crisis. It's an excellent choice for a group watch because it's engaging, informative, and will likely spark interesting discussions.\n\nTips for a successful group watch:\n\n* Choose a documentary that's around 1-2 hours long to keep everyone engaged.\n* Set the mood with some refreshments and a comfortable seating arrangement.\n* Encourage everyone to come with an open mind and be respectful of differing opinions.\n* Pause the documentary at key points to discuss what you've learned and share your thoughts.\n* After the documentary, have a more in-depth discussion about the topic, and consider setting up a follow-up meeting to discuss potential actions you can take together to make a positive impact on the environment.\n\nEnjoy your group watch, and I hope these recommendations help inspire interesting discussions and a deeper understanding of the climate crisis!",
