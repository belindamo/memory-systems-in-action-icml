  "content": "\"Altered Carbon\" and \"Westworld\" are both thought-provoking shows that explore complex themes, and they do share some similarities with \"The Expanse\" in terms of their depth and moral ambiguity.\n\n**\"Altered Carbon\"**:\n\n* Like \"The Expanse\", \"Altered Carbon\" is set in a richly detailed, futuristic world with a complex societal structure. It explores the implications of human consciousness being able to transfer into new bodies, raising questions about identity, power, and corruption.\n* The show features a complex, gritty narrative with a strong focus on characters and their motivations. The main character, Takeshi Kovacs, is a gritty, noir-inspired protagonist with a troubled past.\n* While it doesn't focus on space travel or colonization, \"Altered Carbon\" does explore the implications of advanced technology on human society, which might appeal to fans of \"The Expanse\"'s realistic portrayal of space travel.\n* The show also features a similar blend of action, mystery, and political intrigue, with a strong focus on character development and moral complexity.\n\n**\"Westworld\"**:\n\n* \"Westworld\" is set in a futuristic theme park where guests can interact with lifelike robots, raising questions about the ethics of artificial intelligence, consciousness, and free will.\n* Like \"The Expanse\", \"Westworld\" features a complex, layered narrative with multiple timelines and plot threads. It explores the consequences of playing God with advanced technology and the blurred lines between human and machine.\n* The show features a diverse cast of complex, morally ambiguous characters, including the hosts (robots) and the guests who interact with them. The characters' motivations and backstories are slowly revealed over time, adding depth to the narrative.\n* While \"Westworld\" doesn't focus on space travel or colonization, it does explore the implications of advanced technology on human society, and the consequences of unchecked power and ambition.\n\nBoth shows share some of the same DNA with \"The Expanse\" in terms of their complexity, moral ambiguity, and focus on character development. If you enjoyed the gritty realism and political intrigue of \"The Expanse\", you might find that \"Altered Carbon\" or \"Westworld\" scratches that same itch.\n\nWhich one of these two shows resonates more with you, or would you like to explore both?",
