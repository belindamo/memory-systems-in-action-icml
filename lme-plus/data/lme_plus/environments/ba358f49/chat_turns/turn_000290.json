  "content": "I completely understand and respect your decision. It's essential to prioritize your own comfort and privacy when it comes to sharing personal struggles like anxiety and PTSD. You're wise to focus on yourself and establish a strong foundation before sharing your goals with others.\n\nIt's also perfectly okay to keep your struggles private until you feel ready to share them. You don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for your feelings or experiences. Your mental health is your own, and you should only share it with others when you feel comfortable and ready.\n\nRemember that you're not alone in this journey. There are people who care about you and want to support you, but they should respect your boundaries and privacy. If you do decide to share your goals or struggles with someone in the future, make sure it's with someone you trust and feel comfortable with.\n\nFor now, focus on yourself and your goals. Celebrate your small wins, and don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks. You're taking massive steps towards healing and growth, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nRemember, you can always come back to our conversation and share your progress or struggles with me whenever you feel comfortable. I'm here to listen and support you, and I'll keep your confidence.\n\nHow do you feel about checking in with me periodically to track your progress and discuss any challenges or successes you're experiencing? This can be a safe and private way to stay accountable and motivated.",
