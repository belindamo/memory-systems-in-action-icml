  "content": "How would I make a basic website for personal viewing where I store links in database format, similar to a Notion webpage that has gallery view set? I would like the option to have a gallery, table, and list view of the links. There should be multiple properties in order to organize and categorize, preferably with color-coded tags. This webpage would be like a blend of a Raindrop.io page and a Notion gallery-view database. I need the HTML and CSS and possible JSON or JavaScript to setup this site.",
