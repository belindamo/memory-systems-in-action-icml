  "content": "I'm sorry, there are no bungee jumping or skydiving experiences in St Albans due to the proximity to the airport and the nature of the surrounding landscape. However, there are some nearby locations where you could try these extreme sports. Here are a few options:\n\n1. UK Bungee Club: About an hour's drive from St Albans, UK Bungee offers bungee jumping experiences at the O2 Arena in London, as well as other locations around the UK. \n\n2. Skydiving at Hinton-on-the-Hedges: Located just over an hour's drive from St Albans, Hinton Skydiving Centre offers a range of skydiving experiences for beginners and experienced jumpers.\n\n3. Indoor skydiving: If you're looking for a skydiving-like experience without the extreme heights, iFLY Indoor Skydiving in Milton Keynes offers the feel of freefalling in a controlled, indoor setting.\n\nPlease note that these are extreme sports and require proper safety gear and training from experienced professionals. You should also check with the providers for any age, weight or health restrictions before signing up for these activities.",
