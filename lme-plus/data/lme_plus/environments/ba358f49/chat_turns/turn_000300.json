Asking about their experience with Honda vehicles and oil changes can give you peace of mind and ensure that your car is in good hands.\n\nBy asking about their experience, you can get a sense of their familiarity with your car's make and model, as well as their expertise in performing oil changes on Honda vehicles. This can help you gauge their confidence and competence in working on your car.\n\nSome questions you could ask include:\n\n* \"Do you have experience working on Honda vehicles, specifically the Civic model?\"\n* \"How many oil changes have you performed on Honda Civics in the past year?\"\n* \"What type of training or certifications do your technicians have for working on Honda vehicles?\"\n* \"Do you use Honda-recommended parts and fluids for oil changes?\"\n\nBy asking these questions, you can get a better understanding of their experience and expertise, and make a more informed decision about whether to trust them with your car's maintenance.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and asking questions upfront can help prevent any potential issues or problems down the road.",
