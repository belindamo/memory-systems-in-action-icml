  "content": "I haven't seen any of those shows before, but I'm intrigued by \"Altered Carbon\" and \"Westworld\". I think what I loved about \"The Expanse\" was the realistic portrayal of space travel and the politics involved in a future where humanity has colonized other planets. I'm also a fan of complex characters and morally ambiguous themes. Do you think either of those shows captures some of that same spirit?",
