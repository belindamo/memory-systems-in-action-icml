I'm a computer program designed to provide information and assist with tasks, but I don't have the ability to use apps or participate in language exchange sessions.\n\nI'm here to help you with your questions and provide information on various topics, including language learning and language exchange apps. If you'd like to know more about a specific app or platform, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide you with the information you need!\n\nHowever, I'm curious - what app are you using for your language exchange sessions? What features do you like most about it? I'd love to learn more about your experience and provide any tips or suggestions if you need them!",
