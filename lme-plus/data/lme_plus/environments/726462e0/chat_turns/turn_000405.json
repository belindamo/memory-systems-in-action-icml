Your involvement in this festival is an opportunity for your business to help educate several generations about the importance and impact of maintaining good mental health.\nThe Change Your Mind Festival is designed to be an experience where people can to look past the stigmas and misconceptions often associated with mental health. In the festival marketplace, we welcome our exhibitors to showcase and highlight their goods as they relate to these topics.\nDuring the \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d Festival, Interfaith will offer a full day of wellness activities for our guests. Workshops, panels, and breakout sessions will include topics such as Destigmatizing mental health, The Happiness project, how to deal with depression in the family, Healing through the Arts, and various related subjects.

We thank you for your consideration and contribution!\nExhibitor/Vendor Package: $250 Includes Pre- and post-event publicity\n8ft table, tablecloth, 2 Chairs -Signage\nDetails: Saturday, May 6th from 11 am \u2013 4 pm\nJunior Seau Pier Amphitheatre, Oceanside\nBy partnering with Interfaith on this annual \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d Festival you will earn wide exposure and build even more brand awareness throughout North San Diego County, as well as branding your organization as a leader in the community in which you operate. We value our partnership and want you to be involved in this amazing day\nSome potential activities include:\n1. Naloxone Training and Distribution - either hosted by HRCSD or one of their subcontractors. It could also be a great opportunity to highlight the call to action to become a Naloxone Distributor. Maya and I have also briefly brainstormed some ideas how we could partner with OSI/LiveWoW to develop a Train the Trainer program where certain Outreach staff who go out with the bus get trained to train the community on how to use naloxone, properly track and document said distribution activities, and reinforce the idea that we want to flood the community with naloxone, and \"It's Up 2 Us\" to do that together. People want to help tackle this crisis, let's empower them to do so. This would involve coordination with Stephanie Lao and Population Health. \n\n2. Culturally tailored presentations on mental health through the Breaking Down Barriers contract and their cultural brokers to speak specifically to mental health challenges and stigma facing the Hispanic and African American communities. \n\n3. Rerouting some of the SBCM art pieces to this event to amplify the voices of lived experience\n4. Using this event as a kick-off for both MIHMM in North as well as Fentanyl Awareness Day on May 9th. \n\nand any other ideas you can generate.",
