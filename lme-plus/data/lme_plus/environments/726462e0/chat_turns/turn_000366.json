Having a mix of booked accommodations and flexibility in your itinerary will give you the freedom to adjust your plans as you go along.\n\nIt's great that you've got a good set of hiking boots and outdoor clothing, as well as a backpack with the essentials. A portable charger is a fantastic idea, especially since you'll be out of cell range for parts of the trip. I'd recommend looking into a rugged and waterproof portable charger that can withstand the elements. Some popular options include:\n\n* Anker PowerCore: A compact and lightweight charger that's perfect for hiking and outdoor activities.\n* Goal Zero Torch 250: A waterproof and rugged charger that's designed for outdoor use, with a built-in flashlight and USB ports.\n* Mophie Powerstation: A high-capacity charger that's designed for extended trips, with a rugged and water-resistant design.\n\nIn addition to a portable charger, you may also want to consider bringing:\n\n* A paper map or a GPS device, in case your phone's GPS doesn't work in certain areas.\n* A waterproof phone case or pouch, to protect your phone from water and dust.\n* A small daypack or backpack with rain gear, such as a lightweight rain jacket and pants.\n* A bear spray or bear bell, depending on the areas you'll be hiking in and the time of year.\n* A small first aid kit with any personal medications, as well as supplies for blisters, cuts, and scrapes.\n\nIt's also a good idea to check the weather forecast before you head out each day, and to let someone know your itinerary and expected return time.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you're well-prepared for your trip, but it's always a good idea to double-check your gear and plans before you head out. Have a safe and enjoyable trip!",
