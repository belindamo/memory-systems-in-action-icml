It aimed to provide a rational basis for grammar and emphasized the importance of logic and reasoning in understanding language. The authors focused on the relationship between syntax, semantics, and the logical structure of sentences, arguing that meaning is derived from the relationships between words in a sentence. This work laid the foundation for later theories of generative grammar and formal semantics.",
