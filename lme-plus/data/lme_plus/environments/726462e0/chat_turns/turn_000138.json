Acrylics and watercolors are two very different mediums, and it's exciting that you're looking to explore watercolors further.\n\nWhen it comes to watercolor brushes, the type and quality of brushes can greatly impact the outcome of your work. Here are some suggestions for good watercolor brushes to start with:\n\n1. **Natural Hair Brushes**: Natural hair brushes, such as sable, squirrel, or mongoose hair, are ideal for watercolors. They hold a lot of water and pigment, allowing for smooth, even washes. Look for brushes with high-quality, soft hair that will absorb and release water well.\n2. **Synthetic Brushes**: Synthetic brushes, made from nylon or polyester, are a more affordable option and can mimic the performance of natural hair brushes. They're also easier to clean and maintain.\n3. **Round Brushes**: Round brushes are great for detail work, fine lines, and small shapes. They come in a range of sizes, from 0 (very fine) to 10 (larger).\n4. **Flat Brushes**: Flat brushes are perfect for broad strokes, washes, and covering large areas. They're available in various widths, from 1/2 inch to 2 inches or more.\n5. **Mop Brushes**: Mop brushes are large, soft brushes used for creating soft, wet washes and blending colors. They're essential for creating subtle, atmospheric effects.\n\nSome popular watercolor brush brands for beginners include:\n\n1. **Winsor & Newton**: Known for their high-quality, natural hair brushes.\n2. **Daniel Smith**: Offers a range of synthetic and natural hair brushes, including their popular Watercolor Brushes.\n3. **Holbein**: A Japanese brand offering high-quality, synthetic brushes at an affordable price.\n4. **Schmincke**: A German brand renowned for their high-quality, natural hair brushes.\n\nWhen selecting brushes, consider the following factors:\n\n* Quality of hair or synthetic material\n* Brush size and shape (round, flat, mop)\n* Handle material (wood, plastic, or synthetic)\n* Price point (natural hair brushes tend to be more expensive)\n\nFor a starter set, I'd recommend investing in a few essential brushes:\n\n* Round brush (#6 or #8)\n* Flat brush (1/2 inch or 1 inch)\n* Mop brush (1 inch or 2 inch)\n\nThis will give you a good foundation to start exploring watercolors. As you become more comfortable with the medium, you can always add more brushes to your collection.\n\nRemember, the quality of your brushes will impact the quality of your work. Invest in good brushes, and they'll serve you well for many artistic adventures to come!\n\nHow's your abstract piece \"Turmoil\" coming along, by the way? I'd love to hear more about it!",
