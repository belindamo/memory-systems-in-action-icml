  "content": "I'm so thrilled to hear that! Nahri's story is truly inspiring, and I think you'll find yourself cheering her on every step of the way. The City of Brass is a fantastic book that explores themes of identity, power, and self-discovery, and Nahri's journey is at the heart of it all.\n\nAs you read, pay attention to the world-building, too. Chakraborty's descriptions of 18th century Cairo and the magical world of Daevabad are incredibly vivid and immersive. You'll feel like you're right there with Nahri, navigating the bustling streets and markets of Cairo, and exploring the wonders of the magical city.\n\nAlso, be prepared for a slow-burn romance that will make your heart flutter! The relationships in this book are complex and multi-layered, and Nahri's connections with the people around her are a big part of her growth and development.\n\nIf you have any questions or thoughts while you're reading, feel free to come back and chat with me anytime. I'd love to discuss The City of Brass with you and hear your thoughts on Nahri's journey!\n\nHappy reading, and I hope you enjoy every moment of this magical adventure!",
