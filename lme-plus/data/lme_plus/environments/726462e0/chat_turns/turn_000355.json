If you're ready to try reading and deep breathing, I can offer some additional tips to help you get started.\n\nFor reading, consider the following:\n\n* Choose a book that's not too stimulating or exciting. Opt for something calming, like a romance novel, a poetry collection, or a self-help book.\n* Set aside a specific time for reading, such as 20-30 minutes before bed.\n* Create a cozy reading environment by dimming the lights, adjusting the temperature, and getting comfortable.\n\nFor deep breathing exercises, try the following:\n\n* Find a quiet, comfortable spot to sit or lie down where you can relax without distractions.\n* Close your eyes and focus on your breath. Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.\n* Start with short sessions, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable",
