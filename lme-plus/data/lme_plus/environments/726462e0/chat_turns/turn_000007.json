  "content": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is an updated version of the formula that takes into account the fact that \"O-22-XXX-\" has 9 characters:\n```scss\nNew Column =\nIF(\n    LEN(Table1[Column]) = 22,     // Check if the length of the string is 22\n    Table1[Column],               // If it is already in the correct format, leave it as is\n    LEFT(Table1[Column], 9) &     // Take the first 9 characters (O-22-XXX-)\n    IF(\n        LEN(Table1[Column]) = 24,      // If the length is 24, there is a leading zero that needs to be removed\n        \"ART\" & MID(Table1[Column], 12, 2),   // Take the two characters after the \"ART\" (e.g. \"13\")\n        \"ART0\" & MID(Table1[Column], 12, 1)  // Add a leading zero and take the one character after the \"ART\" (e.g. \"4\")\n    ) &\n    MID(Table1[Column], 15, 6)    // Take the six characters after the \"PI\" (e.g. \"4-K01\")\n)\n```\nThis formula should work correctly for your case. Again, you can replace \"New Column\" with the name of the column where you want to output the transformed values, and \"Table1[Column]\" with the name of the column that contains the original values.",
