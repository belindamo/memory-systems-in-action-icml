It's a calming activity that can help slow down your mind and prepare your body for sleep. Choose a book that's not too stimulating or exciting, and aim to read for 20-30 minutes before bed.\n2. **Deep breathing exercises**: Deep breathing is a simple yet powerful technique to calm your mind and body. It can help slow down your heart rate, lower your blood pressure, and relax your muscles. You can find many guided deep breathing exercises online, or simply focus on taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.\n\nThese two activities are great starting points because they:\n\n* Are easy to fit into your daily routine\n* Don't require any special equipment or setup\n* Can be adapted to your personal preferences and needs\n* Can help you relax and prepare your body for sleep\n\nStart with one or both of these activities and see how they make you feel. Once you've established a consistent routine, you can experiment with other activities to find what works best for you.\n\nRemember, the key is to keep it simple and consistent. Begin with small, manageable steps, and gradually build up to more activities as you become more comfortable with your new bedtime routine.\n\nHow do these recommendations sound? Are you ready to give reading and deep breathing a try?",
