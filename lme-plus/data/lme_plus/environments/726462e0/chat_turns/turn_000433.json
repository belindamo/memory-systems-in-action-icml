  "content": "I can definitely provide some details. So, I went to Walmart last Sunday and spent around $50. The day before, I ordered some groceries online from Target, which were delivered on Monday morning. I used a 10% off coupon on that order, so I ended up saving around $8. A week prior to that, I went to Trader Joe's with my sister and we spent around $75. I've also been regularly shopping at Aldi's, usually stopping by every 10-14 days, and I usually spend around $30-40 per trip. Oh, and I also stopped by the local farmer's market two weekends ago, but I don't have the exact amount I spent there.",
