For the farmer's market trip, I'm going to estimate that I spent around $25. I remember buying some fresh produce, artisanal cheese, and a few baked goods, so that sounds about right.\n\nAlso, I was wondering if we could break down the Aldi's trips into separate entries, rather than just having a total amount. I'd like to get a better sense of how much I'm spending each time I go there. Would that be possible?\n\nThanks again for your help! I'm already feeling more on top of my grocery budget\"",
