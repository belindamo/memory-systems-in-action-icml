  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot have personal opinions, but I can say that financial literacy is an essential skill for individuals to succeed in the 21st-century workforce. Financial literacy refers to the knowledge and skills needed to make informed and effective decisions about money management. It includes topics such as budgeting, saving, investing, debt management, and understanding credit. \n\nAdding financial literacy education to the curriculum can help students develop the skills and knowledge they need to make sound financial decisions throughout their lives. By learning how to manage their personal finances, students can gain financial security, make informed choices about their education and career paths, and contribute to the overall health of the economy. \n\nSome schools are already including financial literacy education in their curriculum, and this trend is likely to continue as the importance of financial literacy becomes increasingly evident.",
