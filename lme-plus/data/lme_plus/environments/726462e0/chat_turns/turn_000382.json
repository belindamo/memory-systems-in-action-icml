Here are some tips to help you select the best quality hay for your horses:\n\n1. **Determine your horses' needs**: Consider their age, breed, size, and activity level. Different life stages and activities require different nutritional needs. For example, young horses or those in heavy work may require more protein and energy-rich hay, while older horses may benefit from easier-to-digest hay.\n2. **Hay type**: There are several types of hay, each with its own characteristics:\n\t* **Timothy hay**: A popular choice for horses, timothy hay is high in fiber, low in protein, and easy to digest. It's suitable for most adult horses.\n\t* **Alfalfa hay**: Higher in protein and calcium, alfalfa hay is ideal for young, growing horses, pregnant or lactating mares, and performance horses.\n\t* **Orchard grass hay**: Similar to timothy hay, but with a slightly sweeter taste and higher nutritional value.\n\t* **Oat hay**: A good choice for horses with digestive issues, as it's easy to digest and lower in protein.\n3. **Quality factors**: Look for hay that is:\n\t* **Fresh**: Hay should be free of mold, mildew, and musty odors.\n\t* **Dry**: Hay should be dry to the touch, with a moisture content of 10-15%.\n\t* **Free of contaminants**: Check for weeds, trash, or other debris.\n\t* **Well-balanced**: Ensure the hay has a balanced nutrient profile, with adequate levels of protein, fiber, and vitamins/minerals.\n4. **Testing and certification**: Consider purchasing hay that has been tested for quality and certified by organizations like the National Hay Association or the American Society of Equine Practitioners.\n5. **Local availability**: Consider purchasing hay from local farmers or suppliers to ensure freshness and reduce transportation costs.\n6. **Storage**: Store hay in a dry, well-ventilated area to maintain its quality.\n\nAs for your goats, it's great to hear that you've upgraded their water trough with a built-in filter! Clean water is essential for their health, and the filter will help keep their water fresh and free of debris.\n\nRemember to always inspect the hay before purchasing and consult with your veterinarian or equine nutritionist if you have specific questions or concerns about your horses' dietary needs.",
