Many cooking schools in Hanoi offer a market tour before the class, which is an excellent way to learn about local ingredients, see where they're sourced from, and get a deeper understanding of Vietnamese cuisine. This combo is often called a \"Market-to-Table\" or \"Farm-to-Table\" experience.\n\nHere are some popular cooking schools in Hanoi that offer a market tour before the class:\n\n1. **Hanoi Cooking Centre**: Their \"Market-to-Table\" class includes a guided tour of the Chau Long Market, where you'll learn about local ingredients, fruits, and vegetables. After the market tour, you'll head back to their kitchen to cook a 3-course meal using the fresh ingredients you've just learned about.\n2. **Vietnam Cooking School**: Their \"Hanoi Market Tour and Cooking Class\" takes you to the Dong Xuan Market, one of the largest markets in Hanoi. You'll explore the market with your guide, learning about local ingredients, and then head back to their kitchen to cook a 3-course meal.\n3. **Hanoi Cooking Class**: Their \"Market Tour and Cooking Class\" includes a visit to the Chau Long Market, where you'll learn about local ingredients and shop for the freshest produce. After the market tour, you'll head back to their kitchen to cook a 3-course meal.\n4. **Street Food Tours Hanoi**: While not exclusively a cooking school, Street Food Tours Hanoi offers a \"Market and Cooking Class\" tour that takes you to the Dong Xuan Market and then to a local kitchen to cook a 3-course meal.\n\nThese market tours are usually around 1-2 hours long and provide a great opportunity to learn about:\n\n* Local ingredients: You'll learn about the variety of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices used in Vietnamese cuisine.\n* Market culture: You'll get to experience the sights, sounds, and smells of a bustling local market.\n* Food sourcing: You'll see where locals shop for their ingredients and learn about the importance of freshness and seasonality in Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nAfter the market tour, you'll head back to the cooking school's kitchen to prepare a delicious meal using the ingredients you've just learned about. This is a fantastic way to connect the dots between the market and the meal, and you'll appreciate the effort that goes into preparing a traditional Vietnamese dish.\n\nWhen booking a cooking class, make sure to check if they offer a market tour as part of the package. Some schools may offer it as an optional add-on, while others might include it as part of the standard class.",
