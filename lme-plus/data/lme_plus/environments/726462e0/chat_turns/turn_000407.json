  "content": "Summarize this for me:\nPassing along an opportunity to enhance the 2nd Annual Change Your Mind Mental Health Festival on May 6th, which is designed to promote culturally responsive and positive mental health and self-care practices. I propose that BHS participate in this event and showcase recent additions to the region such as the Crisis Stabilization Units, Leave Behind kits, Fentanyl Campaign, etc. There are various sponsorship levels ranging from $25k to $250. The $25k title sponsorship offers several C&E benefits like an Opening Announcement on the Main Stage, 5 additional announcements throughout the event, and a chance for Leadership to participate in a podcast with Greg Anglea on SUD or MH topics.\n\nMoreover, we have heard in recent community conversations, listening sessions, UCSD focus groups, key informant interviews, and other engagement channels that there is a misconception in North County about the lack of Behavioral health resources in the area. Therefore, sponsoring the Change Your Mind festival would provide an excellent opportunity for us to promote awareness of the available resources and address this misconception. We could present a North-specific One Pager, Fentanyl Awareness Materials, announce the Youth Challenge, build an interest list for presentations, promote CEP, host culturally tailored workshops with Breaking Down Barriers, and more.\n\nI would love to discuss this opportunity further and explore possibilities for our department to get involved! This seems like a ripe opportunity to collaborate with OEqC to enhance work already being done in the community.",
