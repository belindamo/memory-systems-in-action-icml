  "content": "It's important to incorporate rest days in your training routine, especially when it comes to agility drills. Agility drills are a form of high-intensity training that put a lot of stress on your body, so you need to give your muscles and joints enough time to recover fully between workouts. This means that you should avoid doing agility drills every day and instead, give yourself time to rest and recover. Experts suggest that you should aim for three to five agility workouts per week, with at least one rest day in between each workout. This allows your muscles to recover and repair themselves, which will help prevent injury and improve your performance over time. On your rest days, you can do other forms of low-intensity exercises, such as walking or light stretching. Also, make sure that you are getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet to support your body's recovery and improve your overall performance.",
