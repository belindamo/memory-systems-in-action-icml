  "content": "Sure! Here are a few simple and healthy recipe suggestions that feature salmon and shrimp:\n\nFor salmon, you can try:\n\n1. Maple Glazed Salmon: Combine maple syrup, soy sauce or tamari, garlic, and ginger, then brush the mixture onto salmon fillets and grill, bake, or broil until fully cooked. 2. Miso-Glazed Salmon: whisk together miso paste, mirin, soy sauce or tamari, sesame oil, and a little bit of honey, then coat salmon fillets and bake or broil until cooked through. 3. Lemon Garlic Salmon: marinate salmon fillets in a mixture of lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper for at least 10 minutes or up to a few hours. Then, grill, bake, or broil until cooked through. And for shrimp, you can try:\n\n1. Garlic Shrimp Stir Fry: sautee a mixture of chopped garlic, ginger, and vegetables (such as carrots, bell pepper, broccoli, and snap peas) in a little bit of sesame oil until just tender. Then, add in raw shrimp and cook until pink and fully cooked. Serve over rice or noodles. 2. Coconut Curry Shrimp: simmer onion, garlic, ginger, curry powder, coconut milk, and diced tomatoes in a skillet, then add in raw shrimp and cook until fully cooked. Serve over rice or with naan bread. 3. Shrimp and Avocado Salad: mix together diced avocado, cooked shrimp, cherry tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve over greens or as a sandwich. I hope these ideas help inspire you in the kitchen!",
