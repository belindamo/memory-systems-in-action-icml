  "content": "Yes, drug trafficking is still a major source of income for other armed groups in Colombia, even after the demobilization of FARC. The most significant of these groups is the National Liberation Army (ELN), which is also involved in drug trafficking, illegal mining, and extortion.\n\nOther armed groups involved in drug trafficking include the Gulf Clan, which is Colombia's largest drug-trafficking organization, and dissident factions of FARC that did not demobilize with the peace agreement.\n\nDrug trafficking continues to fuel violence and instability in areas where these armed groups operate. These groups engage in violent turf wars with each other, as well as with law enforcement agencies and civilian authorities. They also use violence and intimidation to expand their drug trafficking operations, as well as to control local communities and resources.\n\nOverall, drug trafficking remains a significant challenge for Colombia, and addressing it requires a multifaceted approach that includes dismantling organized criminal groups, implementing alternative development projects, providing security and justice to affected communities, and reducing demand for illicit drugs worldwide.",
