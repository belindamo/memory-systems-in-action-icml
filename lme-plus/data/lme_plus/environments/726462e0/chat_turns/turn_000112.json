  "content": "Adding a column to track the property manager or contact person is a great idea. Here's an updated template for the Property List sheet:\n\n**Sheet 1: Property List**\n\n| Property ID | Property Address | Location | Acquisition Date | Purchase Price | Current Value | Property Type | Current Status | Property Manager/Contact |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 123 Main St | City, State | 01/01/2020 | $100,000 | $120,000 | Residential | Active | John Smith |\n| 2 | 456 Elm St | City, State | 06/01/2018 | $50,000 | $60,000 | Commercial | Under Construction | Jane Doe |\n| 3 | 789 Oak St | City, State | 03/01/2015 | $200,000 | $250,000 | Vacant Land | Vacant | Bob Johnson |\n\nYou can add a new column with the header \"Property Manager/Contact\" and populate it with the name and contact information of the person responsible for each property. This could be a property manager, a real estate agent, a contractor, or any other person who is responsible for overseeing the property.\n\nTips for using this column:\n\n* Consider adding a separate column for \"Contact Information\" to store additional contact details such as phone numbers, email addresses, or physical addresses.\n* Use a drop-down menu or data validation to restrict the input to a pre-defined list of property managers or contacts.\n* Use filters or pivot tables to analyze your property portfolio by property manager or contact, allowing you to identify trends, opportunities, or areas for improvement.\n* Use conditional formatting to highlight properties with a specific property manager or contact, to quickly identify properties that require attention.\n\nYou can also use this column to:\n\n* Assign responsibilities and tasks to specific property managers or contacts\n* Track communication and interactions with property managers or contacts\n* Identify areas where you need to adjust your management or investment strategy\n* Monitor the performance of property managers or contacts and make data-driven decisions\n\nRemember to update any formulas or reports that reference the Property List sheet to include the new Property Manager/Contact column.\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider adding more columns to track other relevant information such as:\n\n* Property Manager/Contact Email\n* Property Manager/Contact Phone\n* Property Manager/Contact Address\n* Property Manager/Contact Notes\n\nThis will help you to have a more comprehensive view of your property portfolio and make it easier to manage and track your properties.",
