  "content": "One specific idea for an art project that is similar to the banana duct taped to a wall is to create a sculpture using a collection of empty plastic bottles. The sculpture could be created by arranging the bottles in a specific shape or pattern. The bottles could be filled with different colored liquids to add an additional layer of meaning or interest. The sculpture could be displayed in a park or public space and viewers could be encouraged to think about the environmental impact of plastic waste.",
