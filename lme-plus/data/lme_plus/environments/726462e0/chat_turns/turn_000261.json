  "content": "That's great to hear! The \"Learn Mode\" feature on Viki is a fantastic resource for language learners. It allows you to learn Korean phrases and vocabulary in context, which can be really helpful for improving your language skills. You can even save the phrases you learn to a personalized vocabulary list for later review.\n\nIf you're serious about improving your Korean language skills, I'd also recommend checking out other online resources like Duolingo, TalkToMeInKorean, and KBS World Radio. They offer a range of language learning materials, from beginner-friendly lessons to more advanced content.\n\nAdditionally, watching Korean dramas and variety shows with English subtitles can also help you improve your listening and reading skills. You can even try watching shows without subtitles occasionally to challenge yourself and improve your comprehension.\n\nRemember, consistent practice is key to language learning, so try to set aside some time each day or week to practice your Korean skills. Good luck, and I hope you find the \"Learn Mode\" feature on Viki helpful!",
