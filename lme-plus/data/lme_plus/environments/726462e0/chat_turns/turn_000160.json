  "content": "One idea for an art project similar to the banana duct taped to a wall is to create a sculpture using everyday objects arranged in a unexpected or unusual way. For example, using a collection of household items such as kitchen utensils, appliances, or tools, and arranging them in a way that creates a new form or meaning. The sculpture could be displayed in a gallery or public space, and viewers could be encouraged to interpret the meaning of the work for themselves.",
