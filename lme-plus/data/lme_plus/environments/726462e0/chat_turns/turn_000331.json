  "content": "Congratulations on building a new gaming PC! That's exciting! With your PC's capabilities, you can definitely handle most modern games at high settings.\n\nThe games I recommended earlier should run smoothly on your PC, considering you've already played demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Here are some specific notes on the system requirements for each game:\n\n1. **Horizon Zero Dawn**: The PC port is well-optimized, and your PC should handle it easily. Recommended specs include an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 580, which is lower than what you'd need for Cyberpunk 2077.\n2. **Death Stranding**: The PC version is also well-optimized, and your PC should run it smoothly. Recommended specs include an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 590, which is similar to Horizon Zero Dawn's requirements.\n3. **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**: Although an older game, The Witcher 3 still looks great, and your PC should handle it with ease. Recommended specs include an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 390, which is lower than what you'd need for modern games.\n4. **What Remains of Edith Finch**: This game is relatively lightweight and should run on most modern PCs. Recommended specs include an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 or AMD Radeon R7 370, which is even lower than what you'd need for The Witcher 3.\n5. **Life is Strange**: Another relatively lightweight game, Life is Strange should run smoothly on your PC. Recommended specs include an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 or AMD Radeon HD 7770, which is one of the lowest specs among the games I mentioned.\n\nAll of these games should run at high settings on your PC, but you can always adjust settings to achieve the perfect balance between performance and visual quality.\n\nEnjoy your new gaming PC and exploring these new games!",
