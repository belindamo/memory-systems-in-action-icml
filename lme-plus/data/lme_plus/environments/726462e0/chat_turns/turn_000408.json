  "content": "The 2nd Annual Change Your Mind Mental Health Festival on May 6th aims to promote culturally responsive mental health and self-care practices. It's suggested that BHS participate and showcase recent initiatives like Crisis Stabilization Units, Leave Behind kits, and the Fentanyl Campaign. Sponsorship levels range from $250 to $25k, with the latter offering significant C&E benefits.\n\nNorth County faces misconceptions about the availability of behavioral health resources. Sponsoring the festival can help promote awareness and address this issue. Proposed activities include presenting a North-specific One Pager, Fentanyl Awareness Materials, announcing the Youth Challenge, hosting culturally tailored workshops with Breaking Down Barriers, and more. This event presents a great opportunity for collaboration and enhancing community work.",
