  "content": "1. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: This law brought sweeping changes to the financial sector after the 2008 financial crisis. It created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, increased oversight of large financial institutions, mandated stress testing and increased capital requirements.\n\n2. Basel III: This regulation requires banks to hold more capital and reduce risk-taking activities. It also introduces minimum liquidity requirements and mandates regular stress testing.\n\n3. Sarbanes-Oxley Act: This law was passed in response to a series of corporate accounting scandals. It mandates strict internal controls, financial reporting requirements and independent oversight of public companies.\n\n4. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: This law repealed portions of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had separated commercial and investment banking. It allowed for greater consolidation and cross-selling of financial products.\n\n5. Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934: These acts established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and mandated greater transparency and disclosure in financial markets.\n\nThese laws and regulations have had a significant impact on banking practices. They have increased regulatory oversight and accountability, reduced risk-taking behaviors, improved transparency and consumer protection, and led to the development of new financial products and services. However, some critics argue that overly burdensome regulations can stifle innovation and economic growth.",
