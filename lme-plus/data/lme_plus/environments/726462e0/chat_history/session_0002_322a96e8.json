Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Mexican Rice**: A classic combination that pairs well with enchiladas. You can make it with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices for added flavor.\n2. **Roasted Vegetables**: Grilled or roasted vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, carrots, and onions add a nice contrast in texture and flavor to the rich, cheesy enchiladas. Simply brush with olive oil, season with salt, pepper, and your favorite spices, and roast in the oven until tender.\n3. **Refried Beans**: Another traditional Mexican side dish that goes well with enchiladas. You can make them from scratch or use canned refried beans as a quick alternative.\n4. **Spanish-Style Green Beans**: Blanch green beans and saut\u00e9 them with garlic, olive oil, and a squeeze of lemon juice for a light and refreshing side dish.\n5. **Grilled Corn with Cotija Cheese**: Grilled corn on the cob slathered with mayonnaise, lime juice, and sprinkled with Cotija cheese, chili powder, and cilantro makes a delicious and satisfying side dish.\n6. **Avocado Salad**: A simple salad made with diced avocado, red onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice provides a creamy and refreshing contrast to the spicy enchiladas.\n7. **Warm Flour Tortillas**: Serve warm flour tortillas on the side to use as wraps or to mop up the enchilada sauce.\n8. **Mexican Street Corn Salad**: A flavorful salad made with grilled corn, black beans, diced tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, and a drizzle of lime juice and cotija cheese.\n9. **Sliced Radishes with Lime and Salt**: Thinly sliced radishes with a sprinkle of lime juice and salt make a crunchy and refreshing side dish that pairs well with the rich enchiladas.\n10. **Cilantro Lime Rice**: A flavorful variation of Mexican rice, made with cilantro, lime juice, and a hint of garlic, adds a bright and zesty flavor to your meal.\n\nChoose one or two of these options to serve alongside your chicken enchiladas, and I'm sure you'll have a well-rounded and delicious meal!"

Here are some tips to help you tame the clutter and make the most of your spice rack:\n\n1. **Purge and declutter**: Start by removing any expired or unused spices. Check the expiration dates and get rid of any spices that are past their prime.\n2. **Categorize and group**: Divide your spices into categories, such as:\n\t* Baking spices (e.g., cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger)\n\t* Savory spices (e.g., oregano, thyme, rosemary)\n\t* Spicy spices (e.g., cayenne, chili powder, paprika)\n\t* International spices (e.g., curry powder, garam masala, Chinese five-spice)\n\t* Herbs (e.g., basil, oregano, parsley)\n3. **Alphabetize within categories**: Arrange the spices within each category in alphabetical order. This makes it easy to find the spice you need quickly.\n4. **Use a tiered spice rack**: Consider using a tiered spice rack or a carousel to maximize vertical storage and make the most of your counter space.\n5. **Store small bottles at the front**: Place smaller bottles or less frequently used spices at the front of the rack, making it easier to access the spices you use most often.\n6. **Label and date**: Label each spice bottle with its contents and the date you purchased it. This helps ensure you use the oldest spices first and avoid expired spices.\n7. **Keep it clean**: Clean your spice rack regularly to prevent dust and spills from accumulating. Wipe down the rack and bottles with a damp cloth, and dry thoroughly to prevent moisture buildup.\n8. **Consider a spice carousel**: If you have a lot of spices, a spice carousel can be a great investment. These rotate to make it easy to access the spice you need, and they often have built-in labels and storage for small items like measuring spoons.\n9. **Store spices away from heat and light**: Keep your spice rack away from heat sources like ovens, stoves, and direct sunlight, as these can cause spices to lose their flavor and aroma.\n10. **Maintain your organization**: Set aside some time every few months to maintain your spice rack organization. Go through your spices, check expiration dates, and make sure everything is still organized and easily accessible.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to find the spices you need quickly and easily, and your kitchen will feel more organized and efficient.\n\nNow, go forth and cook up those delicious chicken enchiladas, and enjoy your newly organized spice rack!"
