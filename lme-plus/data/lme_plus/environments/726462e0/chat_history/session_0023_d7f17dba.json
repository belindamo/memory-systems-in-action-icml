It can be a bit annoying, but it's great that you were able to adjust to it.\n\nAs for Viki, I think it's a fantastic streaming service for Korean dramas and other international content! Viki has an impressive library of K-dramas, and their community-driven subtitling effort is truly commendable. The fact that they rely on volunteer translators and editors to provide subtitles in multiple languages is amazing. It's a great way to make Korean dramas more accessible to a global audience.\n\nViki's user interface is also relatively user-friendly, and their content is often available with minimal delay after its initial broadcast in Korea. They also offer a range of features like customizable subtitles, episode discussions, and behind-the-scenes content.\n\nOne thing to note is that Viki is a community-driven platform, so the quality of subtitles can vary depending on the show and the volunteer team working on it. But overall, Viki has become a go-to platform for many K-drama fans, and it's great to hear that you're enjoying it!\n\nHave you explored any of the other features on Viki, like the community forums or the \"Learn Mode\" feature that helps you learn Korean phrases and vocabulary while watching dramas?"

      "content": "That's great to hear! The \"Learn Mode\" feature on Viki is a fantastic resource for language learners. It allows you to learn Korean phrases and vocabulary in context, which can be really helpful for improving your language skills. You can even save the phrases you learn to a personalized vocabulary list for later review.\n\nIf you're serious about improving your Korean language skills, I'd also recommend checking out other online resources like Duolingo, TalkToMeInKorean, and KBS World Radio. They offer a range of language learning materials, from beginner-friendly lessons to more advanced content.\n\nAdditionally, watching Korean dramas and variety shows with English subtitles can also help you improve your listening and reading skills. You can even try watching shows without subtitles occasionally to challenge yourself and improve your comprehension.\n\nRemember, consistent practice is key to language learning, so try to set aside some time each day or week to practice your Korean skills. Good luck, and I hope you find the \"Learn Mode\" feature on Viki helpful!"
