The day before, I ordered some groceries online from Target, which were delivered on Monday morning. I used a 10% off coupon on that order, so I ended up saving around $8. A week prior to that, I went to Trader Joe's with my sister and we spent around $75. I've also been regularly shopping at Aldi's, usually stopping by every 10-14 days, and I usually spend around $30-40 per trip. Oh, and I also stopped by the local farmer's market two weekends ago, but I don't have the exact amount I spent there."

For the farmer's market trip, I'm going to estimate that I spent around $25. I remember buying some fresh produce, artisanal cheese, and a few baked goods, so that sounds about right.\n\nAlso, I was wondering if we could break down the Aldi's trips into separate entries, rather than just having a total amount. I'd like to get a better sense of how much I'm spending each time I go there. Would that be possible?\n\nThanks again for your help! I'm already feeling more on top of my grocery budget\""
