      "content": "In Korean mythology, dragons are considered as divine creatures, believed to have control over the natural forces of the world such as water, wind, and fire. Dragons are also believed to reside in sacred places like waterfalls, lakes, and high mountains. \n\nAccording to Korean mythology, dragons were the rulers of the water and the sky, and they sometimes manifested in human form to help and teach people. It is said that the first king of Korea, Dangun, was the son of a heavenly dragon and a bear-woman. \n\nKorean dragon art shows them with more whiskers, sharper claws, and less aggressive features than Western dragons. The gentle look of Korean dragons symbolizes the benevolent nature of the divine. \n\nKorean mythology also holds that dragons were the guardians of ancient texts and knowledge, and they still serve as the protectors of those who seek knowledge and wisdom. \n\nIn modern Korean culture, dragon symbolism has expanded into identification as a national symbol, with the dragon head featured in many places such as the national flag, currency coins, and emblem."
