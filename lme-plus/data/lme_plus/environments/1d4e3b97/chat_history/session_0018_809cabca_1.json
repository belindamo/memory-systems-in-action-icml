One thing that's been helping me lately is experimenting with different times of day to workout - I used to be a morning person, but now I find I have more energy in the evenings. Do you think that's common, or am I just weird?"

      "content": "You're not weird at all! It's actually quite common for people's energy levels and preferences to change over time. Our bodies have natural circadian rhythms that can shift due to various factors such as age, lifestyle, and environmental changes.\n\nMany people find that their energy levels and productivity ebb and flow throughout the day. Some people are naturally morning larks, while others are night owls. It's great that you're experimenting and finding what works best for you!\n\nResearch suggests that the best time to exercise is when you feel most alert and energized. Exercising at a time that suits your natural energy levels can help you:\n\n1. **Increase motivation**: You're more likely to stick to your workout routine if you feel energized and alert.\n2. **Improve performance**: Exercising when you're most energized can help you perform better and push yourself harder.\n3. **Enhance recovery**: Your body's natural rhythms can affect your recovery. Exercising at a time that suits your natural energy levels can help your body recover more efficiently.\n\nSome people might find that their energy levels change depending on the day of the week, time of year, or even their menstrual cycle (for women). It's essential to listen to your body and adapt your workout schedule accordingly.\n\nSince you've found that you have more energy in the evenings, you might want to try to establish a consistent evening workout routine. You can also experiment with different times during the day to see what works best for you.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a time that you can commit to and enjoy. Exercise should be a positive experience that you look forward to, not a chore that you dread."
