Conversation Exchange has a more limited community feature set.\n* **Pricing**: If you're on a tight budget, Conversation Exchange is a great option since it's free with optional donations. Tandem and HelloTalk offer premium features, but you can still use their apps for free with some limitations.\n\nUltimately, you might want to try out all three apps to see which one works best for you.
