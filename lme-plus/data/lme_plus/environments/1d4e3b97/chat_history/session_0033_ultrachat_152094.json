      "content": "It's completely understandable to feel nervous about giving a graduation speech. However, it's also an opportunity for you to reflect on your experiences, thank those who have supported you, and inspire your fellow graduates as they move into the next chapter of their lives.\n\nThat being said, not everyone is required to give a speech at a graduation ceremony. If you really don't feel comfortable giving a speech, it's okay to decline the opportunity or ask if someone else can speak on your behalf.\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to focus on celebrating your achievements and the achievements of your classmates. Whether or not you give a speech, it's a time to celebrate your hard work and accomplishments and look forward to the future."
