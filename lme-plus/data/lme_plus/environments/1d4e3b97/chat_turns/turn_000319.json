Indulgences are important for our mental and emotional well-being, and it's great that you allowed yourself to treat yourself.\n\nIt's also awesome that you have a clear memory of what you did with the treats, which means you savored and enjoyed them mindfully. That's the best way to indulge - by being present and enjoying every bite!\n\nNow, go forth and enjoy your stir-fry dinner, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more assistance or just want to chat about food, organization, or life in general!",
