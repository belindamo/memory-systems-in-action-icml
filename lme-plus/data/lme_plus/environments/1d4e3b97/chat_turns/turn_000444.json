I like the idea of starting with a range of widths and auditioning them to see what looks best with my fabrics. I'll try to use a consistent ratio, maybe 1:1.25:1.5, to create a sense of harmony. Since I'm using a monochromatic blue palette, I think the varying widths will add some nice texture and depth to the quilt. By the way, I've been thinking about the lace shawl I'm working on, and I'm considering adding some beads to give it a bit of sparkle. Do you have any tips on how to incorporate beads into a knitting project?",
