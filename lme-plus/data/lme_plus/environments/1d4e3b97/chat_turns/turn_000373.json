Let's get the details:\n\n**Cat Food Reorder Details:**\n\n* What is the current batch size of cat food you have for Luna?\n* How long does the current batch typically last (e.g., 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks)?\n* When did you last order cat food for Luna (if you have a record of the date)?\n* Do you want to reorder at the same frequency as before, or do you need to adjust the reorder threshold?\n\nOnce you provide this information, we can set up a reminder system for Luna's cat food using the same digital calendar method.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say the current batch of cat food lasts around 6 weeks, and you last ordered on January 10th. You'd want to set a reminder for approximately 6 weeks from the last order date, which would be around February 24th. You can set a reminder notification 3-5 days before that date to give yourself time to reorder.\n\nEvent Title: Reorder Cat Food for Luna\nEvent Date: February 24th\nReminder: February 19th (5 days before)\n\nBy setting up a reminder system for both Max's dog treats and Luna's cat food, you'll ensure you never run out of essential supplies for your furry friends.\n\nRemember to adjust the reminder settings as needed to fit your personal preferences and the specific needs of your pets.",
