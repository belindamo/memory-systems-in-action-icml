  "content": "The most consistent mechanism of action of the medication in question is alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers. The patient's symptoms of increased urinary frequency and weakened urinary stream, along with the finding of an enlarged prostate on examination, are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition in which the prostate gland becomes enlarged. The medication that the physician started the patient on is likely an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker such as terazosin, doxazosin, or tamsulosin. These medications work by blocking the action of alpha-adrenergic receptors in the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck, which results in relaxation of the smooth muscle and improvement of symptoms of BPH.\n\nThe side effect of lightheadedness upon standing and syncopal event are consistent with orthostatic hypotension, which is a common side effect of alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, and it happens when the medication causes a decrease in blood pressure, especially when the patient stands up from a seated or lying down position. The patient should be advised to rise slowly from a seated or lying down position, and to notify the physician if symptoms persist or worsen.",
