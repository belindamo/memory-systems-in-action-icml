The edges were starting to crack and it was just looking really worn out. When I got my new case, I was looking for something simple and subtle, so I got a black case with a subtle design. It's been working out great so far. I do have a screen protector on my phone, but it's been on there for a while now and it's starting to show some wear. Maybe I should consider getting a new one. Do you have any recommendations for good screen protectors?",
