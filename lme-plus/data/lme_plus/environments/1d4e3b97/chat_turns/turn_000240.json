Nezha's eyes widened as he saw it, and he turned to MK.\n\n\"MK, do you know what that is?\" he asked, pointing to the necklace.\n\nMK shook his head, still in shock from the battle.\n\n\"That is the diamond snare necklace,\" Nezha explained. \"It's said to be the only thing that can bind Wukong.\"\n\nMacaque nodded. \"And I got it from him,\" he said, his voice shaking with emotion.\n\nNezha looked at Macaque with respect. \"You are a brave and powerful monkey,\" he said.\n\nMacaque bowed his head humbly. \"I only did what I had to do to protect my friend,\" he said.\n\nMK was amazed to see the two monkeys talking like old friends. \"You two know each other?\" he asked.\n\nNezha chuckled. \"Yes, we go way back,\" he said. \"Macaque was one of the monkeys I trained in the art of combat.\"\n\nMacaque smiled at the memory. \"Those were good times,\" he said. \"You taught us well, Nezha.\"\n\nNezha turned to MK. \"Macaque is one of the greatest warriors I've ever known,\" he said. \"You're lucky to have him as a friend.\"\n\nMK nodded, feeling a deep sense of gratitude toward Macaque. \"I know,\" he said. \"I don't know what I would have done without him.\"\n\nMacaque put his arm around MK. \"Don't worry, little buddy,\" he said. \"I'll always be here for you.\"\n\nNezha smiled at the two of them. \"You two are a great team,\" he said. \"Together, you can accomplish anything.\"\n\nMK smiled, feeling a sense of pride in his friendship with Macaque. He knew that with him by his side, he could face any challenge that came his way.",
