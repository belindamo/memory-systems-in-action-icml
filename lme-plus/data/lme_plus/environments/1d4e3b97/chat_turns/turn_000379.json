Let's set up a reminder system to ensure you don't forget to give them to her.\n\n**Joint Supplement Reminder:**\n\n* Open your digital calendar and create a new event.\n* Set the event title to \"Give Luna Joint Supplements\".\n* Set the event date to a recurring daily or every-other-day reminder, depending on the vet's instructions. For example, if the vet recommended giving her supplements daily, set the event date to today and recurrence to daily.\n* Set a reminder notification to alert you at the same time every day or every other day, so you remember to give Luna her supplements.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nEvent Title: Give Luna Joint Supplements\nEvent Date: Daily (starting from today)\nReminder: 8:00 AM (or a time that works best for you)\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to adjust the reminder time and frequency according to the vet's instructions.\n* Consider setting a reminder for the same time every day or every other day, so it becomes a habit.\n* You can also add a note or description to the event with the supplement name, dosage, and any other relevant information.\n\nBy setting up a reminder for Luna's joint supplements, you'll ensure she receives them consistently and on time.\n\n**Pet Care Reminders Summary:**\n\nYou now have a reminder system in place for:\n\n1. Reordering Max's dog treats\n2. Reordering Luna's cat food\n3. Tracking and reordering cat litter supply\n4. Giving Luna her joint supplements\n\nStay organized, and you'll be able to provide the best care for your furry friends!",
