  "content": "I'd be happy to help you track your screen time and provide insights on how to reduce it.\n\nTo get started, I'll need to know a bit more about your current screen time habits. Please answer the following questions:\n\n1. What type of devices do you use most frequently (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, TV)?\n2. What are your typical wake-up and bedtime hours?\n3. On an average day, how many hours do you think you spend on screens (including work and leisure time)?\n4. What are your top 3-5 most used apps or activities on your devices (e.g., social media, email, games, YouTube, work-related tasks)?\n5. Are there any specific times of the day when you feel like you're most tempted to mindlessly scroll or get sucked into your devices?\n\nRegarding your goal to cut down on phone usage in the evenings, it's great that you're aware of the challenge you faced last week with work commitments. We can work around that by setting realistic goals and finding strategies to help you stay on track.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with personalized insights and suggestions to help you track and reduce your screen time.\n\nRemember, the goal is not to eliminate screen time entirely but to find a healthy balance that works for you and your lifestyle.",
