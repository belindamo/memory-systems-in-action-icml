  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal experience, but here are some tips to ensure a baby is getting enough milk while breastfeeding:\n\n1. Monitor baby's weight - Regular weighing of the baby can help keep track of their weight gain. Generally, a baby should gain around 5-7 ounces per week.\n\n2. Check baby's diapers - A baby who is getting enough milk should have around six to eight wet diapers a day and six to eight dirty diapers a week.\n\n3. Check baby's feeding patterns - A baby who is getting enough milk will feed every 2-3 hours and be satisfied after a feeding.\n\n4. Observe baby's behavior - A baby who is getting enough milk will appear content after a feeding, and may fall asleep or have relaxed body language.\n\n5. Consult with a lactation consultant - If a new mother is concerned about her milk supply, a lactation consultant can offer guidance and support in correcting any issues.\n\n6. Practice proper latching techniques - Ensuring that the baby is properly latched onto the breast can help ensure they are getting enough milk while breastfeeding.\n\n7. Increase nursing sessions - If a new mother is concerned about her milk supply, increasing the frequency of nursing sessions can help stimulate milk production.",
