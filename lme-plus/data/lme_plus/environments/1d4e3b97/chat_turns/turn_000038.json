  "content": "There are many factors that can contribute to low milk supply in new mothers. Some common reasons include:\n\n1. Infrequent breastfeeding or pumping: Regular and frequent emptying of the breasts is important for milk production, and if a mother is not breastfeeding or pumping enough, her milk supply may decrease.\n\n2. Poor latch: If the baby is not latching on properly, this can lead to a decrease in milk supply. A lactation consultant can help to assess and correct the latch.\n\n3. Stress and fatigue: Stress and tiredness can impact milk production. Adequate rest and stress management techniques can help to increase milk supply.\n\n4. Health problems: Certain health conditions such as hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or previous breast surgery can affect milk supply.\n\n5. Medications: Some medications can also affect milk production.\n\nPreventing low milk supply is not always possible, but mothers can take steps to promote milk production by breastfeeding or pumping frequently, ensuring a proper latch, taking care of themselves with adequate rest and nutrition, and seeking help from a lactation consultant or healthcare provider if they are having difficulties with milk supply.",
