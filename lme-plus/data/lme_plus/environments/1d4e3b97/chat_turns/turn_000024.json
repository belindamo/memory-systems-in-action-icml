These processors are capable of handling demanding VR games and provide high clock speeds and multi-core performance. 3. Memory: 16 GB or more of DDR4 RAM with high clock speeds and low latency. 4. Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming, MSI MPG B550 Gaming Edge WiFi, or Gigabyte AORUS Pro AX. 5. Storage: Solid-state drives (SSDs) are recommended for faster load times and performance. Samsung 970 EVO or WD Black SN850 are good choices. 6. Power Supply Unit: Choose a high-quality PSU with at least a 750W output, such as the EVGA SuperNOVA 750W or Corsair RM750X.
