This would be around March 22nd to 29th.\n* Set a reminder notification to alert you 3-5 days before the event date, so you have time to reorder. This would be around March 17th to 24th.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nEvent Title: Reorder Dog Treats for Max\nEvent Date: March 25th\nReminder: March 20th (5 days before)\n\nBy setting the reminder a few days before the expected depletion date, you'll have time to reorder and ensure Max doesn't run out of his favorite treats.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider setting a recurring event or reminder to ensure you don't forget to reorder in the future.\n* You can also add a note or description to the event with the reorder details, such as the supplier (Chewy.com), the specific product, and the quantity you need to order.\n* If you have multiple pet supplies to track, you can create separate events or reminders for each item to keep everything organized.\n\nFeel free to adjust the reminder settings as needed to fit your personal preferences. With this system in place, you'll receive a timely reminder to reorder Max's dog treats and ensure he stays happy and healthy!",
