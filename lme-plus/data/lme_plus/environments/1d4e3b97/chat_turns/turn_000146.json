However, I have to clarify that we didn't have a still-life setup in a park together, as I'm just an AI assistant and don't have a physical presence.\n\nBut I'd be happy to help you with tips on getting started with watercolor painting!\n\nHere are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Choose the right paper**: Watercolor paper is designed to withstand multiple layers of water and pigment. Look for paper labeled as \"hot press\" or \"cold press.\" Hot press paper is smooth and ideal for detailed work, while cold press paper has a texture that allows for more expressive brushstrokes.\n2. **Select your paints**: You can buy watercolor paints in tubes or pans. Tubes are more convenient for traveling, while pans are more cost-effective. Start with a basic set of primary colors and black, and you can always add more colors later.\n3. **Invest in good brushes**: Natural hair brushes (like sable or mongoose) are ideal for watercolor, but synthetic brushes can also work well. Look for brushes with flexible tips and a range of sizes.\n4. **Understand the basics of color theory**: Watercolor is all about transparency and layering. Familiarize yourself with the color wheel and how to mix colors to achieve the desired hues.\n5. **Start with simple exercises**: Begin with basic exercises like wet-on-wet, wet-on-dry, and glazing to understand how the paint interacts with the paper.\n6. **Use reference images**: Gather reference images of still-life setups, flowers, or landscapes to inspire your paintings.\n7. **Practice, practice, practice**: Watercolor requires patience and practice. Don't be discouraged if your first attempts don't turn out as expected. Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement over time.\n8. **Work from light to dark**: Start with light washes and gradually build up to darker colors. This will help you achieve a sense of depth and luminosity in your painting.\n9. **Use the white of the paper**: Don't be afraid to leave some areas of the paper unpainted. The white spaces can add contrast and create a sense of highlights in your painting.\n10. **Have fun**: Watercolor is a forgiving medium, and it's okay to make mistakes. Enjoy the process, and don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nI hope these tips help you get started on your watercolor journey!
