  "content": "I think my character will be writing a mix of fiction and journaling, as a way to process their emotions and tell their story. They might start with journaling as a way to cope with their anxiety, and then gradually move into writing short stories or poetry that reflect their experiences.\n\nAs for their support system, I think they'll need a combination of people who understand their struggles and can offer guidance. Maybe they'll join a writing group or workshop where they can share their work and get feedback from others who are going through similar struggles. They might also have a close friend or family member who's supportive and encouraging, but also doesn't shy away from giving them tough love when they need it.\n\nI'm also thinking of introducing a mentor figure, maybe a published author who's open about their own struggles with anxiety. This mentor could offer guidance on how to navigate the writing world while dealing with anxiety, and provide a sense of hope and inspiration for my character.\n\nWhat do you think? Does that",
