  "content": "Staying hydrated is important for overall health, but there is limited evidence to suggest that drinking more water alone can increase milk supply in new mothers. However, dehydration can affect milk production, so it's important for breastfeeding mothers to drink enough water to stay well hydrated. The Institute of Medicine recommends that breastfeeding mothers drink enough fluids to satisfy their thirst and produce pale yellow urine. Other fluids like milk, juice, and soup can also contribute to hydration, as well as foods with high water content, such as fruits and vegetables. It's recommended to seek advice from a lactation consultant, doctor, or a healthcare professional if a mother is concerned about her milk supply, as the underlying causes of low milk supply can vary and may require different interventions.",
