  "content": "Nezha landed his chariot next to MK and asked, \"Are you alright, mortal?\"\n\nMK looked up at Nezha, still trying to process everything that had happened. \"I think so. That was...unbelievable. Thank you for saving me.\"\n\nNezha nodded. \"It is our duty to protect the innocent from harm. I am glad I was able to do so.\"\n\nMK looked around at the aftermath of the battle. There were wounded monkeys lying on the ground and celestial soldiers tending to them. \"What will happen to the monkeys now?\"\n\nNezha sighed. \"They will be brought to the Jade Emperor for judgment. It is up to him to decide their fate.\"\n\nMK looked down, feeling a pang of guilt. \"I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I just wanted to find a story to tell.\"\n\nNezha placed a reassuring hand on MK's shoulder. \"You did not cause this, mortal. It was the monkeys' greed and arrogance that brought about their downfall. And now, justice will be served.\"\n\nMK nodded, feeling a sense of relief. \"What about Macaque and Wukong? I didn't see them after the fight.\"\n\nNezha's expression darkened. \"They are still at large. But do not worry, mortal. They will not escape justice for long.\"\n\nMK watched as Nezha climbed back into his chariot and took off into the sky. He couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and gratitude towards the celestial warrior who had saved his life.",
