  "content": "I think I'll start by adding beads to the center of the lace motifs, just to give it a bit of sparkle and interest. I'll use a consistent size and type of bead throughout the shawl to create a cohesive look. I might also add some beads to the edge of the shawl, just to give it a nice finish. I'm not sure yet, but I'll experiment and see what looks best. By the way, do you have any tips on how to block a lace shawl? I've never blocked a lace project before, and I want to make sure I do it right.",
