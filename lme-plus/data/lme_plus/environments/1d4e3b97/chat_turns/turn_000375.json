Let's set the reminder for 6 weeks from today (assuming you want to reorder when the current batch is running low).\n\n**Reminder Setup:**\n\n* Open your digital calendar and create a new event.\n* Set the event title to \"Reorder Cat Food for Luna\".\n* Set the event date to 6 weeks from today. For example, if today is February 25th, the event date would be April 8th.\n* Set a reminder notification to alert you 3-5 days before the event date, so you have time to reorder. This would be around April 3rd to 5th.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nEvent Title: Reorder Cat Food for Luna\nEvent Date: April 8th\nReminder: April 3rd (5 days before)\n\nThis way, you'll receive a reminder when it's time to reorder cat food for Luna, ensuring you don't run out and can keep her well-fed and happy.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to update the reminder date each time you reorder cat food, so the system remains accurate.\n* Consider keeping track of the last order date and batch size in your calendar event or a note, so you can refine your reorder threshold over time.\n* If you need to adjust the reorder threshold or reminder settings, you can do so at any time.\n\nNow you have a reminder system in place for both Max's dog treats and Luna's cat food. You'll be notified when it's time to reorder, ensuring your furry friends always have what they need.",
