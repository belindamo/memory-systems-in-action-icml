Here are some pros and cons to help you decide:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Added protection**: A built-in camera lens protector can safeguard your phone's camera lens from scratches, cracks, or other damage.\n2. **Convenience**: Having a single screen protector that covers both the screen and camera lens can be more convenient than applying separate protectors.\n3. **Ease of installation**: Some screen protectors with built-in camera lens protectors come with a single-piece design, making installation easier and less prone to errors.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Bulkier design**: Screen protectors with built-in camera lens protectors might be slightly thicker or bulkier than standard screen protectors, which could affect the phone's overall aesthetic.\n2. **Potential interference**: Depending on the design, the camera lens protector might interfere with the camera's functionality, such as affecting the camera's flash or causing glare.\n3. **Limited compatibility**: Some screen protectors with built-in camera lens protectors might not be compatible with certain phone cases or other accessories.\n\nIf you decide to get a screen protector with a built-in camera lens protector, make sure to:\n\n1. **Check compatibility**: Verify that the screen protector is compatible with your phone model and case (if you plan to use one).\n2. **Read reviews**: Look for reviews from other customers to ensure the camera lens protector doesn't interfere with the camera's functionality.\n3. **Inspect the design**: Check the design of the camera lens protector to ensure it's not too bulky or obtrusive.\n\nUltimately, if you're concerned about protecting your phone's camera lens and want the convenience of a single screen protector, a built-in camera lens protector might be a good option for you. However, if you're looking for a slim and minimalist design, you might want to consider separate screen and camera lens protectors.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards a screen protector with a built-in camera lens protector, or do you have any other questions about this feature?",
