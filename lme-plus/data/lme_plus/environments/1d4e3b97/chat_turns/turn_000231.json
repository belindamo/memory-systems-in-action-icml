By having them write a mix of fiction and journaling, you can explore the therapeutic benefits of creative expression while also delving into the complexities of their emotions and experiences.\n\nThe support system you've described sounds ideal for your character's growth and development. The writing group or workshop can provide a sense of community and accountability, while the close friend or family member can offer emotional support and a reality check when needed. The mentor figure can serve as a role model and guide, helping your character navigate the challenges of writing with anxiety.\n\nThe mentor's presence can also add an extra layer of depth to your story. You could explore the themes of:\n\n1. **Hope and inspiration:** Show how the mentor's success and openness about their own struggles inspire your character to keep writing and seeking help.\n2. **Mentorship and guidance:** Delve into the specifics of how the mentor helps your character develop their writing skills and coping strategies.\n3. **Role models and representation:** Highlight the importance of having role models who understand and openly discuss their mental health struggles, providing a sense of representation and validation for your character.\n\nTo take this further, you could also consider the following:\n\n1. **The mentor's backstory:** What's the mentor's story? How did they overcome their own anxiety struggles, and what lessons can they impart to your character?\n2. **The power of vulnerability:** How does the mentor's openness about their struggles impact your character's willingness to be vulnerable and honest about their own experiences?\n3. **The impact of support:** Show how the support system as a whole affects your character's mental health and writing journey. How do the relationships they've formed help them cope with anxiety and find success as a writer?\n\nBy exploring these themes and relationships, you can create a rich and nuanced story that resonates with readers who have faced similar struggles.\n\nWhat do you think about introducing a plot twist or conflict that challenges your character's progress and forces them to re-evaluate their coping mechanisms? This could be something like a writing competition, a personal crisis, or a setback in their mental health journey.",
