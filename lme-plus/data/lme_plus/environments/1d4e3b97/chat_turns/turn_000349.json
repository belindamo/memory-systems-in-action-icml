  "content": "A typical graduation speech should be between 5-10 minutes long. However, it's important not to focus too much on the length of the speech but on the content and delivery. Here are some tried-and-tested techniques for keeping the audience engaged:\n\n1. Start with a strong opening: Grab the audience's attention with a personal story, a quote, or an interesting fact.\n\n2. Keep it positive: Graduation is a time for celebration, so focus on the positive aspects of the graduates' achievements.\n\n3. Use humor: A well-placed joke or humorous anecdote can lighten the mood and make your speech memorable.\n\n4. Speak clearly and confidently: Use a strong and clear voice so that everyone in the audience can hear you.\n\n5. Use personal examples: Share your own experiences to emphasize your message.\n\n6. Use visual aids: PowerPoint slides or props can help to keep the audience engaged and reinforce your message.\n\n7.
