  "content": "Tracking cat litter supply can be a bit trickier than pet food or treats, as it depends on various factors, such as the type of litter, litter box size, and your cat's usage. However, we can set up a system to help you estimate when you'll need to reorder.\n\n**Cat Litter Tracking:**\n\n1. **Initial Setup:** Start by tracking how much litter you have left in the bag or container. You can weigh it or estimate the volume (e.g., 1/2 full, 1/4 full).\n2. **Usage Monitoring:** For the next few weeks, observe how quickly the litter level decreases. You can check the litter box daily or every other day to get an idea of the usage rate.\n3. **Estimate Reorder Point:** Based on your observations, estimate when you'll need to reorder litter. For example, if you notice the litter level decreases by 1/4 every week, you might need to reorder every 4-6 weeks.\n\nLet's set up a reminder system based on your initial setup:\n\n**Reminder Setup:**\n\n* Open your digital calendar and create a new event.\n* Set the event title to \"Check Cat Litter Supply\".\n* Set the event date to 4-6 weeks from today (based on your estimated reorder point). For example, if today is February 25th, the event date would be March 25th to April 1st.\n* Set a reminder notification to alert you 1-2 weeks before the event date, so you have time to reorder. This would be around March 11th to 18th.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nEvent Title: Check Cat Litter Supply\nEvent Date: March 25th\nReminder: March 11th (2 weeks before)\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Adjust the reminder date and frequency based on your cat's litter usage and your observations.\n* Consider taking notes or photos of the litter level to help you track the usage rate more accurately.\n* If you're unsure about the reorder point, start with a conservative estimate and adjust as needed.\n\nBy tracking your cat litter supply and setting reminders, you'll be able to anticipate when you need to reorder and avoid running out. You can refine the system as you gather more data on your cat's litter usage.\n\nNow, you have a reminder system in place for Max's dog treats, Luna's cat food, and your cat litter supply. You're all set to stay on top of your pet supplies!",
