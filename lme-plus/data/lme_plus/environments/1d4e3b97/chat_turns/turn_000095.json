  "content": "I've been having some trouble sleeping lately, but I've been trying to establish a bedtime routine to help with that. I've been reading for 20-30 minutes before bed, listening to calming music, and getting ready for bed earlier. Oh, and I started taking melatonin supplements about 2 weeks ago, which have really helped - I take one 30 minutes before bed and I'm usually asleep within 15-20 minutes. Can you recommend any other things I can try to improve my sleep quality?",
