  "content": "Yes, pumping breast milk between feedings can help increase milk supply. When a mother breastfeeds her baby or pumps breast milk, it stimulates the production of more milk. Pumping in between feedings can help to increase the number of times that the mother is stimulating milk production, which can result in an increase in supply over time. It's important to note that pumping should be done in addition to breastfeeding, not as a replacement for it, to ensure that the baby is still receiving enough breast milk directly. Additionally, it's recommended to seek advice from a lactation consultant, doctor, or a healthcare professional before starting any regime that aims to increase milk supply.",
