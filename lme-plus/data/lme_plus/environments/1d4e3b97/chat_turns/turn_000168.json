Here are some suggestions for Indian and Middle Eastern dishes that would pair well with Japchae:\n\n**Indian Options:**\n\n1. **Chana Masala**: A popular North Indian dish made with chickpeas in a rich, spicy tomato-based sauce. The creamy texture and slightly sweet flavor of chana masala will complement Japchae nicely.\n2. **Saag Aloo**: A spicy mustard green curry made with potatoes, onions, and garlic. The slight bitterness of the mustard greens will cut through the sweetness of Japchae.\n3. **Vegetable Biryani**: A flavorful and aromatic rice dish made with a mix of vegetables, basmati rice, and a blend of Indian spices.
