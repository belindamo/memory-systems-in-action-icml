  "content": "I'm excited to start watching **The Good Fight** and see Christine Baranski's performance as Diane Lockhart. I've heard great things about her character, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the show tackles real-world issues in a thoughtful and engaging way. Since I've been reading People magazine every week for the past three months, I appreciate how the show incorporates timely commentary on current events into its storylines. Can you recommend a few episodes from the earlier seasons that I should watch to get a better sense of Diane's character and the show's overall tone?",
