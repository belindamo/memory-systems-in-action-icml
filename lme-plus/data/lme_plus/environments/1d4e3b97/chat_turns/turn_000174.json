Here are some drink suggestions that would pair well with your meal:\n\n1. **Mango Lassi**: A popular Indian yogurt-based drink that's sweet, creamy, and refreshing. The mango flavor will complement the spices in the Chana Masala and Japchae.\n2. **Cucumber Lime Refresher**: A light and refreshing drink made with cucumber, lime juice, mint, and a touch of sugar. This drink will help cut the richness of the meal and provide a nice cooling effect.\n3. **Mint Tea**: A soothing and caffeine-free tea that's perfect for hot summer days. The mint flavor will help cool down the palate and prepare it for the next bite.\n4. **Iced Chai**: A spiced tea that's popular in India and the Middle East. You can make it with black tea, milk, and a blend of spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger. The spices will complement the flavors in the Chana Masala and Japchae.\n5. **Pomegranate Lemonade**: A fruity and refreshing drink made with pomegranate juice, lemonade, and a touch of sugar. The tartness of the lemonade will cut the sweetness of the pomegranate, creating a nice balance of flavors.\n6. **Ginger Ale with Lime**: A simple but effective drink that will help cut the richness of the meal. The ginger will also aid digestion and provide a nice warmth to the palate.\n\nThese drinks are all easy to make and can be adjusted to your taste preferences. You can also add a few slices of cucumber, lime, or orange to the drinks for garnish and extra flavor.\n\nRemember to serve the drinks in tall glasses with plenty of ice, so they stay cold and refreshing throughout the meal. Enjoy!",
