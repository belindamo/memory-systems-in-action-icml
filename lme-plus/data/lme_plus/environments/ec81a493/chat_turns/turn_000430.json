  "content": "That's a great plan! Using a gentle soap and water solution to clean the wooden shelves is a good starting point, and following up with a wood polish will help to add protection and shine. For the glass shelves, using a glass cleaner and a lint-free cloth is a good way to avoid streaks and residue.\n\nRemember to always read the instructions on the cleaning products you choose, and test them on a small, inconspicuous area first to make sure they won't damage the material.\n\nAlso, don't forget to dry the shelves thoroughly after cleaning to prevent water spots from forming. And if you have any stubborn stains or scratches, you can try using a stain remover or a scratch remover specifically designed for the type of material your bookshelf is made of.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with the cleaning, and I hope your bookshelf turns out looking great!",
