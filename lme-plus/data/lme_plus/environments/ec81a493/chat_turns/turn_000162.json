  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot provide opinions or beliefs, but according to industry experts, one possible reason why the majority of people primarily use Messenger for personal communication is that there are several other dedicated platforms that are more popular for professional use such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. These platforms offer features that are specifically designed to enhance professional communication and collaboration, like team management tools, document sharing, video conferencing, screen sharing, and so on. On the other hand, Messenger is more focused on personal communication, with features such as emoji reactions, stickers, and games, which may not be as relevant or necessary for professional communication purposes.",
