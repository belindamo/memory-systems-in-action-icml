But I'm happy to chat with you about Hadestown and its influences!\n\nAna\u00efs Mitchell, the creator of Hadestown, has mentioned that she drew inspiration from various sources, including folk music, blues, and Appalachian roots music. She's also cited influences from musical theater, literature, and mythology.\n\nIn terms of specific musicals or plays, Mitchell has mentioned being influenced by works like:\n\n1. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street - She's mentioned being inspired by Stephen Sondheim's complex, narrative-driven songwriting style.\n2. Jesus Christ Superstar - The rock opera's use of a modern, contemporary score to tell a classic story resonated with Mitchell's approach to Hadestown.\n3. Spring Awakening - The musical's themes of youthful rebellion, social commentary, and experimental storytelling likely influenced Hadestown's exploration of power dynamics and social justice.\n\nMitchell has also drawn inspiration from literary works like Margaret Atwood's The Penelopiad, which reimagines Homer's Odyssey from Penelope's perspective. This kind of feminist, reimagined storytelling is reflected in Hadestown's focus on the often-overlooked character of Persephone.\n\nThe show's director, Rachel Chavkin, has also mentioned influences from avant-garde and experimental theater, such as the work of Bertolt Brecht and the Wooster Group. This is evident in the show's use of unconventional storytelling, non-traditional staging, and emphasis on the ensemble.\n\nHadestown's unique blend of influences has resulted in a groundbreaking, genre-bending musical that feels both timeless and modern. I'm sure you'll enjoy the show when it comes to your city!",
