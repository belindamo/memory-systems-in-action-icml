Check if it's straight and parallel to the frame.\n3. **Use a hanger alignment tool**: If you have a derailleur hanger alignment tool (available at most bike shops or online), attach it to the hanger and the frame. The tool will help you determine if the hanger is bent or misaligned.\n4. **Check the derailleur's position**: Look at the derailleur's position relative to the cassette. The derailleur should be parallel to the cassette and the hanger should be in line with the cassette's centerline.\n\n**Adjusting Limit Screws:**\n\nLimit screws control the derailleur's movement and prevent the chain from shifting beyond the cassette's limits. There are two types of limit screws:\n\n1. **Low-limit screw (L-limit)**: Controls the derailleur's inward movement, preventing the chain from shifting into the spokes or the frame.\n2. **High-limit screw (H-limit)**: Controls the derailleur's outward movement, preventing the chain from shifting off the largest cog.\n\n**Adjusting the Limit Screws:**\n\n1. **Shift the chain to the smallest cog**: Move the chain to the smallest cog on the cassette to access the low-limit screw.\n2. **Locate the limit screws**: Find the low-limit screw (usually marked \"L\" or \"Low\") and high-limit screw (usually marked \"H\" or \"High\") on the derailleur.\n3. **Turn the limit screws clockwise**: Turn both limit screws clockwise to tighten them. This will reduce the derailleur's movement and prevent the chain from shifting beyond the cassette's limits.\n4. **Shift the chain to the largest cog**: Move the chain to the largest cog on the cassette to test the high-limit screw.\n5. **Check the chain's alignment**: Observe the chain's alignment with the cassette's teeth. If the chain is rubbing against the next cog or the derailleur, turn the high-limit screw counterclockwise to allow more clearance.\n6. **Repeat the process**: Repeat steps 3-5, adjusting the limit screws in small increments, until the chain shifts smoothly and quietly between gears.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make small adjustments (1/4 turn or less) to the limit screws and test the derailleur's movement after each adjustment.\n* If you're unsure or uncomfortable adjusting the limit screws, consider consulting your bike's manual or seeking help from a professional mechanic.\n* Keep in mind that adjusting the limit screws may require readjusting the derailleur's barrel adjuster, which controls the cable tension.\n\nRemember to be patient and methodical when troubleshooting and adjusting your derailleur. Good luck, and I hope you're able to resolve the issue!",
