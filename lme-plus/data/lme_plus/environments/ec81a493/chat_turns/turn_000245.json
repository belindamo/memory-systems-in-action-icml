Read the following additional material and give me 25 new ideas for posts \n\n\"The diagnosis rates of special conditions in general practice clinics and general pediatrics clinics in India is quite low. So patients are often referred to specialists quite late when the condition has already worsened. So it becomes important to enable general practice clinics with screening tools that can surface red flags for special conditions and alert the doctor. This must be accompanied by doctor-to-doctor specialist advice so local investigations and timely referrals can happen under expert advice. For straightforward cases, local treatment can happen under expert advice, with referrals limited to complicated cases. This benefits the patients with better outcomes due to early diagnosis and local treatment. It benefits the primary care clinic with patient retention, local investigations and local treatment, which add income to the clinic. It benefits specialists, too because they earn consultation fees from the doctor-to-doctor consultations (patient pays) and a referral pipeline for complicated cases. Inditech's screening tools and specialist advice systems cover many special conditions already and almost all specialties in pediatrics. Pharma brands also participate in Inditech programs (over 60 brands have done so so far) because Inditech programs help them to build superior value based relationships for the brands and their field representatives with doctors, which brands struggle with.\"",
