I'm happy to help you with some tips on how to keep them streak-free and clean!\n\nFirst, kudos to you for using the Windex and newspaper method! That's a classic technique that's been passed down through generations. Here are some additional tips to help you keep your mirrors sparkling:\n\n1. **Microfiber cloth**: Invest in a good-quality microfiber cloth, which is gentle on mirrors and effective at removing streaks and smudges.\n2. **Glass cleaner**: You can use a glass cleaner like Windex, but make sure to choose a streak-free or ammonia-free formula to avoid leaving residue.\n3. **Newspaper**: Yes, newspaper is still a great tool for cleaning mirrors! The ink won't transfer to the mirror, and it's a cost-effective option.\n4. **Dry the mirror**: After cleaning the mirror, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe it down and remove any excess moisture. This helps prevent streaks and water spots.\n5. **Avoid paper towels**: Paper towels can leave behind lint and streaks, so it's best to stick with microfiber cloths or newspaper.\n6. **Clean in a circular motion**: When cleaning the mirror, use a circular motion to wipe away dirt and grime. This helps prevent streaks and scratches.\n7. **Avoid using harsh chemicals**: Never use harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or scrubbers on your mirrors, as they can scratch the surface or leave behind residue.\n8. **Regular cleaning**: Clean your mirrors regularly to prevent dirt and grime from building up. This will make it easier to keep them streak-free and clean.\n9. **Use a mirror cleaning product**: If you want a specialized product, look for a mirror cleaning solution or a streak-free glass cleaner. These products are designed to leave your mirrors sparkling and streak-free.\n10. **Inspect and clean the mirror frames**: Don't forget to clean the mirror frames and surrounding areas, as dirt and grime can accumulate there too.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your bathroom mirrors streak-free and clean. Happy cleaning!",
