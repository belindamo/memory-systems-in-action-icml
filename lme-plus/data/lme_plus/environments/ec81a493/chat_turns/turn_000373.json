  "content": "I'm happy to help you with that! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal information or schedule. I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't retain any information about you or your appointments.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you get organized:\n\n1. Check your calendar: Look at your digital or physical calendar to see if you've written down your therapy appointments with Dr. Smith.\n2. Contact Dr. Smith's office: Reach out to Dr. Smith's office or receptionist to ask about your upcoming appointments. They should be able to provide you with the dates and times.\n3. Use a scheduling tool: Consider using a digital scheduling tool like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or a task management app like Trello or Todoist to keep track of your appointments and events.\n4. Create a routine: Try to establish a regular routine for your therapy appointments, such as scheduling them on the same day and time each week or month.\n\nRemember to take care of yourself and prioritize your mental health. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to talk to Dr. Smith about it during your next appointment!",
