Don't worry, I'm here to help you with both tasks.\n\n**Cleaning up the broken glass and debris:**\n\nBefore we dive into organizing your bookshelf, let's tackle the cleanup first. Here are some steps to help you remove the remaining dust and debris from the broken glass:\n\n1. **Safety first**: Wear protective gear like gloves, a face mask, and closed-toe shoes to avoid getting cut or inhaling glass particles.\n2. **Contain the area**: Use a broom or a dustpan to sweep up the larger pieces of glass. Try to contain the debris in a small area to prevent it from spreading.\n3. **Vacuum**: Use a vacuum cleaner with a gentle suction setting to pick up the smaller pieces of glass. Make sure to empty the vacuum cleaner's dustbin frequently to avoid spreading the glass particles.\n4. **Dampen the area**: Mix a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle. Spray the area to help prevent the glass dust from becoming airborne. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to wipe down the surrounding surfaces, including the coffee table and floor.\n5. **Use a lint roller or sticky roller**: These can help pick up any remaining glass particles or dust.\n6. **Disinfect**: Once you've removed as much of the glass as possible, disinfect the area with a gentle cleaning product to prevent any bacteria or germs from spreading.\n\n**Organizing your bookshelf and displaying decorative items:**\n\nNow, let's move on to organizing your bookshelf and finding a way to display your decorative items!\n\n1. **Purge and categorize**: Start by removing everything from your bookshelf and sorting items into categories (e.g., books, decorative items, photos, etc.).\n2. **Assign a home**: Decide which items you want to display and where you want to place them on the bookshelf. Group similar items together, and consider creating a focal point, like a decorative vase or a statement piece.\n3. **Use risers and shelves**: Use risers or additional shelves to create visual interest and separate different types of items. This will also help prevent overcrowding.\n4. **Balance and harmony**: Aim for a balanced look by distributing the weight and visual appeal of your decorative items across the bookshelf. You can also create a theme or color scheme to tie everything together.\n5. **Experiment and have fun**: Don't be afraid to try out different arrangements and see what looks best to you. You can always adjust as needed.\n\nSome popular ways to display decorative items on a bookshelf include:\n\n* Using decorative bookends to hold up smaller items or keep books organized\n* Placing a few choice items on a decorative tray or plate to create a vignette\n* Grouping similar items, like vintage vases or photo frames, together\n* Creating a focal point with a larger or statement piece, like a sculpture or a large vase\n\nFeel free to share more about your bookshelf and the decorative items you want to display, and I can offer more specific advice!",
