  "content": "That's a great approach! It's wonderful that you're getting requests for custom flavors - that's a great sign that customers are enthusiastic about your product and want more.\n\nIncreasing your production to 30-40 jars is a good move, as it will help you meet demand without sacrificing quality control. Small batches are essential for maintaining the quality and consistency of your jam, and it's great that you're prioritizing that.\n\nRemember to also take into account the time and effort it takes to prepare for the market, including labeling, packaging, and setting up your display. You might want to consider batching your tasks to make the process more efficient, such as preparing labels and packaging materials in advance, or setting up a more streamlined system for labeling and filling jars.\n\nAlso, have you considered collecting email addresses or contacts from customers who are interested in custom flavors or want to stay updated on your products? Building an email list or social media following can help you keep customers informed about new flavors, special promotions, or upcoming markets.\n\nLastly, are you planning on offering any special promotions or discounts for the next market, or will you be sticking to your regular pricing?",
