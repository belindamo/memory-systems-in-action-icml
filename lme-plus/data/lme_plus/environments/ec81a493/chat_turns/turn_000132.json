By doing so, you'll create a clear visual and aural language that helps the audience follow the narrative. The use of fade-to-black, lighting shifts, and sound cues will also add to the emotional impact of the scenes and create a sense of continuity between them.\n\n**Balancing Past and Present**\n\nYour approach to balancing the past and present is spot on. By ensuring that each flashback or memory serves a purpose in revealing character insights or deepening relationships, you'll avoid making the flashbacks feel gratuitous or unnecessary. Varying the pace and tone of the scenes will also help create a sense of flow and emotional resonance, keeping the audience engaged and invested in the story.\n\n**Pacing and Tone**\n\nYour idea of using a slower pace in the flashbacks to create a sense of introspection and nostalgia is a great one. This will help the audience absorb the emotional weight of the scenes and connect with the characters on a deeper level. By contrasting the pace and tone of the flashbacks with the present-day scenes, you'll create a sense of tension and urgency, propelling the narrative forward.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\nTo further enhance the non-linear narrative, consider the following:\n\n* Use repetition and motifs to create a sense of continuity between scenes. For example, you could use a recurring image, sound, or phrase to tie together different moments in the characters' lives.\n* Experiment with different narrative structures, such as using non-chronological ordering or circular storytelling. This will add complexity and depth to the narrative, keeping the audience engaged and curious.\n* Don't be afraid to leave some things unsaid or implied. The audience's imagination can fill in the gaps, making the story more personal and relatable.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, you'll create a rich, complex, and emotionally resonant play that will leave a lasting impact on your audience.\n\nHow do you plan to use repetition and motifs to create a sense of continuity between scenes, and what kind of narrative structure are you considering for your play?",
