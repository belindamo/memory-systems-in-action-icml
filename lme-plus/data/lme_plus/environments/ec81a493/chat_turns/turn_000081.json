That's always a great motivator to keep doing what you're doing. Did you get any feedback on the flavor or texture of the jam, or was it more general comments about the product overall?\n\nAlso, since you sold out quickly, are you planning on increasing your production for the next market, or do you want to keep your batches small and exclusive?",
