Write about how Inditech expands the benefits by its associated education, specialist advice etc. \n\n\"General Practice clinics in India have the following problems-\nPatients do not come to the clinic for timely intervention.\nGeneral practitioners are not able to diagnose or treat special conditions.\nGeneral practice clinics don't offer preventive, monitoring or management services for non-communicable diseases and chronic conditions.\n\nWe bring early detection and specialized capabilities to primary care clinics by-\nBringing education to doctors from leading experts and academies.\nBringing in-clinic education, screening tools, red-flag alerts, and doctor-to-doctor specialist advice.\nBringing specialized services to the clinic to prevent and manage chronic conditions.\nInditech delivers professional education for doctors from India's leading experts and is endorsed by medical academies. Inditech delivers education in all the standard formats-\ncertificate online education modules\nonline, offline and hybrid classroom education\nworkshops and case study clinics\n\nInditech enables practical use for the academy-endorsed education by extending it into general practice clinics for early detection and intervention. \nshort format education on red flags for various special conditions, suitable for in-clinic distribution and consumption\nDoctor-personalized multilingual patient screening tools, which report red flags to the doctors\nScreening tools for use by the doctor to identify red flags \n\nInditech makes practical education actionable as follows-\nWhen a red flag is noticed, the general practice clinic will have a doctor-to-doctor specialist advice available to investigate and treat locally under expert advice or make a timely referral to the specialist.\nConnect specialized digital therapeutics services to the general practice clinic to prevent, monitor and manage chronic conditions and non-communicable diseases.\nInditech leverages its vast and deep connections with experts and medical academies to create the above solutions, and works with pharma brands to distribute them to general practice clinics and also uses pharma companies to recruit specialists for the doctor-to-doctor specialist advice system.\n\nPharma brands in India spend most of their marketing and sales budgets on enhancing the quality of their relationships with doctors and specialists. They use these relationships to build brand equity, brand salience and brand loyalty in the community of doctors. But brands find building value-based relationships with doctors challenging because their field representatives could be more talented. Their value-based activities for doctors are mostly limited to hosting or sponsoring professional education events. In addition, there is a need for differentiation from competing pharma brands.\n\nInditech's solutions represent a win-win opportunity, wherein brands can partner with Inditechfor their therapy areas. They can become the distribution or promotion partners for Inditech's services for the doctors/clinics they target. They can also become the recruitment partner for specialists in specific therapy areas for a region. This helps them to bring high and differentiated value to the doctors. Inditech also benefits by revenue, where the pharma brand partner pays Inditech a fee for each doctor served under the partnership.\"",
