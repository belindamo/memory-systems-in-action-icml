They're known for their creative combinations and fresh ingredients.\n2. **Cafe Fines Herb**: They offer a few light bites, such as toast, salads, and quiches, but their focus is more on coffee and pastries. If you're looking for a heartier lunch, this might not be the best option.\n3. **Hewn Bakery & Cafe**: They have a more extensive lunch menu, featuring sandwiches, salads, and soups, as well as some delicious sweet and savory pastries. They're known for their artisanal bread and high-quality ingredients.\n4. **Pilsen Coffee Company**: They have a limited food menu, mostly consisting of pastries, muffins, and sandwiches. They're more focused on their coffee, but their sandwiches are made with high-quality ingredients.\n5. **Maison Parisienne**: They offer a more extensive lunch menu, featuring French-inspired dishes like quiches, croissants, and sandwiches, as well as some sweet treats like crepes and macarons.\n\nIf you're looking for a more substantial lunch, Hewn Bakery & Cafe or Maison Parisienne might be good options. If you're in the mood for something lighter, Lulabelle's or Pilsen Coffee Company could be a good choice.\n\nKeep in mind that menus can change, so it's always a good idea to check their websites or social media for the most up-to-date offerings.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm still keeping my fingers crossed that one of these cafes might be the one you're thinking of!",
