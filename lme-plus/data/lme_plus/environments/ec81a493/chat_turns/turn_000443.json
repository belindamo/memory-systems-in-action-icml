Choice B is probably original research. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n250\nTHE ANSWER IS A. CDS has shown benefits in diagnosis, treatment guidelines, clinical pathway adherence. Unfortunately, data on patient outcomes, physician efficiency and errors in data entry are lacking. (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n251\nTHE ANSWER IS C. An outcome measure describes a real-world patient benefit. Using an appropriate drug-drug interaction checker, maintaining an accurate active medication list would be expected to reduce the number of drug-drug interactions. Choice B is a process measure, not an outcome measure. Choices A and D are possible benefits of maintaining an active medication list, but are not as good as choice C. (REF 2.3.3 Quality Improvement)\n252\nTHE ANSWER IS A. A milestone is a zero-length task meant to signify completion of some part of a project. Slack (or float) is the degree to which a task can be delayed without delaying the end of the project. A summary task is an overarching structure that includes other tasks. In this diagram, the line that reads \u201cProject 15\u201d is a summary task. A start-start dependency describes the situation where one task can not start until another one starts. (REF: Section 4.4.4 Project Management Tools)\n253\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Distributive bargaining is encountered when there is a fixed amount of resources that must be split among all parties, such as when buyer and seller haggle over a price. Choice A involves litigation, which is not a form of negotiation or alternative dispute resolution. Choice B and C are much more likely to be examples of integrative bargaining. (REF: Section 4.1.3 - Negotiation)\n254\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Real time communication, such as interactive video, is a form of synchronous communication. This is distinguished from asynchronous communication where the sender and receiver may not be utilizing the system at the same time. Remote monitoring is usually synchronous, where the remote provider is able to view a live stream of monitoring equipment. Store-and-forward is an asynchronous technique where the data file is stored on a server and forwarded to another server to provide care. (REF 3.3.4 - Telemedicine)\n255\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Sensitivity. Sensitivity is the probability of a test giving a true positive if we know a patient has a disease. Similarly, Specificity is the probability that a test will be negative in patients without the disease.\u00a0 Positive Predictive Value and Negative predictive value measure the likelihood a patient will have a disease (or not) given a positive or negative test. (REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n256\nTHE ANSWER IS D. This represents a finish-to-finish dependency. Task B can not be finished until task A is finished. The easy way to remember this is that the arrowhead determines the task that is constrained. The location of the arrow determines if the dependency applies to the finish or the start. In our case, the network update finish is constrained by the finish of the rewiring project. Choices A and C are essentially the same. Choice B represents a finish-to-start dependency. (REF: Section 4.4.3 Project Management Resource Allocation)\n257\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Data stewardship includes many processes, including those that ensure that the right data is stored in the right place in the database so that users can get to it easily. The stem provides an example of data which is not being stored in the appropriate field, which may hinder future access. Correcting this behavior is an example of data stewardship. Referential Integrity is a characteristic of a database that indicates that all rows which refer to other rows in other tables are valid. Usability refers to the ease with which a user interacts with a system. Syntax is the collection of grammatical rules that defines a well-formed statement in a given language. (REF: 3.5.5 - Clinical information system maintenance)\n258\nTHE ANSWER IS A. ICD-10 supplanted ICD-9 as the most commonly used method of encoding diagnoses in 2016. Both versions are hierarchical and include codes for external causes (e.g. V-codes in ICD-9). ICD-10 allows for greater specificity by including codes for laterality and visit type. (REF: 3.4.5. Nomenclatures, vocabularies, and terminologies)\n259\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Telepresence, which is the simulation of a remote environment, requires immediate feedback to be successful. Messaging, and to a lesser extent, telephone can tolerate latency much better. Remote monitoring tends to have less bandwidth requirement than telepresence. \n260\nTHE ANSWER IS C. User centered design should consider user goals, motivations, and environment throughout the design and development phases. Relying solely on market research or organizational benchmarks will not yield enough useful information. Design should be optimized for all users, not just patients.\u00a0 (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)",
