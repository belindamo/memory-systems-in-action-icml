Reframing negative thoughts and practicing self-compassion are essential skills for building resilience and promoting emotional well-being.\n\n**Reframing Negative Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Become aware of negative self-talk**: Notice when you're thinking critical or harsh thoughts about yourself. These thoughts often start with \"I'm not good enough,\" \"I'm a failure,\" or \"I'm unworthy.\"\n2. **Challenge negative thoughts**: Ask yourself if these thoughts are based on facts or if they're exaggerated. Would you say these things to a friend in a similar situation? Probably not.\n3. **Reframe negative thoughts in a more realistic and compassionate way**: Replace negative thoughts with more balanced, realistic ones. For example, \"I made a mistake, but I can learn from it\" or \"I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.\"\n4. **Practice mindfulness**: Focus on the present moment and let go of thoughts about the past or worries about the future. Mindfulness can help you develop a non-judgmental attitude towards yourself.\n\n**Self-Compassion:**\n\n1. **Treat yourself with kindness**: Be gentle, understanding, and supportive with yourself, just as you would with a good friend. Remember that everyone makes mistakes and has flaws.\n2. **Acknowledge your common humanity**: Recognize that you're not alone in your struggles and that others have faced similar challenges.\n3. **Practice self-care**: Engage in activities that bring you comfort, joy, and relaxation, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to soothing music.\n4. **Develop a growth mindset**: View challenges and setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as threats to your ego.\n\n**Specific to Your Situation:**\n\n1. **Allow yourself to feel your emotions**: It's okay to feel hurt, angry, or sad about the falling out with your friend. Acknowledge these emotions and give yourself permission to process them.\n2. **Focus on what you can control**: Instead of dwelling on what your friend did or didn't do, focus on your own actions and reactions. What can you learn from the situation, and how can you grow as a result?\n3. **Practice forgiveness**: Forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting what happened or excusing your friend's behavior. It means letting go of the negative emotions associated with the situation and moving forward with compassion and understanding.\n\nRemember that reframing negative thoughts and practicing self-compassion take time and practice. Be patient and gentle with yourself as you work through these exercises.\n\nI hope these tips help you cultivate a more compassionate and realistic mindset. If you need further guidance or support, consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a trusted friend or family member.",
