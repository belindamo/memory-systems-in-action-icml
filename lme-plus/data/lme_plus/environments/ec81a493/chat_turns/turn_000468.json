Start with a small amount:** Begin with 1-2 chews every 30-45 minutes to see how your body reacts. You can adjust the amount based on your individual needs and the intensity of your ride.\n\n**2. Consume with water:** Take energy chews with water to help with digestion and electrolyte absorption. Aim to drink 1-2 ounces of water with each serving.\n\n**3. Choose the right flavor:** Select a flavor you enjoy, as this will make it more likely that you'll consume them regularly during your ride.\n\n**4. Store them correctly:** Keep energy chews in a convenient, easily accessible spot on your bike or in your jersey pocket. Avoid exposing them to extreme temperatures or humidity.\n\n**5. Use them at the right time:** Consume energy chews when you start to feel fatigued or when you're approaching a challenging section of your ride.\n\n**6. Chew and swallow:** Make sure to chew each piece thoroughly before swallowing to aid digestion.\n\n**7. Don't overdo it:** While energy chews can provide a quick energy boost, don't rely solely on them for fueling. Make sure to eat a balanced meal or snack before your ride and refuel with a meal or snack within 30-60 minutes after your ride.\n\n**8. Experiment with different brands and flavors:** Find the product that works best for you and your stomach. You may need to try a few different brands and flavors before finding the one that agrees with you.\n\n**9. Consider your electrolyte needs:** If you're riding in hot or humid conditions, look for energy chews that contain electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium to help regulate fluid balance.\n\n**10. Practice makes perfect:** Experiment with energy chews during shorter rides to get used to consuming them on the bike. This will help you develop a routine and ensure you're comfortable using them during longer rides.\n\nBy following these tips, you can effectively use energy chews to fuel your body and optimize your performance during your ride. Happy cycling!",
