  "content": "I think I'll start by expressing my gratitude to my friend for being such a constant presence in my life. I'll share a special memory that highlights our friendship, like the time we went on a spontaneous road trip together. Then, I'll acknowledge her importance in my life and how she's helped me grow as a person. I'll also include some funny moments, like the time we accidentally ordered a ridiculously spicy dish at a restaurant. Finally, I'll close the letter with a message of love and appreciation, and express my hope for many more years of friendship.",
