But I'm thrilled to hear that you're enjoying the Hamilton soundtrack and learning the lyrics!\n\nHamilton is an incredible musical that has had a profound impact on the world of theater and beyond. Lin-Manuel Miranda's innovative blend of hip-hop, jazz, blues, and R&B has brought a new level of diversity and excitement to the Broadway stage.\n\nIt's great that you're having so much fun with the soundtrack, and I'm sure your friends will be impressed by your lyrical skills! If you're interested in exploring more of Lin-Manuel Miranda's work, you might want to check out his other projects, such as In the Heights, Freestyle Love Supreme, or the music from the Disney movie Encanto.\n\nRemember to keep an eye out for Hadestown when it comes to your city, and I hope you'll enjoy the show!",
