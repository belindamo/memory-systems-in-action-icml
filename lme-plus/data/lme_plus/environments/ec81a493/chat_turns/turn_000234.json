  "content": "I think there's been another mix-up! The 2020 Tony Awards ceremony was actually postponed due to the pandemic and didn't take place until 2021. The ceremony that honored the 2019-2020 Broadway season took place on September 26, 2021.\n\nHowever, I completely agree with you about the impact of the pandemic on the theater community. The pandemic has been devastating for the live entertainment industry, and the loss of talented artists like Nick Cordero has been a tragedy.\n\nThe Tony Awards ceremony did pay tribute to Cordero and other members of the theater community who were lost during the pandemic, and it was a powerful and emotional moment. The ceremony was a celebration of the resilience and strength of the theater community, and it was a reminder of the importance of live theater in bringing people together and providing a sense of community and connection.\n\nI'm glad we could have this conversation, and I hope you enjoy Hadestown when it comes to your city!",
