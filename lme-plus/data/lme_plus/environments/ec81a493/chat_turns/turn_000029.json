Here's a step-by-step guide to help you:\n\n1. **Log in to your email account**: Open your email provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) and log in to your account.\n2. **Search for order confirmations**: Type keywords like \"order confirmation,\" \"shipment,\" \"receipt,\" \"Amazon,\" or \"ASOS\" in the search bar to find relevant emails.\n3. **Filter by date**: Use the date filter to narrow down the search to the last week. This will show you only the emails from the past 7 days.\n4. **Open each email**: Open each order confirmation email and take note of the following:\n\t* Date of purchase\n\t* Retailer (Amazon, ASOS, etc.)\n\t* Item(s) purchased\n\t* Total cost (including shipping and taxes)\n5. **Make a list**: Create a list or table to organize the information from each email. You can use a spreadsheet, a note-taking app, or even a piece of paper.\n\nExample:\n\n| Date | Retailer | Item(s) | Total Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023-02-15 | Amazon | Book, T-shirt | $35.99 |\n| 2023-02-17 | ASOS | Jeans, Top | $60.00 |\n\nBy doing this, you'll have a clear picture of your online purchases from the last week. You can then use this information to:\n\n* Track your spending habits\n* Identify areas where you can cut back\n* Make more informed purchasing decisions in the future\n\nRemember to also check your email's \"Promotions\" or \"Updates\" tabs, as some retailers might send order confirmations and updates to these folders.\n\nIf you need help with anything or want to explore other methods, feel free to ask!",
