Here's why:\n\n**Why engagement is more important**:\n\n1. **Quality over quantity**: Having a smaller, engaged audience is more valuable than having a large, inactive following.\n2. **Algorithmic love**: Instagram's algorithm favors accounts with high engagement rates, making your content more visible to your audience.\n3. **Conversions and sales**: Engagement is a stronger indicator of interest and intent, leading to more conversions and sales.\n4. **Brand loyalty**: Engaged followers are more likely to become loyal fans and advocates for your brand.\n\n**Why follower count isn't everything**:\n\n1. **Fake followers**: A large following can be inflated by fake or inactive accounts, which don't contribute to engagement or conversions.\n2. ** Vanity metric**: Follower count is a vanity metric that doesn't necessarily translate to engagement or revenue.\n3. **Difficulty in maintaining**: Growing a large following requires significant effort and resources, which can be challenging to maintain.\n\n**How to increase engagement**:\n\n1. **Create high-quality content**: Focus on producing content that resonates with your audience and encourages interaction.\n2. **Encourage conversation**: Ask questions, ask for feedback, or ask followers to share their experiences.\n3. **Respond to comments**: Engage with your audience by responding to comments and messages.\n4. **Use Instagram Stories**: Leverage Instagram Stories to share behind-the-scenes content, sneak peeks, and exclusive deals.\n5. **Collaborate with influencers**: Partner with influencers or other accounts in your niche to reach a wider audience and increase engagement.\n\n**When to focus on growing your follower count**:\n\n1. **New account**: If you're just starting out, focus on growing your follower count to establish a foundation for engagement.\n2. **Niche or industry**: If you're in a highly competitive niche or industry, growing your follower count can help you stay competitive.\n3. **Brand awareness**: If you're looking to increase brand awareness, growing your follower count can help you reach a wider audience.\n\nIn your case, since you already have an established presence on Instagram, I'd recommend focusing on increasing engagement on your existing posts. This will help you build a loyal community, drive conversions, and ultimately, grow your business.",
