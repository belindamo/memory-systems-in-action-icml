  "content": "Cleaning the fan is a great place to start, and it's often the simplest solution.\n\nRegarding the lifespan of bathroom fans, yes, the 5-10 year average lifespan can vary depending on several factors, including:\n\n1. **Usage**: If the fan is used extensively, such as in a large family or in a bathroom with poor ventilation, its lifespan might be shorter.\n2. **Quality of the fan**: A high-quality fan with a robust motor and durable materials can last longer than a cheaper, lower-quality option.\n3. **Maintenance**: Regular cleaning and maintenance can help extend the fan's lifespan. Neglecting maintenance can reduce its lifespan.\n4. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to moisture, humidity, and extreme temperatures can affect the fan's performance and lifespan.\n5. **Type of fan**: Different types of fans, such as inline fans, ceiling fans, or exhaust fans, may have varying lifespans.\n6. **Power usage**: Fans with higher CFM (cubic feet per minute) ratings or those that run continuously might have a shorter lifespan compared to those with lower CFM ratings or intermittent use.\n\nHere are some general guidelines for the average lifespan of different types of bathroom fans:\n\n* **Basic, low-CFM fans**: 5-7 years\n* **Mid-range, standard-CFM fans**: 7-10 years\n* **High-CFM fans or those with advanced features**: 10-15 years\n* **High-end, premium fans with advanced materials and features**: 15-20 years or more\n\nKeep in mind that these are general estimates, and the actual lifespan of your bathroom fan will depend on the specific factors mentioned above.\n\nAfter cleaning the fan, if you're still experiencing issues, it might be worth considering replacing it, especially if it's approaching or has exceeded its expected lifespan.\n\nLet me know how the cleaning process goes, and if you have any further questions or concerns!",
