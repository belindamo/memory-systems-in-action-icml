  "content": "Lulabelle's and Hewn Bakery & Cafe are both great options, and it's definitely worth asking about their interior design or decor. If you're trying to figure out if it's the cafe you visited with Rachel, asking about their design elements could be a great way to jog your memory.\n\nWhen you visit Lulabelle's and Hewn Bakery & Cafe, feel free to ask the staff or management about their design inspiration, the age of the cafe, or any distinctive features they're particularly proud of. You could ask questions like:\n\n* \"I love the interior design of your cafe! Who designed it, and what was the inspiration behind the aesthetic?\"\n* \"How long has this cafe been open? I'm trying to figure out if I've been here before.\"\n* \"What's the story behind that unique piece of artwork/installation/light fixture? It really caught my eye.\"\n* \"I'm trying to remember if I've been to this cafe before. Do you have any distinctive features or decor that might help me place it?\"\n\nBy asking these questions, you might get some insight into whether it's the cafe you're thinking of. Even if it's not, you'll likely get some interesting information about the cafe's design and history!\n\nRemember to be friendly and polite when asking your questions. Cafe staff are often happy to share their knowledge and passion for their space, and they might even offer you a behind-the-scenes tour or insider tips.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find the cafe you're thinking of!",
