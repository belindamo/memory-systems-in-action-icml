  "content": "Creating a table with relevant ranking criteria can indeed help convey the various aspects and complexity of each category more effectively. Please note that the scores assigned to each criterion will still be subjective, but it can provide a better illustration of the categories' complexities. Here's an example table with four criteria: information processing, abstraction, interconnectedness, and anthropological complexity.\n\n| Category | Information Processing | Abstraction | Interconnectedness | Anthropological Complexity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Invent/Create | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 |\n| Teach | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 |\n| Make/Transform | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |\n| Grow | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 |\n| Move/Take | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| Fix/Heal | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |\n| Promote/Sell | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 |\n| Store | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| Protect/Maintain | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 |\n| Help | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |\n| Understand | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 |\n| Worship | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 |\n| Entertain | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 |\n| Coordinate/Organize | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 |\n\nIn this example, the scores range from 1 to 5, with 1 representing the lowest level of complexity or relevance and 5 representing the highest. The table presents a more nuanced perspective of the categories' complexities and the various aspects they encompass.\n\nKeep in mind that the scores provided here are still subjective and may not capture the exact intricacies of each category in every context. However, the table format offers a clearer illustration of how the categories can be compared across multiple criteria.",
