Organizing the literature can be a challenging task, but it's great that you're taking the time to do it thoroughly.\n\nIt's interesting that you started working on the literature review chapter after submitting your proposal. That's a common approach, as the proposal provides a solid foundation for your research, and the literature review helps to further develop your research question, objectives, and methodology.\n\nRemember to take breaks and pace yourself as you work on your literature review. It's a complex and time-consuming task, but the end result will be worth it. Don't hesitate to reach out to your supervisor or peers for guidance and feedback along the way.\n\nNow that you've made progress on your literature review, you might want to start thinking about the next steps in your thesis journey. Are you planning to start working on your methodology chapter soon? Or do you need to conduct some pilot studies or data collection before moving forward?",
