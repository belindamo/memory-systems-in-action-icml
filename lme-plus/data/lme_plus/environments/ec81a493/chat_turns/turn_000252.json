Here are a few open-ended questions you could consider asking C-level executives in the B2B SaaS space:\n\n1. What challenges is your company currently facing in terms of growth and scaling your business? How are you addressing these challenges?\n2. How do you envision the future of your industry, and how is your company positioning itself to succeed in this future landscape?\n3. What factors do you consider when evaluating new technologies or partnerships to support your business?\n4. Can you share any examples of how your company has successfully navigated industry disruption or change?\n5. How do you measure the success of your business, and what metrics do you use to inform decision-making?\n\nI hope these questions give you some ideas for how to connect with C-level executives and provide valuable insights through your content. Remember to also consider the specific needs and challenges of your target audience, and tailor your content accordingly.",
