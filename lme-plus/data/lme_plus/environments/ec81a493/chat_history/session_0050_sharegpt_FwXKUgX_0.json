Growing up in a family that valued education and public service, he developed a strong passion for healthcare and technology from a young age. This passion led him to pursue a career in medicine, with a focus on using technology to improve patient care and outcomes.\n\nDr. Reider attended Cornell University, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry in 1987. He then went on to attend the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, where he earned his Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree in 1991. During his time at Einstein, Dr. Reider became increasingly interested in family medicine and primary care, which ultimately influenced his decision to complete a residency in Family Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) from 1991 to 1994.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nAfter completing his residency, Dr. Reider returned to his hometown of Albany and began practicing family medicine. He quickly became an advocate for the integration of technology and electronic health records (EHRs) into primary care settings, recognizing the potential to enhance patient care and streamline clinical workflows. This advocacy led him to become an active member of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), where he earned the designation of Fellow (FAAFP).\n\nIn 2003, Dr. Reider took on a new role as the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at Allscripts, a leading EHR vendor. In this position, he helped to drive the development of innovative EHR solutions for physicians, contributing to the advancement of healthcare technology. He continued to work in health IT leadership positions, serving as the CMO at RelayHealth and Medscape, before joining the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) in 2012.\n\nAt ONC, Dr. Reider played a significant role in shaping national health IT policy, serving as the Acting National Coordinator for Health IT from 2013 to 2014. During his tenure, he worked to promote interoperability, data sharing, and patient engagement, helping to drive the adoption of EHRs nationwide.\n\nAfter leaving the ONC, Dr. Reider co-founded Kyron, Inc., a health IT consulting firm focused on improving the design, implementation, and usability of EHRs. As CEO, he has worked with healthcare organizations across the country to optimize their technology investments and advance the quality of patient care.\n\nPublications, Awards, and Memberships\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Reider has been an active contributor to the healthcare and health IT communities. He has authored numerous articles and book chapters on topics such as EHR usability, patient engagement, and health IT policy. He has also been a sought-after speaker at conferences and events, sharing his insights and expertise with audiences around the world.\n\nDr. Reider has received numerous awards and recognitions for his work in healthcare and health IT, including the HIMSS Physician IT Leadership Award and the John Chaffee Award for Leadership in Healthcare Informatics. In addition to his FAAFP designation, he is a member of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).\n\nPersonal Life\n\nOutside of his professional life, Dr. Reider is a devoted husband and father. He is married to his wife, Elizabeth, and they have two children, Emily and Benjamin. Dr. Reider enjoys spending time with his family, traveling, and exploring the great outdoors.
