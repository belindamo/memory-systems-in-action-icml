  "content": "It is not advisable to get a facial when you have a severe sunburn. Sunburn indicates that your skin is inflamed, and getting a facial in such a state may further aggravate your skin, causing pain, discomfort, and even more severe damage to your skin.\n\nWhen you have a sunburn, your skin is more sensitive and can easily become irritated by the products and techniques used during a facial. The heat from the steam and warm towels can cause more discomfort, and the exfoliating or cleansing products may be too harsh for your damaged skin. The pressure applied during a facial massage may also be too painful.\n\nIt is advisable to wait until your sunburn has completely healed before getting a facial. In the meantime, it's important to treat your sunburn with gentle care, stay hydrated, and use a good quality after-sun soothing lotion to encourage the healing process. If you have significant pain or blistering, it may be best to consult a healthcare professional for advice on how to best care for your sunburn.",
