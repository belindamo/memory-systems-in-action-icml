I'm also happy to hear that you're recovering well from your gallbladder removal surgery. Since I had a persistent cough for about three weeks in February, which led me to visit my primary care physician, Dr. Smith, on February 22nd, I'm interested in learning more about coughs and how to manage them. Can you tell me more about the different types of coughs and how to differentiate between them?",
