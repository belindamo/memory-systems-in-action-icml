  "content": "I've been craving savory snacks a lot lately, especially since I got back from my trip to Japan three weeks ago. I think it's because I got hooked on those delicious rice crackers they have at the convenience stores there. Anyway, I've been looking for some new snack ideas that aren't nuts. Do you have any suggestions for store-bought savory snacks that I can easily grab at the health food store near my office?",
