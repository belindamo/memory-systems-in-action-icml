Keep your back straight and your core tight, and hold the position for as long as you can.\n\n2. Cat-Cow Stretch: This stretch helps to elongate and strengthen the spinal muscles. Begin on all fours with your hands placed directly under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Inhale and arch your back, lifting your head and tailbone to the ceiling. Then exhale and round your spine, tucking in your chin and tailbone.\n\n3. Wall Angels: Stand with your back against a wall and raise your arms straight up to form a \"Y\" shape. Slowly lower your arms down to your sides while keeping your back against the wall. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n\n4. Bird Dog: This exercise is great for strengthening the core muscles and improving overall posture. Begin on all fours with your hands and knees on the ground.
