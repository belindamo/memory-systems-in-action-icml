  "content": "Yes, certain medications and medical conditions can make an individual more susceptible to adverse reactions during a facial. For example, individuals who are taking medications that thin their blood, such as aspirin or Warfarin, may be at greater risk for bruising or swelling after facial treatments. Additionally, individuals with medical conditions such as rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis may be more prone to skin irritation from certain facial ingredients or treatments.\n\nIn these cases, it is important for the individual to inform their esthetician about their medical history, any medication they are taking, and any known allergies or sensitivities they may have. The esthetician can then assess the individual's skin and create a customized facial treatment that takes into account any potential risks or sensitivities.\n\nSome precautions that may be taken include using gentle or hypoallergenic products, avoiding aggressive exfoliation or extractions, and utilizing cooling or anti-inflammatory ingredients to minimize the risk of irritation or inflammation. The individual may also be advised to avoid certain treatments, such as chemical peels or microdermabrasion, until their medical condition or medication use has been stabilized.",
