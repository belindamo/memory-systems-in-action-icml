I'm a text-based AI assistant, and our conversation just started, so I don't have any information about your specific rehearsal schedule.\n\nYou might want to check your calendar, email, or contact the director or production team to confirm the rehearsal time for Thursday. Once you have the rehearsal time, you can plan your morning accordingly to grab your iced latte at The Daily Grind before heading to the theater.\n\nIf you need help with anything else, feel free to ask!",
