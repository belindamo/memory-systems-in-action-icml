  "content": "It's best to avoid getting a facial if you have an active cold sore outbreak. Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and are highly contagious. The virus can easily spread to other areas of the face or to other people, even when the cold sore is not visible.\n\nDuring a facial, the esthetician uses various tools and products that can cause minor trauma to the skin, which may exacerbate the cold sore outbreak. Additionally, many facial treatments involve massage or pressure, which can be painful and uncomfortable for those with sensitive skin or a cold sore outbreak.\n\nIf you have an active cold sore outbreak, it's best to wait until the cold sore has completely healed before getting a facial. You should also avoid touching the affected area or applying makeup to it during this time, as this can further spread the virus.\n\nTo manage the cold sore outbreak, you can use topical antiviral creams or oral antiviral medications. You should also practice good hygiene by washing your hands frequently and using a separate towel or utensils from others during the outbreak. With proper care, most cold sores will heal on their own within 1-2 weeks.",
