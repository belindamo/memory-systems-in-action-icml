However, it's important to keep in mind that performing just one or two exercises may not be enough to see significant improvement in your posture and back pain.\n\nIt's recommended to incorporate a combination of exercises that target different muscle groups and motion patterns to help improve your overall strength and stability. If you're short on time, you could try to perform a quick 10-15 minute routine that includes a few different exercises, such as planks, bird dogs, and hip flexor stretches.\n\nRemember that consistency is key when it comes to exercise, so even a little bit of movement each day can make a difference. Additionally, making small tweaks to your daily habits, such as avoiding slouching and taking frequent breaks to stretch, can also help improve your posture over time.",
