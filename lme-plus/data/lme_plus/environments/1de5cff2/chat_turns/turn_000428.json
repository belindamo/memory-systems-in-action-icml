Here are some tips on composition and technique to help you make the most of shooting in tight spaces:\n\n**Composition:**\n\n1. **Get close**: With a wide-angle lens, you can get up close and personal with your subjects. This will help to eliminate distractions and create a sense of intimacy.\n2. **Look for layers**: Tight spaces often have multiple layers of activity. Look for opportunities to capture multiple subjects or elements in the frame, creating depth and visual interest.\n3. **Use leading lines**: Leading lines can help guide the viewer's eye through the frame, especially in tight spaces. Look for lines on the ground, stairs, or architecture to lead the viewer's attention.\n4. **Play with negative space**: Don't be afraid to use negative space to create a sense of simplicity and focus attention on your subject.\n5. **Capture moments of interaction**: Tight spaces often lead to interesting interactions between people. Look for moments of connection, conversation, or conflict.\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. **Shoot from the hip**: When shooting in tight spaces, it can be helpful to shoot from the hip to avoid drawing attention to yourself. This will also help you to anticipate and capture moments more quickly.\n2. **Zone focusing**: With a wide-angle lens, you may need to adjust your focus to compensate for the increased depth of field. Use zone focusing to pre-focus on a specific area and wait for your subject to enter the zone.\n3. **Shoot in continuous mode**: When shooting in busy areas, continuous mode can help you capture the perfect moment. Just be mindful of your buffer size and memory card capacity.\n4. **Pay attention to lighting**: Tight spaces often have interesting lighting conditions. Look for opportunities to incorporate natural light, shadows, or artificial light sources to add depth and mood to your images.\n5. **Be mindful of your surroundings**: Always be aware of your surroundings and the people around you. Be respectful of your subjects and avoid getting in the way or causing a disturbance.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you shoot in tight spaces, the more comfortable you'll become with anticipating and capturing moments.\n2. **Experiment with different angles**: Don't be afraid to get low, climb high, or shoot from unusual vantage points to add variety to your shots.\n3. **Stay patient and observant**: Street photography often requires patience and attention to detail. Take your time to observe the scene and wait for the right moment to capture.\n\nI hope these tips help you make the most of your Tamron 24mm lens and tight spaces!",
