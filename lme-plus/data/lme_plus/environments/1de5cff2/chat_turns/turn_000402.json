Is it boredom, stress, or emotional eating? Once you know your triggers, you can develop a plan to tackle them.\n2. **Hunger vs. Cravings**: Distinguish between hunger and cravings.

Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n4. **Find Healthy Distractions**: Engage in activities like going for a walk, practicing yoga, or reading a book to distract yourself from sugar cravings.\n5. **Gradual Reduction**: If you're used to consuming high amounts of sugar, try gradually reducing your intake over time to give your taste buds time to adjust.\n\n**Bakery Temptations:**\n\n1. **Avoid Impulse Buys**: Try to avoid buying sweets on impulse, especially when you're feeling stressed or emotional.\n2. **Plan Ahead**: If you know you'll be near a bakery, plan ahead by packing healthier snacks or meals.\n3. **Choose Wisely**: If you do indulge, choose a smaller portion or a healthier option like a fruit tart or a savory pastry.\n\nRemember, it takes time and effort to develop new habits and reduce sugar cravings.
