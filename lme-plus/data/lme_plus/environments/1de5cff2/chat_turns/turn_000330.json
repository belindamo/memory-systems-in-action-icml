  "content": "Sourdough sandwiches are an excellent idea! The tangy, slightly sour flavor of the bread will provide a great contrast to the sweet treats. Here are some filling suggestions that would complement the flavors of the matcha tiramisu and salted caramel chocolate tart:\n\n1. **Smoked Salmon with Cream Cheese and Pickled Ginger**: The smokiness of the salmon will pair nicely with the bright, grassy flavor of matcha. The cream cheese will add a richness, while the pickled ginger will provide a nice acidity.\n2. **Caramelized Onion and Brie**: Sweet, caramelized onions will complement the salted caramel chocolate tart, while the creamy brie cheese will tie in with the richness of the chocolate.\n3. **Roasted Turkey with Fig Jam and Arugula**: The sweetness of the fig jam will pair nicely with the matcha tiramisu, while the peppery flavor of the arugula will cut through the richness of the chocolate tart.\n4. **Grilled Chicken with Apple and Mustard**: The sweetness of the apple will complement the caramel flavors, while the tangy mustard will tie in with the sourdough bread.\n5. **Prosciutto and Pear with Honey**: The salty, savory prosciutto will provide a nice contrast to the sweet treats, while the sweetness of the pear and honey will tie in with the caramel and matcha flavors.\n6. **Egg Salad with Pickled Carrots and Chives**: A classic egg salad with a twist! The pickled carrots will add a nice acidity, while the chives will provide a fresh, oniony flavor.\n7. **Grilled Ham with Pineapple and Jalape\u00f1o**: The sweetness of the pineapple will complement the caramel flavors, while the spicy kick from the jalape\u00f1o will cut through the richness of the chocolate tart.\n\nThese fillings offer a mix of sweet, savory, tangy, and spicy flavors that will complement the matcha tiramisu and salted caramel chocolate tart nicely. You can't go wrong with a classic combination like smoked salmon or caramelized onion and brie, but feel free to experiment with the other options to find the perfect fit for your dinner party!",
