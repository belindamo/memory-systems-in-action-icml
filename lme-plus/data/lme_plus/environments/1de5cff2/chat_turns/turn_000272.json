I'd be happy to help you explore ways to improve your serve consistency.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you've noticed improvements with your new racquet. It's possible that the new racquet's weight, balance, or string pattern is suiting your playing style better. Keep that in mind as we explore other factors that might be affecting your serve.\n\nRegarding your yoga practice, it's excellent that you're working on your flexibility and balance. While it might not directly impact your serve, improved flexibility and balance can help with your overall athleticism and movement on the court. This, in turn, can indirectly benefit your serve. However, let's focus on specific tips to improve your serve consistency:\n\n1. **Toss consistency**: Focus on tossing the ball at the same spot every time. Try to toss the ball 6-8 feet in the air, and aim for a consistent release point. This will help you develop a consistent serving motion.\n2. **Shoulder rotation**: Make sure you're rotating your shoulders and using your legs to generate power. A strong shoulder rotation will help you generate more power and control.\n3. **Racquet head speed**: Experiment with different racquet head speeds to find the sweet spot that works for you. Faster racquet head speed can result in more power, but it may also lead to less control.\n4. **Follow-through**: Focus on a consistent follow-through, keeping your arm straight and your racquet in front of your body. This will help you maintain control and generate more power.\n5. **Practice with purpose**: Instead of just hitting serves, practice with a specific goal in mind. Try to hit a certain number of serves in a row, or aim for a specific spot on the court.\n6. **Analyze your serve**: Record yourself serving and analyze your technique. Pay attention to your toss, shoulder rotation, racquet head speed, and follow-through. Identify areas for improvement and work on those specific aspects.\n7. **Mix up your serves**: Practice different types of serves, such as flat, topspin, and slice serves. This will help you develop a more well-rounded serve and keep your opponents guessing.\n8. **Strengthen your core and legs**: A strong core and legs are essential for generating power and stability in your serve. Incorporate exercises like squats, lunges, and planks into your fitness routine.\n9. **Practice under pressure**: Practice serving in game-like situations, such as during a simulated match or with a partner who's trying to return your serves. This will help you develop mental toughness and consistency under pressure.\n10. **Seek feedback**: Consider taking lessons from a tennis coach or experienced player who can provide personalized feedback on your serve technique.\n\nRemember, consistency takes time and practice to develop. Focus on making small adjustments to your technique, and be patient with yourself as you work on improving your serve.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these tips or any other aspects of your serve?",
