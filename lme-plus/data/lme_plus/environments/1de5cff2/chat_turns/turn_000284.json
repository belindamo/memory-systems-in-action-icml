  "content": "There are many different types of musical instruments, but they can be broadly classified into four categories based on how they produce sound: string instruments, wind instruments, percussion instruments, and electronic instruments.\n\n1. String Instruments:\nString instruments produce sound by vibrating one or more strings stretched over a resonating chamber. The vibration is caused by either plucking, bowing, or striking the strings. Examples include guitar, violin, cello, harp, etc.\n\n2. Wind Instruments:\nWind instruments produce sound by blowing air into a resonating chamber or through a reed. The vibration of the air column inside the instrument produces the sound. Examples include flute, trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, etc.\n\n3. Percussion Instruments:\nPercussion instruments produce sound by striking, shaking, or scraping them. The vibration of the instrument's surface or material produces the sound. Examples include drums, cymbals, xylophone, maracas, etc.\n\n4. Electronic Instruments:\nElectronic instruments produce sound using electronic circuits and digital sound generators. Examples include synthesizer, digital piano, electric guitar, etc.",
