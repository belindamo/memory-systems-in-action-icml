  "content": "I'm happy to help you with that! However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time information about your location or the specific theater you're performing at. I can provide general guidance, but I'll need more information from you.\n\nCould you please tell me:\n\n1. What city or location is the theater in?\n2. What is the name of the theater or the address?\n3. Do you have a preferred mode of transportation (walking, driving, public transit, ride-hailing)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can try to provide you with directions to \"The Daily Grind\" (assuming it's a real coffee shop near the theater) and guidance on how to get there before Thursday's rehearsal.\n\nIf you're unsure about the coffee shop's location, you can also try searching online for \"coffee shops near [theater name or address]\" or ask your colleagues or the theater staff for recommendations.",
