It's amazing that you realized you had more time to read during your 10-day break, and that's a great habit to continue.\n\nCarrying a book or having a puzzle on your phone can be a great way to fill those moments when you might otherwise reach for social media. It's all about replacing one habit with another, and it sounds like you're already thinking ahead.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention having a book with you whenever you're out and about. That's a great way to make the most of your time, and it can also help you stay present in the moment. Instead of scrolling through social media, you can be engaging with a good story or learning something new.\n\nRemember, it's all about being intentional with your time and making conscious choices about how you want to spend it. By having alternative activities ready, you're taking control of your habits and making it more likely that you'll stick to your goal of reducing your social media usage.\n\nWhat kind of books do you enjoy reading? Are you currently reading something that you're really into, or do you have a favorite author or genre that you always come back to?",
