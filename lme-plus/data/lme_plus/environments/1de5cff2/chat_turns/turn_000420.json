Soprano and concert ukuleles are the most popular for beginners, as they're smaller and easier to play.\n* **Material**: Look for ukuleles made from solid wood or laminated wood. Solid wood ukuleles tend to sound better, but they're more expensive and sensitive to changes in humidity. Laminated wood ukuleles are more durable and resistant to humidity changes.\n* **Action**: The action refers to the distance between the strings and the fretboard. Look for a ukulele with low action, as it's easier to play.\n* **Tuning pegs**: Make sure the tuning pegs are easy to turn and hold their tuning well.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a ukulele that feels comfortable to play and sounds good to your ears.\n\nNow, get back to gathering that info about your Pearl Export drum set, and I'll be happy to help you determine its value!",
