Production: High-end fashion brands often produce smaller quantities of products compared to fast fashion brands, which mass-produce their products to keep up with demand.\n\n5. Sustainability: High-end fashion brands often prioritize sustainability in their production process, using eco-friendly materials and ethical manufacturing practices.
