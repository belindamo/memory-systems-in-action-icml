The whole point of that part of the walk down the spine was to give you a detailed sense of just how complicated the spine and all its elements really are and how easily\u2014and variously\u2014they can go wrong. And hurt. But let me repeat myself on this key point: The essence of Jeremy\u2019s remarkable technique is that it does not focus on the details of what has gone wrong. It focuses on the whole. Your very complicated back is an integrated whole. Integrated with your muscles, too, which we haven\u2019t gotten to yet. Get it working right, as a whole, and the details will work themselves out. Not always but most of the time. So . . . you can now forget most of what you just learned except this: Remember how intricate it all is. And bear that in mind later when Jeremy tells you how important it is to do the exercises just right. Doing them wrong is literally worse than not doing them at all. Listen closely to Jeremy. \nThe Muscles That Support the Spine \nInterestingly, it is the muscles of your core\u2014the critical spinal support system\u2014that do the most to make your spine work correctly. Think of the core as all of the muscles between your shoulders and hips, all the way around your body: front, back, and sides. The core is the area over which you have the most control and for which you bear the most responsibility. Okay, posture, too, but tending your core is your most serious responsibility. And the most work (read \u201cexercise\u201d). \nParaspinal Muscles\n\nLet\u2019s start with the muscles in the back. Close to the spine you have small muscles called \u201cparaspinals\u201d (in the picture below but not on the test) that act to stabilize the spine locally, preventing excessive movement, at each level, and also relaying information to the brain that tells the brain where the spine is in space. If these little guys become overloaded, they can cause painful spasms leading to debilitating pain. Tip: The paraspinals do in fact get overloaded all the time. Because your lousy posture puts some of your biggest and most important muscles (e.g., the glutes, in your butt) to sleep. It is one of the worst things we do to ourselves, with bad posture, idleness, and so on. Because, when the big boys fall asleep, all your weight shifts to the little guys, the paraspinals. Which fail. Then all that pressure goes straight onto your spine (the bones and discs), which is not designed to bear it. And all hell breaks loose. Details to follow. For now, worry about the poor little paraspinals that are going to be recruited, like child-soldiers, in a hopeless war. \nPsoas Muscles\n\nNext, the body has layer upon layer of muscles, building outward (as seen in the picture), with the deepest ones labeled on the right and most superficial (nearest the skin) labeled on the left. Quite an array, isn\u2019t it? Think there\u2019s a reason for that? Well, yes. Yes, there is. These guys do as much as any element to help you maintain that neutral spine.\nBack Muscles\n\nOne big muscle in your abdomen gets special mention here. It\u2019s called your \u201cpsoas\u201d muscle (see illustration on preceding page) and it\u2019s your main hip \u201cflexor,\u201d meaning that it is the muscle that enables you to lift your knees toward your waist. It gets special mention because it attaches directly to your lumbar spine (on the front) and can wreak havoc on your lumbar spine when it\u2019s shortened or too tight. It gets that way from prolonged sitting, or from sleeping in a fetal position. Ever wake up and feel hunched forward when you get out of bed? If you sleep in the fetal position, it might be a tight psoas you\u2019re feeling. \nA lot of the muscles on our back are \u201cextensors.\u201d That is, they are concerned with bending backward and maintaining posture. The muscles in the preceding diagram are named, but all you need to know is that they help us bend and they help us maintain erect posture. \nAbdominal Muscles",
