  "content": "The Diversity Visa (DV) program is a lottery system established by the U.S. government to provide an opportunity for individuals from countries that have low rates of immigration to the United States to apply for a green card. The registration period for DV-2024 will run from 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on Wednesday, October 5, 2022 to 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Tuesday, November 8, 2022. During this period, eligible individuals can submit only one entry per person. The Department of State uses sophisticated technology to detect multiple entries and individuals with more than one entry will be ineligible for a DV. Eligible family members, such as a spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age, must also be included in the entry. If an individual's entry is selected, they will be directed to a confirmation page with further instructions on the immigration process, including information about fees.",
