A lens hood is a great investment for your Tamron 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, and it will definitely help you achieve better results in your street and portrait photography.\n\nRemember, a lens hood is a relatively affordable accessory that can make a big difference in your image quality. It's a great way to protect your lens and reduce lens flare, which can be especially useful when shooting in bright conditions or with backlight.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further advice, feel free to ask. Otherwise, happy shooting, and I hope you enjoy your new lens hood!\n\n(And don't forget to sell that old kit lens to fund your new accessory!)",
