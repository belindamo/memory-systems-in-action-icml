  "content": "That's really interesting. I had no idea about the story behind Diwali. I've always celebrated it with my family, but I never really knew the significance of it. My parents used to tell me that it's a festival of lights and that we light diyas to welcome Goddess Lakshmi into our homes, but I didn't know about the story of Lord Rama and Sita. It's nice to learn about my own cultural heritage. Can you tell me more about the goddess Lakshmi and her significance in Hinduism?",
