Remember to start slow, focus on proper technique, and gradually increase the intensity as you build power and comfort with the exercises.\n\nIt's also excellent that you're combining plyometrics with strength training exercises that target your legs, glutes, and core. This will help you develop a strong foundation for generating power and speed in your serve.\n\nRegarding your yoga class, that's fantastic! Yoga can be incredibly beneficial for tennis players, as it can help improve flexibility, balance, and overall athleticism. Improved flexibility and balance can definitely benefit your serve, as well as your overall movement and agility on the court.\n\nYoga can also help with injury prevention, which is essential for tennis players. By incorporating yoga into your training routine, you can reduce your risk of injury and maintain a healthy, strong body.\n\nRemember to continue to listen to your body and adjust your training routine as needed. It's also important to warm up properly before each workout and cool down afterwards to prevent injury.\n\nKeep up the great work, and I'm excited to hear about your progress!",
