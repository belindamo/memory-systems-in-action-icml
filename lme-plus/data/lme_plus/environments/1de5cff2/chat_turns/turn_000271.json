  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on how to improve my tennis serves. I've recently started playing again after a six-month break and I've noticed a significant improvement since I started using a new racquet, but I still struggle with consistency. I've also been attending a yoga class every Wednesday evening at 7 pm, which has helped with my flexibility and balance, but I'm not sure if it's directly affecting my serve.",
