Public art: Public art that incorporates shapes and forms can be used to create a visual language that communicates messages about social issues or promotes positive change. For example, a mural or sculpture that depicts diverse communities coming together can promote unity and diversity.\n2. Advertising campaigns: Advertisements often use shapes and forms to communicate ideas and emotions to consumers. By using shapes and forms that promote positive social messages, advertisers can encourage viewers to think about and engage with social issues.\n3. Activist art: Artists have long used their work as a form of activism, using shapes and forms to communicate messages about social justice, inequality, and other issues. For example, a street artist might use stencils to create images of refugees, drawing attention to the plight of displaced people around the world.\n4. Graphic design: Graphic designers can use shapes and forms to create visual representations of social issues, such as infographics that show the impact of climate change or the benefits of vaccination.\n\nOverall, the combination of language, shape, and art can be a powerful tool for promoting social change by communicating ideas, emotions, and messages in a way that is accessible and engaging to a wide audience.",
