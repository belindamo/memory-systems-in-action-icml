Durability is definitely a key factor to consider.\n\nI think I'll go with ceramic as my top choice. It's a classic material that's known for its durability and ease of cleaning, which is perfect for daily use. Plus, it's a great option for hot beverages like coffee and tea.\n\nAs for the size, I think I'll go with a medium-sized mug. That way, I can use it for both my morning coffee and afternoon tea. A medium size will also make it easy to hold and maneuver.\n\nI love the idea of uploading my own design or using a pre-made template on Zazzle. I'll definitely check out their design options and see what catches my eye. Maybe I'll even create a custom design that reflects my personality or interests!\n\nThanks for your help and guidance throughout this process. You've been a huge help in narrowing down my options and making a decision. I'm excited to get my new mug and start enjoying my favorite hot beverages in style!",
