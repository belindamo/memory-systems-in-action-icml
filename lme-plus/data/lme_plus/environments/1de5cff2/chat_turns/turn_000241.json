I find them really inspiring and motivating, and they've been helping me a lot on my journey to reduce my social media usage and focus on my own life. I just finished reading \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" by Stephen Covey, and I'm currently reading \"Daring Greatly\" by Bren\u00e9 Brown.
