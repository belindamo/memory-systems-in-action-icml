I can provide general guidance, but I'll need more information from you.\n\nTo get directions to the community theater from your home, you can try the following options:\n\n1. **Google Maps**: Open Google Maps on your computer or mobile device, enter your home address as the starting point, and the community theater's address as the destination. Google Maps will provide you with turn-by-turn directions and an estimated travel time.\n2. **Waze**: If you have the Waze app on your mobile device, you can enter your home address and the community theater's address to get real-time traffic updates and directions.\n3. **Apple Maps or Maps on your device**: If you have an Apple device, you can use Apple Maps to get directions from your home to the community theater. Similarly, if you have an Android device, you can use the built-in Maps app.\n\nTo ensure you leave on time for Thursday's rehearsal, I recommend checking the directions and estimated travel time in advance. You can also consider leaving a little earlier to account for any unexpected traffic or delays.\n\nIf you're still unsure about the community theater's address or need more assistance, you can try contacting the theater directly or asking a colleague for help.",
