You mentioned wearing a new white dress shirt to your cousin's wedding earlier, and I'm happy to hear it was comfortable and looked great with your tuxedo! It's always a win when you find an outfit that's both stylish and comfortable.\n\nNow, back to shoes... If you do end up trying out a new brand or style, I'd love to hear about your experience! Comfort is key, especially when it comes to everyday wear.",
