      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, of course! Here are some tips on how to find healthier options on BBQ menus:\n\n1. Look for lean protein options - Instead of going for the fattier cuts of meat, look for lean protein options such as grilled chicken or fish. 2. Opt for vegetable sides - Many BBQ restaurants offer vegetable sides such as grilled asparagus, roasted Brussels sprouts, or a side salad that can be a healthier alternative to traditional starch-based sides like mac and cheese or mashed potatoes. 3. Be mindful of sauces - While BBQ sauce is delicious, it is often high in sugar and calories. Consider asking for sauce on the side or choosing a lighter sauce like mustard-based sauce. 4. Choose whole grain options - If the restaurant offers whole grain bread or buns, choose them over white bread options. 5. Share your meal - BBQ portions are often large, so consider sharing your meal with a friend or getting a to-go box to save half for a meal the next day. I hope these tips help you to find healthier options on BBQ menus!"
