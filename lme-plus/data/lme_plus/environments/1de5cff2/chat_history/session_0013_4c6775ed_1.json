      "content": "Great choices! Chicken Fajitas and Veggie Stir-Fry are both quick, easy, and packed with flavor.\n\nRegarding your question, preventing food from sticking to your new non-stick pans is crucial to ensure easy cooking and cleaning. Here are some tips to help you achieve that:\n\n**1. Seasoning:** Before using your non-stick pans for the first time, apply a thin layer of cooking oil (e.g., canola, vegetable, or peanut oil) and place them in the oven at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for an hour. This process, called seasoning, helps create a non-stick surface.\n\n**2. Preheat:** Always preheat your non-stick pans over medium-high heat before adding food. This helps the pan distribute heat evenly and prevents food from sticking.\n\n**3. Oil or cooking spray:** Use a small amount of oil or cooking spray (e.g., cooking spray with olive oil or avocado oil) before adding food to the pan. This creates a barrier between the food and the pan.\n\n**4. Avoid metal utensils:** Use silicone, wooden, or plastic utensils to prevent scratching the non-stick surface.\n\n**5. Don't overcrowd:** Cook in batches if necessary, to ensure that each piece of food has enough room to cook evenly. Overcrowding can lead to food sticking together and to the pan.\n\n**6. Avoid high heat:** Medium-high heat is usually sufficient for most cooking tasks. High heat can cause food to burn and stick to the pan.\n\n**7. Don't leave food unattended:** Stir food regularly, especially when cooking with high-moisture ingredients like vegetables or meat with sauces.\n\n**8. Clean the pan properly:** After cooking, let the pan cool, then wash it with mild soap and warm water. Avoid using abrasive materials or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the non-stick coating.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your new non-stick pans and cook delicious meals with ease!\n\nNow, are you ready to start cooking those Chicken Fajitas and Veggie Stir-Fry? Do you have any questions about the recipes or need further assistance?"
