No need more any comments.\n\nAirbnb in 2020\n\nA BUSINESS MODEL FOR THE SHARING, HEALTHY ECONOMY\nStartup companies have been functioning in a space commonly referred to as the \u201csharing economy\u201d for several years. According to Chesky, the previous model for the economy was based on ownership. Thus, operating a business first necessitated owner- ship of the assets required to do business. Any spare capacity the business faced\u2014either within production or service\u2014was a direct result of the purchase of hard assets in the daily activity of conducting business.\n\nAirbnb and other similar companies, however, operated through offering a technological platform, where individuals with spare capacity could offer their services. By leveraging the ubiquitous usage of smartphones and the continual decrease in technol- ogy costs, these companies provided a platform for individuals to instantly share a number of resources. Thus, a homeowner with a spare room could offer it for rent, or the car owner with spare time could offer his or her services a couple of nights a week as a taxi service. The individual simply signed up through the platform and began to offer the service or resource. The company then charged a small transaction fee as the service between both users was facilitated\n\nWithin its business model, Airbnb received a percentage of what the host received for the room. For Airbnb, its revenues were decoupled from the considerable operating expenses of traditional lodg- ing establishments and provided it with significantly smaller operating costs than hotels, motels, and bed and breakfasts. Rather than expenses related to owning and operating real estate properties, Airbnb\u2019s expenses were that of a technology com- pany. Airbnb\u2019s business model, therefore, was based on the revenue-cost-margin structure of an online marketplace, rather than a lodging establishment. With an estimated 11 percent fee per room stay, it was reported that Airbnb achieved profitability for a first time in 2016,2 and in 2017 Airbnb announced in an annual investors\u2019 meeting that the company had recorded nearly $3 billion in revenue and earned over $90 million in profit",
