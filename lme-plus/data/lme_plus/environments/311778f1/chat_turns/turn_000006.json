  "content": "Depictions of artificial intelligence (AI) in popular media have evolved significantly over the past several decades, and often reflect society's changing attitudes towards technology.\n\nIn earlier depictions of AI, such as in films like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Blade Runner (1982), AI was portrayed as either a helpful tool or a dangerous adversary capable of surpassing human intelligence and taking over the world. These more dystopian and cautionary depictions reflected society's concerns about technology outpacing human control, as it became clear that computers and machines were becoming more intelligent and capable of autonomous actions.\n\nHowever, as technology has become increasingly integrated into everyday life and more people have become familiar with AI technologies like Siri and Alexa, depictions of AI have become more nuanced and complex. In shows like Westworld (2016) and the film Ex Machina (2014), AI is portrayed as sentient and self-aware, raising questions about the ethics of creating and exploiting intelligent machines.\n\nAdditionally, more recent depictions of AI in media have explored the potential benefits of the technology, such as in the film Her (2013), which portrays a future where AI has become a helpful and ubiquitous part of daily life.\n\nOverall, these shifting depictions of AI in popular media reflect society's evolving relationship with technology. As our understanding and use of technology changes, so too do our attitudes towards AI and its potential ramifications.",
