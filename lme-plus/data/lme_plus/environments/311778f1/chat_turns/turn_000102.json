  "content": "Most private cars use Ackermann steering geometry, which is a type of steering geometry that uses the principle of parallel steering. In Ackermann steering, the inner wheel on a turn must rotate through a smaller angle than the outer wheel. This is achieved by linking the steering mechanism to the wheels in such a way that the steering linkage is angled so that the inner wheel points more directly at the center of the turn than the outer wheel.\n\nAckermann geometry is a simple and efficient solution that allows for good stability and handling while also keeping the tire wear at minimum. The design is widely used in almost all types of vehicles, including passenger cars, trucks, buses and even some heavy equipment. It is a simple and efficient solution that allows for good stability and handling while also keeping the tire wear at minimum.\n\nIt's worth noting that, some high-performance cars and race cars use a different type of steering geometry called \"four-wheel steering\" or \"active steering\" which are more advanced and complex than Ackermann geometry. They use sensors and computers to adjust the angle of the wheels, providing better handling and maneuverability at high speeds.",
