  "content": "The process of DNA replication involves the copying of the genetic information contained in a double-stranded DNA molecule. The process begins with the separation of the two strands of the DNA molecule, which are held together by weak hydrogen bonds. An enzyme called helicase unwinds and separates the two strands from each other, creating a replication fork.\n\nOnce the strands are separated, another enzyme called primase synthesizes a short RNA primer that provides a starting point for DNA synthesis. An enzyme called DNA polymerase then attaches nucleotides to the primer, building a new strand of DNA in a process called elongation. DNA polymerase can only elongate the strand in one direction, so the other strand is replicated in short, discontinuous segments that are later joined together.\n\nThe result of DNA replication is two identical copies of the original DNA molecule, each containing one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. This process is essential for genetic inheritance because it ensures that each daughter cell or offspring receives a complete, accurate copy of the parent cell's DNA. Any errors in DNA replication can lead to mutations that may be inherited and can cause genetic diseases or other health problems.",
