  "content": "Yes, the shift towards people-centered policies is likely to influence corporate culture as well. In recent years, we have seen a growing acknowledgment of the importance of employee well-being in the workplace. Many companies have started taking steps to improve the work environment, such as reducing stress levels, building a culture of trust and collaboration, providing better benefits, and creating opportunities for personal and professional development.\n\nMoreover, consumers and investors are increasingly aware of the impact of business activities on social and environmental well-being. Companies that prioritize employee well-being, social goals, and environmental sustainability are more likely to attract customers, investors, and talent.\n\nTherefore, as we incorporate well-being and happiness into policy-making, it is likely that more companies will follow suit and prioritize employee well-being, social goals, and environmental sustainability. Not only does this promote a more equitable and sustainable society, but it can also benefit companies in the long-term by improving employee productivity, morale, and attracting customers and investors who value sustainable practices.",
