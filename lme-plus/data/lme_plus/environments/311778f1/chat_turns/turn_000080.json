Since you enjoyed \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" you might enjoy:\n\n1. **Redshirts** by John Scalzi: A comedic sci-fi novel that spoofs the Star Trek universe. It's a fun, lighthearted listen with a great narrator, Wil Wheaton.\n2. **To Say Nothing of the Dog** by Connie Willis: A time-traveling historian gets stuck in Victorian England, leading to a series of hilarious misunderstandings. This one's a bit more gentle in its humor, but still a delightful listen.\n3. **The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry** by Gabrielle Zevin: A heartwarming, humorous novel about a grumpy bookstore owner who finds love and a new lease on life. It's a charming, feel-good listen.\n4. **Where'd You Go, Bernadette** by Maria Semple: A comedic novel about a dysfunctional family, their adventures, and the power of love. It's a witty, engaging listen with a great narrator, Kathleen Wilhoite.\n5. **Good Omens** by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman: I mentioned this one earlier, but it's a perfect fit for your commute. The audiobook is expertly narrated by Stephen Briggs, and the humor is clever and satirical.\n6. **The Rosie Project** by Graeme Simsion: A socially awkward professor sets out to find love using a scientific approach, but ends up learning more about himself and human connections. It's a charming, humorous listen with a great narrator, Dan O'Grady.\n7. **A Dirty Job** by Christopher Moore: A humorous novel about a man who becomes a death merchant, collecting souls for a living. It's a quirky, offbeat listen with a great narrator, Fisher Stevens.\n\nThese audiobooks should provide a great mix of humor, satire, and entertainment for your daily commute. Enjoy!",
