  "content": "For a baby-themed card, you could opt for something sweet and sentimental, like:\n\n* A card with a adorable baby animal (e.g., a onesie-clad elephant or a sleeping rabbit)\n* A card with a heartfelt message, such as \"Welcome to the world, little one!\" or \"Congratulations on your new bundle of joy!\"\n* A card that features a cute baby quote, like \"Tiny hands, tiny feet, and a whole lot of love to give\"\n\nIf you prefer a more general congratulatory message, you could go for a card that says something like:\n\n* \"Congratulations on your new addition!\"\n* \"Wishing you all the best as you embark on this new chapter!\"\n* \"Celebrating the arrival of your little miracle!\"\n\nChoose a card that resonates with your personality and relationship with Rachel. If you're close friends, you might opt for something more playful or humorous. If you're coworkers, a more professional and heartfelt message might be more suitable.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to express your congratulations and well-wishes for Rachel and her new baby, Emily.",
