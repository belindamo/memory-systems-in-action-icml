  "content": "At the particle level, solids have tightly packed particles that are arranged in a regular pattern. The particles in a solid vibrate in place and have a fixed shape and volume. Solids do not change their shape or volume much if they are subjected to pressure or temperature changes. However, if subjected to extreme temperature or pressure changes, they will melt or break apart.\n\nLiquids have particles that are still close together, but they are not held together as rigidly as in a solid. The particles in a liquid can slide past each other, which is why liquids can change shape to fit their container. Liquids have a fixed volume, but not a fixed shape. Unlike solids, liquids can be compressed but only slightly.\n\nGases have particles that are far apart and move rapidly. Gas particles are not held together by any sort of attraction, so they move independently of one another. Gases can be compressed or expanded very easily, which is why they have no fixed shape or volume. Gases will fill the container they are in, and the particles will spread out to fill all the available space.",
