Some of my favorite artists include Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, and Imagine Dragons. As for podcasts, I enjoy listening to \"The Daily Boost\" and \"The Motivation Minute\" - they're great for getting me pumped up and focused before a big event like this. How about you, do you have any favorite artists or podcasts that you'd recommend?",
