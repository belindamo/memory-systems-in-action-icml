  "content": "The character of Boxer in George Orwell's Animal Farm represents the working class or the proletariat in the Soviet Union. Boxer is a powerful and loyal horse who works hard for the betterment of the farm under the leadership of the pigs. He is portrayed as a symbol of the working class's dedication and strength, as he is one of the strongest animals on the farm and works tirelessly to build the windmill. Boxer always says, \"I will work harder,\" and \"Napoleon is always right,\" which represents the blind loyalty and obedience of the working class to their leaders.\n\nThe character of Boxer also serves to exemplify the tragedy of the working class in communist society. Despite his dedication and hard work, Boxer is ultimately betrayed by the pigs who sell him to a glue factory when he falls ill and cannot work. This betrayal shows how the ruling class can manipulate and exploit the working class for their own benefit, even after the workers have given their all for the betterment of society.\n\nOverall, the character of Boxer serves as a symbol of the working class's strength and dedication, as well as their vulnerability to exploitation and betrayal in communist society. His tragic fate underscores Orwell's critique of communism and the need for a society that values the dignity and rights of all citizens, not just the ruling elite.",
