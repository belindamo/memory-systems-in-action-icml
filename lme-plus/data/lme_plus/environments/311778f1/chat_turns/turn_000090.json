  "content": "Certainly! While some cities in Zambia, such as Lusaka and Livingstone, have higher average incomes than others, there are still vast disparities within each city. In urban areas, the wealthiest residents tend to live in certain neighborhoods or areas, while lower-income residents are often concentrated in informal settlements or areas with inadequate housing and infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, there are significant disparities in income and access to resources between urban and rural areas throughout Zambia. Rural areas often lack basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and access to clean water, which can make it difficult for residents to earn a living and access vital services.\n\nThese disparities can have significant consequences for health, education, and social mobility. While Zambia has made progress in reducing poverty and improving access to education and healthcare in recent years, there is still a long way to go in addressing these inequalities and ensuring that all Zambians have the opportunity to thrive.",
