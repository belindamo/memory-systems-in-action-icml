  "content": "That's a great choice! Medium roast coffee and herbal tea are both excellent options for new moms. The caffeine in coffee can help with fatigue, while the herbal tea can provide a calming and soothing effect.\n\nAnd I'm so glad you mentioned your experience watching your friend's baby, Olivia! It's amazing how much a small act of kindness, like bringing a cup of coffee or tea, can make a big difference in a new parent's day. Those early days of parenthood can be overwhelming, and it's wonderful that you're showing your support and care for Rachel during this time.\n\nHerbal teas, in particular, can be very beneficial for new moms. Peppermint tea, for example, can help with digestion and relaxation, while chamomile tea can promote calmness and reduce anxiety. Some herbal teas, like raspberry leaf tea, can even support breastfeeding and postpartum recovery.\n\nRemember to include a thoughtful note or card with your gift, expressing your congratulations and well-wishes for Rachel and her new baby, Emily. It's a small gesture that can go a long way in making them feel loved and supported during this special time.",
