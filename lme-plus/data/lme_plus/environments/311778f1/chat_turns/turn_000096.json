  "content": "The steering wheel angle of a car is typically converted to the actual wheel angle through a process called Ackermann steering geometry. This process uses the principle of parallel steering, where the inner wheel on a turn must rotate through a smaller angle than the outer wheel. The specific calculations for the conversion will depend on the make and model of the car, as well as the steering system used. The steering ratio, which is the ratio of steering wheel rotation to wheel rotation, is usually provided in the car's specifications and can be used to make the conversion.",
