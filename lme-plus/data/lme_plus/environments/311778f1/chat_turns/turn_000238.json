Here are some examples of well-crafted research questions and thesis statements, along with some tips on how to identify a good one:\n\n**Examples of Research Questions:**\n\n1. What are the effects of social media on mental health in young adults?\n2. How does climate change impact food security in developing countries?\n3. What are the benefits and drawbacks of implementing a universal basic income in the United States?\n\n**Examples of Thesis Statements:**\n\n1. While social media has been shown to have positive effects on social connections, it also has a significant negative impact on mental health in young adults, particularly in terms of increased anxiety and depression.\n2. Climate change is a major contributor to food insecurity in developing countries, and addressing it will require a multifaceted approach that involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving agricultural practices, and enhancing food distribution networks.\n3. Implementing a universal basic income in the United States would have both positive and negative effects on the economy, including reducing poverty and inequality, but also potentially reducing workforce participation and increasing taxes.\n\n**Tips for Identifying a Good Research Question or Thesis Statement:**\n\n1. **Specificity**: A good research question or thesis statement should be specific and focused on a particular issue or topic.\n2. **Originality**: Avoid asking a question that has already been extensively researched or answered. Instead, try to identify a gap in the existing literature and ask a question that addresses that gap.\n3. **Relevance**: Ensure that your research question or thesis statement is relevant to your field of study and has real-world implications.\n4. **Arguability**: A good thesis statement should be arguable, meaning that it takes a clear stance or position on an issue.\n5. **Researchability**: Make sure that your research question or thesis statement is researchable, meaning that there is sufficient data and literature available to support your investigation.\n6. **Clarity**: A good research question or thesis statement should be clear and concise, avoiding ambiguity and jargon.\n7. **Feasibility**: Ensure that your research question or thesis statement is feasible to investigate within the scope of your project, considering factors such as time, resources, and expertise.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Brainstorming**: Take time to brainstorm and generate multiple research questions or thesis statements before selecting the one that best fits your project.\n2. **Literature review**: Conduct a literature review to identify gaps in the existing research and refine your research question or thesis statement.\n3. **Peer review**: Share your research question or thesis statement with peers and mentors to get feedback and refine it further.\n4. **Revision**: Be prepared to revise your research question or thesis statement as you conduct your research and gather more information.\n\nBy following these tips and examples, you can craft a well-crafted research question or thesis statement that will guide your research and help you produce a high-quality paper.",
