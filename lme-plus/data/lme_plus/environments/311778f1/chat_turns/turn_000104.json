  "content": "To calculate the path of a car based on the steering wheel angle or wheel angle, you can use the concept of radius of curvature. The radius of curvature is the radius of a circle that the vehicle is following as it turns. The smaller the radius of curvature, the tighter the turn, and the larger the radius of curvature, the wider the turn.\n\nTo calculate the radius of curvature using the steering wheel angle, you can use the following formula:\n\nRadius of curvature = (Track width / 2) / tan (Wheel angle / 2)\n\nWhere:\n\n* Track width is the distance between the center of the left wheel and the center of the right wheel on the same axle of a vehicle.\n* Wheel angle is the angle of the wheels in degrees.\n* tan is the trigonometric function that returns the tangent of an angle.\n\nTo calculate the radius of curvature using the steering wheel angle, you can use the following formula:\n\nRadius of curvature = (Track width / 2) / tan (Steering wheel angle / 2 \\* Steering Ratio)\n\nWhere:\n\n* Track width is the distance between the center of the left wheel and the center of the right wheel on the same axle of a vehicle.\n* Steering wheel angle is the angle of the steering wheel in degrees.\n* Steering ratio is the ratio of the number of degrees the steering wheel is turned to the number of degrees the wheels turn.\n* tan is the trigonometric function that returns the tangent of an angle.\n\nOnce you have the radius of curvature, you can use it to calculate the path of the car. The path of the car is a circle with its center at the center of the turn (on the inside of the turn) and its radius equal to",
