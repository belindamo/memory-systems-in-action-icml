  "content": "It sounds like you're taking a proactive approach by researching industry trends and best practices, which is great for your professional development regardless of the outcome of your promotion.\n\nLet's break down your schedule into blocks of time. Since your team meetings are still tentative, let's allocate some time for research and other tasks that you can control.\n\nHow many hours per week do you want to dedicate to research and professional development? Is it 2 hours, 5 hours, or something else?\n\nAlso, are there any specific days or times when you're more productive or prefer to focus on certain tasks? For example, do you prefer to do research in the morning or afternoon?\n\nOnce we have a better idea of your availability and preferences, we can start blocking out time for your research and other tasks. And as soon as your team meetings are confirmed, we can add those to your schedule as well.",
