I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I don't recall any previous conversations or meetings you may have had. However, I can help you plan your schedule moving forward.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your schedule and what you need to accomplish over the next few weeks? What are your top priorities, and do you have any fixed commitments or appointments already scheduled?\n\nAlso, regarding your meeting with Rachel on the 15th, it's understandable that you're waiting to hear back about the outcome. Have you set a follow-up meeting or deadline to receive feedback on your performance review?",
