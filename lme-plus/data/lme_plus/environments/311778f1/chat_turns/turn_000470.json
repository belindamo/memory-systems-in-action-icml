The dough is kneaded and then rolled out into thin sheets. The sheets are then either cut into long strands or folded and cut into various shapes like strips, rings, or triangles.\n\n2. Japan - In Japan, the most popular type of noodle is soba, which is made with a mixture of buckwheat and wheat flour. The dough is kneaded and rolled out into thin sheets, and then the sheets are cut into thin strands. Another popular noodle in Japan is udon, which is made with wheat flour, salt, and water, and is thicker and more chewy than soba.\n\n3. Korea - Korean noodles are made with wheat, buckwheat, or sweet potato starch. The dough is kneaded and then either rolled out and cut into thin strands or pressed through a noodle-making machine.

Thailand - Thai noodles are primarily made of rice flour and water, and can be found in various shapes and sizes like vermicelli, flat noodles, and thin or wide rice noodles. The dough is poured onto a flat surface and steamed, then cut into the desired shape.\n\n5. India - Indian noodles, also known as sevai or vermicelli, are made from rice flour. The dough is made by mixing rice flour with water and then extruded through a mold to form long thin strands. These strands are then steamed or roasted and served as a savory or sweet dish.",
