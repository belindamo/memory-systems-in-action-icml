  "content": "What a thoughtful idea! Including a card with a personal message is a wonderful way to make your gift even more special.\n\nAs for mentioning your experience watching Olivia, it's a nice touch, but you might want to consider keeping it brief and subtle. You could mention something like:\n\n\"Congratulations on the arrival of baby Emily! I'm so excited for you both. As someone who's recently spent time with a little one (my friend's baby Olivia), I know how much a good cup of coffee or tea can mean during those early days. Wishing you all the best and sending lots of love!\"\n\nBy mentioning your experience in a brief and lighthearted way, you're showing empathy and understanding without making the focus of the card about you. The emphasis should still be on Rachel and her new baby, Emily.\n\nRemember to keep the message heartfelt, sincere, and concise. You could also add a few words of encouragement, like \"You're doing a great job, mom!\" or \"Enjoy every moment, they grow up so fast!\"",
