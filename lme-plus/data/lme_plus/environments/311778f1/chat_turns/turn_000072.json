  "content": "Yes, De Beers still controls a significant part of the diamond industry, although its dominance has declined over the years due to increased competition and changing market dynamics. According to industry estimates, De Beers\u2019 market share has fallen from around 80% in the 1980s to around 30% today.\n\nDespite this decline, De Beers is still one of the largest diamond producers in the world, and its influence on the diamond industry remains significant. It is also worth noting that De Beers has diversified its operations in recent years, beyond diamond mining and sales, into areas such as laboratory-grown diamonds and jewellery retail.\n\nMoreover, De Beers has also played an important role in shaping industry standards and promoting responsible mining practices. For instance, it created the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which aims to prevent the sale of conflict diamonds, and has also launched initiatives to support local communities and protect the environment around its mines.",
