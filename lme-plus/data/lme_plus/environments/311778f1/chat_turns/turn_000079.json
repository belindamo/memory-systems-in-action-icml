  "content": "I've been listening to audiobooks at 1.5x speed lately, but I agree that some narrators are harder to follow at faster speeds. I've found that certain narrators can make a big difference in my commute, which is about 45 minutes each way. Do you have any recommendations for audiobooks that are similar to \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" in terms of their humor and satire? I'm looking for something that can keep me entertained during my daily commute.",
