  "content": "Write me the start of a script for a movie scene, with dialogue, based on the below information:\n\nTwo directors of Arena Television, the failed outside broadcast business at the centre of the UK\u2019s \u201clargest ever\u201d asset-based lending fraud, were made bankrupt after failing to respond to a High Court judgment ordering repayment of \u00a3100 million.\nAccording to the latest insolvency filing for Arena, which collapsed last November and is suspected of defrauding lenders out of about \u00a3280 million, its owner, Richard Yeowart, and co-director Robert Hopkinson, had initially been asked to repay \u00a3250 million.\nWhen the directors, whose whereabouts are still thought to be unknown, did not respond, insolvency practitioners from Kroll pursued a default judgment via the High Court. This was granted in the sum of \u00a3100 million, plus costs of \u00a3500,000, an administrators\u2019 report shows, said to be the amount the judge was initially satisfied was owed by Yeowart and Hopkinson. The pair were made bankrupt in February after failing to respond to the statutory demand, administrators said.\nA further hearing can be requested to increase the value of the default judgment if it is deemed this could improve returns to creditors.\nArena was incorporated in 1988 and worked on sports and events including the European football championship for ITV Sport and Glastonbury festival for the BBC.\nYeowart ordered it to cease trading in November after a concern was raised that an asset linked to a loan may not exist. Administrators subsequently found the company had borrowed against equipment that either did not exist, or had already been used to secure a loan from another lender.\nThe suspected scam is thought to be one of the largest frauds to have hit the asset-based lending industry, with 55 lenders owed \u00a3282 million, much of which is likely to be lost. Insolvency practitioners have alleged that 46 lenders, owed a combined \u00a3182 million, \u201cdo not have recourse to any assets\u201d underlying their lending, with a shortfall of \u201cseveral thousand assets\u201d.\nIt is understood that Yeowart, 54, and Hopkinson, 41, were living in France before the alleged scam was uncovered and hadn\u2019t been seen at Arena\u2019s premises in Redhill, Surrey, for some time before the group\u2019s failure.\nYeowart has outright ownership in properties in the UK, France and Spain but the combined identified assets of the directors are understood to be worth only a small proportion of the amount owed. A \u00a31.5 million property in Barcelona owned by Yeowart is being held on trust following the judgment.\nA worldwide freezing injunction was obtained against both directors last November. The freezing injunction has also been served on \u201cvarious third parties\u201d that received money from Arena or its directors, administrators said.\nThe Serious Fraud Office began a criminal investigation into the scandal in February, when two arrests were made of unnamed individuals and three properties were searched. Yeowart and Hopkinson were not arrested.\nAreas of interest include Arena\u2019s relationship with third parties including Sentinel Broadcast, a supplier of audiovisual equipment based in Hook, Hampshire.\nAccording to court filings first reported by The Sunday Times, Yeowart used a Hong Kong entity called Sports Online to perpetrate a complex alleged fraud involving fake equipment and complicit third parties to steal funds from lenders. Shawbrook, HSBC, Lombard, ABN Amro and Close Leasing are among those exposed to the scandal.\n\nA locked room in Arena TV\u2019s headquarters in Redhill, Surrey, formed the centre of a scheme to defraud lenders out of \u00a3282 million. There, Arena\u2019s owner, Richard Yeowart, forged labels with false serial numbers as he cooked up a plan that was to become the UK\u2019s biggest-ever fraud in asset-backed lending.\nExplosive court filings in a civil claim against Yeowart and his fellow director Robert Hopkinson allege how the pair spent company funds on cryptocurrency, a house in Barcelona costing \u20ac1.8 million (\u00a31.5 million), and transferred \u00a3950,000 from the company to a personal bank account.\nArena TV collapsed into insolvency last November, two days after Yeowart sent an email to staff telling them to cease trading, leaving more than 50 lenders nursing heavy losses related to debts secured against equipment that either did not exist, or had already been secured by another lender.\nYeowart, 54 and Hopkinson, 41, have since absconded, their whereabouts unknown.\nAdministrators from Kroll said that 55 lenders, including high street banks such as NatWest and Clydesdale Bank and a string of boutique lenders, had provided hundreds of millions in loans. Most were secured against assets that did not exist. Only nine of them had any verified assets to back up their lending.\nFounded in 1988, Arena TV provided outside broadcast services to everything from the Six Nations rugby to Glastonbury festival. The company, which had bases in Redhill and Biggin Hill, in Kent, provided trucks, equipment, such as cameras, and services to customers including the BBC, Sky Sports and ITV. When it collapsed, its trucks were already on the way to Wembley to cover an England game.\nThe Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal investigation, and last month announced the arrests of two individuals, understood to be separate from the defendants in the civil claim.\nYeowart, described as a \u201cquiet man\u201d by his former employees, is a former cameraman with a passion for aircraft, who regularly commuted to work in a helicopter from his home in East Grinstead, West Sussex. Hopkinson joined the company in 2003 and was marketing director.\nIn December 2019, when it last filed financial statementsbefore its collapse, Arena Holdings reported sales of \u00a333.6 million, up from \u00a332.9 million in 2018. It also reported pre-tax profits of \u00a34.2 million, up from \u00a33.2 million a year earlier.\nHowever, details have emerged about the alleged fraud since the company\u2019s collapse. Court filings, brought against Yeowart and Hopkinson by administrators to Arena, allege a complex fraud involving a company registered in Hong Kong, undisclosed bank accounts and complicit intermediaries.\nIn 2012, Yeowart set up a new company, Sports Online Limited, registered in Hong Kong. According to court filings, Sports Online was used by Yeowart to perpetrate the fraud.\nIt is alleged that through a circular scheme, he would arrange for the wrongful \u201csale\u201d of equipment by Arena or Sports Online to an intermediary company, which appeared to be involved in the alleged fraud. The intermediary then sold it on to an asset-backed lender. This \u201cequipment\u201d, much of which did not exist, would then be the subject of a hire purchase agreement between Arena and the lender, which did not handle the goods itself.\nAccording to the claim, Yeowart would send pictures of the equipment with their false serial numbers \u2014 along with false certificates \u2014 to the lender to show that Arena had taken delivery of it.\nThis was done to conceal the fact that the equipment did not exist and had not been procured from a third-party supplier in the ordinary course of business.\nIt is also alleged that Yeowart told the intermediaries the price to be put on these false invoices \u2014 substantially in excess of the market price. The intermediaries were paid a commission of 1 per cent of the inflated purchase price.\nArena allegedly operated undisclosed bank accounts, which were used to carry out the fraudulent schemes.\nAlong with creating false invoices, Yeowart is accused of misappropriating company funds.\nIn September 2019, he opened a cryptocurrency account with Luno Money, transferring \u20ac275,280 and \u00a3480,500 of company money into the account. He also transferred \u00a3950,000 from the company to an account in his name. In the same year, Hopkinson and Yeowart used \u20ac1.8 million of company money to buy a seafront home in Sitges, close to Barcelona. Sitges has been described as the Saint-Tropez of Spain thanks to its glitzy beach crowd. Arena\u2019s remaining assets have been auctioned off and staff still have little clue about what went on behind Yeowart\u2019s locked door.\nA defence has not been filed.\nThe investigation into an alleged fraud at the outside broadcaster Arena TV has widened, after a High Court claim named a further employee at the company.\nKroll, the administrator to Arena, has filed a claim against Nicholas Cousins, who is understood to have held a senior finance job at the company.\nArena TV collapsed in November, two days after its founder, Richard Yeowart, ordered it to stop trading. Lenders were left more than \u00a3280 million out of pocket in what is thought to be the biggest ever alleged scam in asset-backed lending. Its demise left more than 50 lenders nursing losses of hundreds of millions of pounds that had been secured equipment, much of which did not exist.\nYeowart, 54, and fellow director Robert Hopkinson, 41, were made bankrupt in their absence after failing to respond to a High Court judgment ordering repayment of \u00a3100 million.\nNow, Kroll appears to have extended its case to include Cousins, a long-standing employee of Arena. Former employees said Cousins had left the company several weeks before it ceased trading. The nature of the claim against Cousins, who could not be reached for comment, is not yet known.\nArena TV was established in 1988 and worked on big events including Glastonbury and the Euros football championship. The company, which had bases in Redhill, Surrey, and Biggin Hill, Kent, provided trucks, equipment and services to customers including the BBC, Sky Sports and ITV. Trucks had already arrived at Wembley Stadium in preparation for England\u2019s match against Albania on November 12, and were told to return to base when the company ceased trading.\nExplosive court filings later alleged Yeowart had forged labels and created false serial numbers in a locked room in Arena\u2019s headquarters. It is alleged that he then spent company funds on cryptocurrency, a house in Barcelona costing \u20ac1.8 million, and transferred \u00a3950,000 from the company to a personal bank account.\nSome 55 lenders, including high street banks such as NatWest and Clydesdale, had provided hundreds of millions in loans. Since the administration, Arena\u2019s remaining assets have been auctioned off.\nIn its progress report from last month, Kroll said it would continue to identify and pursue claims against third parties. It is assessing Yeowart\u2019s international property portfolio, and his house in Spain is being sold, according to the report. Kroll did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe scale of an alleged fraud at a television business has been laid bare by administrators who estimate that about \u00a3280 million may have been borrowed against thousands of fake assets.\n\nArena Television, whose directors\u2019 whereabouts remain unknown, collapsed into insolvency in November two days after its founder and owner, Richard Yeowart, suddenly ordered it to cease trading after a concern was raised that an asset used to get a loan may not exist.\nYeowart, 54, and his co-director Robert Hopkinson, 41, are said to have absconded and scores of lenders face difficult questions over why they appear to have lent hundreds of millions of pounds with no true security to underpin the debts.\n\nArena was incorporated in 1988 and worked on sports and events coverage as an outside broadcast specialist, including ITV Sport\u2019s European football championship coverage and FA Cup coverage for the BBC, as well as the Wimbledon tennis championships, T20 cricket and Glastonbury music festival.\nAdministrators from Kroll have found that the Arena group secured more than \u00a3290 million against supposed assets, thousands of which are now suspected to never have existed. Fifty-five lenders are owed \u00a3282 million relating to broadcast assets. Insolvency practitioners allege, however, that the group \u201cdoes not hold the vast majority of assets\u201d purportedly borrowed against, filings show.\n\nOnly nine of the fifty-five lenders have any verified assets supporting their lending. The remainder, owed a combined \u00a3182 million, \u201cdo not have recourse to any assets\u201d underlying their lending, administrators said, noting that there is a shortfall of \u201cseveral thousand assets\u201d.\nThey are investigating several matters including \u201cmaterially significant liabilities which do not align with the group\u2019s audited and management accounts\u201d.\nAmong those facing the biggest losses are Shawbrook, owed \u00a334.6 million, HSBC, owed \u00a329.5 million, Lombard, owed \u00a324.2 million, and ABN Amro, owed \u00a322.6 million. Alongside high street banks such as Lloyds and NatWest, scores of non-bank and boutique lenders are also caught up in the alleged scam.\nAccording to his profile on IMDB, the film and games industry information dashboard, Yeowart has worked on television shows including Surprise! Surprise! and Ant & Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway.\nKroll said that Yeowart had ordered the company to cease trading on November 10 at a point when a number of the company\u2019s assets were at, or on the way to, sites for outside broadcast jobs. It emerged that this was after an agent of a lender had conducted an asset verification exercise.\nWhile attempting to verify a serial number of an asset Arena had borrowed against, the equipment supplier told the agent that \u201cno such serial number existed\u201d. The next day Close Leasing, a specialist lender, approached Kroll and administrators were appointed on November 12. Three more group companies including Arena Aviation, an aerial filing provider for Sky News and BBC News and an operator of private jets and VIP helicopter trips, are now also in administration.\nYeowart and Hopkinson are subject to worldwide asset freezing injunctions that have also been served on banks holding accounts in their name or those of Arena companies, as well as upon \u201cvarious third parties that may have received monies from the companies or directors or may hold assets on their behalf\u201d, Kroll said.\nUpon appointment the administrators were told that the directors had left the UK and attempts to contact them by Kroll, \u201cother stakeholders and regulatory bodies, including the High Court\u201d, had been unsuccessful.\nAs well as the \u201csubstantial shortall of assets\u201d, the administrators said that they were also investigating matters such as the abrupt closure of the business, the \u201cabscondment of the directors\u201d and \u201cmisinformation\u201d allegedly provided to lenders and others.\nThe group appears to have little money in the bank. The administrators are selling off Arena\u2019s assets to recover money for creditors but said that it was too early to provide a reliable estimate of how much might be returned.\nThe Times revealed in November that the state-owned British Business Bank is investigating circumstances surrounding the granting of taxpayer guarantees on certain loans made to the business during the pandemic.\nTwo men linked to the Arena TV scandal are being sued by the company\u2019s administrators for \u00a3285 million over claims they were involved in an unlawful conspiracy against scores of lenders.\nPaul Froom, of Sentinel Broadcast, a supplier to Arena, and Nicholas Cousins, thought to have held a senior finance role at Arena, have been accused of providing \u201cdishonest assistance\u201d to Richard Yeowart and Robert Hopkinson, the television company\u2019s directors.\nIn a further development in what is thought to be one of the largest alleged scams ever to hit Britain\u2019s asset-based lending industry, The Times has learnt that Hopkinson has been found in France by local law enforcement.\nThe Serious Fraud Office is understood to be in contact with the French authorities over access to Hopkinson, 41. The whereabouts of Yeowart, 54, are thought to remain unknown.\nA High Court claim against Froom and Cousins shows the former is being pursued over \u00a31.1 million of invoices paid to Sentinel, a sum said to have been \u201cmisapplied and/or misappropriated\u201d by Arena\u2019s directors. Cousins received \u00a3210,000 in \u201ccorrupt gifts\u201d for his role in the scam, administrators claim.\nArena, an outside broadcast specialist, collapsed in November and is suspected of defrauding high street banks and specialist finance houses of \u00a3280 million. The company was incorporated in 1988 and worked on sports events including the European football championship for ITV Sport and the Glastonbury Festival for the BBC.\nYeowart ordered the group to cease trading last November after a concern was raised on behalf of a lender that an asset linked to a loan may not exist.\nInsolvency practitioners from Kroll found the company had borrowed funds against equipment that either did not exist or had already been used to secure debt from other lenders.\nAdministrators have alleged that 46 lenders, owed a combined \u00a3182 million, \u201cdo not have recourse to any assets\u201d underlying their lending, with a shortfall of \u201cseveral thousand assets\u201d.\nThe fraud office is thought to be in contact with Eurojust, a pan-European body that helps national authorities to co-ordinate action against organised crime, over Hopkinson.\nYeowart has been accused of forging labels on equipment and creating false serial numbers and of spending some of the funds on cryptocurrency and property.\nIn June, Hopkinson and Yeowart were made bankrupt after failing to respond to a High Court judgment ordering the repayment of \u00a3100 million. The claim against Froom, 48, and Cousins includes \u00a3285 million for \u201cdamages for unlawful means conspiracy\u201d. It is the estimated total deficit of Arena.\nSentinel Broadcast is a supplier of audiovisual equipment in Hook, Hampshire. The company, which was placed in administration in July, was a \u201cpreferred\u201d supplier for Arena. Sentinel is suspected of creating false invoices and the veracity of serial numbers relating to supposed assets ostensibly supplied by Sentinel is in question.\nFroom was asked for comment. Cousins, Hopkinson and Yeowart could not be reached. Eurojust, Kroll and the fraud office declined to comment.\nAdministrators at Arena Television are looking into the possible role of a supplier in an alleged scam at the outside broadcaster, which is accused of borrowing \u00a3280 million against thousands of non-existent assets.\nArena\u2019s relationship with Sentinel Broadcast, a supplier of audiovisual equipment based in Hook, Hampshire, is a key line of inquiry for the insolvency practitioners, The Times understands.\nArena, whose directors\u2019 whereabouts are unknown, collapsed into insolvency in November, two days after Richard Yeowart, its founder and owner, suddenly ordered it to cease trading after a concern was raised that an asset linked to a loan may not exist.\nYeowart, 54, and Robert Hopkinson, 41, a co-director, are said to have absconded and administrators from Kroll, the consulting firm, have estimated that 55 lenders are owed \u00a3282 million relating to debts ostensibly secured against broadcasting assets.\nInsolvency practitioners allege that 46 lenders, owed a combined \u00a3182 million, \u201cdo not have recourse to any assets\u201d underlying their lending, with a shortfall of \u201cseveral thousand assets\u201d, resulting in embarrassment for high street banks and specialist lenders.\nSentinel Broadcast was a \u201cpreferred\u201d supplier for Arena, the term for a supplier with a trusted relationship with a commercial customer. It is understood that the veracity of serial numbers related to supposed assets ostensibly supplied by Sentinel is being examined.\nWhen asked about the company\u2019s relationship with Arena, Paul Froom, 47, director of Sentinel, said: \u201cI don\u2019t really have a comment at the minute.\u201d He did not respond to an invitation to comment on whether Sentinel had any role in the alleged asset shortfall.\nArena was incorporated in 1988 and worked on sports and events coverage, including the European football championship for ITV Sport and FA Cup coverage for the BBC.\nThe alleged fraud is understood to have gone undetected for a long time as Arena kept up with loan repayments. It was uncovered when a manufacturer told a lender\u2019s agent that a serial number for leased equipment did not exist.\nThe use of broadcast assets in an alleged scam complicates matters for lenders as they are rarely at the borrower\u2019s headquarters for checks. If an equipment supplier or vendor played a role in the alleged scam, it could make it harder for lenders to detect.\nIan Gough-Williams, a director at Thameside TV, an occasional supplier to Sentinel where Arena was the end user, said he was surprised at questions over Sentinel\u2019s role in the case.\n\u201cWe have only ever had a professional relationship with Sentinel, where we were paid as per our invoice terms,\u201d he said.\nAdministrators, who have launched a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Yeowart and Hopkinson, did not respond to an invitation to comment. The Serious Fraud Office has refused to comment on suggestions that it may launch an inquiry.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority is under pressure to look into apparent due diligence failures by lenders.\nThese include Shawbrook, owed \u00a334.6 million, HSBC, owed \u00a329.5 million, Lombard, owed \u00a324.2 million, and ABN Amro, owed \u00a322.6 million.\nAlongside high street banks such as Lloyds, scores of non-bank and boutique lenders are also caught up in the alleged scam. More than 70 staff of Arena are owed almost \u00a31.3 million in unpaid wages.\n\nStaff at Arena Television are owed almost \u00a31.3 million in unpaid wages after the firm collapsed into administration amid fraud allegations.\nMore than 70 employees are among the creditors owed millions of pounds after the outside broadcaster was discovered to have taken out almost \u00a3300 million in loans. Administrators to Arena said it had secured more than \u00a3280 million against assets that did not exist.\nThey are investigating alleged fraud and have launched a legal claim against the company\u2019s two former directors, Richard Yeowart and Robert Hopkinson, who are being sued for breach of fiduciary duty. The two men have not been seen at Arena\u2019s premises since December 2020 and have left the country.\nAfter Kroll was appointed administrator in November, it made most staff redundant. A former senior employee at Arena said he was owed about \u00a36,000 in unpaid wages, and that he was furious it was taking so long to be paid. \u201cThe people who gave their lives to the business get stung,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be treated like a corporate number is shocking ... There are human beings who have gone through mental breakdowns through all this uncertainty.\u201d\nThe collapse of Arena has left hundreds of creditors out of pocket. According to filings lodged last week with Companies House, Arena owes \u00a3155,971 to HMRC and \u00a32 million to trade creditors. Just over 70 employees are owed \u00a31.3 million.\nElectra trust slips into comfier shoes\nElectra Private Equity, once one of London\u2019s highest-profile investment trusts, will announce the final stage of a break-up tomorrow that was sparked by activist investor Edward Bramson (Jill Treanor writes).\nElectra will no longer be listed on the main segment of the stock market and will transform into a comfy shoe business, Hotter, with a market valuation of about \u00a327 million. It will relist on the junior Aim market under the new name of Unbound on January 31.\nIan Watson, who became chief executive of Hotter in 2019 and oversaw a company voluntary arrangement in 2020 to allow 58 store closures, will head the newly listed business.\nIts stock market valuation is significantly below the \u00a384 million that Electra paid for Hotter in 2014, just before Bramson started building his 30 per cent stake in the trust. He no longer has a holding.\nIt is the last of about 20 investments made by Electra, which has sold off the manufacturer Sentinel and last year listed TGI Fridays restaurants under the name Hostmore.\nWatson has big plans for Hotter to grow by teaming up with other retailers. It is now mainly an online business aimed at the over-55s and wants to harness its database of 4.6 million customers. It is in advanced talks with potential partners.\nElectra had a market value of \u00a31.1 billion when Bramson arrived and has since returned \u00a32.1 billion to shareholders, under the chairmanship of Neil Johnson, who joined in May 2016.\n\nAdministrators to Arena Television are suing its former directors for breach of fiduciary duty amid allegations of a huge fraud at the collapsed broadcaster.\nAdministrators from Kroll filed a claim in the High Court last week against Arena TV\u2019s former owner and managing director, Richard Yeowart, and Robert Hopkinson, another former director. The company collapsed suddenly this month.\nA source close to the administration said the collapse was set in motion when an auditor, acting for one of Arena TV\u2019s lenders, attempted to verify serial numbers for company-owned equipment used as security for loans. When the auditor called the equipment suppliers, they were told the serial numbers did not exist.\n\u201cIt is potentially the biggest fraud of this kind the UK has ever seen,\u201d the source said.\nAdministrators have been unable to contact Yeowart, 54, who is believed to be in France. Attempts by The Sunday Times to contact Yeowart were unsuccessful. Hopkinson, 41, did not reply to a request for comment.\nArena TV, founded in 1988, became one of the largest independent outside broadcasters in the UK, serving customers including the BBC, ITV and Sky Sports. According to his LinkedIn profile, Hopkinson joined in 2003, a year after leaving university.\nArena TV is understood to have borrowed about \u00a3300 million from asset-based lenders including HSBC, Close Brothers and Shawbrook, according to Sky News. Allied Irish Bank is also said to have lent to Arena TV. Recoveries from administration are likely to be minimal.\nThe company\u2019s equipment was used to produce ITV\u2019s coverage of Euro 2020, and this year\u2019s FA Cup Final was remotely produced at Arena TV\u2019s headquarters in Redhill, Surrey. Its large outside-broadcast trucks have been deployed at the Glastonbury festival and the Olympics.\nArena Aviation, a separate division, has been providing aerial filming services since the mid-1990s and operated news-gathering helicopters for big networks when it collapsed. The outside- broadcast industry has been steadily consolidating amid tough competition, with many of Arena\u2019s rivals bought by international firms.\nIn 2019, the last year for which accounts are available, the group reported pre-tax profits of \u00a33.8 million on sales of \u00a329.6 million. The company reported that it had assets worth \u00a358.6 million.\nIts accounts were signed off by auditors from McKenzies, a small practice based in Surrey.\nArena employed about 100 people at the time of its collapse.\n\nPolice are understood to be closing in on the owner of collapsed Arena TV after tracking him down to a home in France.\nSources said French police were aware of the location of Richard Yeowart, who ran the outside broadcast supplier until its collapse in November. Yeowart, 54, and fellow director Robert Hopkinson, 41, are said to have absconded to a location near the resort of Le Touquet, just south of Calais. Administrators from Kroll have estimated that 55 lenders are owed \u00a3282 million in loans secured against equipment that, in many cases, appears not to have existed.\nThe investigation has also expanded to Arena\u2019s relationship with one of its suppliers, Sentinel Broadcast, which supplies audiovisual equipment. A source close to the administration said they were investigating whether Sentinel had created false invoices in co-operation with Arena.\nArena was founded by Yeowart more than 30 years ago, and provided outside broadcast services to everything from the Six Nations rugby to Glastonbury. The company, which had bases in Redhill in Surrey and Biggin Hill in Kent, provided trucks and equipment to customers including the BBC, Sky Sports and ITV.\nHowever, on November 10 last year, Yeowart sent an email to senior staff saying that the company was closing down. Over the next couple of days, Arena\u2019s 100 or so employees scrambled around, wondering what to do. Trucks belonging to the company, which had already arrived at Wembley Stadium in preparation for England\u2019s match against Albania on Friday, November 12, were told to return to base. Arena\u2019s customer, ITV, was forced to find a new supplier, and Arena\u2019s staff were left in limbo.\nThe collapse is one of the largest alleged frauds ever to hit the asset-based lending industry.\nSince then, details have emerged about Yeowart\u2019s extravagant lifestyle. The former cameraman has a passion for aircraft and regularly commuted to work by helicopter. Arena owned a fleet, plus three jets, and Yeowart is believed to have a pilot\u2019s licence.\nAccording to Land Registry records, Yeowart owns a cottage in East Grinstead, West Sussex, where he is believed to have been living with. Hopkinson was marketing director at Arena having joined in 2003 from university.\nBoth men are subject to world-wide asset-freezing injunctions that have also been served on banks with accounts in their name.\nPaul Froom, the director of Sentinel, is said to have appointed criminal defence lawyers. He declined to comment. Yeowart could not be reached for comment.\n\nLe Touquet is a chi-chi seaside town in France, just south of Calais, loved by the British since the 1920s. As of last month, it is also thought to be near where Richard Yeowart, chief executive of the scandal-hit broadcast company Arena Television, is camped out.\nYeowart, 54, left Britain early last month as the company he began more than 30 years ago collapsed into administration, leaving 100 staff worried for their futures and a trail of lenders facing losses of almost \u00a3300 million. Sources suggest it could be the biggest scandal in the history of UK asset-backed lending.\nAdministrators to Arena, which provided outside broadcast services to everything from the Six Nations rugby to Glastonbury, are investigating alleged fraud and have launched a legal claim against Yeowart and fellow director Robert Hopkinson, suing the pair for breach of fiduciary duty. One lender, United Trust, has also begun a claim against Yeowart for breach of contract, adding it was \u201cseeking to protect\u201d its interests.\nNow it can be revealed that furloughed staff complained of being told to return to work at Arena while still being paid by the government-backed wages scheme. Multiple members of staff told the Sunday Times they were on furlough during this period and attended the company\u2019s offices for shifts. When they complained, they were told by email that the \u201centire company must work together as a team\u201d to get through Covid. They were told they should perform these tasks \u201cwithout exception\u201d and to disregard guidance from the Citizens Advice Bureau to the contrary.\nArena, which was founded by Yeowart in 1988, grew to become one of the UK\u2019s biggest independent outside broadcasters. The company, which has bases in Redhill in Surrey and Biggin Hill in Kent, provided trucks, equipment and services to customers including the BBC, Sky Sports and ITV. It has worked on events from Glastonbury to the Olympics and the Wimbledon tennis championship.\nDespite his company\u2019s prominence in the industry, little is known personally about Yeowart, a former cameraman who is said to have a passion for aircraft and regularly commuted to work in a helicopter; Arena owned a fleet, plus three jets, and he is believed to hold a helicopter pilot\u2019s licence. \u201cHis first love was aviation,\u201d an ex-employee said.\nAnother former employee described Yeowart as a \u201cvery quiet man\u201d who was \u201cstraightforward, kind and honest\u201d. The company provided the equipment to Ariana Grande\u2019s tribute concert for victims of the Manchester Arena attack, held in 2017 at Old Trafford, free of charge. \u201cIt felt like a family company to work for,\u201d said the former staff member.\nAccording to Land Registry records, Yeowart owns a cottage in East Grinstead, West Sussex, where he is believed to have been living with Hopkinson, who was marketing director at Arena having joined in 2003 from university. The pair are the sole directors of the company.\nIn December 2019, when it last filed financial statements, Arena Holdings reported sales of \u00a333.6 million, up from \u00a332.9 million in 2018. It also reported pre-tax profits of \u00a34.2 million, from \u00a33.2 million a year earlier. \u201cWe expect that British broadcasters will continue to see the merits of supporting a well-established, British-owned company that pays all its taxes in the UK,\u201d its accounts boasted, before adding: \u201cThe business is not for sale and will remain in the same family ownership for many years to come.\u201d\nOnce Covid hit, however, Arena\u2019s business struggled, according to former insiders. This time last year, about 19 members of staff were made redundant. Arena also took on more debt, with The Times reporting last week that it was granted a series of taxpayer-backed loans, including \u00a3800,000 via the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (Cbils).\nWith events cancelled, Arena Television placed employees on furlough and claimed \u00a3360,000 to \u00a3725,000 in wage payments between December 2020 and August 2021, the period for which data is available. It is not known how much Arena claimed in furlough wages during the first lockdown, as these figures have not been made public.\nStaff members allege they were scheduled to work shifts for \u201cmaintenance\u201d or \u201chousekeeping\u201d at Arena\u2019s offices while their wages were being paid by the taxpayer. Furlough rules forbid any work that provides services for the employer. It is understood that staff were told that any furloughed employees required to participate in such tasks would be contacted by their head of department and scheduled a day. Staff are understood to have approached Citizens Advice for guidance and were told by Arena that the work was permissible while on furlough.\nA former senior employee, who was in charge of managing team members, said staff were rostered in for \u201cessential maintenance\u201d, adding they were so afraid for their jobs they may have gone to work when they should not have. The executive responsible for instructing staff on the matter, Peter Love, Arena\u2019s director of operations, did not reply to a request to comment. HMRC said it would not comment on \u201cidentifiable businesses\u201d.\nArena\u2019s real trouble began last month, when one of its lenders attempted to verify serial numbers for company-owned equipment that was being used as security for loans. When the auditor rang the supplier, they were told the numbers did not exist.\nOn November 10, staff received an email from Yeowart: it said that the company had ceased trading and they should go home. Later that afternoon, an email was sent to clients: \u201cI\u2019m very sad to say that Arena TV has ceased trading with effect from today, Wednesday, November 10. All bookings have been cancelled.\u201d\nOver the next couple of days, Arena\u2019s 100 or so employees scrambled around, wondering what to do. Trucks belonging to the company, which had already arrived at Wembley Stadium in preparation for England\u2019s match against Albania on Friday, November 12, were told to return to base; Arena\u2019s customer, ITV, was forced to find a new supplier.\n\u201cBy Thursday morning there was a bit of a panic about what was going on,\u201d said a source familiar with the administration. \u201cStaff didn\u2019t know what was happening.\u201d\nITV was forced to find a new supplier for England\u2019s 5-0 win over Albania, when Harry Kane scored a hat trick\nITV was forced to find a new supplier for England\u2019s 5-0 win over Albania, when Harry Kane scored a hat trick\nLAURENCE GRIFFITHS/GETTY IMAGES\nMore lenders now became aware that the company had ceased trading \u2014 and the debt figure began to grow inexorably.\n\u201cAs people started to wake up to it, more lenders came out of the woodwork, saying \u2018we\u2019re owed X million\u2019,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the administration. It is now thought that there could be more than 20 lenders with a claim, with Arena\u2019s total debts reaching \u00a3280 million. Among them are NatWest, Shawbrook and Close Brothers, which lodged the administration application with the High Court. Kroll was appointed as administrator on November 12.\nThe scale of the alleged fraud has sent shockwaves through the industry. \u201cThis is pretty unprecedented stuff and the finance industry will be looking hard for lessons to learn,\u201d said Will Wright, head of restructuring at Interpath Advisory.\nThe Times reported last week that the British Business Bank is investigating payments that were granted to Arena by lenders accredited to provide taxpayer-backed pandemic loans in the months leading up to its collapse.\nNow the hunt begins: to piece together the scale of the alleged fraud. Kroll is understood to have appointed an investigator to look for any missing equipment. \u201cAs part of the administration process, Kroll has instructed an agent to undertake an inventory of its assets on the company\u2019s premises, as is standard in these situations,\u201d said Ben Wiles, the joint administrator.\nIn the meantime, employees are still waiting for answers. \u201cWe\u2019re all frustratingly still waiting to find out what\u2019s going to happen, if any redundancy or owed time or expenses will even get paid,\u201d said one current employee. \u201cSome of us are owed a great deal.\u201d Answers are unlikely to come from Yeowart, however. Two days before the company ceased trading, he resigned from his family\u2019s agricultural business in East Sussex. Last week, he could not be reached for comment.\n\nA television business at the heart of a fraud investigation secured millions of pounds of taxpayer-backed pandemic loans in the run-up to its collapse.\nArena Television arranged credit that came with state guarantees attached as it ran up debts thought to be in the region of \u00a3280 million from a vast array of lenders, drawing the government\u2019s emergency loan schemes and much of the commercial lending industry into the emerging scandal. Administrators of the London-based business, which failed last week, are investigating an alleged fraud and are suing its directors Richard Yeowart, 54, and Robert Hopkinson, 41, for breach of fiduciary duty.\nThe collapse was set in motion when an auditor acting for one of Arena TV\u2019s lenders tried to verify serial numbers for company-owned equipment used as security for loans, according to The Sunday Times. When the auditor called the equipment suppliers, they were told the numbers did not exist.\nArena was incorporated in 1988 and worked on big sports and events coverage, including ITV Sport\u2019s European football championship and FA Cup coverage for the BBC, as well as the Glastonbury music festival.\nThe state-owned British Business Bank, which administers the emergency finance schemes, is investigating the circumstances surrounding the granting of loans to Arena by lenders that it had accredited to provide credit to help companies to survive the pandemic.\nArena was granted a series of these taxpayer-guaranteed loans, including \u00a3800,000 secured via the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme last year and separate credit provided under the recovery loan scheme, which was launched in April. Arena\u2019s state-backed loans are understood to run into millions of pounds.\nThere is shock in the commercial lending industry at the scale of the alleged fraud, with swathes of the high street and alternative asset-based lending industry caught up. Scores of lenders are facing losses, including HSBC, NatWest, Santander, Shawbrook and Clydesdale. As well as loans allegedly secured against non-existent equipment, lenders are also understood to be concerned that Arena might have managed to fraudulently arrange debts from several providers secured against the same asset.\nArena\u2019s accounts for 2019 show annual sales of \u00a329.6 million, with \u00a329.8 million of debt linked to leasing agreements \u2014 little more than a tenth of what is thought to be its true level of exposure.\nWhile fraud in the asset finance industry is a perennial risk, a senior source in the industry said that the sheer variety of borrowers exposed to what was a relatively small business was unprecedented. Another said that they feared it could turn out to be \u201cthe biggest fraud in asset finance\u201d.\nThe case is likely to raise questions about how the company managed to pass underwriting processes at so many lenders. Arena also claimed between \u00a3360,000 and \u00a3725,000 in wage furlough payments from the taxpayer between December 2020 and August 2021.\nAccording to his profile on IMDB, the film and games industry information dashboard, Yeowart, Arena\u2019s founder, has worked on television shows including Ant & Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway and Spitting Image.\nYeowart, who was said to be in France, could not be reached for comment. Hopkinson was approached for comment.\nThe scandal could result in fresh scrutiny on the lack of regulation of commercial lending, an issue already in the spotlight in the wake of the Greensill Capital saga, as well as on due diligence standards at lenders and the British Business Bank. Before the collapse in March of Greensill, a supply chain lender, it was provided with about \u00a3400 million of state-backed guarantees. Most of these related to loans to companies in the Gupta Family Group Alliance \u2014 a breach of lending limits \u2014 and \u00a3335 million is thought to be at risk. The British Business Bank was accused by MPs this month of \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d due diligence.\nUnder the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme and the recovery loan scheme, the state provided an 80 per cent guarantee on sums advanced by lenders that they can call on if the borrower defaults. The recovery loan scheme coverage drops to 70 per cent in January.\nA British Business Bank spokesman said: \u201cWe are currently investigating facilities granted to Arena through accredited lenders using the bank\u2019s schemes, and expect lenders to work with the company\u2019s administrators on recoveries.\u201d\nA spokesman for Kroll, Arena\ufffd\ufffds administrator, declined to comment.",
