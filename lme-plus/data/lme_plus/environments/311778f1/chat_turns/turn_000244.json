Cirrostratus - Jellyfish (both are transparent and wispy)\n3. Cirrocumulus - Sheep (both are small, fluffy and round)\n4. Altostratus - Dolphin (both are gray and can cover large areas)\n5. Altocumulus - Zebra (both have a striped pattern)\n6. Stratus - Sloth (both move slowly and cover low areas)\n7. Stratocumulus - Cow (both are low and spread out)\n8. Nimbostratus - Elephant (both can release a lot of water or snow)\n9. Cumulus - Puppy (both are fluffy and have a white bottom)\n10. Cumulonimbus - Hippopotamus (both are big and can be dangerous) \n\nHope this helps you to remember all ten types of clouds!",
