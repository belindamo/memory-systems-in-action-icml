Since you're more focused in the morning, we can block out 1.5 hours on two separate days, for example, Wednesday and Friday mornings from 9:00 am to 10:30 am.\n\nHere's a rough outline of your schedule:\n\nWednesday:\n\n* 9:00 am - 10:30 am: Research and professional development\n* Rest of the day: Available for team meetings and other tasks\n\nFriday:\n\n* 9:00 am - 10:30 am: Research and professional development\n* Rest of the day: Available for team meetings and other tasks\n\nThis leaves you with plenty of time to accommodate your team meetings and other tasks, while also ensuring you have dedicated time for your own professional growth.\n\nAs your team meetings are confirmed, we can add them to your schedule. In the meantime, you can use the remaining time to work on other tasks, respond to emails, or tackle any urgent matters that come up.\n\nHow does this sound?",
