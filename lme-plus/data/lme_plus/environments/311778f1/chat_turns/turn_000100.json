  "content": "The turning circle, also known as the \"turning radius,\" is the diameter of the smallest circle that a vehicle can turn around within. It is the distance between the center of the front wheel and the point at which the front wheel makes contact with the ground as the vehicle completes a full U-turn. The turning circle is an important measurement in determining the maneuverability of a vehicle, specifically in tight spaces like parking lots or narrow roads.\n\nIt is calculated by turning the steering wheel to the maximum lock and measuring the distance between the center of the front wheel and the point at which the front wheel makes contact with the ground as the vehicle completes a full U-turn. The turning circle is usually provided in the vehicle's specifications and is usually measured in feet or meters.",
