No need more any comments.\n\nAirbnb in 2020\n\nBed and breakfasts, however, were much smaller, usually where owner-operators offered a couple of rooms within their own home to accommodate guest. The environment of the bed and breakfast\u2014 one of a cozy, home-like ambiance\u2014was what the guest desired when booking a room. Contrasted with the hotel or motel, a bed and breakfast offered a more personalized, quieter atmosphere. Further, many bed and breakfast establishments were in rural areas where the investment to establish a larger hotel may have been cost prohibitive, yet the loca- tion itself could be an attraction to tourists. In these areas individuals invested in a home and property, possibly with a historical background, to offer a bed and breakfast with great allure and ambience for the guests\u2019 experiences. Thus, the bed and breakfast competed through offering an ambiance associated with a more rural, slower pace through which travel- ers connected with their hosts and the surrounding community. \n\nWhile differing in size and target consumer, all hotels, motels, and bed and breakfasts were subject to city, state, and federal regulations. These regula- tions covered areas such as the physical property and food safety, access for persons with disabilities, and even alcohol distribution. Owners and operators were subject to paying fees for different licenses to operate. Due to operating as a business, these prop- erties and the associated revenues were also subject to state and federal taxation.\nIn addition to regulations, the need to construct physical locations prevented hotels and motels from expanding quickly, especially in new international markets. Larger chains tended to expand by purchas- ing pre-existing physical locations or through merg- ers and acquisitions, such as Marriott International Inc.\u2019s acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide in 2016.",
