  "content": "I think there might be some confusion again. As I mentioned earlier, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I wasn't present at any workshop on March 20th. You didn't attend a workshop on academic writing with me, and I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me.\n\nHowever, it's a great idea to review your notes from any workshops, classes, or resources you've used in the past! If you have notes from a workshop on academic writing, it's definitely worth reviewing them to see if there are any tips or strategies that the instructor mentioned about creating an outline. Your notes can be a valuable resource to help you refresh your memory and gain new insights.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try to recall any specific advice or guidance the instructor provided during the workshop. Reflecting on what you learned and how you can apply it to your current project can be a great way to reinforce your understanding and improve your writing skills.\n\nSo, go ahead and review your notes, and I hope you find some helpful tips and strategies to support your writing!",
