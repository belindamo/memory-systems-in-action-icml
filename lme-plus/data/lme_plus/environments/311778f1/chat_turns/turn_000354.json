  "content": "Old Macdonald is a fantastic course! It's a tribute to the classic links courses of Scotland, and it's a unique gem at Bandon Dunes. Here's what makes it special:\n\n**Inspiration:**\n\nOld Macdonald was designed by Tom Doak and Jim Urbina, and it's their homage to Charles Blair Macdonald, a Scottish-American golfer and course designer who is often referred to as the \"Father of American Golf.\" Macdonald was instrumental in introducing the concepts of links golf to the United States, and his designs, such as the National Golf Links of America, are highly regarded.\n\n**Design:**\n\nOld Macdonald features a retro-style design, with hole templates inspired by some of the most famous links courses in Scotland. The course is built on a sandy, gently sloping site, which allows for natural drainage and firm, fast playing conditions. The layout is designed to encourage strategic play, with wide, rolling fairways, deep bunkers, and undulating greens.\n\n**Unique Features:**\n\n* **Template Holes:** Each hole is inspired by a specific hole from a famous Scottish links course. For example, the 3rd hole is a nod to the 11th at St. Andrews, while the 14th hole is inspired by the 17th at North Berwick.\n* **Blind Shots:** Old Macdonald features several blind shots, where players must hit their approach shots over hills or ridges, without seeing the green. This adds an element of strategy and challenge to the game.\n* **Retro-Style Bunkering:** The course features deep, revetted bunkers, similar to those found on traditional links courses. These bunkers are designed to penalize wayward shots, but also provide a unique aesthetic to the course.\n* **Undulating Greens:** The greens at Old Macdonald are designed to be fast and undulating, with subtle breaks and borrows. This demands precision and control from players.\n\n**Playability:**\n\nOld Macdonald is designed to be enjoyable for players of all skill levels. The course offers multiple tee boxes, allowing players to choose the level of challenge they prefer. The fairways are generally wide, and the rough is not overly punishing, making it accessible to mid-to-high handicappers. However, the strategic design and challenging greens ensure that better players will still find it a test of their skills.\n\n**Tee Boxes:**\n\nOld Macdonald offers five sets of tees, ranging from 4,275 yards to 6,944 yards. The course is designed to be playable from any set of tees, but the back tees provide the most challenging experience.\n\nOverall, Old Macdonald is a unique and fascinating course that will appeal to anyone who loves links golf. Its retro-style design, strategic play, and challenging greens make it a must-play at Bandon Dunes.",
