Plan games or activities: Plan some games or activities that are related to your theme. It could be a trivia game, charades, or even a scavenger hunt. These activities will help break the ice and create a fun atmosphere.\n\n2. Have a guest speaker or performer: If you want to add some entertainment value to your dinner party, hire a guest speaker or performer that fits with your theme. For example, if you're hosting a dinner party with a '60s theme, you could hire a guest speaker that talks about the history of the era or a performer that sings popular songs from that time.\n\n3. Create a DIY station: Set up a DIY station where guests can make their own cocktails or desserts. This will not only engage guests but also provide them with an interactive experience.\n\n4. Allow time for socializing: Don't forget to allow time for socializing throughout the night. Encourage guests to mingle and get to know each other by providing designated seating areas or even a networking game.\n\n5. Surprise your guests: Surprise your guests with unexpected elements that are related to your theme. For example, you could create a dance-off competition for a Bollywood-themed party or arrange for a magician to perform tricks throughout the evening.\n\nIncorporating these suggestions will help create a memorable and engaging dinner party for your guests.",
