  "content": "When particles in solids, liquids, and gases are heated, their behavior also differs drastically. \n\nIn solids, when they are heated, the particles will absorb the energy from the heat, and this energy will cause the particles to vibrate more and move further apart. This increase in particle movement and volume will cause the solid to expand. \n\nIn liquids, when they are heated, the energy from the heat will cause the particles to move faster, which also means they will collide with each other more frequently. This increased movement and collisions between particles can cause the liquid to boil and turn into a gas. \n\nIn gases, when they are heated, the particles will gain energy and move faster, which increases their kinetic energy. This increased kinetic energy will cause the particles to collide more frequently, and this will cause the gas to expand further. If enough heat is added, molecules in a gas can ionize, or become charged, and form a plasma.\n\nOverall, heating can cause solids, liquids, and gases to change in volume and behavior in different ways.",
