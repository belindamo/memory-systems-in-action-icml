  "content": "Yes, the portrayal of AI in media and film over time does reflect our changing attitudes and comfort levels with technology.\n\nAs technology has become more integrated into our daily lives and we have become more familiar with it, our attitudes towards AI have shifted. We have become more accepting of the idea of intelligent machines, and even see them as potential partners or helpers.\n\nMedia depictions of AI have also evolved in response to this changing attitude. More recent portrayals of AI have explored the potential benefits of the technology, while also examining the ethical and moral implications.\n\nOverall, our growing comfort with technology has likely contributed to the changing portrayal of AI in media. As we become more comfortable with and dependent on technology in our daily lives, we are better equipped to consider the possibilities and consequences of AI development.",
