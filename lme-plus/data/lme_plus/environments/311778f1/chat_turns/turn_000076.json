Witty, clever, and full of clever wordplay.\n2. **Red Dwarf** by Grant Naylor: A comedic sci-fi series based on the popular TV show. Follow the misadventures of the last human alive and a hologram of his dead bunkmate on a mining spaceship.\n3. **To Say Nothing of the Dog** by Connie Willis: A comedic time-travel novel that's part romp, part satire. A historian gets stuck in Victorian England and hilarity ensues.\n4. **The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul** by Douglas Adams: Another Douglas Adams book, this one a detective novel with a sci-fi twist. Follow Dirk Gently, a \"holistic detective,\" as he solves a murder mystery involving time travel and Norse gods.\n5. **Old Man's War** by John Scalzi: A fun, lighthearted sci-fi novel about seniors who join the military to fight in an intergalactic war. Think \"The Expendables\" in space.\n6. **The Starchild Trilogy** by Frederik Pohl and Jack Williamson: A humorous sci-fi series that follows the adventures of a human who's abducted by aliens and becomes embroiled in their intergalactic politics.\n7. **Bill, the Galactic Hero** by Harry Harrison: A comedic novel that spoofs the traditional space opera. Follow Bill, a young man who's drafted into the military and becomes a hero despite himself.\n8. **The Colour of Magic** by Terry Pratchett: While not strictly sci-fi, this fantasy novel has a similar tone and humor to \"The Hitchhiker's Guide.\" Follow the misadventures of a hapless wizard and his tourist on the Discworld.\n9. **Agent to the Stars** by John Scalzi: A humorous novel about a Hollywood agent who's recruited by an alien species to help them with their intergalactic PR.\n10. **Space Opera** by Catherynne M. Valente: A comedic novel that sends up the sci-fi genre, following a washed-up rockstar who's recruited to represent Earth in an intergalactic singing competition.\n\nThese books all share some of the same irreverent humor, wit, and playfulness that make \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" so beloved.
