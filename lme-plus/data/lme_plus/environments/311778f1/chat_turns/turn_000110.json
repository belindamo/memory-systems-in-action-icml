Now, about the ratio of nuts to seeds to oats, it's largely a matter of personal preference, but here are some general guidelines to get you started:\n\n**Classic Granola Ratio:**\n\n* 2 parts oats : 1 part nuts : 1 part seeds\n\nFor example:\n\n* 2 cups oats\n* 1 cup mixed nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans)\n* 1 cup mixed seeds (sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds)\n\n**Nuts-Forward Granola:**\n\n* 2 parts oats : 1.5 parts nuts : 0.5 parts seeds\n\nFor example:\n\n* 2 cups oats\n* 1.5 cups mixed nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans)\n* 0.5 cup mixed seeds (sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds)\n\n**Seed-Heavy Granola:**\n\n* 2 parts oats : 1 part seeds : 0.5 parts nuts\n\nFor example:\n\n* 2 cups oats\n* 1 cup mixed seeds (sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds)\n* 0.5 cup mixed nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans)\n\nFeel free to adjust these ratios to suit your taste preferences. If you prefer a chunkier granola, add more nuts and seeds. If you like a lighter, more oaty granola, increase the oats and reduce the nuts and seeds.\n\nWhen adding dried fruits like cranberries or cherries, start with a small amount (about 1/4 cup) and mix them in after the granola has cooled. This will help preserve their texture and flavor.\n\n**Tips for Working with Coconut Oil:**\n\n* Coconut oil has a high smoke point, making it ideal for high-heat cooking.\n* Use refined coconut oil for a neutral flavor or virgin coconut oil for a distinct coconut flavor.\n* Coconut oil can add a richness to your granola, so you may want to reduce the amount of nuts and seeds accordingly.\n\n**Tips for Adding Dried Fruits:**\n\n* Choose unsweetened and unsulphured dried fruits to avoid added sugars and preservatives.\n* Cranberries and cherries work well because they're tart and sweet, but you can experiment with other fruits like apricots, raisins, or apples.\n* If using dried fruits, you may want to reduce the amount of honey or sweetener in your recipe.\n\nRemember, the key to making great granola is to experiment and find the combination that you enjoy the most. Don't be afraid to try new ingredients and ratios to create your perfect blend!",
