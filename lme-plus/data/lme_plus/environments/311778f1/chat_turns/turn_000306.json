  "content": "Applying machine learning to your work projects sounds like an exciting goal!\n\nRegarding tracking your Netflix screen time, I'm happy to help. Netflix doesn't provide a direct way to track screen time, but I can offer a few workarounds:\n\n**Method 1: Netflix Viewing History**\n\n1. Sign in to your Netflix account on a web browser.\n2. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner, then select \"Account.\"\n3. Scroll down to the \"Settings\" section and click on \"Viewing activity.\"\n4. You'll see a list of everything you've watched, including the date and time. You can use this to estimate your screen time.\n\n**Method 2: Third-Party Browser Extensions**\n\n1. Install a browser extension like **Netflix Tracker** (Chrome) or **Netflix Watch History** (Firefox).\n2. These extensions will track your Netflix viewing history, including the time spent watching.\n3. Note that these extensions might not be 100% accurate, as they rely on your browser's history.\n\n**Method 3: Mobile Apps**\n\n1. If you watch Netflix on your mobile device, you can use apps like **Screen Time** (iOS) or **Digital Wellbeing** (Android) to track your screen time.\n2. These apps can provide a more accurate picture of your overall screen time, including Netflix usage.\n\n**Method 4: Manual Tracking**\n\n1. Keep a log or spreadsheet to manually track your Netflix screen time.\n2. Each time you finish watching a documentary or show, note down the time spent watching.\n3. This method requires discipline, but it's a simple way to keep track of your screen time.\n\nTo estimate your screen time for last month, you can try Method 1 or Method 2. If you're concerned about your screen time in general, Method 3 or Method 4 might be a better fit.\n\nNow, back to machine learning! What specific tasks or predictions do you want to automate or make with machine learning in your work projects?",
