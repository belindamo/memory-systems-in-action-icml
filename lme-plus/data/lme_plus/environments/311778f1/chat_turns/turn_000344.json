  "content": "Yes, scholars use a range of methods to discern multiple sources that may have contributed to a particular letter, including examining the writing style, vocabulary, and themes present in the text.\n\nFor example, in the case of 1 Corinthians, scholars have found differences in writing style and vocabulary between chapters 1-9 and 10-16, suggesting that they may have been written by separate sources. Additionally, the presence of a rhetorical structure in these chapters indicates that they may have been adaptations of earlier speeches or sermons.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of the book of Hebrews, scholars have identified distinct differences in writing style and content compared to other letters traditionally attributed to Paul, leading them to conclude that it was likely written by someone else. Additionally, Hebrews contains references and allusions to the Old Testament that are specific to a particular Jewish tradition, indicating that the author may have come from that tradition.\n\nOverall, while it can be difficult to definitively establish the authorship of ancient texts, scholars use a range of methods to identify possible sources and contextual factors that may have influenced their composition.",
