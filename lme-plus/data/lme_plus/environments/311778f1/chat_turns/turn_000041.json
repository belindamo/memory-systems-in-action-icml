No need more any comments.\n\nAirbnb in 2020\n\nirbnb was started in 2008 when Brian Chesky and a friend decided to rent their apartment to guests for a local convention. To accommo-\ndate the guests, they used air mattresses and referred to it as the \u201cAir Bed & Breakfast.\u201d It was that week- end when the idea\u2014and the potential viability\u2014of a peer-to-peer room-sharing business model was born. During its 12-year existence, Airbnb has experienced immense growth and success. With a planned IPO at some point during 2020, Airbnb had been in a strong position to continue revolutionizing the hotel and tourism industry through its business model that allowed hosts to offer spare rooms or entire homes to potential guests in a peer-reviewed digital market- place; yet, a global pandemic in the first half of 2020 seemed ready to derail Airbnb\u2019s success.\nIn 2018, the room-sharing company was in approximately 190 countries with more than 4 million listed properties and had an estimated valu- ation of $31 billion. By 2020, Airbnb had entered over 220 countries with more than 7 million loca- tions. Airbnb\u2019s business model has been successful by leveraging what is known as the sharing economy. As it grew, however, Airbnb\u2019s business model was met with resistance. City officials and owners and operators of hotels, motels, and bed and breakfasts complained that, unlike traditional brick-and-mortar establishments that were subject to regulations and taxation, Airbnb hosts were able to circumvent and avoid such liabilities due to participation in Airbnb\u2019s digital marketplace. In other instances, Airbnb hosts had encountered legal issues due to city and state ordinances governing hotels and apartment leases. Yet, an existential crisis for Airbnb now loomed due to the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Many hosts were using Airbnb revenue to either subsidize their mortgage payments or had purchased properties that depended solely on the revenue driven through booked accommodations. As people across the world sheltered in-place and travel restrictions were imple- mented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, Airbnb and its hosts were left to navigate an uncertain travel and accommodation market with a business model that depends on everyday people sharing their own, at times, private homes.",
