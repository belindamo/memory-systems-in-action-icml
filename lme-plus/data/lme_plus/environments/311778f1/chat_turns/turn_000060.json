Procurement of advanced weapon systems: Australian defence spending has enabled the Army to procure advanced weapon systems such as F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, Hawkei protected vehicles, and Boxer combat reconnaissance vehicles. These platforms provide the Army with a competitive edge in modern warfare.\n\n2. Upgrading existing equipment: The Australian Army has also used defence spending to upgrade its existing equipment. For instance, the Army has upgraded its fleet of Black Hawk helicopters with new engines, sensors, and avionics to enhance its capabilities.\n\n3. Research and development: Defence spending has provided the Army with funding to invest in research and development of new technologies. This has led to the development of technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and defence satellites.\n\n4. Improved communication networks: The Army's communication networks have been improved through defence spending. This has enabled soldiers to communicate and coordinate more effectively in the field.\n\n5.
