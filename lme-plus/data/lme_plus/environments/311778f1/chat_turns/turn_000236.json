  "content": "I think there's some confusion again! As I mentioned earlier, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I wasn't present at any workshop with Dr. Smith. You didn't attend a workshop with me, and I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me.\n\nHowever, it's great that you're recalling the importance of creating a clear research question or thesis statement before outlining! This is a crucial step in the research writing process. A clear research question or thesis statement serves as a guide for your entire project, helping you stay focused and ensure that your argument or research is coherent and well-structured.\n\nIf you don't have notes from a workshop, you can still apply this principle to your current project. Take some time to craft a clear and concise research question or thesis statement that summarizes the main argument or point of your paper. This will help you clarify your thoughts, identify gaps in your knowledge, and create a roadmap for your research.\n\nRemember, a good research question or thesis statement should be specific, focused, and arguable. It should also be concise and easy to understand. If you're struggling to craft a clear research question or thesis statement, try breaking it down into smaller components, such as:\n\n* What is the main topic or issue you're exploring?\n* What is the specific aspect of the topic you're investigating?\n* What is the central argument or claim you're making?\n* What are the implications or significance of your research?\n\nBy answering these questions, you'll be well on your way to creating a clear research question or thesis statement that will guide your writing and help you produce a well-structured and coherent paper.",
