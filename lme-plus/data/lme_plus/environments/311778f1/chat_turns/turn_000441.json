I can always expand to other review types later.\n\nFor the sentiment analysis model, I'm interested in exploring machine learning models. I've had some experience with scikit-learn, so I'll likely start with that. However, I'm open to exploring other options, like deep learning models, if they prove to be more effective.\n\nNow that we have a better idea of the project's direction, what's the next step? Should I start designing the user interface, setting up the backend, or working on the sentiment analysis model?",
