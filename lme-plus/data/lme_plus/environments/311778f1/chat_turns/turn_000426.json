Here are some recommendations for coffee and tea that are suitable for new moms:\n\n**Coffee:**\n\n1. **Medium to Light Roast**: A medium to light roast coffee is a good choice, as it's less likely to be too overwhelming or bitter. Look for a roast with notes of chocolate, caramel, or nuts.\n2. **Single-Serve Cups**: Consider bringing single-serve cups or a bag of ground coffee that can be easily brewed in a coffee maker. This way, Rachel can enjoy a fresh cup whenever she needs it.\n3. **Decaf Option**: It's a good idea to bring a decaf option as well, in case Rachel is breastfeeding or sensitive to caffeine.\n\n**Tea:**\n\n1. **Herbal Teas**: Herbal teas like peppermint, chamomile, or raspberry leaf tea are great options for new moms. They're caffeine-free, soothing, and can help with relaxation and milk production.\n2. **Black or Green Tea**: If Rachel prefers a caffeinated tea, a mild black or green tea can be a good choice. Look for a blend that's low in caffeine and high in antioxidants.\n3. **Tea Bags or Loose-Leaf**: Bring a box of tea bags or a bag of loose-leaf tea, along with a tea infuser if needed. This way, Rachel can easily brew a cup whenever she likes.\n\n**Special Considerations:**\n\n1. **Lactation Tea**: If you want to bring a tea that's specifically designed to support breastfeeding, look for a lactation tea blend that contains herbs like fenugreek, blessed thistle, or oat straw.\n2. **Postpartum Recovery Tea**: Some teas, like red raspberry leaf tea or nettle tea, are specifically designed to support postpartum recovery and healing.\n\nRemember to pack your coffee or tea in a cute container or bag, along with some sweet treats, and don't forget to include a thoughtful note or card to make it an extra-special gift.",
