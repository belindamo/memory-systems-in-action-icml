This will give me a solid foundation for the rest of the project.\n\nBefore I dive in, I just wanted to ask: Are there any specific resources or libraries that you would recommend for collecting and preprocessing the dataset? I've worked with datasets before, but I'm not familiar with any specific libraries or tools for collecting and preprocessing text data.\n\nAlso, do you have any advice on how to ensure the dataset is balanced? I've heard that an imbalanced dataset can lead to biased models, but I'm not sure how to address this issue.",
