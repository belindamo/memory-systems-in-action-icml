Suddenly, a massive tentacle shoots out of the water and grabs Matt, pulling him into the depths below. You hear a deafening roar as a giant kraken emerges from the water, its many tentacles writhing and flailing.\n\nJames: \"We need to get out of here!\"\n\nJacob: \"But we can't just leave Matt behind!\"\n\nDM Ben: The kraken lashes out with its tentacles, attacking the party. Roll for initiative.\n\nJames rolls a 14.\n\nJacob rolls a 9.\n\nKraken rolls a 19.\n\nDM Ben: The kraken goes first. It swings its tentacle at James, getting a 23 to hit.\n\nDM Ben: James, you take 18 bludgeoning damage. What do you do?\n\nJames: \"I attack the kraken with my sword!\"\n\nJames rolls to hit and gets a 16.\n\nDM Ben: That hits! Roll for damage.\n\nJames rolls a 12.\n\nDM Ben: Your sword slashes into one of the kraken's tentacles. Jacob, it's your turn.\n\nJacob: \"I cast Sacred Flame on the kraken!\"\n\nJacob rolls to hit and gets a 17.\n\nDM Ben: That hits! Roll for damage.\n\nJacob rolls a 9.\n\nDM Ben: Your divine flame sears one of the kraken's tentacles. The kraken thrashes in pain and takes 9 radiant damage. The kraken attacks again, this time going for Jacob with a tentacle strike. It rolls a 24 to hit.\n\nDM Ben: Jacob, you take 21 bludgeoning damage. Matt's lifeless body floats to the surface. The kraken is still alive and angry. James and Jacob, what do you do?",
