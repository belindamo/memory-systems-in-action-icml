      "content": "The steering wheel angle of a car is typically converted to the actual wheel angle through a process called Ackermann steering geometry. This process uses the principle of parallel steering, where the inner wheel on a turn must rotate through a smaller angle than the outer wheel. The specific calculations for the conversion will depend on the make and model of the car, as well as the steering system used. The steering ratio, which is the ratio of steering wheel rotation to wheel rotation, is usually provided in the car's specifications and can be used to make the conversion."

      "content": "Track width is the distance between the center of the left wheel and the center of the right wheel on the same axle of a vehicle. This measurement is typically taken on the front wheels of a vehicle, as the track width can affect the handling and stability of a car. A wider track width can provide better stability, while a narrower track width can make a car more agile. It is also called wheelbase, it is the distance between the center of the front wheel and the center of the rear wheel."

      "content": "The turning circle, also known as the \"turning radius,\" is the diameter of the smallest circle that a vehicle can turn around within. It is the distance between the center of the front wheel and the point at which the front wheel makes contact with the ground as the vehicle completes a full U-turn. The turning circle is an important measurement in determining the maneuverability of a vehicle, specifically in tight spaces like parking lots or narrow roads.\n\nIt is calculated by turning the steering wheel to the maximum lock and measuring the distance between the center of the front wheel and the point at which the front wheel makes contact with the ground as the vehicle completes a full U-turn. The turning circle is usually provided in the vehicle's specifications and is usually measured in feet or meters."

      "content": "Most private cars use Ackermann steering geometry, which is a type of steering geometry that uses the principle of parallel steering. In Ackermann steering, the inner wheel on a turn must rotate through a smaller angle than the outer wheel. This is achieved by linking the steering mechanism to the wheels in such a way that the steering linkage is angled so that the inner wheel points more directly at the center of the turn than the outer wheel.\n\nAckermann geometry is a simple and efficient solution that allows for good stability and handling while also keeping the tire wear at minimum. The design is widely used in almost all types of vehicles, including passenger cars, trucks, buses and even some heavy equipment. It is a simple and efficient solution that allows for good stability and handling while also keeping the tire wear at minimum.\n\nIt's worth noting that, some high-performance cars and race cars use a different type of steering geometry called \"four-wheel steering\" or \"active steering\" which are more advanced and complex than Ackermann geometry. They use sensors and computers to adjust the angle of the wheels, providing better handling and maneuverability at high speeds."

      "content": "To calculate the path of a car based on the steering wheel angle or wheel angle, you can use the concept of radius of curvature. The radius of curvature is the radius of a circle that the vehicle is following as it turns. The smaller the radius of curvature, the tighter the turn, and the larger the radius of curvature, the wider the turn.\n\nTo calculate the radius of curvature using the steering wheel angle, you can use the following formula:\n\nRadius of curvature = (Track width / 2) / tan (Wheel angle / 2)\n\nWhere:\n\n* Track width is the distance between the center of the left wheel and the center of the right wheel on the same axle of a vehicle.\n* Wheel angle is the angle of the wheels in degrees.\n* tan is the trigonometric function that returns the tangent of an angle.\n\nTo calculate the radius of curvature using the steering wheel angle, you can use the following formula:\n\nRadius of curvature = (Track width / 2) / tan (Steering wheel angle / 2 \\* Steering Ratio)\n\nWhere:\n\n* Track width is the distance between the center of the left wheel and the center of the right wheel on the same axle of a vehicle.\n* Steering wheel angle is the angle of the steering wheel in degrees.\n* Steering ratio is the ratio of the number of degrees the steering wheel is turned to the number of degrees the wheels turn.\n* tan is the trigonometric function that returns the tangent of an angle.\n\nOnce you have the radius of curvature, you can use it to calculate the path of the car.
