A historian gets stuck in Victorian England and hilarity ensues.\n4. **The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul** by Douglas Adams: Another Douglas Adams book, this one a detective novel with a sci-fi twist. Follow Dirk Gently, a \"holistic detective,\" as he solves a murder mystery involving time travel and Norse gods.\n5. **Old Man's War** by John Scalzi: A fun, lighthearted sci-fi novel about seniors who join the military to fight in an intergalactic war.

      "content": "\"Good Omens\" is a fantastic choice. You'll love the witty banter between Aziraphale and Crowley.\n\nRegarding audiobook narrators, I'm happy to help! Some narrators are indeed better suited for faster playback speeds than others. Here are some popular narrators known for their clear, engaging, and easy-to-follow styles, which should work well at faster speeds:\n\n1. **Stephen Fry**: His narration of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" is iconic, and he's also excellent in \"Good Omens\". His voice is soothing, clear, and well-paced.\n2. **Wil Wheaton**: Known for his geeky enthusiasm, Wil's narration is engaging, energetic, and easy to follow. He's narrated books like \"Ready Player One\" and \"The Collapsing Empire\".\n3. **John Lee**: A prolific narrator with a wide range of genres under his belt, John's voice is smooth, clear, and well-suited for faster playback speeds. Try him in \"The Lies of Locke Lamora\" or \"The First Law\" trilogy.\n4. **Scott Brick**: With a deep, resonant voice, Scott's narration is often described as \"movie-like\".
