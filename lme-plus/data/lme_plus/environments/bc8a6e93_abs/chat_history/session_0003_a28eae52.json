      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "When upgrading to coilovers, it's essential to ensure that your wheels can accommodate the new suspension setup. Here's what you need to consider:\n\n**Clearance and Offset:**\n\n* **Clearance:** The KW V3 coilovers have a larger diameter and a more aggressive design compared to the OEM suspension. This means you'll need to ensure your wheels have sufficient clearance to accommodate the new coilovers. You'll want to check the wheel's inner diameter and the distance from the hub to the wheel's center to ensure there's enough room for the coilover's piston rod and spring.\n* **Offset:** The offset of your wheels might need to be adjusted to accommodate the new coilovers. KW V3 coilovers often require a more aggressive offset to improve handling and reduce scrub radius. If your current wheels have a high offset, you might need to switch to wheels with a lower offset or consider using wheel spacers to achieve the desired offset.\n\n**Wheel Specifications:**\n\n* **Width and diameter:** The KW V3 coilovers are designed to work with wheels that are at least 18 inches in diameter and 9-10 inches wide. If your current wheels are smaller, you might need to upgrade to a larger wheel to accommodate the new suspension.\n* **Hub bore:** The hub bore of your wheels needs to match the hub diameter of your Mustang GT's wheels. KW V3 coilovers come with a 72.56mm hub bore, which is the standard diameter for most Mustang GT wheels.\n\n**Upgrading or Reusing Wheels:**\n\n* **Reusing wheels:** If your current wheels meet the clearance, offset, and specification requirements, you might be able to reuse them with the KW V3 coilovers. However, you'll need to ensure the wheels are in good condition and can handle the increased forces and stresses generated by the new suspension.\n* **Upgrading wheels:** If your current wheels don't meet the requirements or are showing signs of wear, it's a good opportunity to upgrade to wheels that are specifically designed for track performance. Look for wheels with a strong, lightweight design, and a suitable offset and width to accommodate the KW V3 coilovers.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I recommend consulting with a suspension expert or a reputable wheel supplier to ensure your wheels can accommodate the KW V3 coilovers. They can help you determine the best course of action and suggest wheels that meet the necessary specifications.\n\nRemember to also consider other factors, such as tire selection, when upgrading your suspension and wheels. A good set of track-focused tires will help you get the most out of your new coilovers and wheels."
