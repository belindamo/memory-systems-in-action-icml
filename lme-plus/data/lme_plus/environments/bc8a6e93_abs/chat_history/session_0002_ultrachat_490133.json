The strategy also emphasized the importance of multilateral forums such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Japan-U.S. security alliance in promoting regional stability and security.\n\nThe current maritime security strategy of Japan, which was first announced in 2013, has three key components:\n\n1. Active contribution to peace: Japan aims to contribute to regional peace and stability by pursuing diplomacy, promoting economic development, and actively participating in international peacekeeping operations.\n\n2. Protecting Japan's territorial integrity and territorial waters: Japan seeks to safeguard its sovereignty by strengthening its defense capabilities, enhancing its maritime surveillance capabilities, and developing a robust amphibious defense capability.\n\n3.

Japan aims to promote international norms, such as freedom of navigation, while also seeking to address challenges such as piracy and terrorism.\n\nOverall, Japan's maritime strategy seeks to balance deterrence and diplomacy, while promoting cooperation and collaboration with other countries to promote regional peace and stability."
