However, some examples of policies that local governments can implement to promote sustainability in urban development include:\n\n1. Green building codes - mandates or incentives for developers to use sustainable building practices, energy-efficient materials, and renewable energy sources.\n\n2. Transit-oriented development - planning and zoning policies that encourage walkable communities, access to public transit, and reduced reliance on cars.\n\n3. Stormwater management - policies that require developers to implement green infrastructure techniques such as green roofs, permeable pavement, or rain gardens to manage stormwater runoff.\n\n4. Habitat protection - measures to conserve natural habitats and wildlife through the preservation of green spaces, the restoration of degraded ecosystems, or the creation of new habitats.\n\n5. Sustainable transportation - policies that encourage the use of alternative transportation modes such as biking, walking, or electric vehicles.\n\n6. Waste reduction - policies that promote recycling, composting and offer incentives for waste reduction as well as better waste management practices during and after construction. \n\n7.
