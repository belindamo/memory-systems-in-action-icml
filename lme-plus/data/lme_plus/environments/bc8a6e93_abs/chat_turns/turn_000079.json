  "content": "That's great to hear that limiting your social media use has been helpful for your productivity! I'd be happy to help you set reminders and notifications for your daily routine.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your daily routine and what tasks and appointments you'd like to set reminders for? For example:\n\n* What time do you wake up and go to bed?\n* Do you have any fixed appointments or commitments, such as work or school?\n* Are there any specific tasks you need to complete daily, such as exercise, studying, or household chores?\n* Are there any specific times you want to allocate for focused work or breaks?\n\nAdditionally, do you have a preferred method for receiving reminders and notifications? For example, do you use a physical planner, a digital calendar like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar, or a task management app like Todoist or Trello?\n\nLet me know and I can help you set up a system that works for you!",
