Here are some tips to help you manage irregular income:\n\n**Include it in your income tracker:**\n\n* Yes, include irregular income in your income tracker, but consider the following:\n\t+ If you receive freelance work or sell items online regularly, you can estimate an average monthly income from these sources and add it to your income tracker.\n\t+ If the income is highly variable or unpredictable, you might want to create a separate category for \"irregular income\" or \"side hustles\" to track it separately.\n\n**Account for variability:**\n\n* Since irregular income can be unpredictable, it's essential to account for the variability:\n\t+ Consider creating a \"buffer\" or a small emergency fund to cover months when irregular income is lower than expected.\n\t+ Review your budget regularly to adjust your spending based on the actual irregular income you receive.\n\n**Set aside a portion for taxes:**\n\n* As a freelancer or online seller, you're responsible for paying taxes on your earnings. Set aside a portion of your irregular income for taxes to avoid a surprise tax bill:\n\t+ Aim to set aside 25-30% of your irregular income for federal income taxes, depending on your tax bracket.\n\t+ Consider consulting a tax professional or accountant to determine the best approach for your specific situation.\n\n**Consider a separate fund:**\n\n* If you receive irregular income regularly, you might want to create a separate fund or account specifically for it:\n\t+ This can help you keep your irregular income separate from your regular income and make it easier to track and manage.\n\t+ You can also use this fund to save for taxes, business expenses, or other related costs.\n\nHere's an example of how you could track irregular income in your spreadsheet:\n\n**Income**\n\n| **Date** | **Income Source** | **Amount** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 01/15/2023 | Freelance Work | $1,000 |\n| 01/20/2023 | Online Sales | $500 |\n| 02/01/2023 | Freelance Work | $800 |\n\n**Irregular Income (Average Monthly)**\n\n| **Category** | **Average Monthly Amount** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Freelance Work | $1,200 |\n| Online Sales | $800 |\n\nBy including irregular income in your income tracker and accounting for its variability, you'll be better equipped to manage your finances and make informed decisions about your budget.\n\nRemember to review and adjust your approach as needed, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions or need further guidance!",
