As you continue to track your expenses, we can refine the table and get a better picture of your spending habits.\n\nRemember, the goal is to get a general idea of your spending patterns, so don't worry too much about exact figures from previous months. We can work with estimates and adjust as needed.\n\nNow, let's focus on tracking your expenses for the current month and beyond!",
