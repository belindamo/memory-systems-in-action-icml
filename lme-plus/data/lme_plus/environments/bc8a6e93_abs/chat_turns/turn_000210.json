However, I can tell you that the U.S. government has been actively exploring the use of blockchain technology for various purposes over the past few years. Many procurement and pilot projects are still ongoing and vendors are still being selected. The specifics of procurement, including the vendors and the years, are often not publicly disclosed, so it may be difficult to find such information.\n\nIt's worth noting that when it comes to blockchain technology, the U.S. government has been generally cautious in procuring services, and has been mostly focused on researching and piloting the technology, rather than implementing it on a large scale.",
