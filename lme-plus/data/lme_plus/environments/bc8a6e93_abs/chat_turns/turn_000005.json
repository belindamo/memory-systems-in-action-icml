Set a bedtime routine: Establishing a bedtime routine can help your brain and body prepare for sleep. Avoid using technology or social media at least one hour before bedtime.\n\n2. Charge your phone outside your bedroom: When you charge your phone outside your bedroom, you\u2019re less likely to look at it before sleep.\n\n3. Read a book or listen to music instead: Instead of scrolling through social media, pick up a book, listen to calming music, read a magazine or even an article in a newspaper, or do anything that you find relaxing.\n\n4. Practice meditation or breathing exercises: Meditation and relaxation techniques can help you calm your mind before sleep.\n\n5. Enable nighttime modes or blue light filters on your devices: These software settings can help reduce the amount of blue light emitted by your screen, making it easier for your eyes to rest before bed.\n\n6. Set a timer: You might want to limit your use of social media before bed by setting a timer for 10-20 minutes. When the timer goes off, put the phone away and start doing something else, like reading or relaxation exercises.\n\nRemember, breaking a habit takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself as you work to change your behavior. Over time, you'll notice that you're feeling better and sleeping better too.",
