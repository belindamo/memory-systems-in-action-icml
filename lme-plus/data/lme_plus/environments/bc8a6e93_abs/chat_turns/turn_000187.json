  "content": "As Deltor, you lead the elite Knights Errant SWAT team along with Detective Petrov, infiltrating the abandoned factory where Bauer and his associates are believed to be hiding. The lighter equipped forces have successfully set up a security perimeter around the factory, and the operation so far is progressing unnoticed by the criminals.\n\nYou give the signal, and the team moves out, making their way towards the factory's main entrance. You approach the door, and with a quick motion, you breach it open. You throw a couple of flashbangs into the vast hall of the abandoned factory that lies beyond it, disorienting anyone inside.\n\nThe SWAT team moves in quickly, weapons at the ready. You can hear the sound of footsteps and shouting as the team engages any guards or associates that are present. The team moves through the factory, clearing each room, and making their way to the basement where Bauer is believed to be hiding.\n\nYou follow closely behind, keeping your weapon at the ready. The factory is dimly lit and filled with debris, making it difficult to see. The team moves quickly and efficiently, neutralizing any resistance they encounter.\n\nAs you reach the basement, you can hear the sound of gunfire and shouting. You give the signal, and the team moves in, ready to capture Bauer and his associates and put an end to their criminal activities.",
