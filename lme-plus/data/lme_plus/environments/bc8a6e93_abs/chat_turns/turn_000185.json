  "content": "As Deltor, you prepare for the raid by putting on your body armor and tactical helmet. You check your Ares SIGMA-3, a reliable and powerful semi-automatic handgun, which has served you well in many situations. You take a deep breath and mentally prepare yourself for what's to come.\n\nYou join the rest of the team, who are also getting ready. The SWAT team members are checking their weapons, and the uniformed officers are putting on their body armor and helmets. The team is focused, and you can sense the tension in the air.\n\nYou do a quick briefing with the team, reminding them of the plan, the layout of the factory, and the objectives. You remind them to be cautious and to prioritize the safety of the hostages, if any. The team nods in understanding, ready to move out. You give the signal and the team moves out, ready to neutralize any resistance and bring Bauer and his associates to justice.",
