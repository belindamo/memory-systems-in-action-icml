He has a long criminal record, but this is the first time he's been connected to something as serious as this. Our informant tells us that Bauer is hiding out in one of the abandoned factories on the outskirts of the city, we think he might be manufacturing the drug there as well.\n\n\"Our next steps are to gather a team, and raid the factory. We need to catch Bauer and his associates and put a stop to this crime wave. We also need to find any evidence that can connect him to the murders. We need to move fast, before Bauer and his gang have the chance to destroy any evidence or escape.\"\n\nAs part of Knight Errant, you and Detective Petrov are responsible for maintaining law and order in New Berlin.
