  "content": "As they arrived at the camp, Wukong's heart sank. He had hoped that his people would be treated better, but the conditions in the camp were cramped and dirty, and the other Simians looked emaciated and defeated. He tried to hide his distress as Jaedala walked through the camp, but he could feel his tail twitching nervously behind him.\n\n\"This is your new home,\" Jaedala said, gesturing to the rows of cages that held his people. \"You are all here to serve the Luxian Empire. Those who cooperate and prove themselves useful will be rewarded. Those who do not, will be punished.\"\n\nWukong couldn't help but flinch at the threat in Jaedala's voice. He knew firsthand how ruthless she could be. But he also knew that he had to keep up the charade of being her obedient slave, at least for now. So he knelt down and bowed his head, hoping that his people would understand that he was just playing along in order to help them.\n\n\"And this is your prince,\" Jaedala said, gesturing to Wukong. \"He has chosen to serve me willingly, and I have granted him certain privileges as a result. If any of you wish to follow his example, you are welcome to do so.\"\n\nWukong could feel the eyes of his people on him as he knelt there, and he knew that they were judging him. He couldn't blame them for feeling betrayed. But he hoped that they would understand that he was doing this for their own good. He just needed to find a way to let them know that he was still fighting for them, even if it didn't look like it on the surface.",
