It's a fantastic addition to your day at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\nAfter re-examining your schedule, I recommend fitting in the Animal Actors Show during your lunch break. Here's an updated plan:\n\n**Lunch Break (12:00 PM - 1:30 PM)**\n\n1. Take a break and grab lunch at one of the many restaurants or food stands throughout the park.\n2. Head to the Animal Actors Show, located in the Upper Lot area. The show typically runs every 30-40 minutes, so you can plan your lunch break around the show schedule.\n3. Enjoy the Animal Actors Show, which features animal stars from popular movies and TV shows.\n\nBy fitting in the Animal Actors Show during your lunch break, you'll still have time to grab a bite to eat and take a short rest before continuing your day. This adjustment shouldn't impact your ability to fit in the other attractions on your list.\n\nHere's the revised itinerary:\n\n**Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)**\n\n1. Arrive at the park early and head straight to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Hogsmeade).\n2. Use your Express Pass to ride:\n\t* Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey\n\t* Flight of the Hippogriff (if you're interested)\n3. Explore the Wizarding World, taking in the sights, sounds, and shopping experiences. Don't forget to try a Butterbeer or pumpkin fizz!\n4. Visit the nearby Springfield: Home of the Simpsons area for a quick photo op and a Duff Beer (if you're 21+, of course).\n\n**Lunch Break (12:00 PM - 1:30 PM)**\n\n1. Take a break and grab lunch at one of the many restaurants or food stands throughout the park.\n2. Head to the Animal Actors Show, located in the Upper Lot area.\n3. Enjoy the Animal Actors Show, which features animal stars from popular movies and TV shows.\n\n**Afternoon (1:30 PM - 4:00 PM)**\n\n1. Use your Express Pass to ride:\n\t* Revenge of the Mummy (indoor roller coaster)\n\t* Jurassic Park River Adventure (get ready to get wet!)\n2. Visit the nearby attractions:\n\t* Transformers: The Ride-3D\n\t* Springfield: Home of the Simpsons (if you didn't visit earlier)\n\n**Late Afternoon (4:00 PM - 6:00 PM)**\n\n1. Use your Express Pass to experience:\n\t* The Studio Tour (behind-the-scenes look at the working film studio)\n\t* King Kong 360 3-D (part of the Studio Tour)\n2. If time permits, fit in one more attraction or explore the Upper Lot area, which offers more shopping and dining options.\n\n**Evening (6:00 PM - 8:00 PM)**\n\n1. End your day by enjoying the evening atmosphere in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. You might catch some live music or street performances.\n2. If you have time, revisit a favorite attraction or explore an area you haven't seen yet.\n\nThis revised itinerary should allow you to fit in the Animal Actors Show while still experiencing all the other attractions on your list. Enjoy the show!",
