  "content": "Exactly! Using pork bones is not necessary, but it's definitely recommended for that rich, creamy, and authentic Tonkotsu flavor.\n\nUsing a combination of chicken and beef bones is a great idea! It can add a nice depth of flavor to your broth. Just be sure to adjust the cooking time and seasoning accordingly.\n\nNow, about dashi powder mixes...\n\nDashi powder mixes can be a convenient and time-saving option, especially for those new to Japanese cooking. They're available at most Asian markets or online. These mixes usually contain a blend of dried ingredients like Kombu seaweed, Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes), and other seasonings.\n\nWhile dashi powder mixes can work well in a pinch, I'd recommend making dashi from scratch for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Flavor**: Homemade dashi has a more nuanced, complex flavor profile compared to store-bought mixes. The slow simmering process allows the umami flavors to meld together beautifully.\n2. **Customization**: When you make dashi from scratch, you can adjust the ratio of Kombu to Katsuobushi to suit your taste preferences. You can also add other ingredients like Shiitake mushrooms or vegetables to create a unique flavor profile.\n3. **Quality control**: With homemade dashi, you have complete control over the quality of the ingredients and the cooking process. You can ensure that your dashi is made with high-quality Kombu and Katsuobushi, which can make a big difference in the final flavor.\n\nThat being said, if you're short on time or new to Japanese cooking, dashi powder mixes can be a good starting point. They can help you get a feel for the flavor profile and texture of dashi. Just be aware that the flavor might not be as rich and complex as homemade dashi.\n\nIf you do decide to use a dashi powder mix, be sure to follow the instructions carefully, and adjust the seasoning to taste. You can also try adding additional ingredients like soy sauce, mirin, or sake to enhance the flavor.\n\nRemember, making dashi from scratch is a relatively simple process that requires some patience and time. If you're interested, I can provide you with a simple recipe to get you started!",
