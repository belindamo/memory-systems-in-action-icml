Increased flexibility can:\n\n1. **Reduce muscle tension**: Tense muscles can lead to poor running form and decreased efficiency. By increasing flexibility, you can reduce muscle tension and maintain good form.\n2. **Improve stride length**: Increased flexibility in your hips, legs, and ankles can allow for a longer stride, which can help you cover more ground with each step.\n3. **Enhance running economy**: Flexible muscles and joints can help reduce the energy needed to move your body, allowing you to run more efficiently.\n4. **Reduce injury risk**: Improved flexibility can help reduce the risk of injuries, as your muscles and joints are better able to absorb the impact of running.\n\nIt's great that you've been doing some of the stretches daily. Consistency is key when it comes to improving flexibility. Consider incorporating dynamic stretches into your warm-up routine, such as leg swings, hip circles, and calf raises, to help prepare your muscles for running.\n\nRegarding your pre-race routine, it's great that you're aware of the impact of nerves and sleep on your performance. Here are a few tips to help you improve your pre-race routine:\n\n1. **Establish a consistent sleep schedule**: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including the night before the race. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and improve sleep quality.\n2. **Develop a relaxing pre-race routine**: Engage in activities that help you relax, such as reading, listening to music, or practicing gentle stretches. Avoid stimulating activities like watching TV or scrolling through your phone.\n3. **Visualize success**: Close your eyes and visualize yourself performing well in the race. Imagine yourself feeling strong, confident, and crossing the finish line with a smile.\n4. **Fuel properly**: Make sure to eat a balanced meal the night before the race, and avoid trying new foods that could cause digestive issues. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\n5. **Get to the race site early**: Arrive at the race site with plenty of time to spare. This can help reduce anxiety and give you time to get settled before the start of the race.\n\nRemember, everyone gets nervous before a race. It's normal! But by focusing on your flexibility, pre-race routine, and mental preparation, you can set yourself up for success and continue to improve your running efficiency.",
