  "content": "Shari Lapena and Fiona Barton are both excellent choices. I hope you enjoy their books!\n\nRegarding book events and festivals, I'm happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information or specific location-based data. But I can suggest a few ways to find out about upcoming book events and festivals in your area:\n\n1. **Local libraries and bookstores**: Check the websites or social media of your local libraries and bookstores. They often host author events, book clubs, and festivals, and usually post about them in advance.\n2. **Book festival websites**: Look for websites dedicated to book festivals and literary events in your region. Some popular ones include BookFestivals.com, LiteraryFestivals.com, and Authors.me.\n3. **Author websites and social media**: Follow your favorite authors on social media or check their websites for tour dates and event schedules. They often announce their appearances and signings in advance.\n4. **Local event calendars**: Check your local newspaper, event calendars, or community boards for book-related events.\n5. **Goodreads**: Goodreads has an events feature that allows you to find and RSVP to book events in your area.\n\nRemember to also keep an eye on your local literary organizations, writing groups, and book clubs, as they often host events and festivals throughout the year.\n\nIf you have any more specific information about your location (city, state, or region), I can try to provide more tailored suggestions.",
