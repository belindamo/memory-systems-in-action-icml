The room is filled with the sounds of gunfire and shouting, as your team engages the remaining members of Bauer's gang. You can see members of the SWAT team moving through the room, weapons at the ready, neutralizing any resistance they encounter. You see the gang members trying to fight back, but they are quickly overpowered by the well-trained and heavily armed SWAT team.\n\nYou also see that the basement is also used as a lab to produce the designer drug, you can see various chemicals and equipment used for the production of the drug. There are also tables filled with packets of the drug ready to be distributed.\n\nAs the last of the resistance is neutralized, you give the signal for the team to move in and secure the area. You keep your weapon at the ready, scanning the room for any remaining threats.",
