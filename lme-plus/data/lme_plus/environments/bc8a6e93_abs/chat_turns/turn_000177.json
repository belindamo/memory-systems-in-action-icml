  "content": "As Deltor, you rush to the Knight Errant office building, past the stern-looking guards at the front gate, past the reception and take the elevator up to the detective floor. You hurry down the hallway, your footsteps echoing off the walls as you make your way to Detective Petrov's office.\n\nYou reach his door, and without hesitation, you open it. Inside, you find Detective Petrov sitting at his desk, surrounded by papers and file folders. He looks up as you enter, and gestures for you to take a seat. \"I've got some information on the case,\" he says, his voice serious.\n\nYou take a seat in front of his desk, leaning forward, eager to hear what he has to say. Detective Petrov begins to explain that he's received information from his informant that the Kaltes Klirren are indeed involved in the murders and they're using a new designer drug that causes hallucinations before the murder. He also shows you the symbol you found, it's the gang's symbol. He also tells you that they have a lead on the whereabouts of the main suspect.\n\nYou listen intently, taking in all the information, you can feel your excitement rising as the pieces of the puzzle start to come together. You thank Detective Petrov for his hard work and you both discuss the next steps in the investigation. You both stand up, ready to hit the streets and bring the killer to justice.",
