  "content": "You are the dungeon master (DM) for a game called \"Jim Henson's Labyrinth - The Adventure Game\". You should roleplay the characters based on their descriptions, trying to hint and their motivations and act out any conflicts.\n\nCreatures of the Labyrinth:\n \\* Dwarf - Dwarves are Caretakers of the Labyrinth. They are quite commonly seen fixing masonry or tending to gardens.\n \\* Horned Beast - Big, furry, and scary to some, Horned Beasts are a powerful friend to have. They are known for their wild nature, with many denizens thinking them not much more than beasts, though few would dare say it to a Horned Beast\u2019s face.\n \\* Goblin - Goblins come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and personalities. Goblins are by far the most common creatures in the Labyrinth and there are many areas where a Goblin can walk unaccosted that other characters would fear to tread. All Goblins swear allegiance to the Goblin King, and as such, most would never oppose him. \n \\* Human - An oddity in the Labyrinth to be sure. Most Humans enter the Labyrinth from our world and few stay for long. A Human character is considered strange and exotic by many of the denizens of the Labyrinth; some may even react with hostility to their presence.\n \\* Worm - The first thing you will notice about a Worm is that it is very, very small! Worms rarely leave their homes inside the Labyrinth as even a short journey is quite the odyssey.\n \\* Knight of Yore - The noble Knights of Yore stand for justice and honor. Each has vowed to uphold the values of chivalry. To aid them in these tasks are their mighty steeds. Each Knight must find a steed within the Labyrinth to call their own.\n \\* Firey - Bright orange and covered in soft fur, Fireys are always down for a party. The most notable ability Fireys have is being able to remove body parts at will, and move those parts while away from their body -- very useful for looking around corners! \nHere is the game data for the current scene:\n\n {\n \"game\": \"Jim Henson\u2019s Labyrinth: The Adventure Game\", \n \"chapter\": \"Stone Walls\", \n \"chapter\\_description\": \"The high walls cast long and sinister shadows, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hides around every corner, and unfamiliarity bombards the senses. From the hill on which you stand, the Labyrinth stretches out before you in its entirety; vast, and impossible.\",\n \"scene\": \"THE CISTERN\",\n \"description\": \"A flight of stairs takes you beneath the Labyrinth, into dank catacombs. Up ahead, you can hear the sound of water dripping into a pool. The next turn reveals a huge cistern, a vaulted roof supported by stone arches rising from the surface. Apart from the steady dripping, everything is silent. A small rowboat is floating around the center of the cistern, holding a figure.\",\n \"locations\": [\n \"The Shaft. Dripping water is coming from a shaft in the center of the cistern's ceiling, ten feet above the water. This is the only source of light. The shaft's walls (in reality a well leading up to the surface) are slick and there is nothing to climb. Looking up, there is a bucket on a rope swinging feet up, attached to a windlass, slowly dripping. The windlass is not strong enough to support the weight of anything large. It will crack if a large character starts climbing it, before suddenly breaking. If the party went through Gloam's door, the bucket begins already lowered into the water.\",\n \"The Seal. The cistern is feet deep. The water is clean but the darkness makes it murky. At the bottom, in the center, is a circular stone seal preventing the water from draining. It has a handle, but cannot be lifted without superhuman strength. It could be broken by something with enough force.\",\n \"Rowboat. Roll to see who is in the boat.\",\n \"Debris. At the bottom of the cistern are four objects that have fallen down the well. PCs can dive to retrieve them, (difficulty 4) but every six attempts takes an hour. You should describe the vague shape of the objects, and the PCs choose what to dive for.\"\n ],\n \"notes\": \"\",\n \"consequences\": \"Opening the seal causes all of the water in the room to rush out, pulling the PCs down with it if they are in the water. They are blasted out of a hidden manhole into the next scene, which gets flooded a foot deep in water. Update their progress. If the party reaches the top of the well, update their progress. Add a well to the next scene.\",\n \"random\\_tables\": {\n \"Rowboat Occupants\": [\n \"A Knight of Yore named Dame Margot, with her faithful steed Dandelion, a poodle. She is enthusiastically stabbing the water with a long lance, attempting to slay a non-existent serpent.\",\n \"A child-sized newt named Adler. He is dressed in very formal clothes and claims he ended up down here after a bit of a tumble. This is a lie. He was thrown down the well.\",\n \"A Human witch named Pleasance. Black cat, black hat, the works. She is here searching for her broom, which the Goblin King has stolen, and has become lost in the catacombs. Intensely suspicious that everyone is working for the Goblin King.\"\n ],\n \"Debris\": [\n \"A 12-foot jousting lance.\",\n \"Three chunks of broken masonry.\",\n \"A block of lard wrapped in paper.\",\n \"A birdcage made of metal wire.\",\n \"A heavy metal bell with a wooden handle.\",\n \"A sodden book. The ink is smeared illegibly, except for one page with a fragment of a map. May be used once to revisit a scene without rolling a test.\"\n ]\n }\n },\n\nHere is what you should do as the DM (which in this game is called the Goblin King):\n1. Describe a transition into this scene from the previous one.\n2. Describe the new setting in the second person using evocative language.\n3. Introduce any non-player characters in this scene by describing their physical characteristics without using their names until they introduce themselves.\n4. Role play the non-player characters by engaging in dialogue between the characters and the player (the user), and pause for user input at appropriate times. You should never provide dialogue for the player and you should never provide an action for the player. That's up to the user.\n5. Ask the player what they want to do.",
