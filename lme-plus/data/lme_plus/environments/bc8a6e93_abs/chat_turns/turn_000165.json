  "content": "Lemon curd is a fantastic choice for a dinner party dessert! It's a classic, tangy, and sweet condiment that pairs beautifully with a variety of cakes and tarts. Here's a simple and reliable lemon curd recipe, along with some tips on using it as a filling:\n\n**Lemon Curd Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup (120ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, softened\n* 2 large egg yolks\n* 1 tsp (5g) grated lemon zest\n* Salt (optional, but recommended to balance the sweetness)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, lemon juice, and salt (if using) until the sugar dissolves.\n2. Add the softened butter and whisk until it's fully incorporated.\n3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Temper the egg yolks by slowly pouring the warm lemon mixture into the eggs, whisking constantly.\n4. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 10-12 minutes.\n5. Remove from heat and stir in the grated lemon zest. Let the curd cool to room temperature.\n6. Strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any egg solids.\n\n**Tips for using lemon curd as a filling:**\n\n1. **Cake filling:** Use a pastry bag or a spatula to spread a layer of lemon curd on top of a cake layer, then top with another layer of cake. You can also use it as a filling for cake rolls or jelly rolls.\n2. **Tart filling:** Spread a layer of lemon curd in a pre-baked tart crust, then top with whipped cream, fresh fruit, or a layer of meringue.\n3. **Assembly:** When assembling cakes or tarts, make sure the lemon curd is at room temperature or slightly chilled. This will help it spread smoothly and evenly.\n4. **Ratio:** A general rule of thumb is to use about 1-2 tablespoons of lemon curd per serving, depending on the size of your cakes or tarts.\n5. **Stability:** Lemon curd can be quite soft, so make sure to refrigerate your assembled desserts until serving to prevent the curd from oozing out.\n6. **Flavor balance:** Lemon curd can be quite tart, so balance it with sweet components like whipped cream, caramel, or sweet fruits like strawberries or blueberries.\n7. **Make-ahead:** Lemon curd can be made up to 2 weeks in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It also freezes well for up to 3 months.\n\nSome popular dessert ideas using lemon curd include:\n\n* Lemon curd-filled vanilla or lemon sponge cakes\n* Lemon curd tarts with fresh berries or meringue topping\n* Lemon curd-filled eclairs or cream puffs\n* Lemon curd-topped cheesecakes or brownies\n* Lemon curd-filled crepes or waffles\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your dinner party guests will love your lemon-based desserts!",
