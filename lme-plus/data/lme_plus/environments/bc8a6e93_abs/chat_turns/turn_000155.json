The process involves crushing the grapes and letting the juice and skins sit together for a period of time, allowing the yeast to convert the natural sugars in the grapes into alcohol. The mixture is then strained, and the resulting juice is aged in oak barrels or stainless steel tanks until it is ready to be bottled.\n\nThe best vineyards for wine production are located in regions with specific climates and soil conditions. Some of the most well-known wine regions include:\n\n1.
