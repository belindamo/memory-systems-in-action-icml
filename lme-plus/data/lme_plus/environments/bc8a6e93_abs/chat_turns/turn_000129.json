It's thoughtful, practical, and easy to use. I'm sure she'll appreciate the gesture and the usefulness of the gift.\n\nRemember, it's the thought that counts, not the price tag or the frills. You're showing Rachel that you value her help and want to make her workday a little brighter. That's what matters most!\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further advice, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope Rachel enjoys her new pens and that you both continue to work well together!",
