Please provide me with the list of expenses you've incurred over the past month, and I'll help you categorize them into gifts, groceries, and office supplies. You can share the list in any format you have it - a spreadsheet, a note-taking app, or even just a plain text list.\n\nAlso, don't worry about the office supplies you bought for Rachel - we can categorize those as office supplies, and I'll make sure to include them in the total.\n\nOnce I have the list, I'll help you total up the amounts for each category.",
