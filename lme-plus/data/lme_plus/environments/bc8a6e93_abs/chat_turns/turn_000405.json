But I like the idea of recognizing her support and giving her a shoutout during the Q&A session! It's a great way to show appreciation for her support and encourage others to participate as well.\n\nThanks for the suggestions and ideas! I'll make sure to promote the Q&A session and the incentives through my social media channels and channel description. I'll also have a clear plan in place for managing the Q&A session and recognizing participants.\n\nLet's move on to the next topic. What do you think about me doing a collaboration with another streamer or YouTuber? Would that be a good way to reach a broader audience and build my following?",
