Try to log everything you eat and drink, even if you think it's not \"healthy.\"\n2. **Log as you go**: Log your food and drinks throughout the day, rather than trying to remember everything at the end of the day.\n3. **Use the barcode scanner**: MyFitnessPal's barcode scanner makes it easy to log packaged foods. Simply scan the barcode, and the app will retrieve the nutrition information.\n4. **Measure portions**: Measure your food portions to ensure you're logging accurate amounts. You can use measuring cups or a food scale to help.\n\n**Eating Out:**\n\n1. **Look up menus online**: Before eating out, look up the restaurant's menu online and log your meal in advance. This way, you can make healthier choices and have an idea of the nutrition information.\n2. **Ask your server**: If you're unsure about ingredients or portion sizes, ask your server for more information.\n3. **Take a photo**: Take a photo of your meal to help you remember what you ate and estimate portion sizes.\n4. **Use MyFitnessPal's restaurant database**: MyFitnessPal has a large database of popular restaurants and their menu items.

You can always adjust later if needed.\n4. **Log as soon as possible**: Try to log your food and drinks as soon as possible after the gathering, while the details are still fresh in your mind.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use the \"Recipe\" feature**: If you cook a meal from scratch, use MyFitnessPal's \"Recipe\" feature to log the ingredients and portion sizes.\n2. **Create a \"Frequent Foods\" list**: Add frequently eaten foods to your \"Frequent Foods\" list for quick logging.\n3. **Sync with a fitness tracker or wearable**: If you use a fitness tracker or wearable, sync it with MyFitnessPal to get a more complete picture of your daily activity and calorie burn.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to accurately track your food intake, even when eating out or at social gatherings.
