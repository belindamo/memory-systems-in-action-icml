  "content": "The abandoned factories on the outskirts of New Berlin are located in an industrial area that has been largely abandoned due to the advancements in technology. The factories are old and run down, with broken windows and graffiti covering the walls. They are large, sprawling buildings with multiple levels, including a basement, and are connected by a network of corridors and staircases. The buildings are made of concrete and steel, with large open spaces and large machinery still present.\n\nThe raid plan is to surround the factory and secure the perimeter, while a smaller team moves in to take out any guards and neutralize Bauer and his associates. The team will consist of a mix of uniformed and plainclothes officers, including yourself, Detective Petrov and a team of Knight Errant SWAT team members. The team will be armed with standard Knight Errant gear, including body armor, tactical helmets, and weapons such as automatic rifles and sidearms. The team will also have flashbangs and teargas at their disposal. We'll have around 20-30 officers, including SWAT team members.\n\nThe team will also have a medic on standby, in case of injuries. The goal is to move quickly and efficiently, neutralizing any resistance, and securing the factory. The main objective is to capture Bauer and his associates and gather any evidence that can connect them to the murders.",
