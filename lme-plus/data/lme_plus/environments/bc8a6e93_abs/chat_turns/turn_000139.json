  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal schedule or activities. I don't have the ability to know what you were doing on Sunday morning or any other time.\n\nI'm designed to provide general information and respond to questions within my knowledge domain, but I don't have access to personal data or real-time information about individual users. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation, and I don't retain any information from previous conversations.\n\nIf you're trying to recall your schedule from last week, you might want to check your personal calendar, planner, or phone for reminders and events. You could also try asking a family member or friend if they remember what you were doing on Sunday morning.\n\nIf you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to help!",
