However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to know your personal schedule or activities, including your yoga class attendance.\n\nI'm designed to provide general information and respond to questions within my knowledge domain, but I don't have access to personal data or real-time information about individual users. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation, and I don't retain any information from previous conversations.\n\nThat being said, I'm happy to chat with you about yoga or any other topic you're interested in! If you have any questions about yoga or need recommendations on yoga-related topics, feel free to ask.",
