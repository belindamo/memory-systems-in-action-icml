  "content": "The procurements I listed above are likely to have employed the use of contractors. The U.S. government often procures goods and services from contractors, including technology-related services. When it comes to blockchain technology, the government has been exploring the use of contractors to help with research and development, as well as to implement and operate pilot projects.\n\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Defense, when working on a pilot project to use blockchain technology to track the movement of medical supplies, would likely have contracted a company with expertise in blockchain technology and supply chain management to help design and implement the pilot project. Similarly, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) would have likely contracted a company with expertise in blockchain technology and identity management when working on a pilot project to use blockchain technology to secure access to government facilities.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the U.S. government often uses competitive bidding process to select contractors, which means that multiple companies have the opportunity to bid on a contract, and the government selects the bid that offers the best value.",
