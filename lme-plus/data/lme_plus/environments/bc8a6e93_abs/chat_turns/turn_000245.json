  "content": "Wukong quickly steps in front of Sanzang, bowing his head to Jaedala in apology. \"Forgive my friend, great one,\" he says, trying to keep his voice steady. \"He speaks out of despair for our people. We have all suffered greatly at the hands of your empire.\"\n\nJaedala scowls at Wukong, clearly unimpressed by his words. \"You will all suffer more if you do not learn your place,\" she says coldly.\n\nWukong continues to stand in front of Sanzang, his back straight and his eyes fixed on Jaedala. \"I understand, great one,\" he says, trying to placate her. \"But my friend speaks the truth. We are a proud people, and it is difficult for us to be caged like animals.\"\n\nJaedala's eyes narrow at Wukong's words, but she doesn't say anything. After a tense moment, she turns and storms out of the prison camp, leaving Wukong and the other prisoners behind.\n\nAs soon as she's gone, Wukong's shoulders sag in relief and he turns to face his friend. \"I'm sorry, Sanzang,\" he says, his voice breaking. \"I didn't mean to get you in trouble.\"\n\nSanzang reaches out and puts a hand on Wukong's shoulder, his own eyes filled with tears. \"It's not your fault, my friend,\" he says. \"We are all prisoners here, but we will find a way to survive and escape. Together.\"",
