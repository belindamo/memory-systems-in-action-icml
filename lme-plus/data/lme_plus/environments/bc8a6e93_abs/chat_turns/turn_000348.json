  "content": "A new litter box can definitely make a difference! Cats can be very particular about their litter boxes, and sometimes a change can encourage them to start using it again.\n\nHere are some tips to consider when selecting a new litter box for Luna:\n\n1. **Size**: Make sure the litter box is large enough for Luna. A general rule of thumb is to provide a litter box that's at least 1.5 times the length of your cat.\n2. **Type**: There are different types of litter boxes, such as:\n\t* Clumping litter boxes: These are the most common type and use clumping litter that forms clumps when your cat urinates.\n\t* Silica gel litter boxes: These use silica gel as an absorbent material and can be more odor-controlling.\n\t* Automatic litter boxes: These self-cleaning litter boxes can be more convenient, but may be noisier and more expensive.\n\t* Natural litter boxes: These use natural materials like pine, corn, or wheat, and can be a good option for cats with sensitivities.\n3. **Litter**: Choose a litter that Luna finds comfortable and appealing. Some cats prefer certain textures, smells, or absorbency levels. You may need to try a few different litters to find the one she likes best.\n4. **Low sides**: If Luna is having trouble getting in and out of the current litter box, consider a litter box with lower sides or a ramp for easier access.\n5. **Odor control**: If you're concerned about odor, look for litter boxes with built-in odor control features, such as filters or antimicrobial materials.\n6. **Easy cleaning**: A litter box that's easy to clean can make your life easier and encourage Luna to use it more.\n\nSome popular litter box brands include:\n\n* Nature's Miracle\n* Arm & Hammer\n* Dr. Elsey's\n* World's Best Cat Litter\n* Litter-Robot (automatic litter box)\n\nRemember to introduce the new litter box gradually, placing it next to the old one at first and gradually transitioning Luna to the new one. You may also want to try different locations or angles to find the spot that Luna prefers.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm happy to provide more advice if you need it!",
