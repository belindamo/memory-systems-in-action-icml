  "content": "The property is located in the countryside, about 2 hours from the city. It's an old family home, around 2,500 square feet. From what I saw on January 25th, the roof needs repair, the electrical system needs updating, and the foundation work is a must. The walls and floors need repair, and the whole place needs a new coat of paint. I'm thinking of using mid-range materials and finishes. I'm planning to hire a contractor to oversee the project, and I've already gotten quotes from a few of them.",
