  "content": "I've been browsing online and found a few coffee table options that I like, but I need to measure the space before I make a final decision. I was also thinking of getting a new desk for my home office, and I already found one I like at West Elm. It's a bit pricey, at $400, but it's really high-quality and has great storage. I ordered it online and it should arrive next Wednesday.",
