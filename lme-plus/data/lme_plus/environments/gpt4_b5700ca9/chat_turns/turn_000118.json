Speaking of musicals, I was just thinking about Hamilton the other day - I watched it on Disney+ about a month ago and I'm still obsessed with the soundtrack. Anyway, can you recommend some shows that are similar to Schitt's Creek? I just finished binge-watching it and I'm looking for something with a similar tone and humor.",
