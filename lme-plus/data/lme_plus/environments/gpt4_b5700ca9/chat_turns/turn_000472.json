  "content": "Of course! Here is a recommended workout routine for someone who has not exercised in a while:\n\n1. Start with a 5-minute warm-up of walking, light jogging, or jumping jacks.\n\n2. Work on cardio for 20-30 minutes. This can be a brisk walk, jogging, cycling, or swimming.\n\n3. Move onto strength training exercises for your upper body, lower body, and core. Start with bodyweight exercises such as squats, lunges, planks, push-ups or wall push-ups. Do 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps for each of these exercises.\n\n4. Finish with a 5-minute cool-down of stretching exercises such as cat-cow, child's pose, and hamstring stretches.\n\nMake sure to rest for 1-2 days in between workout days to let your muscles recover. And remember to always listen to your body and take things at your own pace. Gradually increase your workout intensity and duration over time as your fitness level improves.",
