Here are some tips to help you pair them perfectly:\n\n**Temperature**\n\nServe the matcha tea hot, around 160\u00b0F to 170\u00b0F (71\u00b0C to 77\u00b0C). This temperature allows the tea's delicate flavors to shine through and complements the cold, creamy mochi ice cream.\n\n**Sweetener and Milk**\n\nYou can serve the matcha tea with or without sweetener and milk, depending on your personal preference. Here are some options:\n\n1. **Traditional style**: Serve the matcha tea without sweetener or milk. This allows the tea's natural bitterness to balance the sweetness of the mochi ice cream.\n2. **Sweetened**: Add a small amount of sugar or honey to the tea to balance the bitterness. This pairs well with sweet mochi ice cream flavors like mango or coconut.\n3. **Creamy**: Add a small amount of milk or cream to the tea to create a creamy, velvety texture. This pairs well with richer mochi ice cream flavors like green tea or sesame.\n\n**Ratio of Tea to Ice Cream**\n\nAim for a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio of tea to ice cream. This means serving a small cup of tea (around 6 oz or 180 ml) with one or two scoops of mochi ice cream. This allows guests to enjoy both the tea and ice cream without overwhelming their senses.\n\n**Tips for Serving**\n\n1. Serve the matcha tea in small cups to encourage guests to appreciate the flavors and aromas.\n2. Place a scoop of mochi ice cream on a plate or bowl, and serve the matcha tea on the side.\n3. Consider garnishing the tea with a small mochi ball or a sprinkle of matcha powder to add a pop of color and whimsy.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll create a harmonious pairing of matcha tea and mochi ice cream that will delight your guests' taste buds!",
