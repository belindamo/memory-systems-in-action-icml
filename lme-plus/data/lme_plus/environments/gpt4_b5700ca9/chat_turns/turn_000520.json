  "content": "Sure! Here's an ASCII representation of the piano arrangement using the revised chord progression. Each group of notes represents a chord, and the notes are written as the MIDI note numbers (where middle C is 60). The numbers are separated by commas, and each chord is separated by a semicolon.\n\nChord progression:\n\n1. C Major 9: 60, 64, 67, 71, 74\n2. A Minor 7: 57, 60, 64, 67\n3. F Major 9: 53, 57, 60, 65, 69\n4. G7sus4: 55, 60, 62, 65\n\nFor better readability, here's the same arrangement in musical notation:\n\n1. Cmaj9: C4, E4, G4, B4, D5\n2. Am7: A3, C4, E4, G4\n3. Fmaj9: F3, A3, C4, E4, G4\n4. G7sus4: G3, C4, D4, F4\n\nRemember that this is a simple chord arrangement, and you can further experiment with voicings, inversions, or rhythmic patterns to create a more interesting and personalized arrangement.",
