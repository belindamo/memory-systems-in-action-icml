Here's a simple rhythmic pattern for the chord progression:\n\nTempo: Moderato (around 80-90 BPM)\n\n1. Cmaj9: C4, E4, G4, B4, D5 (play for 1 whole note)\n2. Am7: A3, C4, E4, G4 (play for 1 whole note)\n3. Fmaj9: F3, A3, C4, E4, G4 (play for 1 whole note)\n4. G7sus4: G3, C4, D4, F4 (play for 1 whole note)\n\nYou can also try a more syncopated rhythm, like this:\n\n1. Cmaj9: C4, E4, G4, B4, D5 (play for 1 dotted half note)\n2. Am7: A3, C4, E4, G4 (play for 1 half note)\n3. Fmaj9: F3, A3, C4, E4, G4 (play for 1 dotted half note)\n4. G7sus4: G3, C",
