  "content": "Yes, it can be frustrating to see such resistance from those who refuse to acknowledge the harm caused by societal norms and oppression. However, it is important to remember that change is never easy, and it often requires long-term effort and commitment. Resistance to change is often rooted in fear, ignorance, and a desire to maintain power and privilege. But when we continue to push for social justice and equality, we can overcome these obstacles and create a better, more just society for everyone. We must keep fighting for what is right and keep supporting each other in this struggle for true individual freedom and societal change.",
