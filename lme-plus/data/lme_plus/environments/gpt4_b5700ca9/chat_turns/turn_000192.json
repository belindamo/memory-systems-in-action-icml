Some of the countries that are working to protect lions include:\n\n1. Botswana: Botswana has established various protected areas including the Okavango Delta which provides a safe haven for the largest lion population in the country.\n\n2. Tanzania: Tanzania has put in place conservation measures such as increasing patrols in protected areas, limiting hunting, and creating incentives for communities living near wildlife habitats to participate in conservation programs.\n\n3. Kenya: Kenya has various protected areas including wildlife parks such as the Maasai Mara, Amboseli National Park, and Samburu National Reserve, which are home to a large population of lions.\n\n4. Zambia: Zambia has established game management areas and community-owned conservancies to protect lion populations.\n\n5. South Africa: Private game reserves in South Africa have taken measures to eliminate poaching and hunting of lions, and have become important breeding grounds for lions.\n\nThese countries have made significant strides to protect their lion populations, but there is always more that can be done to ensure these magnificent creatures continue to thrive in the wild.",
