Add sliced pork, boiled egg, and green onions on top.\n2. **Somen Noodles**: Cook somen noodles according to package instructions, then chill them. Serve with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, sake, and mirin. You can also add sliced cucumbers, carrots, and pickled ginger on the side.\n\n**Salads**\n\n1. **Wakame Salad**: Mix together wakame seaweed, cucumber, carrots, and sesame seeds with a dressing made from soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.\n2. **Cucumber Sunomono**: Slice cucumbers thinly and soak them in a sweet vinegar dressing made from rice vinegar, sugar, and salt.

This will save you time and stress in the kitchen.\n\nThese dishes should complement your teriyaki chicken and stir-fried vegetables nicely, and offer a variety of textures and flavors for your guests to enjoy!",
