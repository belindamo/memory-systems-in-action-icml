Serving the matcha tea hot without sweetener or milk will definitely help balance the sweetness of the mochi ice cream, and the 1:1 ratio will ensure that guests can fully appreciate both components.\n\nServing in small cups and plates is also a great idea, as it will encourage guests to slow down and savor the experience. It's all about creating a harmonious balance of flavors and textures, and it sounds like you're on the right track!\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with your presentation. You could even consider adding a few Japanese-inspired touches, like a small ceramic tea scoop or a sprinkle of matcha powder on top of the ice cream. It's all about creating a memorable experience for your guests.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope your dinner party is a huge success, and your guests enjoy the delicious matcha tea and mochi ice cream pairing!",
