Here are some tips to help you style them together:\n\n**Pencil Skirt:**\n\n* Choose a pencil skirt that fits you well and hits just above the knee. This length is flattering and professional.\n* Consider a skirt in a neutral color like navy, black, gray, or beige, which can be easily paired with different blouses and blazers.\n* If you want to add some visual interest, look for a skirt with a subtle pattern, such as a small check or stripe.\n\n**Blouse:**\n\n* Select a blouse that complements the color of your skirt. You can opt for a bold, contrasting color to create a statement look or a more subtle, matching shade for a cohesive appearance.\n* Consider a blouse with some texture or interest, like a silk or cotton blend with a subtle pattern, a ruffled detail, or a soft blouse with a relaxed fit.\n* Make sure the blouse is not too tight or too loose. You want it to skim your body without overwhelming your silhouette.\n\n**Blazer:**\n\n* Choose a blazer that fits well and is proportional to your body. A fitted blazer can create a powerful, professional look.\n* Select a blazer in a neutral color that complements your skirt and blouse. Black, navy, gray, and beige are all great options.\n* Consider a blazer with some texture or interest, like a wool or cashmere blend, a patterned lining, or a unique button detail.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n\n* Start with your pencil skirt as the base of your outfit.\n* Add your blouse, making sure it's tucked in or styled in a way that creates a flattering silhouette.\n* Top it off with your blazer, which can add a polished, professional touch.\n* Slip on your new black ankle boots from Zara to complete the look. The boots will add a sleek, modern touch to your outfit.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To add some visual interest, try layering a statement necklace or a scarf over your blouse.\n* If you want to soften the look, swap the blazer for a cardigan or a kimono.\n* Experiment with different blouse styles, such as a peplum or bell-sleeved blouse, to add some personality to your outfit.\n* Don't be afraid to mix and match different patterns, like a striped blouse with a polka-dot skirt, to create a unique look.\n\nI hope these tips help you create a stylish and professional outfit with your new boots!",
