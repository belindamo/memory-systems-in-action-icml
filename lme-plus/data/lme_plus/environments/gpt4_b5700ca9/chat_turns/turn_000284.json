A leather jacket can be a fantastic addition to your wardrobe, and it's even better that you can snag it during their sale.\n\nAs for styling the leather jacket with your new blazer and blouse from ASOS, it really depends on the specific pieces. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Blazer:** If your blazer is more structured and formal, it might be challenging to pair it with a leather jacket, as both pieces can be quite bold. However, if your blazer is more relaxed and has a softer silhouette, you might be able to layer the leather jacket over it for a cool, edgy look.\n* **Blouse:** If your blouse is more feminine and delicate, it could provide a nice contrast to the edginess of the leather jacket. Look for blouses with lace, ruffles, or soft fabrics like silk or cotton.\n\nTo make it work, you could try the following:\n\n* Wear the leather jacket over the blouse, and skip the blazer for a more casual, weekend look.\n* Layer the blazer over the blouse, and then add the leather jacket for a more avant-garde, fashion-forward look.\n* If you want to create a more polished look, you could wear the blazer over the leather jacket, but this might be a bit more challenging to pull off.\n\nBefore making a purchase, you might want to try on the leather jacket with your blazer and blouse to see how they work together. If you can't try it on, you could also consider the following:\n\n* Take a photo of yourself wearing the blazer and blouse, and then imagine the leather jacket layered over it. This can give you an idea of how the pieces will work together.\n* Check out fashion blogs or Instagram for inspiration on how to style leather jackets with blazers and blouses.\n\nUltimately, it's all about experimenting and finding a look that feels confident and stylish to you!",
