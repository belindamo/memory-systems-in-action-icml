Here are some tips to help you enhance your photos and bring out their best:\n\n1. **Start with the basics**: Begin by adjusting the exposure, contrast, and color temperature of your image. Use the Histogram panel to ensure your image isn't over or underexposed. Adjust the Exposure, Contrast, and Highlights sliders to balance the tones.\n2. **Use the Gradient Filter**: Wide-angle lenses can often lead to uneven skies. Use the Gradient Filter tool to darken or lighten specific areas of the image, such as the sky or foreground. This tool is especially useful for balancing the exposure between the sky and land.\n3. **Local Adjustments**: The Adjustment Brush and Gradient Filter are powerful tools for making local adjustments. Use them to enhance specific areas of the image, such as adding contrast to rocks or trees, or darkening the sky.\n4. **Color Grading**: Landscape photos often benefit from a natural, earthy color palette. Use the Color Grading panel to adjust the hue, saturation, and luminance of specific colors. For example, you can enhance the greens of foliage or the blues of the sky.\n5. **Orton Effect**: The Orton effect adds a dreamy, ethereal quality to your image. To achieve this, use the Effects panel to add a small amount of Orton effect (around 10-20).\n6. **Sharpening and Noise Reduction**: Wide-angle lenses can introduce some noise and softness. Use the Detail panel to adjust the Sharpening and Noise Reduction settings to find a balance between detail and noise.\n7. **Crop and Straighten**: Don't forget to crop and straighten your image to remove any distractions and improve composition.\n8. **Vibrance and Saturation**: Landscapes often benefit from a boost in vibrance and saturation. Use the Basic panel to add a small amount of vibrance (around 10-20) to enhance the colors.\n9. **Split Toning**: Split toning can add depth and interest to your image. Use the Split Toning panel to add a warm tone to the shadows and a cool tone to the highlights.\n10. **Compare and Iterate**: Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and try different edits. Use the Before and After view to compare your original image with your edited version, and iterate on your edits until you're happy with the result.\n\nSome specific tips for your hike photos:\n\n* Since you were shooting in a state park, you may want to emphasize the natural colors and textures of the environment. Look for opportunities to enhance the greens of foliage, the browns of trees, and the blues of the sky.\n* Wide-angle lenses can make objects appear smaller than they are. Consider using the Transform panel to correct any distortion or perspective issues.\n* If you have any interesting clouds or weather phenomena in your shots, consider emphasizing them using the Adjustment Brush or Gradient Filter.\n\nI hope these tips help you enhance your landscape photos and bring out the best in your hike shots!",
