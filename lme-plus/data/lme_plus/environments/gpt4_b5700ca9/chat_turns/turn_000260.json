  "content": "What a great idea! Inviting your friends from the \"Charity Cycle\" event is a wonderful way to build a strong team for your walkathon.\n\nOffering incentives can be a fantastic way to motivate people to fundraise more and make the experience more engaging. Here are some ideas for prizes and recognition that might encourage your friends to fundraise more:\n\n**Prizes:**\n\n1. **Top fundraiser prize:** Offer a prize for the individual or team that raises the most funds, such as a gift card, a free entry to a local event, or a donation in their name to the homeless shelter.\n2. **Milestone prizes:** Set fundraising milestones (e.g., $100, $250, $500) and offer prizes for reaching each milestone, such as a water bottle, a t-shirt, or a small gift.\n3. **Team prize:** Offer a prize for the team that raises the most funds collectively, such as a group outing or a catered meal.\n\n**Recognition:**\n\n1. **Fundraising leaderboard:** Create a leaderboard on your GoFundMe page or social media that showcases the top fundraisers, with regular updates to keep the competition going.\n2. **Social media shoutouts:** Give shoutouts to top fundraisers on social media, highlighting their progress and thanking them for their efforts.\n3. **Special recognition:** Offer special recognition at the walkathon event, such as a special bib or a shoutout during the opening ceremony.\n\n**Other Ideas:**\n\n1. **Challenge matches:** Offer a challenge match, where a sponsor or donor will match funds raised within a certain timeframe or up to a certain amount.\n2. **Fundraising challenges:** Create fun fundraising challenges, such as a \"dress-down\" day at work or a bake sale, and offer prizes for the most creative or successful challenges.\n3. **Personalized fundraising pages:** Encourage participants to create personalized fundraising pages, where they can share their own stories and reasons for participating in the walkathon.\n\nRemember to communicate the incentives clearly and regularly to your friends and participants, and make sure they're aligned with your fundraising goals and the spirit of the event. Good luck, and I hope these ideas help motivate your team to fundraise more!",
