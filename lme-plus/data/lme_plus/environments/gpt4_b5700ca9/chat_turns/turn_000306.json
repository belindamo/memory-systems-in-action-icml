Here's why:\n\n1. **Power surges and spikes**: A surge protector can safeguard your TV from power surges, spikes, and electrical storms that can damage the internal components.\n2. **Voltage fluctuations**: A surge protector can help regulate voltage fluctuations, which can cause damage to your TV's power supply and other components over time.\n3. **Overvoltage protection**: Many surge protectors come with overvoltage protection, which can prevent damage from excessive voltage levels.\n\nWhile a surge protector won't directly protect your TV from viruses or malware, it can help prevent physical damage to the device, which can be caused by power-related issues.\n\nAs for your laptop, it's great that you're taking steps to protect it from viruses and malware. Make sure to:\n\n1. **Keep your operating system and software up to date**.\n2. **Use reputable antivirus software** and keep it updated.\n3. **Avoid suspicious links and attachments** from unknown sources.\n4. **Use strong passwords** and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.\n5. **Regularly back up your data** to prevent losses in case of a malware infection.\n\nBy taking these precautions, you can significantly reduce the risk of malware infections and protect your devices from potential harm.\n\nRemember, a surge protector is a great addition to your TV's setup, but it's not a substitute for good cybersecurity practices. Stay safe online, and enjoy your TV and laptop!",
