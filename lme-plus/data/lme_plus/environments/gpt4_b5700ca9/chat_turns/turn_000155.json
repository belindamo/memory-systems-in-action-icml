Ryan is a suave, charming, and witty character who's always trying to keep his passengers happy and entertained, while also dealing with the various crises that arise during their journey.\n\nRyan is a bit of a smooth talker, often using his charm to defuse tense situations or distract from the ship's problems. However, as the series progresses, we see that beneath his polished exterior, Ryan is struggling with his own insecurities and personal demons. He's not as confident as he seems, and he often finds himself in comedic misadventures as he tries to navigate the ship's issues.\n\nHugh Laurie brings his signature wit and dry humor to the role, and his character's interactions with the other passengers and crew members are often hilarious. He has great comedic chemistry with the rest of the cast, particularly with Rebecca Front, who plays the ship's owner, Judd.\n\nIf you're new to Hugh Laurie's comedic work, \"Avenue 5\" is a great introduction. He's had plenty of experience in comedy, having starred in the British sitcom \"Blackadder\" and the American comedy series \"Veep,\" among others. He's a talented comedic actor who can easily switch between humor and drama, and his performance in \"Avenue 5\" is no exception.\n\nI think you'll really enjoy \"Avenue 5\" and Hugh Laurie's performance. Let me know what you think of the show once you've started watching!",
