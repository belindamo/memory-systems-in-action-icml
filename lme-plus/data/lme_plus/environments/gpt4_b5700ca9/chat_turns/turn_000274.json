Open a web browser and enter the IP address of your router in the address bar. The default IP address is typically 192.168.1.1\n2. Log in using your admin credentials. If you haven't changed it, the default login credentials can be found in the router's documentation.\n3. Once logged in, navigate to the \"Advanced settings\" menu, then select \"IPv4\"\n4.
