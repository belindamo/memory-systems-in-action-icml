Cucumbers are a popular and versatile veggie, and they can benefit from being planted alongside certain companions. Here are some suggestions for good companions for cucumbers:\n\n1. **Nasturtiums**: These colorful flowers repel aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that can harm cucumbers. They also attract beneficial insects like lacewings and hoverflies.\n2. **Dill**: Dill is a natural repellent for aphids and other pests that target cucumbers. Its tall growth also provides shade and support for climbing cucumbers.\n3. **Radishes**: Radishes can help to repel cucumber beetles and other pests. They also improve soil health by breaking up compacted soil and bringing up nutrients.\n4. **Marigolds**: These bright flowers repel nematodes, which can harm cucumbers, and also attract beneficial insects.\n5. **Basil**: Basil and cucumbers have a symbiotic relationship and are often planted together in traditional Italian gardens. Basil repels pests that target cucumbers and adds flavor to cucumber salads!\n6. **Borage**: Borage attracts beneficial insects like bees and predatory wasps, which can help pollinate and protect cucumbers.\n7. **Carrots**: Carrots and cucumbers have similar growing requirements and can be interplanted to create a mutually beneficial relationship.\n8. **Chives**: Chives repel aphids and other pests that target cucumbers, and their onion-like flavor can enhance the flavor of cucumber dishes.\n9. **Oregano**: Oregano is a natural fungicide and can help prevent diseases that affect cucumbers.\n10. **Comfrey**: Comfrey acts as a fertilizer plant, adding nutrients to the soil that benefit cucumbers and other nearby plants.\n\nRemember to plant companions according to their growing requirements and space needs. Some plants, like nasturtiums and marigolds, can be planted around the base of the cucumbers, while others, like dill and sunflowers, may need more space to grow.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy gardening!",
