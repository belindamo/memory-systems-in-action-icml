Getting a new sofa bed is a great opportunity to refresh your living room's look and feel.\n\nWest Elm and Crate and Barrel are both great options for throw pillows, offering a wide range of styles and colors. Since you're looking to match your new sofa bed's color scheme, I'd suggest taking a closer look at the color palette of your sofa bed and identifying the dominant colors.\n\nHere are some tips to help you choose the perfect throw pillows:\n\n1. **Take a color cue**: Identify the main colors of your sofa bed and look for throw pillows that complement or match them. You can also consider the color of the walls, rugs, and other furniture in the room to ensure a cohesive look.\n2. **Consider the sofa bed's fabric**: If your sofa bed has a pattern or texture, you may want to choose throw pillows with a similar fabric type or texture to create a harmonious look.\n3. **Think about the style**: West Elm and Crate and Barrel offer a range of styles, from modern and sleek to traditional and ornate. Choose a style that fits your personal taste and the overall aesthetic of your living room.\n4. **Don't be afraid to mix and match**: You don't need to choose throw pillows from the same collection or brand. Mixing and matching different patterns, textures, and colors can add visual interest to your space.\n\nBefore making a final decision, you might want to:\n\n* Order fabric swatches or pillow covers from West Elm and Crate and Barrel to get a better sense of the colors and textures.\n* Create a mood board or collage with images of your sofa bed, walls, rugs, and other furniture to visualize the overall look.\n* Read reviews and check the return policies of both stores in case you need to make any adjustments.\n\nRemember, throw pillows are an easy way to update your space and add a pop of color and texture. Have fun exploring the options, and I'm sure you'll find the perfect ones to match your new sofa bed!",
