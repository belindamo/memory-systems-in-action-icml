Then I bought some skincare products, kitchen utensils, vinyl records, and more clothes and accessories from various websites. Here's what I've got so far:\n\n* Feb: 3 shirts, 1 pair of jeans from Everlane ($150), skincare products from Sunday Riley ($120)\n* Mar: kitchen utensils from Amazon ($80), vinyl records from eBay ($200), sneakers and tank tops from Everlane ($100)\n* Apr: dresses and sandals from ASOS ($150)\n\nLet me know if you need anything else!",
