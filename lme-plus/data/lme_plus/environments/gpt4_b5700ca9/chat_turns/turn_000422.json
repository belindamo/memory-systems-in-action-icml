Societal pressure can be overwhelming, and it's easy to compare yourself to others, including your parents.\n\n**The Changing Landscape:**\n\nYou're right that times have changed, and the career landscape has shifted significantly. Many people are taking longer to settle into their careers, and it's not uncommon for people to change careers multiple times. The traditional linear career path is no longer the only norm.\n\n**Expectations vs. Reality:**\n\nIt's essential to recognize that your parents' experiences might not be directly applicable to your life. They grew up in a different time, with different opportunities, and different expectations. The fact that they got married and had you by a certain age doesn't mean you need to follow the same timeline.\n\n**Your Own Timeline:**\n\nRather than comparing yourself to others, focus on your own goals, values, and priorities. What do you want to achieve in your career? What kind of lifestyle do you want to have? What kind of impact do you want to make?\n\n**Exploring Your Options:**\n\nFeeling restless can be a catalyst for positive change. Take this opportunity to:\n\n1. **Reflect on your strengths and passions**: What are you good at? What do you enjoy doing?\n2. **Explore new opportunities**: Consider taking courses, attending workshops, or networking events to discover new possibilities.\n3. **Re-evaluate your priorities**: What's most important to you in your career? Is it work-life balance, financial stability, or personal fulfillment?\n4. **Create a personalized plan**: Set realistic, achievable goals for yourself, and break them down into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n**You're Not Alone:**\n\nRemember that many people in their 30s are still figuring things out. It's a common phenomenon, and it's okay to take your time. You're not behind; you're just on your own unique journey.\n\n**Celebrate Your Progress:**\n\nRather than focusing on what you haven't achieved, celebrate your accomplishments so far. You've made it to 32, and that's something to be proud of! Acknowledge your strengths, skills, and experiences, and use them as a foundation for your future growth.\n\nHow do you feel about exploring new opportunities and creating a personalized plan for your career? Would you like to discuss some ideas or concerns you have?",
