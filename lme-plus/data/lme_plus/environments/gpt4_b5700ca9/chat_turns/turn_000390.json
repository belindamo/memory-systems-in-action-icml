Now, let's explore the possibility of switching to a medium-dark roast.\n\nA medium-dark roast can be a great option if you're looking for a smoother flavor profile. Here's why:\n\n1. **Balanced flavor:** Medium-dark roasts often offer a balanced flavor profile, which can help tone down the bitterness and acidity found in medium roasts.\n2. **Reduced acidity:** As you move from medium to medium-dark roast, the acidity tends to decrease, resulting in a smoother taste.\n3. **Body and texture:** Medium-dark roasts typically have a fuller body and a more velvety texture, which can contribute to a smoother mouthfeel.\n4. **Flavor nuances:** Medium-dark roasts can bring out flavors like chocolate, nuts, and caramel, which can add depth and complexity to your coffee without overpowering it.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that a medium-dark roast might not be the perfect solution if:\n\n1. **You're sensitive to bitterness:** While medium-dark roasts are generally smoother, they can still have a slightly bitter taste, especially if you're sensitive to it.\n2. **You prefer a bright, acidic flavor:** If you enjoy the bright, acidic notes in your medium roast, you might find a medium-dark roast too mellow.\n\nTo make the most of a medium-dark roast, consider the following:\n\n1. **Adjust your brewing time:** As you mentioned, brewing time can greatly impact the flavor. Start with a slightly shorter brewing time to prevent over-extraction and bitterness.\n2. **Experiment with ratios:** Try adjusting the coffee-to-water ratio to find the perfect balance for your taste preferences.\n3. **Choose a high-quality bean:** Look for a high-quality, freshly roasted medium-dark roast from a reputable roaster to ensure the best flavor.\n\nIf you're willing to experiment, trying a medium-dark roast could be a great next step. You might find that it's the perfect balance of flavor and smoothness for your taste buds.",
