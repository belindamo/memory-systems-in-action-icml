It's always a relief when you find a piece that fits perfectly, and it sounds like your black ankle boots from Zara are a winner!\n\nTrying on the leather jacket with your blazer and blouse at Madison Island is a great idea. It's always better to see how the pieces work together in person, and you can get a sense of how the fabrics, textures, and silhouettes interact.\n\nRemember to take your time, and don't be afraid to ask the sales associates for their opinion or advice. They might have some great styling tips or suggestions that can help you create a look that's all your own.\n\nAnd yay for your black ankle boots! Four wears already is a great sign that they're going to be a staple in your wardrobe. It's always exciting to find a piece that becomes a go-to, and I'm sure you'll continue to style them in many different ways.\n\nHave fun trying on the leather jacket, and I hope you find a look that makes you feel confident and stylish!",
