Here's a simple recipe to make mochi ice cream at home:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups glutinous rice flour (also known as mochiko)\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup water\n* Food coloring (optional)\n* Ice cream of your choice (e.g., green tea, mango, coconut)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour and sugar.\n2. Gradually add in the water and mix until a dough forms.\n3. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and pliable.\n4. Divide the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter.\n5. Flatten each ball into a disk shape.\n6. Place a scoop of your chosen ice cream in the center of each disk.\n7. Fold the mochi dough over the ice cream and press the edges together to seal.\n8. Serve immediately, or store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 days.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a high-quality glutinous rice flour that's specifically labeled as \"mochiko\" or \"sweet rice flour.\"\n* If the dough is too sticky, add a little more glutinous rice flour. If it's too dry, add a little more water.\n* Experiment with different ice cream flavors and mix-ins, like matcha, sesame, or red bean.\n\n**Manju**\n\nManju is a traditional Japanese steamed bun filled with sweet bean paste or ice cream. Here's a simple recipe to make manju at home:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 2 tablespoons sugar\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon instant dry yeast\n* 1/2 cup warm water\n* Filling of your choice (e.g., sweet bean paste, ice cream, red bean paste)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.\n2. Add the yeast and warm water, and mix until a dough forms.\n3. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n4. Divide the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter.\n5. Flatten each ball into a disk shape.\n6. Place a small amount of filling in the center of each disk.\n7.
