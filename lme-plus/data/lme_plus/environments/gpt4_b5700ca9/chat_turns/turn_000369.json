  "content": "Fees must be paid to Flywire in one of two ways\n\nTwo transactions, one of principal to PayZen from user, and one of fee to Flywire\n\nOne transaction, where PayZen immediately routes monies to Flywire via ACH.\n\nWe follow a similar process for sweeping funds to different investor accounts\n\nCurrent State\n\nFuture State\n\nWe would need to route $3.95 to FW for each payment collected.\n\n \n\nBalance Adjustment Offboard\nIf FW cancels the plan due to the balance increasing beyond $30k, we must follow a different cancelation process as per our normal cancellation process.\n\nNormal Cancelation Process\n\nPlease see Cancel Plan Automation for details. TL;DR we will refund the patient if they paid PayZen more than what was owed. This will not be done via an API, our staff will manage.\n\nWe have to update the plan when this happens and send a webhook to Flywire.\n\nProvider Funded Offboard\n\nIf a plan is adjusted to be over $30k, our partners must tell us why the plan is canceled, specifically for this reason; TL;DR cancelation logic will be that we refund all funds to the provider and mark adjustments / net-settle as we typically do (we do not refund patient payments to the patient, but to the provider and simply mark down the balance)\u2014Balance Adjustment | General Rules .\n\n \n\nAsset Purchase Requirements\nSupport the ability for FW to create plans in PayZen with existing balances\n\nCreate a new endpoint for FW to onboard these servicing transfer plans\n\nFollow the process we used to board plans with Scratch (Migration endpoint w/ Peach)\n\nCreate payment plan agreements and receivables for these individuals, collate records from FW of when users agreed to their terms.\n\n:art: User interaction and design\nWe must present users a new total payment plan amount for modification purposes. We must call out that the service fee is a \u201cFlywire Fee.\u201d We can leverage the same heuristics as FW, see below. FW document this here.",
