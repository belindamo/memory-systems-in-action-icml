Open your windows for a few hours each day, weather permitting. 2. Use natural air fresheners: Essential oils, dried herbs, and natural fruit, like oranges or lemons, can all be used to make natural air fresheners. You can put these items in a bowl or sachet to add a lovely scent to your home. 3. Clean regularly: Keeping your home clean and tidy will help keep it smelling fresh. Vacuum carpets, dust surfaces, wash linens frequently, and take out the garbage regularly. 4. Use baking soda: Baking soda is great for absorbing odors. Place an open container of baking soda in your refrigerator, closet, or other spaces that tend to get musty. 5. Light candles: Candles are a great way to add ambiance and fragrance to your home. Choose candles made from natural materials like beeswax or soy and avoid those made from synthetic fragrances. By incorporating these tips into your cleaning routine, you can keep your home smelling fresh and welcoming all year round.",
