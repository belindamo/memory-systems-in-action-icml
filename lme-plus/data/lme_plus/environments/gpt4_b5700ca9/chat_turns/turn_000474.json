  "content": "Yes, consistency is key when it comes to exercise. For someone who is new to working out or has not exercised in a while, it's best to start with 2-3 days per week, with at least one rest day in between each workout day to allow your muscles time to recover. As you get more comfortable with the routine and your fitness level improves, you can gradually increase your workout frequency and intensity. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most or all days of the week. Remember, it's important to find an exercise routine that works for you and that you enjoy.",
