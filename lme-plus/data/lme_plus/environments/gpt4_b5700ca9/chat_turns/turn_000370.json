  "content": "To ensure a seamless user experience, we will need to present users with a clear and easy-to-understand breakdown of their payment plan, including the service fee charged by Flywire. We can leverage the same heuristics as Flywire, which calls out the service fee as a separate line item in the payment plan breakdown.\n\nWe will also need to ensure that any modifications to the payment plan, such as adding a new bill or rolling up existing bills, are reflected accurately in the payment plan breakdown and that any changes to the service fee are clearly communicated to the user.\n\nAdditionally, we will need to ensure that our user interfaces are intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly and easily manage their payment plans and view their payment histories. We will work closely with Flywire to ensure that our UIs are consistent with their brand and design guidelines, while also incorporating our own unique features and functionality.",
