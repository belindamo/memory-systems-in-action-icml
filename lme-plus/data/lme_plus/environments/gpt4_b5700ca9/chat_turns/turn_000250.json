  "content": "I see, if the variation in the amount of liquid is 100% related in the two batches, then the measurements of the amount of liquid and the amount of alcohol are not completely independent. In this case, you can use the formula for the combined standard deviation that takes into account the covariance between the two measurements:\n\nCombined standard deviation = sqrt((SD1)^2 + (SD2)^2 + 2*r*SD1\\*SD2)\n\nwhere SD1 is the standard deviation of the measurements of the amount of liquid, SD2 is the standard deviation of the measurements of the amount of alcohol, and r is the correlation coefficient between the two measurements.\n\nIf the variation in the amount of liquid is 100% related between the two batches, then the correlation coefficient between the two measurements is 1. The formula for the combined standard deviation simplifies to:\n\nCombined standard deviation = sqrt((SD1)^2 + (SD2)^2 + 2*SD1*SD2)\n\nPlugging in the values from your previous examples, where SD1 = 1.5 grams and SD2 = 1.12 grams, we get:\n\nCombined standard deviation = sqrt((1.5)^2 + (1.12)^2 + 2*1.5*1.12) = 2.3 grams\n\nSo the combined standard deviation of the two measurements is 2.3 grams.",
