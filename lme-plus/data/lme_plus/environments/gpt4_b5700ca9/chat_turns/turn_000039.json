  "content": "Of course! In my basic algebra course, I currently use a traditional lecture format in which I present concepts and examples on the board while students take notes. In addition, I assign problem sets for students to work on outside of class, which we then review together during class time.\n\nFor the flipped model, I would like to create short video lectures that students can watch before class, freeing up class time for more interactive and collaborative activities. I would also like to create online quizzes and activities to help reinforce concepts and give students more opportunities for practice outside of class.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for how to design these video lectures and online activities to best support student learning?",
