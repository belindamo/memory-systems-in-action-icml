It's great that you're taking the time to double-check the dimensions before making a final decision.\n\nAnd congratulations on finding a desk that you love for your home office! $400 might seem like a lot, but if it's high-quality and meets your needs, it's a worthwhile investment. Good storage is especially important for a home office, as it can help keep you organized and focused.\n\nWest Elm is known for its high-quality furniture, so I'm sure your new desk will be a great addition to your home office. It's exciting that it's arriving next Wednesday - you must be looking forward to getting set up and organized!\n\nSince you've already found a desk you like, I'm curious: what made you choose that particular one? Was it the design, the storage options, or something else that drew you to it?\n\nAlso, have you thought about how you'll style and organize your new home office?
