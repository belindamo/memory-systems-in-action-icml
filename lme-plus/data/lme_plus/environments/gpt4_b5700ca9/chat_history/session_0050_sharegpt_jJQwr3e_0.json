      "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, FL Studio does not have an official Python API. However, there is an unofficial Python API called \"pydaw\" which was developed by a third-party developer. This API allows users to interact with FL Studio to some extent, but it's not officially supported by Image-Line, the company behind FL Studio.\n\nUsing the unofficial API, you can perform tasks like:\n\n1. Navigating the project structure: You can access and manipulate different elements of the project, such as patterns, tracks, and mixer channels.\n2. MIDI data manipulation: You can create, edit, and delete MIDI notes and control change events.\n3. Automation clip management: You can create, modify, and delete automation clips.\n4. Sample and plugin management: You can load and manage samples, as well as interact with VST plugins.\n5. Project rendering: You can render your project into an audio file format such as WAV, MP3, or OGG.\n\nKeep in mind that since this is an unofficial API, there might be limitations and compatibility issues, and it may not always work as expected. It is always recommended to use official APIs or SDKs provided by the software developers, but in the case of FL Studio, there is no such official support for Python as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021."

      "content": "Yes, FL Studio provides an SDK called the FL Studio SDK, which allows developers to create plugins and extensions for the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The SDK is primarily designed for creating VST plugins, native FL Studio plugins (such as effects, generators, and controllers), and other extensions.\n\nThe FL Studio SDK is written in C/C++, and you can find the documentation and the SDK files on the Image-Line website. To get started, you can visit their developer portal and download the SDK, along with example projects and documentation:\n\n<https://www.image-line.com/developers/>\n\nPlease note that the SDK is not for Python, but for C/C++. If you want to develop plugins or extensions for FL Studio, you will need to have some experience with C/C++ programming. However, you can still use Python for other parts of your project and communicate with your C/C++ code using various inter-process communication methods or language bindings like ctypes or Boost.Python."

It would be a multi step workflow:\n1) The user describes what they want to hear. For example, a happy chord progression. They give the key of the song they're producing and any other useful info in this description.\n2) The user is provided with multiple options in the form of MIDI \n3) The user can then use the generated midi in their song.\n\nCan we test this out? You act as GPT-4 in this case. I'll act as the user. Just generate 2 different versions of the request.\n\nUser Request: I'd like a happy, but interesting chord progression\nAI Response:"
