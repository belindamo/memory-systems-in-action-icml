One ounce of avocado contains around 50 calories, while one ounce of nuts can contain anywhere from 160 to 200 calories. Similarly, one tablespoon of olive oil has around 120 calories. However, it's important to note that the type of fat found in avocado is predominantly monounsaturated, which is considered healthier than the saturated fats found in many other high-fat foods. Additionally, avocados are rich in nutrients such as fiber, potassium, and vitamin C, making them a healthy addition to any diet when consumed in moderation."
