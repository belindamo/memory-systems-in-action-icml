Work on cardio for 20-30 minutes. This can be a brisk walk, jogging, cycling, or swimming.\n\n3. Move onto strength training exercises for your upper body, lower body, and core.

Finish with a 5-minute cool-down of stretching exercises such as cat-cow, child's pose, and hamstring stretches.\n\nMake sure to rest for 1-2 days in between workout days to let your muscles recover.

For someone who is new to working out or has not exercised in a while, it's best to start with 2-3 days per week, with at least one rest day in between each workout day to allow your muscles time to recover. As you get more comfortable with the routine and your fitness level improves, you can gradually increase your workout frequency and intensity. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most or all days of the week. Remember, it's important to find an exercise routine that works for you and that you enjoy."
