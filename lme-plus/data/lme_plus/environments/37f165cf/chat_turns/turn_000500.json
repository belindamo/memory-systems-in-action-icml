It's always important to have a good instructor who can break down complex recipes into manageable steps, and it sounds like Chef Maria did a great job of that.\n\nThe Cooking Academy is a great option for a sushi-making class! I've heard excellent reviews about their classes, and sushi-making is a fantastic skill to learn.

They also provide a fun and relaxed atmosphere, which makes the learning experience even more enjoyable.\n\nIf you're interested in taking the sushi-making class, I'd definitely recommend signing up for it! You'll get to learn a new skill, enjoy a fun and interactive cooking experience, and take home some delicious sushi to share with friends and family.\n\nHave you ever made sushi before, or is this a new culinary adventure for you?",
