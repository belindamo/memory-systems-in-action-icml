  "content": "I totally understand! Hawaii can be pricey, but there are ways to experience the islands without breaking the bank. I'd be happy to help you find affordable accommodations and restaurants that are off the beaten path.\n\n**Affordable Accommodations:**\n\n1. **Vacation Rentals:** Consider renting a condo or apartment through websites like VRBO, Airbnb, or HomeAway. These options often offer more space and amenities at a lower cost than hotels. You can find great deals, especially if you're willing to stay in a neighborhood that's a bit further from the beach.\n2. **Hostels:** Yes, hostels! Hawaii has some amazing hostels that offer dorms and private rooms at a fraction of the cost of hotels. Check out Hostelworld or Booking.com for options like the Honolulu Hostel or the Beach House Hostel on Oahu.\n3. **Budget Hotels:** Look for locally-owned hotels or motels that offer simple, no-frills accommodations at a lower price point. Some options include the Ohana Waikiki East Hotel on Oahu or the Hilo Hawaiian Hotel on the Big Island.\n\n**Non-Touristy Restaurants:**\n\n1. **Local Eats:** Head to neighborhoods like Kaka'ako or Chinatown on Oahu, or Hilo Town on the Big Island, where you'll find authentic, affordable eateries serving traditional Hawaiian dishes like laulau, kalua pig, and poke.\n2. **Food Trucks:** Food trucks are popular in Hawaii, and they offer a quick, affordable bite.
