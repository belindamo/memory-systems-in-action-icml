  "content": "The size of a company that offers profit-sharing can vary greatly depending on the industry, location, and other factors. However, it is possible for even small companies to offer profit-sharing as a benefit to their employees.\n\nFor example, a small business with only a few employees may offer a simple profit-sharing plan where a percentage of the company's profits is distributed among the employees at the end of the year. In some cases, small businesses may even partner with a financial services provider to set up a 401(k) plan with profit-sharing features, although this can be more complex and may not be feasible for all small businesses.\n\nUltimately, the size of a company that offers profit-sharing will depend on the specific circumstances of the business, and there is no specific minimum size requirement for offering this benefit.",
