Here's a modified version of the recipe with lower carbs and cholesterol content, using metric units and suitable for a fan forced oven:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4-6 bone-in, skinless chicken thighs\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* 1/2 cup chicken broth (low-sodium)\n* 1/2 cup reduced-fat coconut cream\n* 2 tbsp whole grain mustard\n* 1 tbsp honey or sugar-free sweetener\n* 1 tsp dried thyme\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat the fan forced oven to 200\u00b0C.\n2. Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper.\n3. Heat the olive oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat.\n4. Add the chicken thighs to the skillet and cook until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.\n5. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n6. In the same skillet, add the chicken broth, reduced-fat coconut cream, whole grain mustard, honey (or sugar-free sweetener), and dried thyme.\n7. Whisk the sauce together and bring it to a simmer.\n8. Return the chicken thighs to the skillet and spoon some of the sauce over the top of each thigh.\n9. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is bubbly and slightly thickened, about 25-30 minutes.\n10. Once the chicken is cooked, remove the skillet from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.\n11. Serve the chicken thighs with the creamy sauce spooned over the top.\n\nThis modified recipe has fewer carbs and less cholesterol compared to the original recipe by using skinless chicken thighs, low-sodium chicken broth, reduced-fat coconut cream, and whole grain mustard. You can also reduce the amount of honey or use a sugar-free sweetener to further reduce the carb content. Enjoy!",
