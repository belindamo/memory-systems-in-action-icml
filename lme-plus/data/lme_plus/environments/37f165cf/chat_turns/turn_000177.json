In the past, Mellotrons were challenging to maintain because they used tapes, which were prone to erasure, damage, and wear. Furthermore, Mellotrons had a limited range of sounds, and switching between tapes could be time-consuming.\n\nHowever, with the advancements in music technology in recent years, the Mellotron has undergone significant changes. Today, Mellotron samples are readily accessible in software and digital synthesizer plugins, making them more convenient and far easier to use. Moreover, modern Mellotron samples are designed to sound like classic Mellotron recordings, but with added functionality like timing and tuning controls, making them more versatile and easy to modify.\n\nIn modern music, Mellotron samples are commonly used in various genres, such as indie-rock, pop, and electronic music. Furthermore, contemporary artists use samples of Mellotron sounds blended with a wide range of instruments to form new creative sounds that push the Mellotron beyond its limitations. Mellotron samples can be layered with other digital instruments, augmented with effects, and even triggered by MIDI controllers.\n\nIn summary, technology advancements have revolutionized the Mellotron, making it more accessible, versatile, and modern. Consequently, Mellotron samples continue to be used by contemporary artists to add a vintage flavor and uniqueness to their productions.",
