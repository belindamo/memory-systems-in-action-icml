Don't worry, I've got some tips to help you minimize the waterworks:\n\n1. **Use a very sharp knife**: A sharp knife causes less damage to the cells of the onion, releasing fewer irritant compounds into the air. A dull knife, on the other hand, will crush the cells, making you cry more.\n2. **Cut under cold running water**: This is the technique you might have learned in your cooking class! The water helps to dilute the sulfur compounds that make you tear up. Simply place the onion under the faucet and slice it while the water is running.\n3. **Cut from the root end to the top**: Starting from the root end, slice the onion in a direction parallel to the lines on the onion. This helps to minimize the amount of cell damage and reduces tear-inducing compounds.\n4. **Leave the onion in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before chopping**: Chilling the onion slows down the release of the enzymes that cause tearing.\n5. **Cut in a well-ventilated area**: Open a window or turn on the exhaust fan to remove the gas released by the onion from the air.\n6. **Use protective gear**: Wear goggles or glasses to protect your eyes from the irritant compounds. You can also try using a mask or holding your breath while chopping.\n7. **Try using a different type of onion**: Some people find that certain types of onions, like sweet onions or red onions, cause less tearing than others.\n8. **Use a tool**: If you're really struggling, consider using a tool like an onion chopper or an onion goggles (yes, they exist!) to minimize contact with the onion.\n\nAs for making pesto from scratch, it's relatively easy and only requires a few ingredients:\n\n**Classic Basil Pesto Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups fresh basil leaves\n* 1/3 cup pine nuts (or walnuts or almonds)\n* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil\n* 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* Salt, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a food processor, combine basil leaves, pine nuts, and garlic. Process until well combined.\n2. Add Parmesan cheese and process until the mixture is well combined and slightly smooth.\n3. With the processor running, slowly pour in the olive oil through the top. Process until the pesto reaches your desired consistency.\n4. Season with salt to taste.\n\nThat's it! You can store your homemade pesto in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week or freeze it for up to 6 months.\n\nI hope these tips help you conquer onion chopping and pesto making!",
