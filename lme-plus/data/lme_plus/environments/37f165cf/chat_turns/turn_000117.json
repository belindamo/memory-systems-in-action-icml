Negotiate trade agreements: Governments can negotiate bilateral, regional, or multilateral trade agreements that aim to reduce trade barriers and promote more stable trade conditions. These agreements typically include provisions for reducing tariffs, quotas, and other barriers to trade.\n\n2. Harmonize regulations: Governments can work together to harmonize regulations and standards, making it easier for businesses to comply with different regulatory systems in different countries.\n\n3. Enhance trade facilitation: Governments can improve trade facilitation by simplifying customs procedures, reducing paperwork, and improving transport and logistics infrastructure at ports and borders.\n\n4. Promote transparency: Governments can promote transparency by providing information about regulations, standards, and trade policies, helping businesses to better understand the trade environment in different countries.\n\n5. Address non-tariff barriers: Governments can address non-tariff barriers to trade, such as technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and intellectual property rights.\n\nSome examples of successful trade agreements include:\n\n1. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA): This agreement replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and aims to modernize and update trade relations between the three countries, reducing barriers to trade and promoting more open markets.\n\n2. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP): This agreement includes 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region and aims to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade, as well as establish common rules and standards for trade.\n\n3. The European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement: This agreement aims to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade between the European Union and Singapore, as well as promote investment and protect intellectual property rights.",
