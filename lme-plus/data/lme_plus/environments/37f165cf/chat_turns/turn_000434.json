This approach encourages readers to engage more actively with the material, making her stories feel more like a conversation than a lecture.\n\n**Exploring the Gray Areas:**\n\nOne of Oyeyemi's strengths is her ability to explore the gray areas between right and wrong, good and evil.

Her stories may not tackle specific news headlines, but they often explore the underlying power dynamics, social structures, and cultural norms that shape our world.
