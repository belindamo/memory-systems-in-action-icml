Professional golfers at the highest level not only have to be physically skilled but also mentally strong to perform under pressure, handle the spotlight, and deal with setbacks and challenges. Being successful in golf requires an incredible amount of focus, patience, and resilience, especially in major tournaments where the stakes are higher and the pressure is amplified.
