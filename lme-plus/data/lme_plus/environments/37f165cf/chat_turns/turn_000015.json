  "content": "The CTA 'L' Train is a convenient and affordable way to get to the city center.\n\nYou can buy a Ventra card at O'Hare Airport, so you don't need to purchase it online beforehand. Here's how:\n\n1. At O'Hare Airport, follow the signs to the CTA 'L' Train station (located in Terminal 2).\n2. Before you head down to the platform, look for the Ventra vending machines or the Ventra Customer Service Center.\n3. You can buy a Ventra card from the vending machine using cash, credit, or debit cards. The machine will dispense a physical card, and you can load value onto it.\n4. If you need assistance or have questions, visit the Ventra Customer Service Center, where staff can help you purchase and set up your Ventra card.\n\nThe Ventra card costs $3, and you can load value onto it in $1 increments, with a minimum of $3. You can also set up a Ventra account online or through the Ventra app to manage your card, add value, and track your balance.\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to buy your Ventra card before you head down to the platform, as you'll need it to enter the station.\n* If you plan to use the CTA frequently during your stay, consider buying a 1-7 day pass, which can be a cost-effective option.\n* You can also use your contactless bank card or mobile payment method (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay) to pay for your fare, but a Ventra card is still a good option if you plan to use the CTA extensively.\n\nNow that you've got your transportation sorted, enjoy your trip to Chicago!",
