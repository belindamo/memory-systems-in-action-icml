  "content": "I'm glad you recommended \"The Alice Network\"! I'm definitely interested in reading more about women's roles during wartime. Speaking of which, I just finished reading \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah, which had 440 pages and took me around 5 weeks to complete. Do you think I would enjoy \"The Women in the Castle\" by Jessica Shattuck, given my reading pace and interest in historical fiction?",
