  "content": "While it is common for 401(k) plans to offer profit-sharing, not all plans do so. Some smaller employers or businesses may opt not to offer profit-sharing for various reasons, such as cost or complexity. However, it's worth noting that the specific types of 401(k) plans that do not offer profit-sharing may vary depending on the source of the data and the criteria used to define a \"401(k) plan.\"\n\nIt's also important to note that while profit-sharing is a common feature in many 401(k) plans, it is not a requirement under the law. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides guidelines and rules for how 401(k) plans must be structured, but it is up to the plan sponsor (usually the employer) to determine the specific features of the plan, including whether or not to offer profit-sharing.",
