Here are some additional criteria that can be added to the matrix:\n\n\n| Criteria | Coach 1 | Coach 2 | Coach 3 | Coach 4 | Coach 5 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Coaching Certification | ICF PCC | ICF ACC | ICF MCC | EMCC | No Certification |\n| Language | English | Spanish | French | Mandarin | Other |\n| Age Group | Adults | Young Adults | Seniors | Adolescents | Children |\n| Coaching Method | In-person | Virtual | Hybrid | Telephone | Email |\n| Fees | $$$$ | $$$ | $$ | $ | Complimentary Session |\nTo use this matrix to match coaches with clients, you can ask clients to fill out a coaching intake form that includes information about their coaching needs and preferences. You can then match the client with a coach who fits their criteria based on the matrix.\nFor example, let\u2019s say a client is looking for an executive coach with at least 10 years of experience in the finance industry, who is available on weekdays and has an analytical personality. Based on these criteria, you could match them with Coach 1.\nAlternatively, if a client is looking for a career coach who speaks Spanish, works virtually, and charges a moderate fee, you could match them with Coach 2.\nBy using this matrix to match coaches and clients, you can ensure that each client is paired with a coach who can best meet their needs and goals. Additionally, you can use this matrix to identify areas where you may need to recruit additional coaches or offer additional training to your existing coaching team.",
