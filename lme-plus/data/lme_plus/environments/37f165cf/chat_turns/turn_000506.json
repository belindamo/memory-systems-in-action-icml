However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experience with farming or direct access to your vet's recommendations. It's always best to consult with your veterinarian for specific advice on your chicken's health and nutrition.\n\nThat being said, I can provide some general information on calcium supplements for chickens. Calcium is essential for strong eggshell production, and supplements can be beneficial for hens like Henrietta. The frequency of supplementation may vary depending on factors like Henrietta's age, breed, diet, and individual needs.\n\nHere are some general guidelines:\n\n* Laying hens typically require around 2-3% calcium in their diet.\n* Calcium supplements can be given daily, but it's essential to follow the product instructions and your vet's recommendations.\n* You may need to adjust the frequency or amount of supplementation based on Henrietta's egg production, shell quality, and overall health.\n\nTo ensure you're providing the best care for Henrietta, I recommend consulting with your veterinarian to discuss:\n\n* The specific calcium supplement product recommended for Henrietta\n* The correct dosage and frequency of supplementation\n* Any potential interactions with her regular feed or other supplements\n* Monitoring Henrietta's response to the supplements and making adjustments as needed\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your animal's health. Your veterinarian can provide personalized guidance to help Henrietta thrive!\n\nNow, let's add a task to your list:\n\n**Task 4: Consult with veterinarian about Henrietta's calcium supplements**\n\n* Schedule a call or visit with your veterinarian\n* Discuss Henrietta's calcium supplement needs and schedule\n* Follow veterinarian's recommendations for supplementation and monitoring\n\nHow's that?",
