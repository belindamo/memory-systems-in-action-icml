It's a blend of rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca flour.\n2. **Pamela's Products Gluten-Free Artisan Flour Blend**: This blend is designed for artisan-style baking and contains a combination of rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca flour. It's a great option for muffins, cakes, and breads.\n3. **King Arthur Gluten-Free Multi-Purpose Flour**: This blend is a combination of rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca flour, and is designed for a wide range of gluten-free baking applications.\n4. **Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour Blend by Anthony's**: This blend is a combination of rice flour, potato starch, tapioca flour, and coconut flour, making it a great option for those who want a coconut-based flour blend.\n\n**Tips for Using Gluten-Free Flour Blends:**\n\n1. **Use a 1:1 substitution ratio**: Replace the all-purpose flour with an equal amount of gluten-free flour blend.\n2. **Add xanthan gum or guar gum**: These gums help with texture and structure in gluten-free baking. Start with 1/4 teaspoon per cup of gluten-free flour and adjust as needed.\n3. **Adjust liquid content**: Gluten-free flours can absorb more liquid, so you may need to increase the liquid content in the recipe. Start with the recommended amount and adjust as needed.\n4. **Be gentle when mixing**: Overmixing can lead to tough, dense gluten-free baked goods. Mix wet and dry ingredients separately and gently fold them together until just combined.\n\n**Additional Tips for Gluten-Free Muffin Baking:**\n\n1. **Use a lower oven temperature**: Gluten-free muffins can burn easily, so reduce the oven temperature by 25\u00b0F (15\u00b0C) to prevent over-browning.\n2. **Check for doneness**: Gluten-free muffins can be more dense and may take longer to cook through. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of a muffin.\n\nBy using a good gluten-free flour blend and following these tips, you should be able to create delicious and tender Cranberry-Orange-Pecan muffins that your gluten-free friend will love!",
