  "content": "That's really helpful! I've been thinking about how I can make my trip to Hawaii more authentic and immersive. I've realized that booking resorts and restaurants that cater to tourists can be expensive and feels very touristy. I'd love to stay in a locally-owned accommodation and eat at local eateries that serve traditional Hawaiian dishes. Can you recommend some affordable and authentic options for me?",
