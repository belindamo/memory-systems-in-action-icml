  "content": "We learned to make bruschetta and tiramisu, which were both delicious. The bruschetta was really interesting because we used canned tomatoes, but I've since tried making it with fresh tomatoes from my garden and it's a whole different ball game. And the tiramisu was a lot easier to make than I thought it would be. Our instructor, Chef Maria, was great and provided a lot of helpful tips.",
