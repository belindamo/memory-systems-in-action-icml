  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs but I can provide you with the factors ITU-T considers when developing new telecommunications standards:\n\n1. Technical feasibility: ITU-T considers the technical feasibility of implementing new standards, which includes the feasibility of designing and developing new technologies, and the compatibility of new technologies with existing ones.\n\n2. Market demand: ITU-T takes into account market demand for the given technology, in order to ensure that new standards will be widely adopted by industry and consumers.\n\n3. Economic viability: ITU-T considers the costs of developing and implementing new standards, as well as potential economic benefits and risks associated with the new technology.\n\n4. Compatibility: ITU-T assesses the compatibility of new standards with existing ones, in order to ensure that they can be integrated and coexist with other standards.\n\n5. Security: ITU-T considers the security implications of new technologies and aims to develop standards that provide a high degree of security for users and network infrastructure.\n\n6. Interoperability: ITU-T ensures that new standards are interoperable with existing standards, which means that different systems can work together seamlessly.\n\n7. Environmental impact: ITU-T considers the environmental impact of new technologies and aims to develop standards that are environmentally sustainable.",
