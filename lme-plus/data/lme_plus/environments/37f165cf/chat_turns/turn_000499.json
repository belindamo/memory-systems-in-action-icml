Chef Maria did a great job of breaking down each recipe into manageable steps, and we got to do a lot of hands-on cooking, which was really helpful. The recipes were definitely easy to follow, and I felt confident making them again on my own.\n\nActually, I haven't been back to Tasty Studios yet, but I've been thinking about taking another class there. I've also been wanting to try out The Cooking Academy, I've heard good things about their sushi-making class. Do you know anything about that?",
