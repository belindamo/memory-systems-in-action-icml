  "content": "I'm thinking of making a few other dishes to go along with the pumpkin pie, and I was wondering if you have any suggestions for some classic fall side dishes that pair well with the flavors of pumpkin and turkey. By the way, I'm still recovering from a sunburn I got during my beach trip last month, so I'm trying to avoid spending too much time in the kitchen.
