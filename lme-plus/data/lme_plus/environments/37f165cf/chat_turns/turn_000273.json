  "content": "Sure, a recent example of a telecommunications standard developed by ITU-T is the Recommendation ITU-T H.265, also known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). This standard, which was finalized in 2013, was developed to provide a more efficient method for compressing video files than its predecessor, the H.264 standard. HEVC can compress video files up to twice as efficiently as H.264, which translates to significant improvements in video quality for the same file size or reduced file size for the same quality. This standard is widely used in applications such as streaming video over the internet, video conferencing, and digital television broadcasting.",
