  "content": "With synthetic blend oil, you're likely good to go for a bit longer than with traditional oil.\n\nSince you got the synthetic blend oil about 2 months ago, and you're not sure when the previous oil change was, it's a good idea to play it safe and follow the recommended oil change interval for your 2018 Honda Civic.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the recommended oil change interval for your vehicle is:\n\n* 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km) for conventional oil\n* 7,500 to 10,000 miles (12,000 to 16,000 km) for synthetic oil\n\nSince you used synthetic blend oil, let's aim for the middle ground. Considering you've already gone 2 months, I'd recommend getting your oil changed around 5,000 to 6,000 miles (8,000 to 9,600 km) from your last oil change.\n\nTo be extra cautious, you could also check your oil level and condition regularly. If you notice the oil level is low or the oil looks dirty, it's a good idea to get it changed sooner rather than later.\n\nAdditionally, since your previous oil change was done at the dealership, you might want to check your maintenance records to see if they have any specific recommendations for your vehicle.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to oil changes. If you're unsure or have any concerns, you can always consult with a trusted mechanic or the dealership for guidance.\n\nHope that helps!",
