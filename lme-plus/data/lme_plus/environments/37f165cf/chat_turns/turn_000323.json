However, historically, the prize money for major golf tournaments like the Masters, US Open, and Open Championship have been similar, with first-place payouts ranging from $1.8 to $2.5 million. The PGA Championship typically offers a lower total purse than the other majors, but the payouts are still substantial. The specific payout structure varies from tournament to tournament, but typically the top finishers earn a larger portion of the total purse, with the winner receiving the largest share. Additionally, some tournaments may offer bonuses or incentives for players who make the cut, finish in the top 10, or score a hole-in-one.",
