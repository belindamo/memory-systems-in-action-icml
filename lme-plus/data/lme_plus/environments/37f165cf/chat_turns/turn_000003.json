Open the Instagram app and go to your profile page.\n3. Tap the three horizontal lines on the top-right corner.\n4.

Go to the \"Content\" tab in Insights.\n2. Select the time period you want to analyze (e.g., the past 6 weeks).\n3. Look at the \"Engagement\" metric, which shows the total engagement on your posts during that time period.\n4.
