According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), the average revenue for a small business in the United States was $1.2 million in 2020. However, this figure can vary greatly depending on the size and type of business.\n\nFor example, small businesses in the healthcare and social assistance industry had an average revenue of $1.7 million, while small businesses in the retail trade industry had an average revenue of $797,000. The average revenue for small businesses in the construction industry was $1.6 million, while the average revenue for small businesses in the professional, scientific, and technical services industry was $1.5 million.\n\nIt's worth noting that the definition of a small business varies depending on the industry and other factors such as annual revenue and number of employees. The SBA defines a small business based on industry-specific size standards that take into account factors such as the average annual receipts or the number of employees in the industry.",
