  "content": "\"A futuristic battle between droids and humans. Explosions and ships can be seen at a distance. The camera should be positioned high above the battle, giving an aerial view of the chaos below. The lens should be set to capture 4K resolution, highlighting the intricate details of the droids and ships, as well as the smoke and fire from the explosions. As the camera pans and tilts, it should reveal the full scale of the battle and the destruction it is causing. The final shot should be a close-up of a droid and a human locked in an intense fight, their expressions full of determination and intensity.\"",
