You can ask questions like:\n\n* What kind of support services do you offer for international students?\n* How can I access counseling or mental health support services?\n* Are there any specific resources available for students with disabilities or mental health conditions?\n* How do you promote student well-being and mental health awareness within the residence?\n\nBy asking these questions, you can get a better understanding of the support services available to you and make an informed decision about which residence is the best fit for your needs.\n\nI hope this helps you feel more confident about the support services available to you as an international student in Edinburgh!",
