  "content": "Yes, street art that uses technology or incorporates interactive elements has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Many street artists use technologies such as projection mapping or augmented reality to create dynamic and temporally-shifting works that respond to their surroundings or to user input. For instance, some artists use QR codes or mobile applications to add digital layers to their artwork, allowing viewers to access additional content, like animations or sound effects, by scanning or interacting with the pieces in different ways. Other interactive street art installations use sensors, motion detectors, or other digital technologies to create immersive and participatory experiences that blur the line between viewer and artist. These types of street art installations not only make for visually-striking additions to the urban landscape, but also provide new ways for viewers to engage with and experience art in public spaces.",
