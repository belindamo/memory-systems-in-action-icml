  "content": "Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 1:1 Baking Flour is a great choice for gluten-free baking.\n\nAs for substituting almond flour for some of the gluten-free flour blend, you can definitely do that! Almond flour can add a delicious nutty flavor and texture to your Cranberry-Orange-Pecan muffins. However, keep in mind that almond flour behaves differently than gluten-free flour blends, so you'll need to make some adjustments to the recipe.\n\n**Tips for using almond flour:**\n\n1. **Use a combination of gluten-free flour blend and almond flour**: Replace up to 25% of the gluten-free flour blend with almond flour. This will give you a nice balance of flavor and texture.\n2. **Reduce the amount of liquid**: Almond flour absorbs more liquid than gluten-free flour blends, so reduce the liquid content in the recipe by about 10-15%. This will help prevent a too-wet batter.\n3. **Adjust the ratio of sugar**: Almond flour can make baked goods more dense, so you may want to reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe to balance the flavor.\n4. **Be gentle when mixing**: Almond flour can be delicate, so mix the wet and dry ingredients separately and gently fold them together until just combined.\n\nHere's an example of how you could modify the Cranberry-Orange-Pecan muffin recipe to incorporate almond flour:\n\n**Modified Recipe:**\n\n* 1 1/2 cups Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 1:1 Baking Flour\n* 1/2 cup almond flour\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar (reduced from 1 cup)\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted\n* 1 large egg\n* 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 1/2 teaspoon orange zest\n* 1/2 cup chopped pecans\n* 1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries\n\nRemember to adjust the liquid content and sugar ratio according to the tips above. Also, keep an eye on the muffins while they're baking, as they may cook more quickly due to the almond flour.\n\nBy incorporating almond flour into your recipe, you'll add a delicious nutty flavor and texture to your Cranberry-Orange-Pecan muffins. Enjoy!",
