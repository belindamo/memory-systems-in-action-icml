The Creamy Chicken Thighs recipe you've shared is a delicious-sounding dish that I'm sure many people will enjoy.\n\nFor anyone who is interested in making this recipe, the ingredients needed are:\n\n* 4-6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 2 tbsp butter\n* 1/2 cup chicken broth\n* 1/2 cup heavy cream\n* 2 tbsp Dijon mustard\n* 1 tbsp honey\n* 1 tsp dried thyme\n\nTo make this dish, first preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the chicken thighs to the skillet and cook until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.\n\nTo the same skillet, add the chicken broth, heavy cream, Dijon mustard, honey, and dried thyme. Whisk the sauce together and bring it to a simmer. Return the chicken thighs to the skillet and spoon some of the sauce over the top of each thigh. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is bubbly and slightly thickened, about 25-30 minutes.\n\nOnce the chicken is cooked, remove the skillet from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve the chicken thighs with the creamy sauce spooned over the top.\n\nEnjoy your delicious Creamy Chicken Thighs!"
