According to a report by the Plan Sponsor Council of America, approximately 55% of 401(k) plans offered profit-sharing in 2020.

      "content": "While it is common for 401(k) plans to offer profit-sharing, not all plans do so. Some smaller employers or businesses may opt not to offer profit-sharing for various reasons, such as cost or complexity. However, it's worth noting that the specific types of 401(k) plans that do not offer profit-sharing may vary depending on the source of the data and the criteria used to define a \"401(k) plan.\"\n\nIt's also important to note that while profit-sharing is a common feature in many 401(k) plans, it is not a requirement under the law. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides guidelines and rules for how 401(k) plans must be structured, but it is up to the plan sponsor (usually the employer) to determine the specific features of the plan, including whether or not to offer profit-sharing."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The size of a company that offers profit-sharing can vary greatly depending on the industry, location, and other factors. However, it is possible for even small companies to offer profit-sharing as a benefit to their employees.\n\nFor example, a small business with only a few employees may offer a simple profit-sharing plan where a percentage of the company's profits is distributed among the employees at the end of the year. In some cases, small businesses may even partner with a financial services provider to set up a 401(k) plan with profit-sharing features, although this can be more complex and may not be feasible for all small businesses.\n\nUltimately, the size of a company that offers profit-sharing will depend on the specific circumstances of the business, and there is no specific minimum size requirement for offering this benefit."

      "content": "The average revenue of small businesses in the United States can vary widely depending on the industry, location, and other factors. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), the average revenue for a small business in the United States was $1.2 million in 2020. However, this figure can vary greatly depending on the size and type of business.\n\nFor example, small businesses in the healthcare and social assistance industry had an average revenue of $1.7 million, while small businesses in the retail trade industry had an average revenue of $797,000. The average revenue for small businesses in the construction industry was $1.6 million, while the average revenue for small businesses in the professional, scientific, and technical services industry was $1.5 million.\n\nIt's worth noting that the definition of a small business varies depending on the industry and other factors such as annual revenue and number of employees. The SBA defines a small business based on industry-specific size standards that take into account factors such as the average annual receipts or the number of employees in the industry."

These groups may have a variety of restaurant concepts under their umbrella, ranging from fast-casual to fine dining.

Some examples of profitable restaurant groups include Darden Restaurants (owners of Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, and others), Bloomin' Brands (owners of Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, and others), and Union Square Hospitality Group (owners of Shake Shack, Gramercy Tavern, and others)."

Unlike publicly-traded restaurant groups, private restaurant groups are not listed on stock exchanges and do not have shareholders. Instead, they are owned by individuals, families, or private equity firms. Private restaurant groups can be profitable by maintaining a strong focus on customer satisfaction, maintaining efficient operations, and managing costs effectively. Examples of private profitable restaurant groups include Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, and the Starr Restaurant Group."

This is because profit sharing is typically a part of employee compensation and benefits, which falls under the purview of HR. However, depending on the size and structure of the company, other departments such as finance, accounting, or operations may also be involved in the decision-making process for purchasing software that affects the company's financial management or reporting."

However, it is likely that the decision-maker in the HR department would be either the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), Director of Human Resources, or HR Manager. In smaller companies, it could be the owner or CEO who handles HR responsibilities and makes decisions on software purchases."
