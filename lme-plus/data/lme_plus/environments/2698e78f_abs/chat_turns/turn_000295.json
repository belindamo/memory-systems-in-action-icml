It was founded in Brussels, Belgium, in 1973. 2. SWIFT is owned by its members, which include banks, broker-dealers, and other financial institutions around the world. The members use SWIFT to communicate with each other and to access SWIFT's network of connectivity and messaging services. 3. SWIFT facilitates millions of financial transactions every day, with a total value of trillions of dollars. Its system is trusted by banks and financial institutions worldwide due to its security, reliability, and speed. 4. SWIFT has also introduced various other services and products to its network over the years. Some examples include KYC Registry, which allows banks to share due diligence information about their customers; and SWIFT GPI, which enables faster and more transparent cross-border payments. 5. Lastly, it's important to note that while SWIFT is a trusted messaging network, it is not responsible for the underlying financial transactions themselves. The actual movement of funds between banks is facilitated through other channels.",
