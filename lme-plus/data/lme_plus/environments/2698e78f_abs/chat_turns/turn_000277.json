Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **\"Then and Now\" Trivia**: Create a trivia game that tests guests' knowledge of your journey over the past year. You could include questions about your first day, milestone projects, and significant events.\n2. **Guess the Baby Photo**: Gather baby photos of yourself and have guests guess which one is you. This can be a fun and entertaining activity that encourages laughter and conversation.\n3. **The One-Word Game**: Ask guests to come up with a word that describes you or your journey over the past year. Collect the words and create a word cloud or display them on a board for everyone to see.\n4. **Scavenger Hunt**: Create a scavenger hunt with clues and challenges that take guests around the party area. You could include items or tasks that are related to your job or industry.\n5. **Karaoke Contest**: Rent a karaoke machine and have a sing-off with your favorite songs. You could even offer prizes for the best performance or most entertaining singer.\n\nWhich of these ideas resonates with you, or do you have something else in mind?\n\nAfter we finalize the games and activities, we can discuss party favors and invitations. I have some ideas for those as well!",
