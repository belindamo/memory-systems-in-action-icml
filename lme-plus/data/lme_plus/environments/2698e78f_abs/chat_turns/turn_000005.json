It's great that Dr. Smith is guiding you in this direction.\n\nSaying \"no\" and setting boundaries can be challenging, especially if you're someone who tends to prioritize others' needs over your own. However, with practice and the right mindset, you can learn to do so without feeling guilty or anxious. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Recognize your limits:** Understand that you can't do everything and be everything to everyone. Acknowledge your limitations and prioritize your own needs.\n2. **Identify your values:** Reflect on what's truly important to you and allocate your time and energy accordingly. This will help you make decisions that align with your values and goals.\n3. **Practice saying \"no\" in low-stakes situations:** Start small by saying \"no\" to minor requests, like declining an invitation to a movie or turning down a second helping of food. This will help you build confidence and develop a sense of assertiveness.\n4. **Use the 3Rs:** When asked to commit to something, respond with the 3Rs:\n\t* **Reflect:** Take a moment to consider the request and your priorities.\n\t* **Respond:** Say \"I need some time to think about it\" or \"Let me check my schedule.\"\n\t* **Renegotiate:** If you decide to accept, negotiate the terms to ensure they work for you.\n5. **Offer alternatives:** Instead of saying \"no\" outright, suggest alternative solutions that work better for you. For example, \"I'm not available to meet on Fridays, but I can meet on Wednesdays.\"\n6. **Be firm but polite:** When saying \"no,\" be clear, direct, and respectful. Avoid apologetic or hesitant language, which can be seen as an invitation to negotiate. Use phrases like \"I appreciate the invite, but I need to prioritize my own commitments right now.\"\n7. **Remember that \"no\" is a complete sentence:** You don't owe anyone an explanation for your decision. A simple \"no, thank you\" or \"I'm not able to commit to that\" is enough.\n8. **Prepare for pushback:** Some people might resist or guilt-trip you into changing your mind. Anticipate this and stay firm in your decision. You can say, \"I understand you're disappointed, but I've made up my mind.\"\n9. **Celebrate your \"no\"s:** Acknowledge and celebrate each time you successfully set a boundary or say \"no\" to a commitment that doesn't serve you. This will help you build confidence and reinforce the importance of prioritizing your own needs.\n10. **Seek support:** Share your struggles with Dr. Smith, friends, or family members you trust. They can offer guidance, encouragement, and support as you develop your boundary-setting skills.\n\nRemember, setting healthy boundaries and saying \"no\" is not about being selfish; it's about taking care of yourself and maintaining your emotional and mental well-being.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these strategies? Is there a specific situation where you'd like to practice saying \"no\" or setting a boundary?",
