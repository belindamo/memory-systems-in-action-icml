Select the cells you want to format.\n2. Go to the \"Format\" menu, then select \"Conditional formatting\".\n3. In the \"Format cells if\" section, choose \"Custom formula is\".\n4. Enter the formula: `=WEEKDAY(A1) = 1`, where \"A1\" is the cell reference to the first cell in the selected range.\n5. Choose the color you want to apply to Sundays.\n6. Click \"Done\" to apply the formatting.\n\nThe formula `=WEEKDAY(A1) = 1` returns \"TRUE\" if the date in cell A1 corresponds to a Sunday, and \"FALSE\" otherwise. By applying this formula to a range of cells, you can format all Sundays in the same way.",
