Speaking of which, I need to schedule a trip to the dry cleaner's to get my winter coats and blankets cleaned before the cold weather sets in. I'm glad I stocked up on winter squashes and apples from the harvest festival, they've been great for soups and pies. By the way, three weeks have passed since the last day of summer, and I'm still adjusting to the cooler mornings and darker evenings of autumn.",
