That's exciting!\n\nAfter a period of inactivity, it's essential to give your bike some TLC to ensure it's safe and ready to ride. Here are some tips to help you clean and maintain your bike, focusing on the tires and brakes:\n\n**Tires:**\n\n1. **Inspect the tires**: Check for signs of wear, such as cracks, cuts, or excessive wear on the tread or sidewalls. Make sure the tire pressure is at the recommended level, as specified on the sidewall or in your bike's manual.\n2. **Clean the tires**: Use a mild soap and water to remove dirt and grime. Avoid using harsh chemicals or high-pressure washes, which can damage the tires or remove their protective coatings.\n3. **Check tire pressure**: Inflate the tires to the recommended pressure, and make sure they're properly seated on the rims.\n4. **Lubricate the tire beads**: Apply a small amount of lubricant, such as silicone-based lubricant or talcum powder, to the tire beads to prevent them from sticking to the rims.\n\n**Brakes:**\n\n1. **Inspect the brake pads**: Check the brake pads for wear, looking for signs of excessive wear or damage. If they're worn down too far, consider replacing them.\n2. **Clean the brakes**: Use a soft-bristled brush or a cloth to remove dirt and debris from the brake calipers, brake pads, and brake levers.\n3. **Lubricate the brake pivot points**: Apply a small amount of lubricant, such as silicone-based lubricant or grease, to the brake pivot points to keep them running smoothly.\n4. **Adjust the brake cables**: Check the brake cables for proper tension and adjust them as needed to ensure proper braking performance.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Give your bike a overall cleaning**: Use a mild soap and water to clean the frame, wheels, and other components. Avoid using high-pressure washes or harsh chemicals.\n2. **Lubricate the chain**: Apply chain lube to the chain, following the manufacturer's instructions.\n3. **Check and adjust the derailleur**: Make sure the derailleur is properly aligned and adjusted to ensure smooth gear shifting.\n4. **Take it for a test ride**: Before hitting the roads or trails, take your bike for a short test ride to ensure everything is functioning properly.\n\nRemember to always refer to your bike's manual for specific maintenance and repair instructions, as different bikes may have unique requirements.\n\nHave fun picking up your bike and getting back on the road (or trail)!",
