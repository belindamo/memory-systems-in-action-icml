Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Attending Open Mics First:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Get a feel for the scene**: Attend open mics to get a sense of the local comedy community, the types of comedians performing, and the audience's preferences.\n2. **Low stakes**: Open mics are usually low-pressure environments, allowing you to try out material without committing to a class or a specific format.\n3. **Experimentation**: You can test different styles, jokes, and stage presence without investing a lot of time or money.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Lack of structure**: Open mics can be disorganized, and you might not receive constructive feedback or guidance.\n2. **Limited stage time**: You might only get 3-5 minutes of stage time, which can limit your opportunity to develop a set or try out new material.\n\n**Taking a Comedy Class:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Structured learning**: A comedy class provides a structured environment with a teacher, peers, and a clear curriculum, which can help you develop your skills more efficiently.\n2. **Feedback and guidance**: You'll receive constructive feedback from the instructor and peers, helping you refine your material and performance.\n3. **Accountability**: You'll be more likely to write and prepare new material, as you'll have a regular schedule and a sense of responsibility to your classmates.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Commitment**: You'll need to commit to a set schedule, which can be daunting if you're not sure if comedy is for you.\n2. **Cost**: Comedy classes can be expensive, especially if you're not sure if you'll enjoy or stick with it.\n\nHere's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Attend 2-3 open mics**: Get a feel for the scene, try out some material, and see how you enjoy the experience.\n2. **Take a beginner's class**: If you enjoy the open mics and want to learn more, sign up for a beginner's comedy class. This will give you a structured environment to learn and grow.\n3. **Continue attending open mics**: While taking the class, continue attending open mics to apply what you're learning, get more stage time, and stay connected with the local comedy community.\n\nRemember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. You can always try out open mics and then decide to take a class, or vice versa. The key is to find a approach that works for you and helps you grow as a comedian.",
