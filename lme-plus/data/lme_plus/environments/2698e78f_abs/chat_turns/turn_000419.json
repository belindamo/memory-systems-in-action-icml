I'd be happy to provide a new price comparison for flights from New York to Tokyo.\n\nHere's an updated estimate of prices for economy class flights from New York (JFK or EWR airports) to Tokyo (NRT or HND airports) for 7-10 days in May:\n\n**ANA (All Nippon Airways)**\n\n* Average price for 7-10 day trip in May: $700-$900 USD\n* Pros: ANA is a Japanese carrier with a high-quality service, comfortable seats, and decent in-flight entertainment.\n* Cons: Prices can be higher than other carriers, and food options might not be as varied.\n\n**Japan Airlines**\n\n* Average price for 7-10 day trip in May: $650-$850 USD\n* Pros: Japan Airlines offers a more affordable option with similar service quality to ANA, and their economy seats have more legroom.\n* Cons: In-flight entertainment might not be as extensive as ANA's, and food options can be limited.\n\n**Singapore Airlines**\n\n* Average price for 7-10 day trip in May: $750-$950 USD\n* Pros: Singapore Airlines is known for its high-quality service, comfortable seats, and excellent in-flight entertainment.\n* Cons: You'll have a layover in Singapore, which might add to your overall travel time, and prices can be higher than Japan Airlines.\n\nPlease note that these prices are estimates and can vary depending on the specific travel dates, flight schedules, and availability.\n\nAs before, I recommend checking the airlines' websites or flight comparison tools like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak for the most up-to-date prices. You can also set up price alerts to notify you when prices drop.\n\nIf you're flexible with your travel dates, consider flying on off-peak days (e.g., Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays) or during the first week of May, which might be cheaper than the latter part of the month.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider flying out of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) instead of Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), as JFK might offer more flight options and potentially better prices.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
