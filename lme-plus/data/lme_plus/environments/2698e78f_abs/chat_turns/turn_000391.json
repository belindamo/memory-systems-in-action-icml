  "content": "A waterproof liner is a fantastic idea, especially if Max can be a bit messy! Yes, some of the brands I mentioned do offer waterproof liners or waterproofing features. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Big Barker**: Big Barker beds come with a waterproof liner as an optional add-on. It's a durable, waterproof material that's easy to clean and prevents accidents from seeping into the bed.\n2. **K&H Pet Products**: Some of K&H's orthopedic beds come with a waterproof liner, but it's not a standard feature across all their products. Look for specific models that mention \"waterproof\" or \"water-resistant\" in the description.\n3. **Pawfect Pets**: Pawfect Pets' orthopedic beds have a waterproof liner built into the design. It's a thin, durable layer that prevents accidents from soaking into the bed.\n4. **Armarkat**: Armarkat's orthopedic beds don't typically come with a waterproof liner, but they do offer a waterproof mattress protector as a separate accessory. This can be a good option if you want to add an extra layer of protection to their bed.\n5. **PetFusion**: PetFusion's Ultimate Pet Bed has a waterproof liner built into the design, making it easy to clean and maintain.\n\nWhen shopping for an orthopedic bed with a waterproof liner, make sure to check the product description or manufacturer's website to confirm that it includes this feature. You might also want to read reviews from other pet owners to see how well the waterproof liner holds up in real-world use.\n\nRemember, even with a waterproof liner, it's still important to clean the bed regularly to keep Max healthy and happy!",
