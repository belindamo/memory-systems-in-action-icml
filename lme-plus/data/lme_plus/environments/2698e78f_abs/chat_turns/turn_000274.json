I'll include photos from my first day, milestone projects, and team-building activities. I'll also add notes about the challenges I overcame, lessons I learned, and personal reflections on my growth. For mementos, I'll attach my old and new business cards, certificates from training sessions, and a few memorable emails from colleagues. I'll design the timeline in a chronological order, with a mix of images, graphics, and text to make it visually appealing.",
