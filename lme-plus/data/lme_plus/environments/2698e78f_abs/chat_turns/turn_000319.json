  "content": "Codenames and What Do You Meme are both excellent choices for a fun family game night!\n\nAs for your grandma, I'm happy to report that both games are relatively tech-free and don't require any prior experience with technology. Here's why:\n\n**Codenames**: The game is played with cards, and the only \"tech\" involved is reading words and phrases on the cards. The gameplay is straightforward, and the goal is to identify words based on one-word clues given by your teammate. The game doesn't require any digital devices or apps, making it accessible to players of all ages and tech comfort levels.\n\n**What Do You Meme**: While the game does involve memes, which are often associated with the internet, the gameplay itself doesn't require any tech knowledge. Players compete to create the funniest meme by combining caption cards with a random image. The images are printed on cards, and the gameplay is all about creativity and humor. Your grandma might even enjoy the nostalgic feel of creating memes the old-school way!\n\nTo ensure your grandma feels comfortable, you could also consider the following:\n\n* Take some time to explain the rules and objectives of each game before starting.\n* Offer to be her teammate or partner, so she can learn the game alongside you.\n* Emphasize that it's okay to ask questions or clarify rules during the game.\n* Encourage her to have fun and not worry too much about \"winning\" \u2013 the goal is to enjoy quality time together as a family!\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your grandma will have a blast playing Codenames and What Do You Meme with your family!",
