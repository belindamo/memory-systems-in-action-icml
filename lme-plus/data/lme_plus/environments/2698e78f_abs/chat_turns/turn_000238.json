Contemporary art is a diverse and ever-evolving field, but I'd be happy to give you an overview of some key styles and artists associated with them. Keep in mind that these categories are not exhaustive, and many artists blend styles or defy categorization. Here's a brief rundown:\n\n1. **Conceptual Art** (1960s-1970s): Focuses on the idea or concept behind the artwork, often prioritizing language and text over visual aesthetics. Key artists: Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Kosuth, John Baldessari.\n2. **Minimalism** (1960s-1970s): Characterized by simplicity, minimal materials, and a focus on space and scale. Key artists: Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Sol LeWitt.\n3. **Performance Art** (1960s-present): Involves live actions, often blurring the lines between art and everyday life. Key artists: Marina Abramovi\u0107, Joseph Beuys, Carolee Schneemann.\n4. **Installation Art** (1970s-present): Immersive, site-specific environments that engage viewers physically and emotionally. Key artists: Anselm Kiefer, Richard Serra, James Turrell.\n5. **Neo-Expressionism** (1980s): A reaction against minimalism, characterized by bold colors, emotive brushstrokes, and a focus on the artist's inner experience. Key artists: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, Georg Baselitz.\n6. **Postmodernism** (1980s-1990s): Challenges traditional notions of art, history, and culture, often incorporating irony, appropriation, and pastiche. Key artists: Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince, Jeff Koons.\n7. **Abstract Expressionism** (1940s-1960s, revived in the 1980s): Emphasizes expressive brushstrokes, color, and gesture, often on a large scale. Key artists: Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko.\n8. **Street Art/Graffiti** (1970s-present): Originated in urban environments, often using stencils, murals, or spray paint to make bold, public statements. Key artists: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Banksy.\n9. **Digital Art** (1990s-present): Explores the intersection of technology and art, using digital tools, virtual reality, and the internet as mediums. Key artists: Joshua Davis, Casey Reas, Rafa\u00ebl Rozendaal.\n10. **Hyperrealism** (2000s-present): Highly detailed, photorealistic representations of everyday life, often with a focus on the surreal or uncanny. Key artists: Richard Estes, Chuck Close, Kehinde Wiley.\n11. **Relational Aesthetics** (1990s-2000s): Focuses on the social and relational aspects of art, often involving collaboration, participation, and community engagement. Key artists: Rirkrit Tiravanija, Carsten H\u00f6ller, Philippe Parreno.\n\nThese are just a few of the many contemporary art movements and styles. Remember that many artists blend elements from multiple categories or defy categorization altogether.\n\nIt's great that you got to experience contemporary sculptures up close during your guided tour at the City Gallery!
