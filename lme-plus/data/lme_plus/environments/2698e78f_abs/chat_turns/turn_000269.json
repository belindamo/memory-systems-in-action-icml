Here are some ideas for decorations and food that will help you create a nostalgic and fun atmosphere:\n\n**Decorations:**\n\n1. **Time Capsule**: Create a time capsule with items from your first year on the job, such as notes, photos, and memorabilia. Bury it in a decorative box or container and open it at the party to reminisce about the past year.\n2. **Then and Now Photo Booth**: Set up a photo booth with props and encourage guests to take pictures with captions like \"Then\" (with a funny, outdated hairstyle or accessory) and \"Now\" (with a more current look).\n3. **Retro Office Decor**: Decorate with retro office items like old computers, typewriters, or rotary phones to create a nostalgic atmosphere.\n4. **Year-in-Review Timeline**: Create a timeline of your accomplishments and milestones from the past year. Hang it on a large piece of paper or a canvas, and add photos, notes, and other mementos to make it visually appealing.\n5. **Vintage Color Scheme**: Choose a color scheme inspired by the past, such as neon colors, pastels, or earth tones, to add to the retro vibe.\n\n**Food and Drinks:**\n\n1. **Retro Snacks**: Serve popular snacks from the past, such as Doritos, Cheetos, Fritos, or Chex Mix.\n2. **Candy Bar**: Set up a candy bar with retro candies like Nerds, Fun Dip, Pop Rocks, or Pixy Stix.\n3. **\"Then\" and \"Now\" Food Stations**: Create two food stations, one with popular foods from when you started your job (e.g., sliders, mac and cheese) and another with modern, trendy options (e.g., avocado toast, quinoa bowls).\n4. **Vintage-Inspired Desserts**: Serve desserts inspired by the past, such as brownies, apple pie, or ice cream sundaes with retro toppings like sprinkles or chopped nuts.\n5. **\"Throwback\" Drinks**: Offer retro-inspired drinks like Tab, Fresca, or Surge soda, or create specialty cocktails with names like \"The First Day\" or \"The Promotion.\"\n\n**Activities:**\n\n1. **Guess the Year**: Create a game where guests have to guess the year a particular event or achievement happened.\n2. **Then and Now Trivia**: Prepare a trivia game with questions about your job, industry, or popular culture from the past year.\n3. **Share Your Story**: Encourage guests to share their own \"then and now\" stories, either verbally or by writing them down on cards or a shared document.\n\nBy incorporating these ideas, you'll create a fun and nostalgic atmosphere that will make your \"Then and Now\" Throwback Party a memorable celebration of your one-year work anniversary!",
