  "content": "Nachos are always a crowd-pleaser!\n\nAs for movie recommendations, I'd be happy to help! However, I need a bit more information to give you a tailored suggestion. Here are a few questions to help me narrow down some options:\n\n1. What type of genre are you and your friends in the mood for? (e.g., action, comedy, horror, rom-com, etc.)\n2. Are you open to watching a blockbuster hit, or something a bit more indie or under-the-radar?\n3. Is there a particular streaming platform you're subscribed to, or are you open to suggestions across multiple platforms (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Disney+, etc.)?\n4. How much time do you have available for the movie night? Are you looking for a quick 90-minute film, or are you open to a longer, more epic movie?\n\nLet me know your answers to these questions, and I can give you some personalized movie recommendations that have recently come out on streaming platforms!",
