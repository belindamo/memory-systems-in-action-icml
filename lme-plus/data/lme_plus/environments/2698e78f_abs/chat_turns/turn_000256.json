However, it is true that the sexualization of female characters in video games has been a controversial issue in the gaming industry for many years. Many video games feature female characters who wear revealing clothing, have exaggerated body proportions, and frequent camera angles that focus on their bodies. This can contribute to the objectification and hypersexualization of female characters, which can lead to harmful stereotypes and limit the representation of women in games as complex characters with diverse stories and motivations. While this trend is not exclusive to the Metal Gear series, it is present in various other video games as well. The gaming industry has made some strides towards more representation and diversity in recent years, but the issue of sexualized portrayals of female characters in gaming remains a topic of debate and discussion amongst the gaming community.",
