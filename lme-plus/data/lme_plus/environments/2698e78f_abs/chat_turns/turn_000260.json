Show your support for games with diverse and well-developed female characters: One way to encourage the inclusion of diverse characters in games is to support games that already have them. This can be done through purchasing, reviewing and sharing such games with others.\n\n2. Use social media to voice your opinions: Social media is an effective tool to share ideas, opinions and concerns. Using social media to voice your concerns explicitly and articulate the need to have diversity and inclusivity in video games can help create further attention and discussion among developers and publishers.\n\n3. Support organizations that advocate diversity and inclusivity: There are many organizations and communities advocating for diversity and inclusivity in games, such as Women in Games and Games for Change. Supporting such groups can help drive change on collective levels.\n\n4. Provide feedback to game developers: Game developers often solicit feedback from their players and communities to understand how they can improve their games. Providing constructive feedback to game developers on ways to improve representation of gender, and diversity in the game can help create more inclusive gaming environments.\n\n5. Educate yourself and others on issues surrounding diversity and inclusivity in the gaming space: Reading literature, watching videos, and participating in forums that cover issues related to diversity and inclusivity in gaming can also help raise awareness and understanding on this subject.",
