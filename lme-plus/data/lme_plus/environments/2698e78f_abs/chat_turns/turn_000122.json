  "content": "That's a great idea! I think showing some NBA playoffs highlights would be perfect, especially since I just watched the Lakers game against the Denver Nuggets at my friend Alex's place and had a blast with pizza and wings. It was such a thrilling game, and I'm sure my friends would love reliving some of those exciting moments. Do you think I could also show some Wimbledon highlights? I'm a huge tennis fan, and I've been rewatching some old matches from the 2019 tournament.",
