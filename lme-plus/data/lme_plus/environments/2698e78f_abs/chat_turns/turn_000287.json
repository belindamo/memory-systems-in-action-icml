However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have visual access to your living room or its layout. But I can offer some general suggestions that you can adapt to your space:\n\n1. **Create a focal point:** Designate a central area for the TV and soundbar, and arrange the furniture around it. This will help draw everyone's attention to the screen.\n2. **Cozy seating:** Use plush couches, armchairs, or sectionals to create a comfortable and inviting seating arrangement. Consider adding throw pillows, blankets, and rugs to enhance the cozy atmosphere.\n3. **Intimate spacing:** Arrange the seating in a way that encourages conversation and socializing. A U-shaped or circular configuration can help create a sense of togetherness.\n4. **Dim lighting:** Adjust the lighting to create a warm and intimate ambiance. Table lamps, floor lamps, or string lights can add a cozy touch.\n5. **Snack station:** Set up a snack table or bar with easy access to snacks and drinks. This will encourage guests to mingle and graze throughout the movie.\n6. **Rearrange for comfort:** Consider moving furniture away from walls and creating a more relaxed, conversational layout. This can help create a sense of comfort and relaxation.\n7. **Add textiles:** Throws, blankets, and pillows in warm, rich colors can add to the cozy atmosphere. You can also use aromatherapy candles or essential oils to create a calming scent.\n\nRemember, the key to a perfect cozy movie night layout is to prioritize comfort, intimacy, and relaxation. Experiment with different arrangements until you find a setup that works best for you and your guests!\n\nHave fun rearranging, and I hope your movie night is a huge success!",
