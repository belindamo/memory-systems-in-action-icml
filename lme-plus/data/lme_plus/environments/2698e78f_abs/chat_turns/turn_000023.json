  "content": "There are some backcountry routes and mountaineering opportunities in Denali National Park that are more challenging and require advanced skills. The park's backcountry permits system allows experienced hikers and climbers to access off-trail routes and remote areas of the park, where they can encounter challenging terrain, glacier travel, and other mountaineering challenges. However, it's important to note that these routes are not suitable for inexperienced hikers or climbers, and require advanced mountaineering skills and equipment. \n\nSome examples of challenging routes in Denali National Park include:\n\n1. The West Buttress route up Denali - a technical climb that follows the ridgeline to the summit of Denali.\n\n2. The Muldrow Glacier route - a challenging backcountry route that traverses the Muldrow Glacier and involves glacier travel, crevasse crossings, and other mountaineering challenges.\n\n3. Mount Huntington - a peak in the park that is known for its steep, technical climbing routes and challenging approach.\n\nThese routes are not recommended for inexperienced hikers or climbers, and should only be attempted by those with the necessary skills and equipment.",
