Incorporating physical activity into your daily routine can have numerous benefits for your physical and mental health.\n\nHere are some tips to help you make the most out of your walk and incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine:\n\n1. **Track your progress**: Use a pedometer, fitness tracker, or mobile app to track your daily steps and distance walked.
