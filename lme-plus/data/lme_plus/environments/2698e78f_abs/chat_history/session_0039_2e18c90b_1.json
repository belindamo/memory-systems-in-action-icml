      "content": "I didn't think about the importance of waterproofing until I had to wash Max's favorite blanket last week. That was a real pain, but at least it came out okay. Anyway, back to the pet bed, do you think a waterproof liner would add a lot to the overall cost of the bed?"

      "content": "I'm glad Max's favorite blanket made it through the wash!\n\nRegarding the waterproof liner, it can add some cost to the overall price of the bed, but it's usually not a significant increase. The cost will depend on the brand, quality, and type of waterproofing used.\n\nOn average, you can expect to pay an extra $10 to $30 for a waterproof liner, depending on the bed's size and features. For example:\n\n* A basic orthopedic bed without a waterproof liner might cost around $40 to $70.\n* The same bed with a waterproof liner might cost $50 to $100.\n\nHowever, some high-end or premium orthopedic beds with advanced waterproofing features, such as a fully waterproof design or a high-quality, breathable membrane, might add $50 to $100 or more to the overall cost.\n\nIt's essential to weigh the benefits of a waterproof liner against the added cost. If you have a pet that's prone to accidents or likes to drool, a waterproof liner can be a valuable investment in the long run. It can save you time and hassle when cleaning up messes, and it can also help extend the life of the bed.\n\nWhen deciding, consider the following:\n\n* How often do you expect to clean the bed?\n* How messy is Max, and how often does he have accidents?\n* Is the added cost of a waterproof liner worth the convenience and peace of mind it provides?\n\nUltimately, if you think a waterproof liner is a must-have feature, factor it into your budget, and look for beds that offer this feature within your price range."
