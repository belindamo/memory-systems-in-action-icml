      "content": "To accomplish this, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Add the background image of the old Microsoft desktop in the vaporwave aesthetic as a CSS background image for the page.\n2. Add clickable file folder icons as images or SVG elements on top of the background image. You can use an <a> tag to wrap around the icons and link them to the desired pages.\n3. Use the Next.js Link component to create the links to the other pages. Here is an example of how you can use the Link component:\n```javascript\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\n<Link href=\"/other-page\">\n  <a>\n    <img src=\"/path/to/folder-icon.svg\" alt=\"Folder Icon\" />\n  </a>\n</Link>\n```\n4. Repeat step 3 for all the clickable file folder icons on the page.\n5. Style the file folder icons using CSS to make them look like clickable icons. You can add hover effects and transitions to enhance the user experience.\n6. Test the page to ensure that the file folder icons are clickable and redirect to the correct pages.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to build a page with clickable file folder icons that redirect to other pages."
