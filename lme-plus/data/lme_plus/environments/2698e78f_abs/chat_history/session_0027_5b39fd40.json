However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about your soundbar model or its compatibility with Netflix.\n\nBut don't worry, it's easy to check! Here are a few steps to help you determine if your soundbar is compatible with Netflix:\n\n1. Check your soundbar's manual or manufacturer's website for information on its compatibility with streaming services like Netflix.\n2. Look for HDMI ports on your soundbar. If it has an HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) port, it's likely compatible with Netflix.\n3. Check your TV's settings to see if it supports HDMI ARC and can pass through audio to your soundbar.\n4. If you're still unsure, you can try connecting your soundbar to your TV and seeing if it recognizes the Netflix app. You can also try playing a Netflix show or movie and see if the audio comes through your soundbar.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you can consult your soundbar's customer support or contact Netflix's support team for further assistance.\n\nEnjoy your movie night, and I hope your soundbar works perfectly with Netflix!"

However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have visual access to your living room or its layout. But I can offer some general suggestions that you can adapt to your space:\n\n1. **Create a focal point:** Designate a central area for the TV and soundbar, and arrange the furniture around it. This will help draw everyone's attention to the screen.\n2. **Cozy seating:** Use plush couches, armchairs, or sectionals to create a comfortable and inviting seating arrangement. Consider adding throw pillows, blankets, and rugs to enhance the cozy atmosphere.\n3. **Intimate spacing:** Arrange the seating in a way that encourages conversation and socializing. A U-shaped or circular configuration can help create a sense of togetherness.\n4. **Dim lighting:** Adjust the lighting to create a warm and intimate ambiance. Table lamps, floor lamps, or string lights can add a cozy touch.\n5. **Snack station:** Set up a snack table or bar with easy access to snacks and drinks. This will encourage guests to mingle and graze throughout the movie.\n6. **Rearrange for comfort:** Consider moving furniture away from walls and creating a more relaxed, conversational layout. This can help create a sense of comfort and relaxation.\n7. **Add textiles:** Throws, blankets, and pillows in warm, rich colors can add to the cozy atmosphere. You can also use aromatherapy candles or essential oils to create a calming scent.\n\nRemember, the key to a perfect cozy movie night layout is to prioritize comfort, intimacy, and relaxation. Experiment with different arrangements until you find a setup that works best for you and your guests!\n\nHave fun rearranging, and I hope your movie night is a huge success!"
