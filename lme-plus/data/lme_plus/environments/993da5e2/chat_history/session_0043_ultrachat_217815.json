One of the most significant shifts was the revival of pre-revolutionary architectural styles such as Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Neoclassicism.\n\nAfter the Soviet regime, there was a push to restore some of the city's pre-revolutionary buildings, which were destroyed or neglected during Soviet times. This led to extensive renovation works on historic buildings such as the Bolshoi Drama Theatre, Catherine Palace, and the Kazan Cathedral.\n\nAlso, new buildings constructed after the Soviet collapse reflected a move towards Western-style architecture, with glass and steel being the predominant materials used. The construction of the Lakhta Center is an example of this trend, as the skyscraper features a modern design that is unique compared to the city's historic architecture.\n\nIn summary, the post-Soviet period saw a mix of revival and modernization of architectural styles. Nonetheless, the city's historical architecture still remains a fundamental element of its identity, making St. Petersburg a unique blend of old and new architectural styles."

      "content": "Indeed, the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, also known as the Church of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, is a true landmark of St. Petersburg. Its colorful and intricate domes are one of the most photographed and iconic images of the city.\n\nThe church was built between 1883 and 1907 on the spot where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in 1881. Its unique style blends elements of traditional Russian architecture with influences from Byzantine and Gothic styles. The interior of the church is just as impressive, featuring intricate mosaics covering the walls and ceilings depicting scenes from the Bible and the life of Jesus Christ.\n\nUnfortunately, the church suffered significant damage during the Soviet period and was used as a warehouse for many years. It was not until the 1970s that restoration works began, and in 1997 it was finally opened to the public. Today, it is considered one of St. Petersburg's most treasured architectural gems, visited by thousands of tourists every year."
