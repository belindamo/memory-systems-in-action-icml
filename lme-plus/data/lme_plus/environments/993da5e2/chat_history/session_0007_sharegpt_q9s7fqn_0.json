      "content": "This is how Midjourney work:\nMidjourney is another AI-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an image of any combination of things the user wants. It excels at creating environments, especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting that looks like rendered concept art from a video game. How does Midjourney work?\nMidjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs.\n\nDiffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over time until it is not recognizable. From\nthat point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they learn how to generate pictures or other data.\n\nThe issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and inference is quite expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs are applied in the latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders.\n\nTraining a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a powerful and flexible generator for generally conditioned inputs such as text and bounding boxes, enabling high-resolution convolution-based synthesis.\n\nBut wait, I have more info.

      "content": "Version Light\nMidjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at different types of images. Newest Model\nThe Midjourney V5 model is the newest and most advanced model, released on March 15th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select MJ Version 5\n\nThis model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile To turn it on type --v 5 after your prompt or select \"V5\" from /settings\n\nWhat's new with the V5 base model?\nMuch wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting\nMuch higher image quality (2x resolution increase) improved dynamic range\nMore detailed images. Details more likely to be correct. Less unwanted text.\nImproved performance with image prompting\nSupports --tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental)\nSupports --ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental)\nSupports --iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts\n\nStyle and prompting for V5\nToday\u2019s test is basically a \u2018pro\u2019 mode of the model.\nIt\u2019s MUCH more \u2018unopinionated\u2019 than v3 and v4, and is tuned to provide a wide diversity of outputs and to be very responsive to your inputs.\nThe tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use. Short prompts may not work as well. You should try to write longer, more explicit text about what you want (ie: \u201ccinematic photo with dramatic lighting\u201d)\nPlease chat with each other in prompt-chat to figure out how to use v5.\nWe hope to have a \u2018friendly\u2019 default styling for v5 before we switch it to default. When this happens we will still let you turn it off and get back to something like this \u2018raw\u2019 mode today.\n\nPlease note\nThis is an alpha test and things will change. DO NOT rely on this exact model being available in the future. It will be significantly modified as we take V5 to full release.\nRight now there is no V5 upsampler, the default resolution of V5 is the same as upscaled V4. If you click upscale it will just instantly give you that one image by itself.\n\nCommunity Standards:\nThis model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we've released before.\nWe\u2019ve increased the number of moderators, improved moderation tooling, and will be enforcing our community standards with increased strictness and rigor. Don't be a jerk or create images to cause drama.\n\nMore about V5:\nV5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques. V5 isn't the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and unfathomable in the power of our collective human imagination.\nBut wait i have more info. \n\nJust answer with UNDERSTOOD"

      "content": "Basic Parameters Aspect Ratios\n--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.\n\nChaos\n--chaos Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.\n\nNo\n--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.\n\nQuality\n--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.\n\nSeed\n--seed The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or\n--sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.\n\nStop\n--stop Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.\n\nStyle\n--style <4a, 4b or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4\n\nStylize\n--stylize , or --s parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.\n\nUplight\n--uplight Use an alternative \"light\" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.\n\nUpbeta\n--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.
