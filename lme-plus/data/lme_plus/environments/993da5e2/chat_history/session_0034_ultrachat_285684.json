Spring (March to May): The weather can be a bit unpredictable during this time, but the snow has started to melt, the flowers are in bloom, and the mountains are still covered in snow.

Summer (June to August): Summer is the peak season in Savoy, and the weather is usually mild and pleasant. Hiking, mountain biking, and water sports like swimming, paddleboarding, and kayaking are popular activities during this time.\n\n3. Autumn (September to November): Autumn in Savoy brings a fantastic display of fall colors, making it one of the best times to visit. The temperatures start to cool, making it ideal for outdoor activities like hiking, mountain biking, and skiing in some of the higher altitudes.\n\n4. Winter (December to February): Winter is the season for skiing, snowshoeing, and other winter sports in Savoy. Resorts and villages offer a range of activities and events throughout the season, including Christmas markets, lighting displays, and ice skating rinks.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the best time to visit Savoy depends on your interests and what you would like to do.
