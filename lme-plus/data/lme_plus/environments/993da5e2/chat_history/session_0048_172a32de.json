However, these flights are scheduled to have the shortest layovers among the options I previously mentioned.\n\nIf you prioritize convenience and want to minimize your layover time, the Southwest Airlines flight with a 55-minute layover in DAL might be the best option for you.\n\nRemember to check the airlines' websites or a flight comparison tool for the most up-to-date schedules and fares."
