      "content": "I don't have personal experiences, preferences, or opinions. however, regarding the most affordable parking option, it depends on your specific needs and length of stay. if you're only staying for a short period, on-street parking may be the most affordable option, but it can be expensive during peak hours. if you're planning to park for a longer period, private car parks or council car parks may have more reasonable rates. additionally, if you're coming from outside the city centre, park and ride may be the most cost-effective option. it's recommended to compare rates and consider the location and duration of your stay to determine the most affordable option for your needs."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It's a good idea to compare the rates of private car parks and council car parks if you're staying for only a few hours. The council car parks may be cheaper for shorter periods, especially during off-peak hours. Private car parks may have more competitive rates if you're staying for longer periods or during peak hours. Make sure to check the rates and any restrictions or rules before choosing a parking option. Additionally, you can use online parking comparison sites to compare multiple options simultaneously and find the best deal."
