  "content": "2.3.3 Previous Studies on the Relationship between L2 Motivational Self-System, Self-Efficacy, and English Achievements\n\nPrevious research has explored the relationship between L2MSS and English achievement, as well as self-efficacy and English achievement. However, few studies have examined the relationship between these three variables simultaneously. Only a few domestic studies have been found, mostly in the form of master's theses (Zhao Wei, 2021; Zhou Huijuan, 2021; Chen Weilin, 2022).\n\nHuo and Rui (2020) conducted a survey of 239 junior and senior non-English majors in a university in North China, investigating the interactions between self-efficacy, L2MSS, and English academic proficiency. The study found that ideal L2 self and L2 learning experience had a mediating effect between self-efficacy and English proficiency, but self-efficacy could not significantly impact English proficiency through ought-to L2 self. This study's participants had a wide distribution of majors, including science, engineering, and liberal arts, making them representative of the student population.\n\nA few master's theses have explored the pathways of influence among the three variables, all conducted with high school students in urban areas using questionnaires to explore learners' levels of L2MSS and self-efficacy.\n\nHowever, the findings of these studies are not entirely consistent, with some studies indicating that learners have a high level of L2MSS, with the three dimensions in the order of ideal L2 self > L2 learning experience > ought-to L2 self, while others found that the levels of L2MSS are at an average level, and L2 learning experience is the highest. Additionally, the dimensions of self-efficacy examined varied among studies.\n\nOverall, previous studies had several limitations. They focused on a single research variable, used a quantitative analysis method employing questionnaires as the instrument, and focused mainly on non-English major college students and high school students in urban areas. There was no attention paid to students in rural areas, affecting the generalizability of the results.\n\nTo address these limitations, this study selected high school students from a rural school in Yibin, Sichuan Province as research participants. The study used questionnaires and interviews as research instruments to investigate the correlation between self-efficacy, L2MSS, and English academic achievement and their influence on learners' English academic achievement. This selection of participants increased the diversity of the sample, making the research more comprehensive.",
