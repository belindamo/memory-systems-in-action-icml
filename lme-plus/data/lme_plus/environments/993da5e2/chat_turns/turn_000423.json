One of the most significant shifts was the revival of pre-revolutionary architectural styles such as Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Neoclassicism.\n\nAfter the Soviet regime, there was a push to restore some of the city's pre-revolutionary buildings, which were destroyed or neglected during Soviet times. This led to extensive renovation works on historic buildings such as the Bolshoi Drama Theatre, Catherine Palace, and the Kazan Cathedral.\n\nAlso, new buildings constructed after the Soviet collapse reflected a move towards Western-style architecture, with glass and steel being the predominant materials used. The construction of the Lakhta Center is an example of this trend, as the skyscraper features a modern design that is unique compared to the city's historic architecture.\n\nIn summary, the post-Soviet period saw a mix of revival and modernization of architectural styles. Nonetheless, the city's historical architecture still remains a fundamental element of its identity, making St. Petersburg a unique blend of old and new architectural styles.",
