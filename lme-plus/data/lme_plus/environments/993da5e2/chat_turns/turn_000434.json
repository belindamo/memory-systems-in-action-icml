Video showed an empty tank with water pouring into the hotel lobby.\n\nGuests have been moved out of the hotel following the incident at 05:50 (04:50 GMT).\n\nA spokesman for Berlin's fire brigade told the BBC the vast majority of the fish had died, and the cold weather had made rescue attempts more difficult. The tank had contained more than 100 different species.\n\nOutside the Radisson Blu, a pile of debris lay in front of what were the front doors, which now hang into the street - twisted at an angle by the force of the exploding tank.\n\nPaul Maletzki was staying on the fourth floor with his girlfriend.\n\nHe described being woken up by a loud bang and shaking. When he looked down into the lobby, he saw water flowing across it. They and other guests were later escorted out of the hotel by armed police.\n\nThe Mayor of Berlin Franziska Giffey went to the hotel to see the damage and described the tank burst as being like a tsunami.\n\nShe expressed relief it had happened so early in the morning - saying an hour or so later, and the lobby and street outside would have been busy with visitors, many of them children.\n\nSandra Weeser, a member of the German federal parliament who had been staying at the hotel, told local television that she had been woken up by \"a kind of shock wave\" and described the scene outside the hotel as a \"picture of devastation\".\n\nShe said fish which may have been saved had frozen to death and recalled seeing a \"large parrotfish lying on the ground, frozen\".\n\nThe aquarium was modernised two years ago, and there is a clear-walled lift built inside for use by visitors. Some of the rooms in the hotel are advertised as having views of it.\n\nBerlin's fire brigade said more than 100 firefighters were sent to the scene and it was not clear what caused the break.\n\nIt said it used rescue dogs to check the area inside the hotel for anyone potentially injured, with nobody found.\n\nPolice said \"massive amounts\" of water were flowing into nearby streets and people in the area should drive cautiously.\n\nA police source told local media there is no evidence the break was the result of a targeted attack.\n\nBut there has been speculation that freezing temperature - which dropped as low as -6C overnight - may have caused a crack in the tank.\n\nBerlin's public transport authority said Karl-Liebknecht street outside the hotel had been closed off due to \"an extreme amount of water on the road\". Trams service in the area was also stopped.\n\nAquaDom was opened in December 2003 and was given the Guinness World Record for being the world's largest cylindrical aquarium.\n\nAccording to reports at the time of its construction, it cost about \u20ac12.8m (\u00a311.2m) to build.",
