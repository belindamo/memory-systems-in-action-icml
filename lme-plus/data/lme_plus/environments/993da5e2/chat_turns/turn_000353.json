I'd be happy to help with some tips on its care.\n\n**Direct Sunlight:** You're right to be concerned about direct sunlight, as it can cause leaf burn and scorching. Fiddle leaf figs prefer bright, indirect light, especially when they're young. If possible, move your tree to a spot with filtered or dappled sunlight, such as an east- or west-facing window. If that's not possible, you can use a sheer curtain to filter the direct sunlight.\n\n**Lighting Tips:**\n\n* South-facing windows: If your tree is in a south-facing window, consider moving it a few feet away from the window or using a sheer curtain to filter the intense sunlight.\n* East- or west-facing windows: These windows receive gentler sunlight, making them ideal for fiddle leaf figs.\n* Avoid low light: While fiddle leaf figs can tolerate some shade, they'll thrive in brighter conditions. Avoid placing your tree in a spot with very low light, as it may lead to weak and spindly growth.\n\n**Watering:**\n\n* Watering frequency: Water your fiddle leaf fig when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. This is usually every 1-2 weeks in the summer and less often in the winter.\n* Water thoroughly: When you do water, make sure to water thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain from the pot.\n* Avoid overwatering: Fiddle leaf figs don't like wet feet, so avoid waterlogging the soil. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle.\n\n**Humidity:**\n\n* Maintain a humid environment: Fiddle leaf figs prefer a humid environment, typically between 40-60% relative humidity. You can achieve this by placing the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles or using a humidifier nearby.\n\n**Temperature:**\n\n* Average room temperature: Fiddle leaf figs prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C).\n* Avoid extreme temperatures: Keep your tree away from heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, and drafty windows.\n\n**Fertilization:**\n\n* Feed your tree: Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n* Prune and repot: Prune your fiddle leaf fig regularly to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. Repot your tree every 1-2 years in the spring when it becomes pot-bound.\n\n**Pest Control:**\n\n* Check for pests: Regularly inspect your tree for signs of pests like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale.\n* Isolate infected plants: If you notice any pests, isolate the infected plant to prevent the infestation from spreading to other plants.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your fiddle leaf fig tree happy and thriving. Good luck, and I hope your tree continues to flourish!",
