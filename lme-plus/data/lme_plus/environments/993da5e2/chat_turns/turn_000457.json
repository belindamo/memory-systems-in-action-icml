While running is a great way to improve your cardiovascular endurance, you'll want to incorporate other exercises to target specific areas important for tennis. Here are some tips to help you improve your overall fitness for tennis:\n\n1. **Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT)**: HIIT involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by brief periods of rest. This type of training is excellent for tennis, as it mimics the stop-and-go nature of the game. Try incorporating HIIT into your running routine, or add exercises like sprints, burpees, or jump squats.\n2. **Focus on explosive power**: Tennis requires quick, explosive movements. Incorporate exercises like box jumps, depth jumps, and resistance band training to improve your power and explosiveness.\n3. **Incorporate strength training**: Building strength in your legs, core, and upper body will help you generate more power and control on the court. Focus on exercises like squats, lunges, deadlifts, and rows.\n4. **Improve your agility and speed**: Agility drills like cone drills, ladder drills, and shuttle runs can help you improve your speed and reaction time. These exercises will also help you change direction quickly and efficiently on the court.\n5. **Don't forget about flexibility and mobility**: Tennis requires a good range of motion in your shoulders, hips, and legs. Incorporate stretching exercises like leg swings, lunges, and hip circles to improve your flexibility and mobility.\n6. **Plyometrics and jump training**: Plyometric exercises like jump squats, box jumps, and depth jumps can help improve your explosiveness and power.\n7. **Core strength**: A strong core will help you maintain good posture, generate power, and improve your overall stability on the court. Incorporate exercises like planks, Russian twists, and leg raises into your routine.\n8. **Incorporate tennis-specific exercises**: Exercises like medicine ball tosses, resistance band training, and tennis-specific agility drills can help you develop the specific skills and movements required for tennis.\n\nRemember to always warm up before training, and to listen to your body and take rest days as needed. It's also essential to incorporate proper nutrition and recovery techniques, such as foam rolling and stretching, to help your body recover from intense training.\n\nAs for your current routine, three times a week is a good start, but you may want to consider increasing the frequency and intensity of your workouts. Aim to do at least 4-5 days of intense training per week, with one or two rest days in between.\n\nHow do you feel about incorporating some of these exercises into your routine? Do you have any specific questions about any of these tips?",
