Adding strength training to your routine can help you achieve your goal of doing 10 push-ups in a row and overall enhance your overall fitness. Here are some effective strength training exercises you can do at home to target different muscle groups:\n\n**Upper Body:**\n\n1. **Push-ups**: Start with modified push-ups on your knees if regular push-ups are challenging. Aim for 3 sets of 5-8 reps.\n2. **Dumbbell Chest Press**: Hold dumbbells and lie on your back with your arms extended. Lower the dumbbells to your chest, then press back up. Do 3 sets of 8-12 reps.\n3. **Bicep Curls**: Hold dumbbells with your palms facing forward. Curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders, then lower back down. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n4. **Tricep Dips (using a chair or bench)**: Place your hands on the edge of a chair or bench with your feet flat on the floor. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle. Straighten your arms to return to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**Lower Body:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down into a squat, keeping your back straight and your knees behind your toes. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 8-12 reps.\n2. **Lunges**: Stand with your feet together. Take a large step forward with one foot and lower your body down into a lunge. Push back up to the starting position. Alternate legs with each rep. Do 3 sets of 8-12 reps per leg.\n3. **Calf Raises**: Stand on the edge of a step or curb with your heels hanging off the edge. Raise up onto your tiptoes, then lower back down. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**Core:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Start in a push-up position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Engage your core and hold the position for 30-60 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds, then repeat for 3 sets.\n2. **Russian twists**: Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat. Lean back slightly and lift your feet off the ground. Hold a weight or medicine ball and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight to the ground beside you. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Start with lighter weights and higher reps to focus on endurance. As you get stronger, increase the weight and lower the reps.\n2. Warm up before your workout with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching.\n3. Rest for 30-60 seconds between sets and 60-90 seconds between exercises.\n4. Focus on proper form and technique to avoid injury.\n5. Increase the difficulty of exercises as you get stronger by adding weight, reps, or sets.\n\nRemember to be patient and consistent with your strength training routine. It may take some time to see results, but with dedication and persistence, you'll be doing 10 push-ups in a row in no time!",
