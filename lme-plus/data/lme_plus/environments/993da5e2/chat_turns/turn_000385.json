Here are some delicious and freezer-friendly filling ideas:\n\n1. **Scrambled Eggs and Sausage**: Scramble eggs with cooked sausage (such as chorizo or breakfast sausage), diced bell peppers, and onions.\n2. **Veggie Delight**: Fill with scrambled eggs, black beans, diced bell peppers, onions, and shredded cheese. Add some saut\u00e9ed mushrooms or spinach for extra flavor.\n3. **Breakfast Meat Lovers**: Use scrambled eggs, crumbled bacon, diced ham, and shredded cheese.\n4. **Southwestern Style**: Combine scrambled eggs, cooked chorizo or breakfast sausage, black beans, diced tomatoes, and shredded cheese.\n5. **Mushroom and Spinach**: Fill with scrambled eggs, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, wilted spinach, and feta cheese.\n6. **Cheesy Bean and Sausage**: Mix scrambled eggs, cooked sausage, black beans, and shredded cheese.\n7. **Vegan Option**: Use scrambled tofu, black beans, diced bell peppers, onions, and shredded vegan cheese.\n\nWhen assembling the burritos, make sure to:\n\n* Use a sturdy tortilla that can hold the fillings without breaking.\n* Add a sprinkle of cheese on top of the fillings to help hold everything together.\n* Fold the burritos tightly to prevent fillings from spilling out during freezing and reheating.\n* Place the burritos on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put them in the freezer until frozen solid (about 1-2 hours).\n* Transfer the frozen burritos to a freezer-safe bag or container for storage.\n\nTo reheat, simply microwave a frozen burrito for 1-2 minutes or wrap it in a damp paper towel and microwave for 30-45 seconds.\n\nTips:\n\n* Label the freezer bag or container with the filling ingredients and date, so you can easily identify them later.\n* Consider using a breakfast burrito assembly line to make the process more efficient.\n* You can also add other ingredients like diced potatoes, diced tomatoes, or chopped cilantro to the fillings for extra flavor.\n\nEnjoy your frozen breakfast burritos!",
