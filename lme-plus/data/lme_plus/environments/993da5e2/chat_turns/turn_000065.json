  "content": "Basic Parameters Aspect Ratios\n--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.\n\nChaos\n--chaos Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.\n\nNo\n--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.\n\nQuality\n--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.\n\nSeed\n--seed The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or\n--sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.\n\nStop\n--stop Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.\n\nStyle\n--style <4a, 4b or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4\n\nStylize\n--stylize , or --s parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.\n\nUplight\n--uplight Use an alternative \"light\" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.\n\nUpbeta\n--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details. Default Values (Model Version 5)\nAspect Ratio Chaos Quality Seed Stop Style Stylize Default Value\n1:1 0 1 Random 100 4c 100\nRange\nany 0\u2013100 .25 .5 1 or 2 whole numbers 0\u20134294967295 10\u2013100 - 0\u20131000\nAspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredicatble results. But wait, I have more info. \n\nJust answer with UNDERSTOOD",
