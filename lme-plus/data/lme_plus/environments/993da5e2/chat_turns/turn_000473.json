  "content": "You're welcome! I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to try out the recipe! Grating the cucumber is a great way to add texture and flavor to the raita, and it will definitely help to cool down the heat from the gochujang.\n\nRemember, the key to balancing the flavors in this dish is to taste and adjust as you go. Don't be afraid to add more gochujang, cumin, coriander, or yogurt to the marinade or raita to suit your taste. And if you want to take it up a notch, you could always add some other Indian spices like garam masala or cayenne pepper to give it an extra kick.\n\nAlso, don't forget to serve the chicken wings with some crispy kimchi slaw or pickled carrots and cucumbers to add some crunch and freshness to the dish. It'll be a perfect combination of spicy, sweet, sour, and umami flavors!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a blast making and devouring this delicious Indian-Korean fusion dish!",
