In the 2020-2021 season, LeBron James averaged 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists per game, while Anthony Davis averaged 21.8 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks per game. \n\nCompared to other Western Conference teams, the Lakers' top-performing players are among the best in the league. However, other Western Conference teams also have strong players, including the Denver Nuggets' Nikola Jokic, the Utah Jazz's Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, and the Phoenix Suns' Devin Booker and Chris Paul. \n\nOverall, the Western Conference is known for its competitive teams and talented players, making it challenging for any team to dominate solely based on its top performers.",
