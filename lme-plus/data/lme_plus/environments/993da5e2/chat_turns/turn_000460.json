  "content": "I think I'll start with some of the HIIT workouts and explosive power exercises to see how my body responds. I'll definitely need to work on my endurance and agility to keep up with the fast-paced nature of tennis. \n\nBy the way, I have a tennis lesson coming up this weekend, and I'm planning to work on my serve again. Do you have any tips on how I can practice my serve during the lesson? Should I focus on a specific aspect of my serve, or try to work on my overall technique?",
