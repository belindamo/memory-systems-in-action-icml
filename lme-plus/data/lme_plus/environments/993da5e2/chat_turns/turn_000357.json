It sounds like you've been busy tending to your plants and giving them the love they need.\n\n**Spider Plant:** Pruning and propagating your spider plant is a great way to keep it healthy and encourage new growth. Spider plants are one of the easiest plants to propagate, and it's wonderful that you're multiplying your plant babies! Make sure to give the new plants enough time to establish themselves before separating them from the mother plant.\n\n**Herb Garden:** Fresh herbs from your own garden are the best, aren't they? It's great that you've been enjoying the fruits of your labor! Tidying up your herb garden and replanting them in a pot with better drainage will definitely help them thrive. Herbs can be quite particular about their soil conditions, so it's essential to provide them with well-draining soil to prevent waterlogged roots.\n\n**Humidifier:** Ah, a humidifier is a great investment for your plants! Dry air can be detrimental to plants, especially during the winter months when the air tends to be drier. A humidifier will help maintain a healthy humidity level, which will benefit all your plants, including your fiddle leaf fig and snake plant. Just be sure to choose a humidifier that's suitable for your space and plant needs.\n\nYou might also consider grouping your plants together to create a microclimate, which can help maintain a more humid environment. This is especially beneficial for plants that prefer higher humidity, like ferns and peace lilies.\n\n**Other Plant Tips:**\n\n* For your spider plant, make sure to keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Spider plants prefer bright, indirect light and temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C).\n* For your herbs, ensure they receive plenty of sunlight (most herbs prefer at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight) and maintain well-draining soil. Herbs can be quite sensitive to overwatering, so be cautious not to waterlog the soil.\n* Consider fertilizing your herbs regularly to promote healthy growth and flavor. You can use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended strength.\n\nIt's wonderful to see you're dedicated to providing the best care for your plants. Keep up the great work, and happy planting!",
