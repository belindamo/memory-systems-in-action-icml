  "content": "You didn't mention Maria earlier, but it's a great idea to ask her about the salsa festival! As your instructor, Maria might have connections to the local salsa community or know about upcoming events. She might even be participating in the festival or know someone who is.\n\nDefinitely reach out to Maria and ask if she's heard about the salsa festival or knows anything about it. She might be able to provide you with valuable insider information or point you in the right direction.\n\nRemember to also ask her if she's planning to attend the festival or if she knows of any other events or workshops that might be happening around the same time. You might discover some other fun opportunities to dance and learn!\n\nGood luck with your search, and I hope you find the information you're looking for!",
