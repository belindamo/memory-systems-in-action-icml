  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or feelings, but I can understand why it might feel discouraging to see the continued influence of big money in politics. While it might seem like progress is slow, there have been some wins and successes in the fight for a more equitable democracy.\n\nFor example, there have been notable efforts to increase transparency in campaign spending and limit the influence of big money through legislation, grassroots organizing, and legal challenges to campaign finance laws. Additionally, more candidates running for office are rejecting large donations and opting for smaller donor support. This approach has proven successful for several candidates in recent elections.\n\nEducation and engagement around the issue is also important. The more people understand the issue and the consequences of a system that is highly influenced by money, the more motivated they might be to vote and be informed of their representatives' positions on campaign finance reform.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the fight for an equitable democracy is ongoing and will require continued efforts from citizens, advocacy organizations, and lawmakers. While change might take time, every step taken toward a more democratic, equitable political system is a step in the right direction.",
