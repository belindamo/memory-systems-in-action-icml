Hold for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat.\n2. **Leg Raises:**\n\t* **Lying Leg Raises:** Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n\t* **Hanging Leg Raises:** Hang from a pull-up bar with your hands shoulder-width apart and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n3. **Russian twists and rotations:**\n\t* **Russian twists:** Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat.
