Sport statistics are regularly updated and vary depending on the current ongoing season, making it difficult to provide real-time analysis.\n\nHowever, based on the current 2021-2022 season, it is early to compare the stats for the Lakers' top-performing players to those of the Nuggets and Jazz as the season has just started, and we do not have enough sample size to make significant comparisons. Nonetheless, the Lakers have a strong roster with talented players, and their top-performers are expected to continue contributing to the team's success throughout the season.",
