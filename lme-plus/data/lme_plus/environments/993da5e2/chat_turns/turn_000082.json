  "content": "Some of the industries that contribute to income inequality in Sydney include finance, real estate, and technology. These industries are primarily located in Sydney's central business district, which is home to the highest-paid jobs in the city. Also, Sydney's world-class universities attract high-skilled international students who tend to remain in the city, leading to a concentration of highly skilled professionals in certain industries, like finance and technology. As a result, the income gap between the top earners and low-income earners is significant, making it one of the main factors leading to income inequality in Sydney.",
