  "content": "There are a few exemptions and loopholes in campaign finance laws that allow for unlimited donations. One of them is the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which allows corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political advocacy, as long as it is independently done and not coordinated with a candidate or party. Another loophole is the use of \"dark money\" by nonprofit organizations that do not have to disclose their donors.\n\nThese issues are being addressed by lawmakers and advocacy groups in various ways. Some lawmakers have proposed new legislation that would limit the influence of money in politics, such as the For the People Act or the DISCLOSE Act. Advocacy groups are also working to challenge these exemptions and loopholes through litigation, public awareness campaigns, and grassroots organizing. Additionally, some states, such as California and New York, have taken steps to increase transparency and reduce the influence of dark money in their elections.",
