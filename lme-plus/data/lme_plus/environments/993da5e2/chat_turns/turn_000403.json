To complement them, you could consider adding plants with different textures, shapes, and growth habits. Here are some suggestions that would blend well with your existing plants:\n\n1. **Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)**: Pothos is a popular, low-maintenance plant that can trail down or grow up a trellis. Its heart-shaped leaves have variegated patterns, adding visual interest to your reading nook.\n2. **Peperomia (Peperomia obtusifolia)**: This small, compact plant has beautiful, rounded leaves with intricate patterns. It prefers high humidity, making it a great match for a cozy reading nook.\n3. **Dracaena (Dracaena spp.)**: Dracaena is a versatile plant that comes in many varieties. Look for compact or dwarf varieties like 'Janet Craig' or 'Warneckii' that can grow up to 2-3 feet tall. They have slender leaves with yellow or white stripes, adding a pop of color to your space.\n4. **Air Plant (Tillandsia spp.)**: If you want to add something unique, consider an air plant. They don't require soil and can thrive in a bright, indirect light spot. You can place them on a decorative rock or shell to create a visually appealing display.\n5. **English Ivy (Hedera helix)**: English Ivy is a great choice if you want a plant that can trail down or grow up a trellis. It has delicate, lobed leaves that can add a romantic touch to your reading nook.\n6. **ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia)**: The ZZ Plant is a low-maintenance plant that can tolerate a range of lighting conditions. Its shiny, dark green leaves add a sophisticated touch to any space.\n\nWhen choosing new plants, consider the following factors:\n\n* Lighting: Make sure the new plants can thrive in the same lighting conditions as your existing plants.\n* Watering: If you tend to forget to water your plants, choose ones that are more forgiving, like the ZZ Plant or Pothos.\n* Humidity: If your reading nook is particularly dry, consider plants that prefer higher humidity, like Peperomia or Ferns.\n* Space: Leave enough space between plants to create a visually appealing arrangement and allow for proper air circulation.\n\nRemember, it's all about creating a harmonious balance in your reading nook. You can always experiment with different plants and arrangements until you find the perfect combination that makes you feel cozy and relaxed.",
