  "content": "Great, let's get started! For a single-page website promoting a product like Golden Eagle energy drink, we can create a simple, modern design that showcases the brand and the product.\n\nHere's a general outline of the steps we'll need to take to create the website:\n\n1. Plan the layout and design of the website\n2. Write the HTML and CSS code for the website\n3. Create a contact form using JavaScript and a modal to display it\n4. Set up a PHP script to send the form submissions to your email address\n5. Test the website and make any necessary updates\n\nI'll start by creating a basic HTML structure for the website, including the header, main content, and footer. Here's an example of what the HTML code might look like:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Golden Eagle Energy Drink</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <header>\n        <nav>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#\">About</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#\">Products</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#\">Contact</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </nav>\n    </header>\n\n    <main>\n        <section id=\"hero\">\n            <h1>Golden Eagle Energy Drink</h1>\n            <p>Get the energy boost you need to power through your day</p>\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"button\">Learn More</a>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"about\">\n            <h2>About Golden Eagle</h2>\n            <p>Golden Eagle Energy Drink is a premium energy drink that is made with all-natural ingredients and contains no artificial flavors or preservatives. Our unique formula provides a long-lasting energy boost that will keep you going all day long.</p>\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"button\">Buy Now</a>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"products\">\n            <h2>Our Products</h2>\n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                    <img src=\"product1.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Eagle Original\">\n                    <h3>Golden Eagle Original</h3>\n                    <p>Our classic energy drink, made with all-natural ingredients</p>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    <img src=\"product2.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Eagle Zero\">\n                    <h3>Golden Eagle Zero</h3>\n                    <p>Our sugar-free and calorie-free energy drink, perfect for those watching their diet</p>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    <img src=\"product3.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Eagle Sport\">\n                    <h3>Golden Eagle Sport</h3>\n                    <p>Our energy drink designed for athletes and fitness enthusiasts, with added electrolytes and amino acids</p>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n        </section>\n    </main>\n\n    <footer>\n        <p>&copy; 2023 Golden Eagle Energy Drink</p>\n    </footer>\n\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nThis code creates a basic structure for the website, including a header with a navigation menu, a main section with three sections promoting the product, and a footer with a copyright notice.\n\nNext, we'll need to create the CSS styles for the website. We can use CSS to add colors, fonts, and layout to the HTML structure. Here's an example of what the CSS code might look like:\n```css\n/* Reset styles for all elements */\n*\n```",
