Here's a general breakdown of credit score ranges and how they're viewed by lenders:\n\n* Excellent credit: 760-850: You'll likely qualify for the best interest rates and terms.\n* Good credit: 700-759: You'll still qualify for competitive interest rates and terms, but might not get the absolute lowest rates.\n* Fair credit: 680-699: You may qualify for decent interest rates, but you might face stricter loan terms or higher fees.\n* Poor credit: 620-679: You might face higher interest rates, stricter loan terms, and higher fees.\n* Bad credit: Below 620: You may struggle to get approved for a mortgage or face very high interest rates and unfavorable terms.\n\nFor a mortgage, lenders typically consider a credit score of 700 or higher to be good. However, some lenders might have slightly different criteria. In your case, having good credit scores likely contributed to your pre-approval for a mortgage up to $425,000.\n\nKeep in mind that credit scores are just one factor in the mortgage approval process. Lenders will also consider:\n\n1. Income and debt-to-income ratio\n2. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio\n3. Employment history and stability\n4. Cash reserves and assets\n5. Property type and location\n\nSince you've already got pre-approval, you're ahead of the game. Just remember to carefully review the terms of your mortgage offer and ask questions if you're unsure about anything. It's essential to understand the terms and conditions before signing any agreements.\n\nWhat's your next step in the home-buying process? Are you already house hunting or still researching neighborhoods?",
