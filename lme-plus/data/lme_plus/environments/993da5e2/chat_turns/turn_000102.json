A struggling pitching staff can be tough to overcome, especially when you've made a trade that hasn't panned out.\n\n**Pitching Staff Struggles**\n\n1. **Chris Sale and Jose Berrios**: Both are talented pitchers, but they're having down years. Sale's velocity is down, and Berrios has been inconsistent. You can't give up on them yet, but you need to adjust your expectations.\n2. **Assess your pitching depth**: Look at your entire pitching staff, including your starters, relievers, and bench options. Identify any pitchers who are performing well or have a strong track record.\n\n**Trade Regret**\n\n1. **Top prospect for a struggling closer**: Ouch! That's a tough pill to swallow. It's essential to evaluate the trade from a value perspective. Did you overpay for a closer who's not producing?\n2. **Learn from the trade**: Take this as an opportunity to reassess your trade evaluation process. What would you do differently if you could go back in time?\n\n**Turning Things Around**\n\n1. **Stream pitchers with favorable matchups**: Identify pitchers with good matchups and stream them for a spot start. This can help you accumulate wins, strikeouts, and quality starts.\n2. **Waiver wire pitching options**: Look for pitchers who are performing well but are still available on the waiver wire. Consider adding them to your roster or streaming them for a start.\n3. **Roster adjustments**: Consider demoting struggling pitchers or promoting a hot hand from the minors. Make adjustments to your rotation and bullpen to optimize performance.\n4. **Buy low on a struggling starter**: If you have the resources, consider acquiring a talented starter who's having a down year. They might be due for a turnaround.\n\n**Roto League Strategy**\n\n1. **Focus on categories**: Since you're in a roto league, focus on accumulating stats in specific categories. Identify areas where you're struggling and target players who can help you improve.\n2. **Play the matchups**: Make sure you're starting players who have favorable matchups, especially in categories like wins, strikeouts, and saves.\n\n**Advice**\n\n1. **Stay patient**: Rebuilding a pitching staff takes time. Focus on making incremental improvements and stay patient.\n2. **Stay active**: Continuously monitor the waiver wire, trade market, and player performances. Make adjustments as needed to optimize your team.\n3. **Re-evaluate your team**: Take a step back and assess your team's strengths and weaknesses. Identify areas where you need to improve and make adjustments accordingly.\n\n**Action Items**\n\n1. Review your pitching staff and identify areas for improvement.\n2. Stream pitchers with favorable matchups to accumulate wins, strikeouts, and quality starts.\n3. Look for waiver wire pitching options or buy low on a struggling starter.\n4. Make roster adjustments to optimize performance.\n5. Focus on accumulating stats in specific categories to improve your roto standings.\n\nI hope this helps! Remember, turning your team around takes time and effort. Stay focused, and don't be afraid to make adjustments as needed.",
