  "content": "Alex, the guy from the social dance night? I don't think you mentioned him earlier, but that's a great idea! Alex might indeed have some valuable insights or recommendations about bachata or kizomba classes in the city.\n\nAs someone who's into dance, he might have connections to the local dance community or know about classes that are not well-advertised online. Plus, asking him for recommendations can be a great way to start a conversation and get to know him better.\n\nJust approach him with a friendly and casual tone, like: \"Hey Alex, I've been thinking of trying out bachata or kizomba classes. Do you know of any good studios or instructors in the city?\"\n\nWho knows, you might even find a new dance buddy or practice partner! Just remember to be respectful of his time and expertise, and don't be discouraged if he doesn't know anything about those specific styles.\n\nGood luck, and let me know how it goes!",
