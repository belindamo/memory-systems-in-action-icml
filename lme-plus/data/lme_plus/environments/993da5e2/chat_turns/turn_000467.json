  "content": "What a great idea! Using Greek yogurt instead of soy sauce is an excellent substitution, especially if you want to add a tangy flavor to the marinade. Greek yogurt will provide a creamy, slightly sour taste that will help balance the sweetness of the gochujang.\n\nHere's why it works:\n\n* Greek yogurt has a high acidity level, which will help break down the proteins in the chicken and tenderize it.\n* The creaminess of the yogurt will also help to neutralize some of the heat from the gochujang, making the dish more approachable for those who prefer milder flavors.\n* The tanginess of the yogurt will cut through the richness of the gochujang, creating a more balanced flavor profile.\n\nWhen using Greek yogurt, keep the following in mind:\n\n* Use a plain, unflavored Greek yogurt to avoid adding any unwanted flavors to the marinade.\n* Start with a small amount, such as 2-3 tablespoons, and adjust to taste. You can always add more yogurt, but it's harder to remove excess yogurt from the marinade.\n* If you're concerned about the yogurt curdling or separating during the marinating process, you can mix it with a small amount of water or lemon juice to thin it out.\n\nHere's an updated marinade recipe using Greek yogurt:\n\n**Gochujang Chicken Wings Marinade (with Greek Yogurt):**\n\n* 2 tablespoons gochujang\n* 2-3 tablespoons Greek yogurt\n* 1 tablespoon brown sugar\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon grated ginger\n* 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)\n* 1/4 teaspoon garam masala (optional)\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 1 tablespoon lime juice (optional)\n\nMix all the ingredients together, adjusting the amount of yogurt to your taste. Marinate the chicken wings for at least 2 hours or overnight, then bake or grill until cooked through.\n\nRemember to taste and adjust the marinade as you go, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your delicious gochujang chicken wings!",
