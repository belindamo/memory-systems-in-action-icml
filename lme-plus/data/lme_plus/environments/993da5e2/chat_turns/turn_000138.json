  "content": "It's a good idea to compare the rates of private car parks and council car parks if you're staying for only a few hours. The council car parks may be cheaper for shorter periods, especially during off-peak hours. Private car parks may have more competitive rates if you're staying for longer periods or during peak hours. Make sure to check the rates and any restrictions or rules before choosing a parking option. Additionally, you can use online parking comparison sites to compare multiple options simultaneously and find the best deal.",
