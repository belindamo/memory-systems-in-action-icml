  "content": "Okay! So, there was a really big fish tank in a hotel in Berlin, Germany. It was so big, it was even in the Guinness World Record book! But one day, the tank broke and a lot of water spilled out. Some people got a little hurt from the broken glass, but they are going to be okay. The hotel had to move all the guests to a different place to stay while they clean up the water and fix the tank. It was a big mess, but everyone is working hard to make everything better.",
