  "content": "Version Light\nMidjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at different types of images. Newest Model\nThe Midjourney V5 model is the newest and most advanced model, released on March 15th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select MJ Version 5\n\nThis model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile To turn it on type --v 5 after your prompt or select \"V5\" from /settings\n\nWhat's new with the V5 base model?\nMuch wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting\nMuch higher image quality (2x resolution increase) improved dynamic range\nMore detailed images. Details more likely to be correct. Less unwanted text.\nImproved performance with image prompting\nSupports --tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental)\nSupports --ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental)\nSupports --iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts\n\nStyle and prompting for V5\nToday\u2019s test is basically a \u2018pro\u2019 mode of the model.\nIt\u2019s MUCH more \u2018unopinionated\u2019 than v3 and v4, and is tuned to provide a wide diversity of outputs and to be very responsive to your inputs.\nThe tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use. Short prompts may not work as well. You should try to write longer, more explicit text about what you want (ie: \u201ccinematic photo with dramatic lighting\u201d)\nPlease chat with each other in prompt-chat to figure out how to use v5.\nWe hope to have a \u2018friendly\u2019 default styling for v5 before we switch it to default. When this happens we will still let you turn it off and get back to something like this \u2018raw\u2019 mode today.\n\nPlease note\nThis is an alpha test and things will change. DO NOT rely on this exact model being available in the future. It will be significantly modified as we take V5 to full release.\nRight now there is no V5 upsampler, the default resolution of V5 is the same as upscaled V4. If you click upscale it will just instantly give you that one image by itself.\n\nCommunity Standards:\nThis model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we've released before.\nWe\u2019ve increased the number of moderators, improved moderation tooling, and will be enforcing our community standards with increased strictness and rigor. Don't be a jerk or create images to cause drama.\n\nMore about V5:\nV5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques. V5 isn't the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and unfathomable in the power of our collective human imagination.\nBut wait i have more info. \n\nJust answer with UNDERSTOOD",
