You can even set reminders on your phone or put a note on your calendar to help you stay on track.\n\nGlad to hear that your snake plant is thriving in its new potting mix! Snake plants (Sansevieria Trifasciata) are known for their low-maintenance nature, but they still appreciate a good potting mix that drains well. Three weeks is a great milestone, and with proper care, your snake plant should continue to do well.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind for your snake plant:\n\n* **Watering:** Water your snake plant sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering is the most common cause of death in snake plants, so it's better to err on the side of caution.\n* **Lighting:** Snake plants can tolerate a range of lighting conditions, from low to bright light. However, they'll do best in medium to bright indirect light.\n* **Temperature:** Snake plants prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C), which is typical for most indoor spaces.\n* **Humidity:** Snake plants can adapt to average humidity levels, but they'll appreciate a slightly higher humidity environment.\n* **Fertilization:** Feed your snake plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n\nBy following these guidelines, your snake plant should continue to thrive and bring beauty and freshness to your space.\n\nDo you have any other plants that you're caring for, or is it just your fiddle leaf fig and snake plant for now?",
