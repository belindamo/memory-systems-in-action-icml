  "content": "I don't have personal experiences, preferences, or opinions. however, regarding the most affordable parking option, it depends on your specific needs and length of stay. if you're only staying for a short period, on-street parking may be the most affordable option, but it can be expensive during peak hours. if you're planning to park for a longer period, private car parks or council car parks may have more reasonable rates. additionally, if you're coming from outside the city centre, park and ride may be the most cost-effective option. it's recommended to compare rates and consider the location and duration of your stay to determine the most affordable option for your needs.",
