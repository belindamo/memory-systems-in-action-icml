  "content": "The AquaDom aquarium, located in the lobby of the Radisson Blu hotel in Berlin, Germany, burst on Wednesday, causing massive damage to the hotel and flooding nearby streets. Two people were injured by falling glass, and the majority of the 1,500 tropical fish in the tank died as a result of the incident. The tank, which was 15.85 meters high and contained over 100 different species of fish, was described as the largest free-standing cylindrical aquarium in the world. It is not yet clear what caused the tank to burst, though freezing temperatures and a targeted attack have been speculated as possible causes.",
