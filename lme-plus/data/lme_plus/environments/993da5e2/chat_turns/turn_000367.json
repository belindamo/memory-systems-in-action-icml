Meanwhile, the Utah Jazz's top-performing player, Donovan Mitchell, averaged 26.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game during the regular season, making him an All-Star and helping to lead the team to the top seed in the Western Conference.\n\nWhile LeBron James and Anthony Davis had strong seasons for the Lakers, their numbers fell short compared to the top performers of the Nuggets and Jazz. Nonetheless, the Lakers remain a strong team with a talented roster, and with the return of James and Davis to full health, the team will likely remain a top contender in the Western Conference for the upcoming season.",
