Here's why:\n\n1. **Peace Lily:** Peace lilies are known for their ability to tolerate low light conditions and can thrive in rooms with limited natural light. They can survive with as little as 50-75 foot-candles of light, which is roughly equivalent to a north-facing window. They're also great air purifiers, making them an excellent choice for bedrooms.\n2. **Orchid:** Orchids generally require more light to photosynthesize and bloom well. Most orchids need bright, indirect light, and some species require direct sunlight for short periods. If your bedroom receives limited natural light, an orchid might not receive enough light to bloom or grow well.\n\nThat being said, if you still want to consider an orchid, look for species that can tolerate low light, such as:\n\n* Phalaenopsis (moth orchid): These are one of the most common and adaptable orchid species, which can tolerate low light conditions.\n* Dendrobium: Some Dendrobium species can thrive in low-light conditions, but they might not bloom as frequently.\n\nKeep in mind that even if you choose a low-light-tolerant orchid, it will still require more light than a peace lily.\n\nAdditional tips for a peaceful bedroom atmosphere:\n\n* Consider adding a few low-maintenance plants like Pothos, ZZ Plant, or Snake Plant, which can thrive in low-light conditions.\n* Use grow lights: If you want to provide more light for your plants, consider using grow lights. They can supplement the natural light and help your plants thrive.\n* Maintain a consistent temperature: Most plants prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C), which is ideal for a bedroom.\n\nRemember, observe your plants' responses to the environment and adjust their care accordingly. Happy planting, and I hope you create a serene oasis in your bedroom!",
