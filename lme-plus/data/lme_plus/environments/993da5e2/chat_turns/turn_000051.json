  "content": "The scientist who made this observation and prediction was Urbain Le Verrier, a French mathematician and astronomer. He made the prediction based on calculations of the orbit of Uranus, which appeared to be disturbed by the gravitational influence of an unknown planet. Le Verrier sent his predictions to German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle, who then used them to discover the new planet, which was named Neptune. Neptune was first observed on September 23, 1846.",
