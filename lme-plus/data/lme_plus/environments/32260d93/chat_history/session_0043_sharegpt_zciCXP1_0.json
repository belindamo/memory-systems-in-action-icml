We are hosting \"Ethereum Mexico\", an event in Mexico City on September 30th, with the goal of targeting an audience of 1200 people. The event will consist of talks and workshops that aim to educate attendees on web3, the current status of the ecosystem, and more complex topics such as future updates on Ethereum. We plan to offer all talks and workshops in Spanish, making it more accessible to people who want to learn from scratch about Ethereum. We aim to reach out to universities and smaller communities across Mexico to participate in the event, allowing us to expand our reach and connect with more people. Additionally, we will be launching a Quadratic Funding Round with the EF, which will help us to secure more funding for public goods in Mexico. Overall, the proposed work aligns with the EF\u2019s mission and scope by focusing on community building, education, and strengthening the foundations of the Ethereum ecosystem."

      "content": "To improve the answer to the question, \u201cWhat problem(s) is being solved within the scope of the grant?\u201d the following could be added:\nOur grant proposal addresses several key problems within the scope of the grant. Firstly, we are addressing the issue of access and affordability for Mexican people who are interested in learning about the Ethereum ecosystem but cannot afford to attend events in other parts of the world. By hosting an event in Mexico City, we are providing a more accessible and affordable option for individuals who want to learn about Ethereum.\nSecondly, we are tackling the problem of limited awareness and understanding of the web3 ecosystem in Mexico. Many people in Mexico still associate Ethereum with cryptocurrency and are not aware of its broader potential to transform industries beyond finance. By providing talks and workshops that cover a range of topics related to web3 and the Ethereum ecosystem, we aim to educate attendees and inspire them to build on Ethereum.\nLastly, we are aiming to create a community-backed event that is specifically focused on the Mexican Ethereum community. By bringing together builders, developers, and enthusiasts from across Mexico, we hope to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and build a stronger community that can continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem in Mexico."
