  "content": "Yes, there are labels and certifications that you can look for when shopping for meat that indicate that the animals were raised humanely. Some common labels and certifications in the USA include:\n\n- Certified Humane: This label is managed by the nonprofit organization Humane Farm Animal Care (HFAC) and is given to products that come from animals that were raised in confinement-free spaces and were given proper food, water, and shelter. Animals were not given antibiotics or added hormones.\n\n- Animal Welfare Approved (AWA): This certification is given to farms that raise animals using the highest welfare standards set by the nonprofit organization A Greener World (AGW). Animals must be raised outdoors or in well-lit, well-ventilated, and spacious indoor areas, and must have continuous access to pasture for grazing. \n\n- Global Animal Partnership (GAP): This certification program rates animal welfare on a scale from 1 to 5+, with higher ratings indicating better conditions for the animals. GAP measures animal welfare throughout the animal's entire life, from birth to slaughter, and requires that animals have access to outdoor spaces, clean bedding, and other requirements.\n\n- Certified Organic: Organic meat guarantees that the animals were raised on organic feed without pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Organic farms must also follow strict animal welfare standards, including providing animals with access to the outdoors.\n\nEach certification has its own requirements and standards, so it's a good idea to research each one to understand the standards that they set for animal welfare.",
