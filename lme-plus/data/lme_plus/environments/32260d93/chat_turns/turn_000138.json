  "content": "I'm really looking forward to having a bigger kitchen and a backyard. I've always wanted to have a garden and host outdoor gatherings. I'm also excited to finally have a separate office space, I've been working from home for a while now and it'll be great to have a dedicated area for that. As for packing, I've started decluttering and sorting out what I want to keep, donate, or throw away, but I haven't started packing boxes yet. Do you have any tips on how to efficiently pack a kitchen?",
