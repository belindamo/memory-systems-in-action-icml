It's a common approach used by other sports leagues like the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL to increase their appeal and draw fans from different regions of the world.\n\nBy focusing on developing star players and building their personal brands, the CFL could attract new fans to the league as fans often follow and support individual athletes. This could lead to increased viewership and attendance at games, more merchandise sales, and additional revenue streams.\n\nHowever, the CFL should not solely rely on building personal brands of individual athletes. The league should also focus on promoting its brand and unique features such as its rules, traditions and heritage. This would help create a unique identity for the league and ensure fans' loyalty to the league and not only to individual players.\n\nTherefore, it would be a good strategy for the CFL to focus on both promoting individual star players and developing its own brand to attract a broader audience.",
