Ticket to Ride is an excellent game, and I'm sure you'll enjoy exploring other games in the same vein. Here are some recommendations that might interest you:\n\n1. **Train Station**: This game is often referred to as \"Ticket to Ride's little cousin.\" It's a more compact, faster-paced game where players build train stations, manage resources, and compete to create the most efficient network.\n2. **Railways of the World**: This game is part of the same series as Ticket to Ride, but it's a more complex and strategic experience. You'll build railroad empires, manage resources, and compete to complete routes across a modular board.\n3. **18xx series**: If you're looking for a more in-depth, economic simulation experience, the 18xx series might be up your alley. These games are set in the 19th century and focus on building railroad empires, managing finances, and competing against other players.\n4. **TransAmerica**: In this game, players build railroad tracks across a map of North America, trying to connect cities and complete routes. It's a more abstract game than Ticket to Ride, but still offers a similar experience.\n5. **Locomotive Werks**: This game takes a different approach, focusing on building and customizing locomotives rather than building tracks. You'll manage resources, upgrade your engines, and compete to deliver goods across the board.\n6. **Railroad Revolution**: This game combines train-themed gameplay with area control and resource management. Players build railroad networks, manage resources, and compete to control the most valuable routes.\n\nAll of these games offer a unique twist on the train theme, so you're sure to find one that resonates with you and your siblings. If you're looking for something similar to Ticket to Ride, Train Station or Railways of the World might be the way to go. If you're open to exploring different mechanics, the other options could provide a fresh and exciting experience.\n\nWhich one of these games catches your attention, or would you like more information about any of them?",
