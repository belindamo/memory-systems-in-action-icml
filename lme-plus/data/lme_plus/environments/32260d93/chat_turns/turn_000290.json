Players build railroad networks, manage resources, and compete to control the most valuable routes across a modular board. The game features:\n\n* **Modular board:** The board is composed of interlocking tiles, creating a unique map for each playthrough.\n* **Route-building:** Players build railroad tracks, trying to create the most efficient network and block their opponents.\n* **Resource management:** Manage resources (coal, iron, and money) to build tracks, upgrade locomotives, and complete objectives.\n* **Area control:** Control key regions on the board to earn bonuses and limit opponents' expansion.\n\nCompared to Ticket to Ride, Railroad Revolution offers:\n\n* A more tactical, area-control focused gameplay experience.\n* A stronger emphasis on resource management and engine-building.\n* A modular board, which adds replayability and variety.\n\n**Locomotive Werks:**\n\nLocomotive Werks is a game of engine-building, resource management, and delivery. Players build and customize locomotives, manage resources, and compete to deliver goods across a dynamic board. The game features:\n\n* **Engine-building:** Build and upgrade locomotives, improving their capabilities and efficiency.\n* **Resource management:** Manage resources (coal, water, and crew) to fuel and maintain your locomotives.\n* **Delivery:** Deliver goods to cities, completing contracts and earning points.\n* **Dynamic board:** The board changes with each playthrough, as cities and routes are added or removed.\n\nCompared to Ticket to Ride, Locomotive Werks offers:\n\n* A stronger focus on engine-building and customization.\n* A dynamic board that changes with each playthrough.\n* A more tactical gameplay experience, with a focus on resource management and delivery.\n\n**Comparison to Ticket to Ride:**\n\nBoth Railroad Revolution and Locomotive Werks share some similarities with Ticket to Ride, such as:\n\n* Train-themed gameplay\n* Route-building and network management\n* Resource management\n\nHowever, they each offer distinct twists and mechanics that set them apart from Ticket to Ride. Railroad Revolution focuses on area control and resource management, while Locomotive Werks emphasizes engine-building and delivery.\n\nIf you enjoy the train theme and route-building of Ticket to Ride, you may appreciate the unique mechanics and gameplay experiences offered by Railroad Revolution and Locomotive Werks.\n\nDo you think you might be interested in exploring one of these games, or do you still have your heart set on the 18xx series?",
