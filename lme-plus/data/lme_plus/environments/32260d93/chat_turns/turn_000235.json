  "content": "I think I'll add some subtle henna patterns as accents to the design, maybe in the corners of the pages or as separators between sections. I also like the idea of incorporating Indian florals, maybe using delicate illustrations of marigolds or jasmine flowers to add a touch of elegance to the design. I'll make sure to use them sparingly and balance them with negative space to create a clean and uncluttered design. Thanks for the tips and ideas! Can you suggest some online resources or tools that I can use to create these Indian-inspired patterns and motifs?",
