Reusable cotton pads require washing and drying, but this process is relatively easy and can be incorporated into your daily routine.\n3. **Hygiene:** Reusable cotton pads can be washed and sanitized, making them just as hygienic as disposable ones. However, it's essential to follow proper washing and drying instructions to maintain cleanliness.\n4. **Lifespan:** The lifespan of reusable cotton pads varies depending on usage and care. On average, they can last for several months to a year or more with proper maintenance.\n\n**Tips for using reusable cotton pads:**\n\n1. **Wash them regularly:** Wash your reusable cotton pads in warm water with a mild detergent, and dry them on a low heat setting or air-dry them.\n2. **Sanitize them:** Sanitize your reusable cotton pads by soaking them in hot water with a tablespoon of white vinegar or tea tree oil.\n3. **Store them properly:** Store your clean, dry reusable cotton pads in a breathable container or bag to prevent moisture buildup.\n4. **Choose the right material:** Select reusable cotton pads made from materials that suit your skin type and needs. For example, if you have sensitive skin, look for pads made from gentle, organic cotton.\n\nSome popular brands for reusable cotton pads include:\n\n* LastRound (offers a range of reusable cotton pads and other eco-friendly products)\n* The Better Store (carries a variety of reusable cotton pads from different brands)\n* Zero Waste Co (offers reusable cotton pads made from organic cotton and other eco-friendly materials)\n\nRemember, making the switch to reusable cotton pads might require some adjustments, but the benefits to the environment and your wallet make it a worthwhile change.",
