Suitable for runners and walkers who need more support, especially those with flat feet or overpronation.\n\nKey differences:\n\n* **Cushioning:** Ultraboost and Fresh Foam have more substantial cushioning than the Superstar, making them better suited for high-impact activities or longer walks.\n* **Support:** Ultraboost and Fresh Foam offer more support than the Superstar, with a more substantial heel counter and a more secure fit.\n* **Upper material:** Superstar often features a leather or premium material upper, while Ultraboost and Fresh Foam typically have a more breathable, mesh-based upper.\n\nWhen trying on these shoes, pay attention to how they feel on your feet, especially in the toe box, heel, and midfoot areas. Consider the following:\n\n* Do you prefer a more comfortable, cushioned ride or a more supportive, secure fit?\n* Do you need a shoe that can handle high-impact activities or longer walks?\n* Are you looking for a more stylish, fashion-forward design or a more functional, athletic look?\n\nBy trying on these shoes and considering your specific needs, you'll be able to find the perfect fit for your daily 10,000 steps!",
