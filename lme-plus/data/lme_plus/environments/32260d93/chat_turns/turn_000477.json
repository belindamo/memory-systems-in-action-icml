  "content": "\u201cEthereum Mexico\u201d is a 1-day conference in Mexico City on September 30th, targeting an audience of 1200 people. We will offer talks and workshops in Spanish on web3 and the current state of the Ethereum ecosystem, including future updates. Our goal is to reach out to universities and smaller communities across Mexico, expanding our reach and connecting with more people. We will also launch a Quadratic Funding Round with the EF to secure more funding for public goods in Mexico. This proposal aligns with the EF\u2019s mission by focusing on community building, education, and strengthening the foundations of the Ethereum ecosystem.",
