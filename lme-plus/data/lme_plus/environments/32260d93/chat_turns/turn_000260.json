Players compete to build train routes across a map of North America (or other continents in expansions). Easy to learn, fun to play, and takes about 30-60 minutes.\n2. **Railways of the World** (2005) - A more complex, strategic game where players build train networks across a modular board, managing resources and competing to deliver goods. Playtime: 60-120 minutes.\n3. **TransAmerica** (2002) - A quick and simple game where players build train routes across a map of the United States, trying to connect cities. Playtime: 30-45 minutes.\n4. **Trains** (2012) - A deck-building game where players collect cards to build train routes and deliver goods in a futuristic setting. Playtime: 30-60 minutes.\n5. **18xx series** (1970s-1980s) - A series of games that simulate the growth of railroads in the 19th century. These games are considered classics, but they can be complex and take 2-4 hours to play.\n6. **Steam Railways to Riches** (2012) - A game of building train routes and delivering goods, with a focus on resource management and optimization.

If you're new to train games, Ticket to Ride is a great introduction. If you're looking for something more complex, Railways of the World might be the way to go.\n\nWhat type of game are you in the mood for?
