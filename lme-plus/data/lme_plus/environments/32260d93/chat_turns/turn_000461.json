  "content": "What a great idea! Adding a \"Lent to\" column is a fantastic way to keep track of items you've loaned out to others. It's always frustrating when you can't remember who has what, or when they might return it.\n\nWith this column, you can keep a record of:\n\n* Who you lent the item to (e.g., \"Sister\")\n* The date you lent it out\n* A reminder or due date for when you'd like it back\n* Any notes about the loan, such as if it was for a specific event or occasion\n\nThis will help you stay organized and ensure that your lovely bright yellow sundress makes its way back to your closet eventually!\n\nRemember to also consider adding a \"Returned\" column or a \"Status\" column to update the item's status once it's been returned to you. This will help you keep your spreadsheet up-to-date and avoid confusion.\n\nI'm glad I could help, and I hope your wardrobe organization project turns out to be a success!",
