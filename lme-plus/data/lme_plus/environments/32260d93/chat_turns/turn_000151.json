  "content": "Using a combination of masking fluid and drybrushing will give you a beautiful, textured effect.\n\nWhen it comes to watercolor paper, the type you choose can indeed impact the appearance of your highlights. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Surface texture**: A paper with a rougher texture, such as Cold Press or Rough, can help create a more dynamic, expressive effect with drybrushing. The rough texture will catch the brushstrokes and create a more organic, irregular pattern. However, this texture might make it more challenging to achieve crisp, sharp highlights.\n2. **Tooth**: Papers with a higher tooth (a measure of the paper's texture and absorbency) will tend to hold more pigment and create a more vibrant, rich color. This can be beneficial for creating deep, dark blues and grays in your moonlit scene. However, the higher tooth might make it more difficult to achieve delicate, subtle highlights.\n3. **Whiteness and brightness**: A paper with a high whiteness and brightness (measured by its ISO brightness rating) will provide a more neutral background for your painting, allowing your colors to appear more vivid and your highlights to stand out. Look for papers with an ISO brightness rating of 90 or higher.\n\nBased on these factors, I would recommend using a watercolor paper with the following characteristics:\n\n* **Hot Press**: A Hot Press paper has a smooth, even surface that will help you achieve crisp, sharp highlights. This surface is ideal for creating delicate, detailed work and will allow your drybrushing to produce a more subtle, silvery effect.\n* **Medium to Low Tooth**: A paper with a medium to low tooth will provide a good balance between color vibrancy and highlight control. This will allow you to achieve rich, dark colors in your moonlit scene while still maintaining the ability to create delicate highlights.\n* **High Whiteness and Brightness**: Look for a paper with an ISO brightness rating of 90 or higher to ensure your colors appear vivid and your highlights stand out.\n\nSome excellent watercolor paper options that fit these criteria include:\n\n* Arches Hot Press\n* Winsor & Newton Cotman Hot Press\n* Fabriano Artistico Hot Press\n* Saunders Waterford Hot Press\n\nRemember, the type of paper you choose ultimately depends on your personal preference and the specific needs of your project. If you're new to watercolor, you might consider experimenting with different papers to find the one that works best for you.\n\nDo you have any other questions about watercolor paper or the Moonlit Waves piece?",
