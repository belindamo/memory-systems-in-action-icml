Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Salt Sprinkling**: Sprinkle salt onto a wet wash to create a textured, speckled effect. The salt absorbs the pigment, creating a unique, organic pattern. Experiment with different types of salt, like kosher salt or sea salt, for varying textures.\n2. **Wash and Scrape**: Apply a wash to your paper, then use a credit card or a scraper to remove some of the pigment while it's still wet. This creates a rough, textured surface.\n3. **Drybrushing**: Drag a almost-dry brush across the paper to create a rough, scratchy texture. This is great for suggesting rough, rocky surfaces or dry, cracked earth.\n4. **Gesso and Modeling Paste**: Mix gesso or modeling paste with water to create a thick, impasto texture. Apply this mixture to your paper using a palette knife or brush. Once dry, you can paint over it with watercolors.\n5. **Collage**: Incorporate collage elements like paper, fabric, or found objects into your painting to add texture and interest. Apply these elements using a medium like matte medium or acrylic gel.\n6. **Pumice Gel**: Mix pumice gel with water to create a textured, rough surface. Apply this mixture to your paper using a brush or palette knife.\n7. **Rough Paper**: Use rough, textured paper like cold press or rough watercolor paper to create a natural, organic texture.\n8. **Spatter**: Flick or spatter paint onto your paper using a brush or toothbrush. This creates a dynamic, expressive texture.\n9. **Wax Resist**: Apply melted wax to your paper, then paint over it with watercolors. The wax will resist the paint, creating a textured, patterned effect.\n10. **Experiment with Brushes**: Use unusual brushes like a fan brush, a scrub brush, or a bristle brush to create unique textures and patterns.\n\nRemember, the key to achieving interesting textures is to experiment and play. Don't be afraid to try new things and make mistakes \u2013 they can often lead to exciting, unexpected results!\n\nWhich of these techniques resonates with you, or do you have any other questions about creating textures in watercolor?",
