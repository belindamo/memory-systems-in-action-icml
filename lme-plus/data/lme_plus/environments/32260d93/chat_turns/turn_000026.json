  "content": "Sure, there are many drinks that would pair well with Tarte aux Pommes. If you want a non-alcoholic option, you can try serving it with a cup of hot tea, like Earl Grey or English Breakfast. If you prefer a cold drink, a glass of cold milk or a refreshing iced tea would be great as well.\n\nIf you want an alcoholic pairing, you can try pairing it with a glass of Calvados, the apple brandy that's famous in Normandy. Another great option is a glass of hard cider or an apple cider mimosa. The tartness and sweetness of the cider or Calvados perfectly complement the flavors of the Tarte aux Pommes.",
