  "content": "Write a brief descripiton of only 300 characters of this proposal, in wording different from the used in the full explanation, make it clear and concise. We are hosting \"Ethereum Mexico\", an event in Mexico City on September 30th, with the goal of targeting an audience of 1200 people. The event will consist of talks and workshops that aim to educate attendees on web3, the current status of the ecosystem, and more complex topics such as future updates on Ethereum. We plan to offer all talks and workshops in Spanish, making it more accessible to people who want to learn from scratch about Ethereum. We aim to reach out to universities and smaller communities across Mexico to participate in the event, allowing us to expand our reach and connect with more people. Additionally, we will be launching a Quadratic Funding Round with the EF, which will help us to secure more funding for public goods in Mexico. Overall, the proposed work aligns with the EF\u2019s mission and scope by focusing on community building, education, and strengthening the foundations of the Ethereum ecosystem.",
