I'm happy to help you with gear recommendations.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on attending a photography workshop and getting to try out new equipment. That's a great way to get a feel for what works for you and what you need.\n\nFor Yellowstone, you'll want to prioritize gear that can handle varying weather conditions, as well as equipment that can help you capture the diverse range of subjects, from wildlife to landscapes. Here are some essentials to consider:\n\n**Camera Body and Lenses:**\n\n* A DSLR or mirrorless camera body with good low-light performance, as you'll likely be shooting early morning or late evening when the light is soft and warm.\n* A versatile zoom lens, such as a 24-70mm or 24-105mm, which can handle landscapes, wildlife, and general photography.\n* A telephoto lens (70-200mm or 100-400mm) for capturing wildlife, especially bears, bison, and elk.\n* A wide-angle lens (10-22mm or 14-24mm) for capturing the grandeur of Yellowstone's landscapes.\n\n**Additional Accessories:**\n\n* Tripod: A sturdy tripod is a must-have for Yellowstone, as you'll often be shooting in low light or using slower shutter speeds to capture the mist from waterfalls or geysers.\n* Remote Shutter Release or Camera Timer: To minimize camera shake and ensure sharp images.\n* Extra Batteries and Memory Cards: With the cold weather and extended shooting sessions, it's essential to have spare batteries and memory cards.\n* Camera Rain Cover or Raincoat: Yellowstone can experience sudden rain showers, so it's a good idea to have a rain cover or raincoat for your gear.\n* Lens Cleaning Kit: A cleaning kit with a soft brush, microfiber cloths, and cleaning solution will help keep your lenses clean and free of dust and moisture.\n\n**Other Essentials:**\n\n* Backpack or Camera Bag: A comfortable backpack or camera bag with padding and compartments will help you carry your gear safely and efficiently.\n* Water and Snacks: Yellowstone is a vast park, and you may be away from amenities for extended periods. Bring water, snacks, and energy bars to keep you fueled.\n* Bear Spray: This is a must-have for safety, especially when hiking or venturing into areas with bear activity.\n* Map and Guidebook: A detailed map and guidebook will help you plan your itinerary and locate the best photography spots.\n\n**Clothing and Personal Gear:**\n\n* Layers: Pack clothing that can be layered for varying weather conditions, including warm hats, gloves, and a waterproof jacket.\n* Sturdy Hiking Boots: Good hiking boots with traction will help you navigate Yellowstone's trails and uneven terrain.\n* Sunscreen and Insect Repellent: Protect yourself from the sun and insects with SPF 30 or higher sunscreen and DEET-based insect repellent.\n\nRemember to check the weather forecast before your trip and pack accordingly. It's also a good idea to check with park rangers or visitor centers for any specific regulations or guidelines for photography in the park.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have an amazing time capturing the beauty of Yellowstone!",
