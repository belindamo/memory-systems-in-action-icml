As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so we didn't attend a company party in January together.\n\nHowever, I love the idea of adding a \"Special Occasions\" column! Tracking which items you've worn to special events can be super helpful in planning your outfits and making the most of your wardrobe.\n\nBy keeping a record of which items you've worn to specific events, you'll be able to:\n\n* Identify patterns in your dressing habits and see which items you tend to reach for during certain occasions\n* Plan your outfits more effectively for future events by knowing which items have worked well in the past\n* Avoid repeating outfits or wearing the same item to multiple events\n* Even create a mental or digital \"lookbook\" of your favorite outfits for different occasions\n\nYou could also consider adding additional columns to further break down your special occasion tracking, such as:\n\n* \"Event Type\" to categorize the type of event (e.g., wedding, party, formal gala, etc.)\n* \"Date\" to track the date of the event\n* \"Location\" to note the location of the event\n* \"Notes\" to add any additional details or comments about the event or outfit\n\nBy keeping track of your special occasion outfits, you'll be able to make more intentional fashion choices and create a wardrobe that works harder for you.",
