  "content": "Sure, here are some vegetarian snack ideas that are high in protein:\n\n1. Hummus with veggies: Hummus is made from chickpeas, a great source of protein. Pair it with sliced vegetables such as carrots, celery, bell peppers, cucumbers, to boost fiber and nutrient intake.\n\n2. Roasted chickpeas: Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas, coat them with some olive oil and spices, and roast them in the oven for a crispy, protein-filled snack.\n\n3. Greek yogurt with berries: Greek yogurt is high in protein, and the addition of berries provides additional flavor and antioxidants.\n\n4. Edamame: Edamame is high in protein and fiber and makes an excellent snack. Boil or steam them for a few minutes and sprinkle with salt or spices for additional flavor.\n\n5. Peanut butter apple slices: An apple is a healthy and fiber-rich snack while peanut butter is a good source of protein and healthy fat.\n\n6. Trail mix: Mix nuts like almonds or cashews, seeds, dried fruit, and even dark chocolate to create a filling and high-protein snack.\n\nSnacks that incorporate legumes, Greek yogurt, nuts, and seeds are good options for vegetarians looking to up their protein intake. They\u2019re all tasty and high in protein, and can be enjoyed any time of the day.",
