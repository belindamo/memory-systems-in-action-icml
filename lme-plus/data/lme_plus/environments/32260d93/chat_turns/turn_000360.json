  "content": "I think it's best to focus on the bag's condition and features when listing your old gym bag. Here's why:\n\n1. **Relevance**: The fact that you lent the bag to your friend Sarah and she hasn't returned it isn't directly relevant to the bag's condition, quality, or functionality. It's a personal issue that doesn't impact the bag's value.\n2. **Negative connotations**: Mentioning that the bag was lent to someone and not returned might raise concerns about the bag's cleanliness, potential damage, or even the possibility of it being stolen. You don't want to create any negative associations in the buyer's mind.\n3. **Focus on the positives**: Instead, highlight the bag's best features, such as its durability, water-resistant material, multiple compartments, or comfortable straps. Emphasize its benefits and what makes it a great gym bag.\n4. **Honesty is important, but...**: While it's essential to be honest about the bag's condition, you don't need to disclose every detail about its history. Stick to the facts that are relevant to the buyer's purchasing decision.\n\nWhen listing your gym bag, focus on the following:\n\n* The bag's condition (e.g., gently used, minor signs of wear)\n* Its features (e.g., water-resistant, multiple compartments, padded straps)\n* Any flaws or defects (e.g., small tears, fading)\n* The original price and your asking price\n* High-quality photos that show the bag from different angles\n\nBy focusing on the bag's condition and features, you'll attract buyers who are interested in the product itself, rather than its history.",
