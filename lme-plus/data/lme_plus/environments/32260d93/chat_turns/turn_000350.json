Here are a few suggestions to help you adjust the pocket or find a smaller umbrella that fits:\n\n**Adjusting the Pocket:**\n\n1. **Check the pocket's dimensions**: Measure the internal dimensions of the side pocket to determine the maximum size of the umbrella that can fit.\n2. **Consider a pocket expander**: If the pocket has a zipper or Velcro closure, you can try attaching a pocket expander or a small pouch to increase the pocket's capacity.\n3. **Use a compression strap**: If the umbrella is just a bit too long, you can try using a compression strap to cinch it down and make it more compact.\n4. **Reposition the umbrella**: Try placing the umbrella at an angle or horizontally in the pocket to see if it fits better.\n\n**Smaller Umbrella Options:**\n\n1. **Compact umbrellas**: Look for umbrellas specifically designed to be compact and lightweight, often called \"travel umbrellas\" or \"pocket umbrellas.\" These usually have a smaller canopy and a more compact folding design.\n2. **Mini umbrellas**: Consider a mini umbrella, which is even smaller than a compact umbrella. These are designed for emergency use and are often very small and lightweight.\n3. **Folding umbrellas with a smaller diameter**: If you still want a full-sized umbrella, look for one with a smaller diameter (e.g., 30-35 inches instead of 40-45 inches). This might make it more compact when folded.\n\nSome popular compact umbrella brands include:\n\n* Totes\n* Samsonite\n* Lewis N. Clark\n* REI Co-op\n* UGG (yes, the same brand that makes boots!)\n\nWhen shopping for a smaller umbrella, be sure to check the reviews and product descriptions to ensure it's sturdy and windproof.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find a solution to fit your umbrella in your backpack's side pocket!",
