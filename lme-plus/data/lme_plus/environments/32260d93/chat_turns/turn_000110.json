  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not possess personal opinions, but I can provide an overview of how public attitudes have evolved over time towards diversity on the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe composition of the Supreme Court of Canada has always been a subject of public interest and discussion. Initially, the court was predominantly composed of white, male judges with a background in law or politics. As the court began to address issues of diversity and inclusivity, public opinion gradually shifted towards the importance of having a more diverse bench.\n\nIn 1989, the appointment of Bertha Wilson as the first female judge on the Supreme Court of Canada was celebrated as a crucial milestone in the promotion of diversity in the judiciary. Wilson was a groundbreaking figure who paved the way for a new era of more inclusive appointments to the court.\n\nSince then, the court has become increasingly diverse, with appointments of judges from a variety of backgrounds, including women, Indigenous people, and members of visible and ethnic minority groups. Many Canadians view this trend as a positive development, as it reflects a more representative and inclusive judiciary that can better understand and address the diverse perspectives of the society.\n\nThere are also those who argue that appointments based on identity politics are not appropriate and that merit should always come first. However, the trend towards appointing a more diverse group of judges to the court shows that public attitudes towards diversity have become more positive over time. Ultimately, the Supreme Court of Canada will continue to evolve as new issues of diversity and inclusivity arise, and as public attitudes towards diversity change.",
