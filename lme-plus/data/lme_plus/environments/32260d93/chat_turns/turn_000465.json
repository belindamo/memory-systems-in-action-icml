The \"Notes\" column is a fantastic idea, and it's exactly the kind of detail that can help you jog your memory and figure out where that white shirt might be.\n\nBy adding notes about the specific occasion, you can recall details that might seem insignificant at first but can later become crucial in tracking down a missing item. In this case, noting that you wore the shirt to Sarah's house for dinner could be the key to remembering that you might have left it there.\n\nRemember to be as specific as possible in your notes. You could include details like:\n\n* Who you were with\n* What you did during the event\n* Any notable conversations or events that might help you remember\n* Even small details like what you ate or drank can help trigger your memory\n\nHaving these notes will give you a better chance of reconstructing your activities and figuring out where you might have left the shirt.\n\nYou're doing a great job of customizing the spreadsheet to fit your needs. I'm confident that with these columns and notes, you'll be able to track down that white shirt and keep your wardrobe organized!",
