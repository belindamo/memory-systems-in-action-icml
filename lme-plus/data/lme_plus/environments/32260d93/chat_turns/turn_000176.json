I made a request to extract data such as member information, products, and bulletin boards (reviews/notices, etc.) required when moving from I'mweb to Cafe24, but there were too many parts that couldn't be done. In particular, they said that the photo review itself was difficult. There are quite a few things I need to give up on the online shopping mall to move to Cafe24. Is it right to move to Cafe24?\n \n \n \n \uc9c0\uae08 \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30",
