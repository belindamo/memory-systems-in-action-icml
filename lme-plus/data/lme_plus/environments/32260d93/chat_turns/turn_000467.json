By keeping a record of when and where you bought each item, you'll be able to:\n\n* See how often you're buying new clothes and identify patterns or habits\n* Track your spending habits and stay within your budget\n* Reflect on your purchasing decisions and make more intentional choices in the future\n* Even calculate the cost per wear for each item, which can help you prioritize your wardrobe and identify areas for improvement\n\nYou could also consider adding additional columns to further break down your purchasing habits, such as:\n\n* \"Price\" to track the cost of each item\n* \"Store/Brand\" to see which retailers or brands you frequent the most\n* \"Category\" to categorize your purchases by type (e.g., tops, bottoms, dresses, etc.)\n* \"Season\" to track which seasons you tend to shop the most\n\nBy having this information at your fingertips, you'll be able to make more informed decisions about your wardrobe and spending habits. You might even discover areas where you can cut back and allocate your budget more efficiently.\n\nRemember, becoming more mindful of your spending habits takes time and effort, but it's a great step towards developing a more sustainable and intentional approach to fashion.",
