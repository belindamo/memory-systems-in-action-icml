They're such a delight to watch, aren't they?\n\nHummingbirds are attracted to flowers that provide nectar, which is their primary source of energy. They have a long, extendable tongue that allows them to reach deep into flowers to gather nectar, so they tend to favor flowers with long, tube-shaped blooms. Here are some tips on what types of flowers and plants are most attractive to hummingbirds:\n\n1. **Tubular flowers**: Hummingbirds love flowers with long, tube-shaped blooms, such as trumpet-shaped flowers, honeysuckles, fuchsia, and lantana.\n2. **Red, orange, and purple flowers**: Hummingbirds are particularly drawn to flowers with bright, bold colors, especially red, orange, and purple. These colors are often associated with nectar-rich flowers.\n3. **Nectar-rich flowers**: Hummingbirds seek out flowers with high nectar content, such as salvias, bee balm, cardinal flower, and coral bells.\n4. **Flowers with abundant blooms**: Hummingbirds prefer flowers that produce multiple blooms, ensuring a steady supply of nectar. Examples include coneflowers, black-eyed susans, and zinnias.\n5. **Native plants**: Planting native flowers and shrubs in your yard can attract hummingbirds, as they're more likely to be familiar with these plants and their nectar sources.\n6. **Flowers with a sweet, energy-rich nectar**: Hummingbirds need to consume a lot of energy to power their high metabolism, so they're attracted to flowers with a high sugar content, such as flowers with a sucrose-rich nectar.\n\nSome specific plants that are known to attract hummingbirds include:\n\n* Trumpet vine (Campsis radicans)\n* Honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.)\n* Fuchsia (Fuchsia spp.)\n* Lantana (Lantana camara)\n* Salvias (Salvia spp.)\n* Bee balm (Monarda didyma)\n* Cardinal flower (Lobelia cardinalis)\n* Coral bells (Heuchera spp.)\n* Coneflower (Echinacea spp.)\n* Black-eyed susan (Rudbeckia hirta)\n* Zinnias (Zinnia spp.)\n\nRemember to plant a variety of flowers that bloom at different times to provide a constant nectar source throughout the growing season. Also, consider using plants that are native to your region, as they'll be more attractive to local hummingbird populations.\n\nBy incorporating these flowers and plants into your yard, you'll be creating a hummingbird-friendly habitat that will attract these beautiful birds and provide them with the energy they need to thrive. Good luck, and happy birding!",
