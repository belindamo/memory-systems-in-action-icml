  "content": "(The scene opens with the whole gang sitting at their usual table at Patty's Pub, drinking their beers and joking around. Suddenly, Dennis and Mac get into an argument.)\n\nDennis: \"I'm telling you, JFK was assassinated. It's a proven fact.\"\n\nMac: \"No way, man. He died of natural causes. Heart attack or something.\"\n\nDennis: \"What are you talking about? The Warren Commission clearly said it was a lone gunman.\"\n\nMac: \"I don't care what some commission said. I've done my own research and I know the truth.\"\n\nCharlie: \"What are you guys even talking about?\"\n\nDennis: \"Mac here thinks JFK died of natural causes.\"\n\nCharlie: \"Yeah, that's ridiculous. Everyone knows he was killed by the government.\"\n\n(Everyone looks at Charlie in surprise)\n\nDennis: \"See, even Charlie knows it was an assassination.\"\n\nMac: \"I'm telling you, there's more to the story. And I have the evidence to prove it.\"\n\n(Mac pulls out a stack of conspiracy theory books and begins to read from one)\n\nDennis: \"Oh please, you're just reading from some crackpot's website.\"\n\nMac: \"This is from the Smithsonian, you moron!\"\n\n(The argument escalates with the gang getting increasingly confused and frustrated)\n\nCharlie: \"Wait a minute, JFK died in the 60s, right? So why does it even matter now?\"\n\nDennis: \"Exactly! It doesn't matter, let's just drop it.\"\n\nMac: \"I'll drop it when the truth is finally told!\"\n\n(Danny DeVito's character, Frank, enters the pub)\n\nFrank: \"What's all the commotion about?\n\nCharlie: \"Dennis and Mac are arguing about whether JFK died of natural causes or not.\"\n\nFrank: \"Oh, that old chestnut. I've got a theory. He was killed by a time-traveling alien.\"\n\n(The gang stares at Frank in disbelief)\n\nDennis: \"You're not helping, Frank.\"\n\nFrank: \"What? It's a plausible explanation!\"\n\n(The scene ends with the gang laughing and shaking their heads while Mac sulks in the corner, still convinced of his theory)",
