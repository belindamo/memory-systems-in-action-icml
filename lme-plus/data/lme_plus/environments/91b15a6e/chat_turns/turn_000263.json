  "content": "It is possible to use fighter jet technology for civilian purposes like transporting passengers or cargo. However, it is not practical due to a few reasons.\n\nFirstly, fighter jets are designed to fly in high-stress environments and conduct combat operations, so their design priorities differ significantly from commercial aircraft, which prioritize passenger comfort and safety.\n\nSecondly, fighter jets have limited range and payload capacity, which makes them unsuitable for long-range civilian transportation.\n\nThirdly, fighter jets require specialized training and maintenance by trained air force personnel, which makes their operational costs prohibitively expensive for commercial aviation.\n\nHowever, some fighter jet technology has found its way into the design of commercial aircraft, such as fly-by-wire flight controls and advanced avionics systems.\n\nIn conclusion, while fighter jet technology could be useful for commercial aviation, it is not practical due to their design priorities, limited range and payload capacity, and high operating costs. Therefore, there are better-suited aircraft designed for passenger and cargo transport in the commercial aviation industry.",
