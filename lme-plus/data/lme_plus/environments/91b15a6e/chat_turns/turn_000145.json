Visit these stores, and ask the owners if they're interested in buying or consigning your items.\n2. **Antique malls or collectible stores**: If you have multiple items to sell, consider consigning them to an antique mall or collectible store. They'll take care of the pricing, displaying, and selling, and you'll receive a percentage of the sale price.\n3. **Estate sale companies**: If you have a large collection or multiple items, consider hiring an estate sale company to handle the sale. They'll appraise, price, and sell your items, and you'll receive a percentage of the proceeds.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Get items appraised**: If you're unsure of the value of your items, consider hiring a professional appraiser to evaluate them. This will give you a better understanding of their worth and help you set realistic prices.\n2. **Research and price competitively**: Look at completed listings on online marketplaces, auction houses, and local antique stores to determine fair prices for your items.\n3. **Provide detailed descriptions and photos**: When listing your items online, include high-quality photos and detailed descriptions to showcase their condition, provenance, and features.\n4. **Be prepared to negotiate**: Be flexible with your pricing, and be open to negotiating with potential buyers.\n5. **Consider donating or consigning**: If you're not attached to receiving a specific price, consider donating your items to a charity or consigning them to a local antique store or auction house.\n\nBy exploring these options, you'll increase your chances of finding the right buyer and getting a good price for your antique music box, vintage typewriter, and depression-era glassware. Good luck!",
