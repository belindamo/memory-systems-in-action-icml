Yes, you can prioritize tasks in Trello using labels, tags, or even a custom field. Here are a few ways to do it:\n\n1. **Labels**: You can create labels with different colors and names to represent priority levels, such as \"High\", \"Medium\", or \"Low\". Then, assign the relevant label to each card. This way, you can quickly filter cards by label to see which ones need attention first.\n2. **Tags**: Similar to labels, you can create tags with priority levels and add them to cards. Tags are more flexible than labels, as you can create multiple tags for a single card.\n3. **Custom Fields**: Trello's custom fields feature allows you to create a custom field for priority levels. You can choose from various field types, such as dropdown menus, checkboxes, or text fields. This way, you can add a priority field to each card and set the level accordingly.\n\nTo avoid overwhelm in Trello, here are some tips:\n\n1. **Keep it simple**: Start with a minimal setup and gradually add more features and complexity as needed. Avoid creating too many lists or cards at the beginning.\n2. **Use a consistent naming convention**: Establish a consistent naming convention for your lists, cards, and labels to make it easy to find and organize information.\n3. **Focus on one board at a time**: If you have multiple projects, consider creating separate boards for each project. This will help you focus on one project at a time and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n4. **Use filters and sorting**: Use Trello's filtering and sorting features to quickly find specific cards or focus on a particular list. This will help you stay organized and avoid feeling overwhelmed by the number of cards.\n5. **Regularly clean up and archive**: Regularly clean up your board by archiving completed cards, deleting unnecessary lists, and reorganizing your board to reflect changes in your project.\n6. **Set boundaries**: Establish boundaries for yourself and your team (if you're working with others) on how much time to spend on Trello each day or week. This will help you avoid getting sucked into the tool and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to prioritize your tasks effectively and avoid feeling overwhelmed in Trello.\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions? Do you have any other questions about prioritizing tasks or avoiding overwhelm in Trello?",
