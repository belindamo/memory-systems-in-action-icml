The ideal amount of protein to consume post-workout is a topic of ongoing debate, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n**Post-workout protein intake:**\n\n* Consume 15-25 grams of protein within 30-60 minutes after your cycling training session. This is often referred to as the \"anabolic window.\"\n* Aim for 1.2-1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight within the first hour after exercise. For example, if you weigh 70 kg, aim for 84-112 grams of protein.\n\n**Protein-rich foods:**\n\n1. **Lean meats**:\n\t* Chicken breast (3-4 ounces cooked: 26-30 grams protein)\n\t* Turkey breast (3-4 ounces cooked: 24-28 grams protein)\n\t* Lean beef (3-4 ounces cooked: 22-26 grams protein)\n2. **Fish and seafood**:\n\t* Salmon (3-4 ounces cooked: 20-24 grams protein)\n\t* Tuna (3-4 ounces cooked: 20-24 grams protein)\n\t* Shrimp (3-4 ounces cooked: 16-20 grams protein)\n3. **Dairy and eggs**:\n\t* Greek yogurt (1 cup: 20-25 grams protein)\n\t* Cottage cheese (1 cup: 28-30 grams protein)\n\t* Eggs (2 large eggs: 14-16 grams protein)\n4. **Legumes**:\n\t* Lentils (1 cup cooked: 18-20 grams protein)\n\t* Chickpeas (1 cup cooked: 15-18 grams protein)\n\t* Black beans (1 cup cooked: 15-18 grams protein)\n5. **Plant-based protein powder**:\n\t* Whey protein isolate (1 scoop: 20-25 grams protein)\n\t* Pea protein powder (1 scoop: 20-25 grams protein)\n\t* Rice protein powder (1 scoop: 15-20 grams protein)\n\n**Protein supplements:**\n\nIf you're struggling to consume enough protein from whole foods, consider adding a protein supplement to your routine. Whey protein isolate and pea protein powder are popular options among cyclists due to their high protein content and ease of digestion.\n\n**Timing and frequency:**\n\nAim to consume protein-rich foods or supplements at the following times:\n\n* Immediately after your cycling training session (within 30-60 minutes)\n* 1-2 hours after your training session (as a snack or light meal)\n* With your main meals (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner)\n\n**Example post-workout meal or snack:**\n\n* Greek yogurt with berries and honey (20-25 grams protein)\n* Turkey and avocado wrap with whole grain tortilla (25-30 grams protein)\n* Protein smoothie with whey protein powder, banana, and almond milk (20-25 grams protein)\n\nRemember to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, and adjust your protein intake based on your individual needs and training schedule.",
