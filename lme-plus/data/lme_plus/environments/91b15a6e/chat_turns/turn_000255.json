  "content": "The technology used in fighter jets and bombers differs based on mission requirements. However, fighter jets are typically equipped with more advanced features compared to bombers, primarily due to their role in air-to-air combat.\n\nFighter jets are designed to be highly maneuverable and fast, which requires advanced avionics and flight control systems. They are equipped with state-of-the-art radar and sensors that allow pilots to detect and engage targets from great distances. They also have advanced electronic countermeasures systems that can jam or deceive enemy radar and missile systems.\n\nBombers, on the other hand, focus more on long range and carrying a large payload of weapons. They are equipped with advanced navigation systems that allow them to fly long distances without refueling and can carry large amounts of fuel and munitions. However, they may not prioritize advanced avionics and electronic warfare systems as much as fighter jets.\n\nIn summary, fighter jets and bombers have different priorities when it comes to technology. Fighter jets prioritize maneuverability, speed, and electronic warfare systems, while bombers prioritize range, payload, and navigation systems.",
