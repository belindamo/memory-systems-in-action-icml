Here's how it works:\n\n**What is a Q-bot?**\nA Q-bot is a virtual queuing system that allows you to reserve a spot in line for popular attractions and shows at Legoland Windsor. It's a handheld device that you can use to book a time slot for a specific ride or show, and then return to the attraction at the designated time with minimal waiting.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\n1. **Collection**: You can collect your Q-bot device from the Q-bot desk or a designated pick-up point at the park.\n2. **Booking**: Use the Q-bot device to book a time slot for a specific ride or show. You can choose from a list of available attractions and time slots.\n3. **Reservation**: The Q-bot system will allocate a time slot for you, and you'll receive a confirmation on the device.\n4. **Return**: At the designated time, head to the attraction and show your Q-bot device to the staff. You'll be given priority entry to the ride or show with minimal waiting.\n\n**Types of Q-bots**\nLegoland Windsor offers different types of Q-bots, including:\n\n* **Q-bot Standard**: Allows you to book one ride or show at a time, with a limited number of bookings per day.\n* **Q-bot Express**: Allows you to book multiple rides or shows at once, with priority entry and unlimited bookings per day.\n* **Q-bot Ultimate**: Includes all the benefits of Q-bot Express, plus additional perks like a dedicated Q-bot host, priority entry to character meets, and more.\n\n**Tips and Essentials**\n\n* Q-bots are subject to availability and can sell out quickly, especially during peak seasons. Book your Q-bot in advance to ensure availability.\n* You can only book one ride or show at a time with a Q-bot Standard, so plan your day accordingly.\n* Q-bots are non-refundable and non-transferable.\n* Make sure to check the Q-bot device regularly for any updates or changes to your bookings.\n\nBy using a Q-bot, you can minimize your wait times and make the most of your day at Legoland Windsor.
