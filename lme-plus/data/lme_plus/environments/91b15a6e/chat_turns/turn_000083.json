  "content": "Thank you for the strength training exercises and routines! I'm excited to incorporate them into my training program.\n\nAs for my cycling training, I have about 12 weeks left until my 40km cycling event on June 1st. I'm planning to gradually increase my training intensity and volume over the next few weeks to build up my endurance and speed.\n\nMy current plan is to continue with my regular Saturday morning 20km rides and add one or two shorter rides during the week, focusing on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to improve my anaerobic endurance. I'll also increase my strength training to 3 times a week, targeting my core, legs, and glutes as we discussed.\n\nIn the last 4-6 weeks leading up to the event, I plan to taper my training volume and focus on active recovery, allowing my body to rest and adapt to the demands of the event. I'll also work on my bike fit, making any necessary adjustments to optimize my comfort and efficiency on the bike.\n\nDo you have any additional advice or guidance on how to structure my training plan or make the most of my remaining 12 weeks?",
