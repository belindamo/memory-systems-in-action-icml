  "content": "I'm happy to help you with your question! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about individual stores or their promotions. But I can give you some general advice and clarify the discount concept for you!\n\nIt's always a good idea to call ahead or check the store's website or social media pages to inquire about any promotions or discounts they might be offering, especially for first-time customers. You can also ask about any loyalty programs or email newsletters that might provide exclusive offers.\n\nNow, about discounts: when an item is discounted by 20%, it means you'll pay 80% of the original price, but that's not exactly how the math works. Here's the correct calculation:\n\nOriginal price = $100\nDiscount = 20% of $100 = $20\nDiscounted price = $100 - $20 = $80\n\nSo, in this case, you'd pay $80, which is 80% of the original price ($100). Make sense?\n\nRemember to always check the prices and any discounts carefully before making a purchase, and don't hesitate to ask the store staff if you have any questions. Happy thrifting!",
