  "content": "Sure! Cheese is delicious, but it can also be high in calories and fat. Here are some healthier cheese substitutes you may want to consider when making tacos:\n\n1. Greek yogurt: You can use plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream or cheese as a high-protein, low-fat option.\n\n2. Nutritional yeast: This is a vegan cheese substitute that adds a cheesy flavor to tacos but is low in fat and calories. \n\n3. Reduced-fat cheese: If you can't imagine your taco without cheese, consider using a reduced-fat cheese variety instead of regular. It has fewer calories and less fat.\n\n4. Avocado: Instead of using cheese, you can use mashed avocado as a topping. It\u2019s a healthy source of fat that creates a similar creamy texture to cheese.\n\n5. Queso fresco: This is a crumbly Mexican cheese that has fewer calories and less fat than many other cheese varieties.\n\nThese are just a few ideas, but there are many other options you can experiment with to find a healthy cheese substitute you enjoy.",
