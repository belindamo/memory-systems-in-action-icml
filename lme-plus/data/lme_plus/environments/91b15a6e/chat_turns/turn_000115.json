  "content": "Here's a possible text to image prompt for Azrael Blackwood's defaced holy symbol:\n\nCreate an image of a once-beautiful holy symbol of Bahamut, now defaced and corrupted by Azrael Blackwood, a fallen Oathbreaker Paladin. The symbol is a shining platinum dragon on a field of blue, scratched and tarnished, with chunks of metal missing and deep gouges marring its surface. In the center of the symbol, where the dragon's heart should be, there is now a jagged black gemstone, pulsating with an otherworldly energy. The image should convey a sense of unease and discomfort, as if the viewer is being watched by some malevolent force.",
