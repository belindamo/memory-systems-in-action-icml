A good tennis club will want to ensure you find the right racket and provide you with excellent service.\n\nTaking notes during the demo session will help you keep track of your impressions, pros, and cons of each racket. Don't be afraid to ask follow-up questions or seek clarification on any concerns you may have.\n\nWhen you're trying out the rackets, focus on how they feel in your hand, the weight, balance, and swing weight. Pay attention to how the racket responds to your strokes, including the power, control, and spin.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and enjoy the process of finding your new racket!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your demo session, and I hope you find the perfect racket for your game!",
