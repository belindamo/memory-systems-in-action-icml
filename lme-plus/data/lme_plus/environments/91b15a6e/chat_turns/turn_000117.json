  "content": "Here's a possible text to image prompt for a realistic render of Azrael Blackwood:\n\nCreate a realistic render of Azrael Blackwood, a male Oathbreaker Paladin who has fallen from grace and turned to the service of a dark deity. He stands at around 6 feet tall, with a muscular build and broad shoulders. He has short black hair and piercing blue eyes, which are now clouded with a hint of malevolence and darkness.\n\nHis armor is dark and menacing, with jagged spikes protruding from the shoulders and gauntlets. The armor is adorned with sinister motifs, including skulls and serpents, and bears the symbol of the dark deity that he now serves. The armor is battle-worn and bears the scars of many battles, reflecting the dark path that Azrael has chosen.\n\nIn his hand, Azrael wields a blackened longsword, which is imbued with dark magic and can drain the life force of his enemies. His stance is aggressive and confident, reflecting his newfound power and influence. Despite his fall from grace, there is still a sense of nobility and righteousness about him, a vestige of the paladin he once was. The image should convey a sense of danger and malevolence, while still hinting at the character's tragic past and inner struggle.",
