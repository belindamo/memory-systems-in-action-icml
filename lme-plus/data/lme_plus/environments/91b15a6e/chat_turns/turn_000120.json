  "content": "I usually do lifestyle and cooking content. My target audience is mostly young adults who enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes. My live streams are usually around 30 minutes to an hour long. I've been thinking of doing a live cooking stream with a special guest, maybe a fellow streamer or a chef. I've also been considering doing a live Q&A session where I answer questions about my favorite recipes and cooking tips. Oh, and I just realized I started live streaming on YouTube about three weeks ago, and I've been going live almost every other day since then!",
