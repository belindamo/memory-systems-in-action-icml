Since I've been going for 20km bike rides every Saturday morning, I'll make sure to consume 15-25 grams of protein within 30-60 minutes after my ride. I'll aim to have a protein-rich snack or meal, such as Greek yogurt with berries and honey or a turkey and avocado wrap, to aid in muscle recovery.",
