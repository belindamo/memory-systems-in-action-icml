LEGO Friends is a theme within the LEGO brand, but it doesn't have a dedicated live show at Legoland Windsor.\n\nIt's possible that you might be thinking of a different theme park or event. LEGO City Stage typically hosts various shows and performances throughout the day, but the exact shows and schedules may vary depending on the season and year.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Legoland Windsor soon, I recommend checking the park's website or mobile app for the most up-to-date information on shows and attractions. You can also check the park's schedule for the day you plan to visit to see what shows are happening during your trip.\n\nI'm glad to hear that you had a blast with your niece on August 5th, though! I hope you and your family have another fantastic time at Legoland Windsor!",
