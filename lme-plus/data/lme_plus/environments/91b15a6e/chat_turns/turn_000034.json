I'll start by creating a new board and setting up lists for To-Do, In Progress, and Done. I'll also create cards for each task and add details like task name, description, and due date. I'm excited to explore Trello's features, such as power-ups and custom fields, to see how they can enhance my workflow.\n\nOne question I have is about prioritizing tasks.

Is there a way to label or tag cards with a priority level, such as high, medium, or low?\n\nAlso, I was wondering if you have any tips on how to avoid overwhelm when using Trello.
