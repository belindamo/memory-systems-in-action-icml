  "content": "Fighter jets are aircraft specifically designed to engage in air-to-air combat, meaning they are primarily used for attacking other aircraft. They are highly maneuverable and equipped with advanced weapons systems that allow them to engage in dogfights, intercept enemy aircraft, provide close air support, and control the airspace over a battlefield.\n\nBombers, on the other hand, are larger and slower aircraft that are designed to drop bombs on ground targets. They can also carry missiles and other weapons to engage in air-to-air combat, but this is not their primary role.\n\nThe main differences between fighter jets and bombers are their size, speed, maneuverability, weapons systems, and mission objectives. Fighter jets are smaller, faster, and more agile than bombers, allowing them to outmaneuver enemy aircraft in dogfights. They are also equipped with advanced weapons and radar systems that enable them to detect and engage enemy aircraft from long distances.\n\nBombers, on the other hand, are larger and slower, making them easier targets for enemy fighters. However, they are designed to carry much larger payloads of bombs and other weapons, enabling them to destroy ground targets from high altitude. They also have long-range capabilities that allow them to fly great distances without refueling, making them ideal for strategic bombing missions.",
