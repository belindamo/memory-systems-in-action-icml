  "content": "As an Oathbreaker Paladin who has turned away from his deity, Azrael Blackwood would likely have defaced his holy symbol, the traditional symbol of Bahamut, as a way to reject his former faith and show his allegiance to the dark deity who promised him power. Here is a potential description of what his defaced holy symbol might look like:\n\nThe once-beautiful holy symbol of Bahamut is now marred and defaced, a testament to Azrael's betrayal of his oath and his deity. The symbol, which was once a shining platinum dragon on a field of blue, is now scratched and tarnished, with chunks of metal missing and deep gouges marring its surface. Where the dragon's eyes once gleamed with the pure light of justice and righteousness, they are now dark and empty, like the soul of the fallen paladin who carries it.\n\nAt the center of the symbol, where the dragon's heart should be, there is now a jagged black gemstone, a symbol of the corruption and darkness that now grips Azrael's soul. The gemstone pulsates with an otherworldly energy, and those who look upon it can feel a sense of unease and discomfort, as if they are being watched by some malevolent force.\n\nDespite its desecration, the holy symbol still carries a powerful magic, albeit one that has been twisted and corrupted by Azrael's betrayal. Those who are attuned to it can still draw upon its power, but doing so comes at a terrible cost, as it deepens the paladin's corruption and brings him ever closer to the darkness that he has chosen to embrace.",
