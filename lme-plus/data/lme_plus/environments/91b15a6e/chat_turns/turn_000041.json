It's possible that you might be thinking of a different theme park or event.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to help you with your question about new rides and attractions at Legoland Windsor! Legoland Windsor regularly updates its attractions and events, so it's always a good idea to check their website or mobile app for the latest information.\n\nSome recent additions and popular attractions at Legoland Windsor include:\n\n1.
