  "content": "Fighter jets are primarily designed for combat scenarios to engage in air-to-air or air-to-ground combat missions. However, some fighter jets can also be used for reconnaissance and surveillance missions, either by carrying specialized equipment or by being modified for a different mission.\n\nFor example, the F-16 Fighting Falcon has been used for reconnaissance missions by carrying a specialized pod called the AN/ASQ-213 HTS (High-Speed Track Sensor system) on its centerline pylon. This pod can detect and track multiple ground targets and is used to gather information about enemy troop movements and tank formations.\n\nLikewise, the F-35 Lightning II, a fifth-generation fighter, is designed to carry out a wide range of missions, including air-to-air combat, air-to-ground operations, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Its advanced sensors and avionics systems make it an ideal platform for gathering intelligence and conducting surveillance missions.\n\nSo, while fighter jets are primarily combat-oriented aircraft, they can be used for ISR missions when equipped with specialized equipment or modified for a different mission.",
