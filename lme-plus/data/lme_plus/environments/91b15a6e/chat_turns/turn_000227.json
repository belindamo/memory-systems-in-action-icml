  "content": "Another war fought by Britain that is often cited as having been fought on a stated reason rather than a pretext is World War II.\n\nIn September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland, Britain and France declared war on Germany, with the aim of defending Poland's sovereignty and preventing further aggression by the Nazi regime. Over the course of the war, Britain played a leading role in the Allied forces, fighting against Germany, Italy, and Japan on multiple fronts.\n\nWhile it is true that Britain had strategic and economic interests at stake in the war, such as defending its own territory and preserving the international order, the stated reason for the war was to stop Nazi aggression and protect the sovereignty of other nations. Britain's participation in World War II is widely seen as a just and necessary response to the threat of fascism and tyranny, rather than a pretext for pursuing its own interests.",
