For your cycling event, you'll want to focus on complex carbohydrates that are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Here are some excellent sources of complex carbohydrates to include in your meals during the 2-3 days leading up to your event:\n\n1. **Whole grains**:\n\t* Brown rice\n\t* Quinoa\n\t* Whole wheat bread\n\t* Whole grain pasta\n\t* Oats\n2. **Fruits**:\n\t* Bananas\n\t* Apples\n\t* Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)\n\t* Dried fruits (dates, apricots, prunes)\n3. **Vegetables**:\n\t* Sweet potatoes\n\t* Carrots\n\t* Broccoli\n\t* Peas\n\t* Corn\n4. **Legumes**:\n\t* Lentils\n\t* Chickpeas\n\t* Black beans\n\t* Kidney beans\n\t* Canned beans (black beans, chickpeas, kidney beans)\n5. **Starchy vegetables**:\n\t* Potatoes\n\t* Yams\n\t* Parsnips\n\t* Turnips\n6. **Other complex carbohydrates**:\n\t* Whole grain cereals (oatmeal, muesli)\n\t* Energy bars (look for ones with whole grains and natural ingredients)\n\t* Dried fruit and nut mixtures\n\nIncorporate these complex carbohydrates into your meals and snacks during the 2-3 days leading up to your cycling event. Aim to increase your carbohydrate intake gradually, rather than trying to consume a massive amount in one sitting.\n\nHere's an example of how you could incorporate these complex carbohydrates into your meals:\n\n**Breakfast**\n\n* Oatmeal with banana and honey\n* Whole grain toast with avocado and scrambled eggs\n\n**Lunch**\n\n* Grilled chicken breast with quinoa and steamed vegetables\n* Whole grain pita with hummus, cucumber, and tomato\n\n**Dinner**\n\n* Grilled salmon with sweet potato and roasted broccoli\n* Lentil soup with whole grain bread and a side salad\n\n**Snacks**\n\n* Apple slices with almond butter\n* Handful of trail mix with nuts and dried fruits\n* Energy bar with whole grains and natural ingredients\n\nRemember to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Aim to increase your carbohydrate intake by about 1-2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day leading up to your event. For example, if you weigh 70 kg, aim to consume an additional 70-140 grams of carbohydrates per day.\n\nBy focusing on complex carbohydrates and increasing your intake gradually, you'll be well-fueled for your cycling event on June 1st!",
