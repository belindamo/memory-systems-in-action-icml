  "content": "I can certainly recommend some popular weathered albums that fans of the band often enjoy. the band has two studio albums, including \"stranger here\" and \"everything all at once.\" \"stranger here\" is often regarded as their breakthrough album, featuring heartfelt and emotive ballads such as \"do you remember\" and \"new normal.\" \"everything all at once\" is a more recent album that showcases the band's growth and evolution towards a more indie-rock sound. it features the standout tracks \"lying in wait\" and \"i'm okay\" mentioned earlier. both albums showcase weathered's talent for creating emotionally-charged and introspective music, and which one you prefer may depend on your personal taste.",
