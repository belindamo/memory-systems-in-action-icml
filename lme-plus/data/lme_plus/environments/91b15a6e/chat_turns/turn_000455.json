  "content": "As the gang is taken in for questioning, they quickly realize that they are in the middle of a much larger conspiracy. Mac's obsession with JFK's death had led him to uncover some classified information that the government will do anything to keep hidden.\n\nDuring the interrogations, Mac is able to prove that JFK's death was not a lone gunman but a result of a larger conspiracy involving the government. The other members of the gang are also able to provide evidence and alibis that clear them of any wrong doing.\n\nDespite this, the government continues to try and silence them, and the gang finds themselves on the run from the law. They use their street smarts and resourcefulness to evade capture, but they know that they can't run forever.\n\nAs they dig deeper into the conspiracy, they discover that it goes all the way to the top, involving high-ranking officials and powerful businessmen. They begin to gather evidence to take down the conspirators but the government sends hitmen to take them out.\n\nThe gang must use all their wit and cunning to survive against the powerful forces that are trying to silence them. They find themselves in a desperate race against time to expose the truth before they are eliminated.\n\nThey finally manage to gather enough evidence and with the help of a honest journalist they are able to reveal the conspiracy to the public and bring down the corrupt officials. But the price they had to pay was high, they lost a member of the gang and they all had to flee the country to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe final scene shows them sitting in a beach bar, in a tropical country, watching the news of the conspiracy being exposed on TV. They raise their glasses in a toast to their fallen friend and to their freedom, but also to the realization that they will never be able to go back home.",
