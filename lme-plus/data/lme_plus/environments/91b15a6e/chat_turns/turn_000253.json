  "content": "Yes, there are fighter jets that can perform bombing missions in addition to their primary role of air-to-air combat. These aircraft are called multirole fighters, and they are designed to carry out a wide range of missions, including close air support, air interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, and air defense suppression.\n\nMultirole fighters can carry a variety of weapons, such as bombs, missiles, and rockets, and they are equipped with advanced avionics and sensors that allow them to locate and attack ground targets with accuracy. Some examples of multirole fighters are the F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, Eurofighter Typhoon, and the Dassault Rafale.\n\nIn recent years, multirole fighters have become increasingly popular as they provide greater mission flexibility and are more cost-effective than dedicated bombers or attack aircraft.",
