  "content": "Yes, as mentioned earlier, some fighter jets can also perform bombing missions in addition to their primary role of air-to-air combat. These multirole fighters are equipped with advanced avionics, sensors, and weapons that allow them to engage ground targets with precision. Multirole fighters can carry a variety of bombs, missiles, and rockets, such as Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), laser-guided bombs, and cluster bombs.\n\nHowever, while multirole fighters can perform bombing missions, they may have some limitations compared to dedicated bombers. Dedicated bombers usually have larger payloads and longer range capabilities for strategic bombing missions. Still, multirole fighters can be an effective and versatile platform for performing both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat missions.\n\nMoreover, fighter jets are often used for close air support (CAS) missions, where they provide support to ground troops by engaging enemy targets with precision. In these missions, fighter jets must be able to identify targets accurately and engage them without harming friendly forces. Their advanced sensors and weapons systems make them ideal for this role as they can provide close-range support to the troops on the ground.",
