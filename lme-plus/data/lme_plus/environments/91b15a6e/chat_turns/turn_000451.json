Frank walks in and joins the group)\n\nFrank: \"What's the topic of discussion today?\"\n\nDennis: \"Mac here thinks JFK died of natural causes.\"\n\nFrank: \"Oh, that old chestnut. I've got a theory. He was killed by a time-traveling alien.\"\n\n(The gang stares at Frank in disbelief)\n\nCharlie: \"Frank, you know that's not true. You were the one who convinced us to invest in the JFK conspiracy theory-themed strip club.\"\n\n(Everyone starts laughing)\n\nMac: \"I'm telling you, there's more to the story. And I have the evidence to prove it.\"\n\n(Mac pulls out a stack of conspiracy theory books and begins to read from one)\n\nDennis: \"Oh please, you're just reading from some crackpot's website.\"\n\nMac: \"This is from the Smithsonian, you moron!\"\n\n(The argument escalates with the gang getting increasingly confused and frustrated)\n\nCharlie: \"Wait a minute, JFK died in the 60s, right? So why does it even matter now?\"\n\nFrank: \"Yeah, Mac, you're like the Nightman of conspiracy theories, always singing the same song.\"\n\n(Mac glares at Frank)\n\nDennis: \"Exactly! It doesn't matter, let's just drop it.\"\n\nMac: \"I'll drop it when the truth is finally told!\"\n\n(The scene ends with the gang shaking their heads and continuing to drink and make fun of Mac)",
