  "content": "Fighter jets and bombers have different design priorities, so their speed and radar-evading capabilities vary based on their mission requirements.\n\nGenerally, fighter jets are smaller and more maneuverable than bombers, so they can fly faster and more agile in many cases. However, bombers like the B-2 Spirit can still fly at high speeds and altitude, making them difficult to detect and intercept.\n\nWhen it comes to radar-evading capabilities, both fighters and bombers have advanced technology to reduce their radar signatures or radar cross-section (RCS). Fighter jets like the F-35 Lightning II, for instance, have stealth capabilities and can evade enemy radar systems effectively. Moreover, the use of composite materials, specialized paints, and radar-absorbent materials (RAMs) makes them less visible to radar.\n\nBombers, on the other hand, have been designed with stealth technology in mind, such as the B-2 Spirit, which has a low RCS due to its angular shape, composite materials, and specialized surfaces. Some bombers, like the B-52 Stratofortress, also use electronic countermeasures systems to jam enemy radar systems.\n\nIn summary, both fighters and bombers have advanced technology to reduce their radar signature and increase their survivability in combat situations. However, their specific capabilities vary based on their mission requirements and design priorities.",
