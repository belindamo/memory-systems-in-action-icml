  "content": "I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. however, it can be argued that it is both easier and harder for new artists to break into the scene now that everything is online.\n\non the one hand, streaming platforms have made it possible for anyone to upload their music and potentially gain a following, so it has never been easier to get your music out there. social media also provides a powerful tool for new artists to engage with fans and promote their music.\n\non the other hand, the sheer volume of music on streaming platforms make it harder for new artists to stand out and get noticed. it can also be difficult to make an income in the early stages of a music career, as streaming revenue can be low and artists need to invest in promoting their music across social media, advertising, and other platforms. \n\noverall, while there are both advantages and disadvantages of the changing music industry, new artists should focus on creating great content, engaging with fans, and leveraging all available resources to build their careers.",
