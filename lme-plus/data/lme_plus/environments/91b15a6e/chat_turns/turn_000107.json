He is a master of manipulation and intimidation, using his charisma and natural charm to get what he wants. He is not afraid to use force, either, and will not hesitate to strike down anyone who gets in his way.\n\nDespite his evil alignment, Azrael is not reckless or impulsive. He is a patient and calculating individual who carefully plans his actions and considers all angles before making a move.
