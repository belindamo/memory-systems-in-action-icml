My live streams are usually around 30 minutes to an hour long. I've been thinking of doing a live cooking stream with a special guest, maybe a fellow streamer or a chef. I've also been considering doing a live Q&A session where I answer questions about my favorite recipes and cooking tips. Oh, and I just realized I started live streaming on YouTube about three weeks ago, and I've been going live almost every other day since then!"
