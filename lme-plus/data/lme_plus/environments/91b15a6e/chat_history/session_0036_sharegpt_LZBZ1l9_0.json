      "content": "The Continental Congress of 1787 was a pivotal moment in American history. After years of struggle under the Articles of Confederation, the states sent delegates to Philadelphia to draft a new constitution that would provide a more stable and effective form of government. The delegates debated and negotiated for months, addressing issues such as representation, taxation, and the balance of power between the states and the federal government. Eventually, they produced a document that would become the cornerstone of American democracy, and which has endured for over two centuries. On September 17, 1787, the delegates signed the Constitution, and it was sent to the states for ratification. It would take several years for all the states to approve it, but in the end, the Constitution became the foundation of the United States of America."
