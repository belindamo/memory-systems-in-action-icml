      "content": "As an Oathbreaker Paladin who has turned away from the teachings of his order, Azrael Blackwood has rejected the deity he once worshiped and abandoned his oath. It is not uncommon for Paladins to fall from grace and become Oathbreakers, often as a result of a personal crisis or a traumatic event that causes them to question their faith.\n\nIn Azrael's case, his betrayal of Bahamut may have been due to a number of factors, such as a perceived injustice or a personal ambition that conflicted with the tenets of his order. Perhaps he witnessed an event that made him question the benevolence of his deity, or he may have become disillusioned with the corruption and hypocrisy within his order.\n\nAnother possibility is that Azrael was seduced by the promises of power and influence offered by a darker force, such as a powerful demon or a cult that worshiped an evil deity. This temptation may have been too great for him to resist, leading him down a path of corruption and evil.\n\nRegardless of the specific circumstances, Azrael's decision to betray Bahamut would have had significant consequences for his personal journey and the world around him. He would have lost his divine powers and the favor of his deity, and he would have become an outcast among his former allies and comrades."

      "content": "As an Oathbreaker Paladin who has turned away from his deity, Azrael Blackwood would likely have defaced his holy symbol, the traditional symbol of Bahamut, as a way to reject his former faith and show his allegiance to the dark deity who promised him power. Here is a potential description of what his defaced holy symbol might look like:\n\nThe once-beautiful holy symbol of Bahamut is now marred and defaced, a testament to Azrael's betrayal of his oath and his deity. The symbol, which was once a shining platinum dragon on a field of blue, is now scratched and tarnished, with chunks of metal missing and deep gouges marring its surface. Where the dragon's eyes once gleamed with the pure light of justice and righteousness, they are now dark and empty, like the soul of the fallen paladin who carries it.\n\nAt the center of the symbol, where the dragon's heart should be, there is now a jagged black gemstone, a symbol of the corruption and darkness that now grips Azrael's soul. The gemstone pulsates with an otherworldly energy, and those who look upon it can feel a sense of unease and discomfort, as if they are being watched by some malevolent force.\n\nDespite its desecration, the holy symbol still carries a powerful magic, albeit one that has been twisted and corrupted by Azrael's betrayal. Those who are attuned to it can still draw upon its power, but doing so comes at a terrible cost, as it deepens the paladin's corruption and brings him ever closer to the darkness that he has chosen to embrace."

He stands at around 6 feet tall, with a muscular build and broad shoulders. He has short black hair and piercing blue eyes, which are now clouded with a hint of malevolence and darkness.\n\nHis armor is dark and menacing, with jagged spikes protruding from the shoulders and gauntlets. The armor is adorned with sinister motifs, including skulls and serpents, and bears the symbol of the dark deity that he now serves. The armor is battle-worn and bears the scars of many battles, reflecting the dark path that Azrael has chosen.\n\nIn his hand, Azrael wields a blackened longsword, which is imbued with dark magic and can drain the life force of his enemies. His stance is aggressive and confident, reflecting his newfound power and influence. Despite his fall from grace, there is still a sense of nobility and righteousness about him, a vestige of the paladin he once was. The image should convey a sense of danger and malevolence, while still hinting at the character's tragic past and inner struggle."
