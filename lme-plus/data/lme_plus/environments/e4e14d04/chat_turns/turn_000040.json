Since you were at Sundance, I'll suggest a mix of films that premiered at Sundance and other festivals. Here are a few:\n\n**Sundance Premieres:**\n\n1. **The Farewell** (dir. Lulu Wang) - A heartwarming comedy-drama about a Chinese-American woman who returns to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother, without telling her the true reason for the visit.\n2. **Honeyland** (dirs. Tamara Kotevska, Ljubomir Stefanov) - A stunning documentary that follows the life of a beekeeper in North Macedonia, exploring themes of environmentalism, tradition, and community.\n3. **The Last Black Man in San Francisco** (dir. Joe Talbot) - A poignant and visually stunning drama about a young black man's quest to reclaim his family's home in a rapidly gentrifying San Francisco.\n\n**Other Festival Favorites:**\n\n1. **Parasite** (dir. Bong Joon-ho) - A darkly comedic thriller that won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, exploring class struggle and social inequality in South Korea. (You might have seen this one, but it's a must-mention!)\n2. **The Lighthouse** (dir. Robert Eggers) - A psychological horror drama set in 1890s Maine, starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as two lighthouse keepers descending into madness.\n3. **High Life** (dir. Claire Denis) - A thought-provoking sci-fi drama about a group of prisoners on a mission to explore a black hole, featuring a critically acclaimed performance from Robert Pattinson.\n4. **The Souvenir** (dir. Joanna Hogg) - A semi-autobiographical drama about a film student's complicated relationship with her boyfriend, set in 1980s London.\n5. **Atlantics** (dir. Mati Diop) - A haunting and romantic drama about a young woman's supernatural experience in Dakar, Senegal, which won the Grand Prix at Cannes.\n\nThese films have received critical acclaim and have been praised for their unique storytelling, cinematography, and performances. I hope you enjoy exploring these hidden gems!",
