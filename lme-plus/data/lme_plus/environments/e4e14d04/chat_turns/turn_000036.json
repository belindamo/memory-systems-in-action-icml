(carefully removing the soiled diaper, overalls, and shirt)\n\nDaughter: (whining) I don't want to take these off, they're my favorite!\n\nMother: I know, honey, but they're all dirty now. We need to get you into some clean clothes.\n\nMother: (putting the dirty diaper and wipes in the toilet) Alright, let's get this over with.\n\nDaughter: (peering into the toilet, interested) Wow, look at all that stuff, Mama!\n\nMother: (sitting down on the toilet, taking care of her #1 and #2, wiping herself clean)\n\nDaughter: (excitedly) Can I flush it, Mama? Can I?\n\nMother: (smiling) Sure, honey. You can flush it.\n\nDaughter: (proudly pressing the handle) Bye bye, yucky stuff!\n\nMother: (flushing the shirt)\n\nDaughter: (mildly protesting as she watches her overalls go into the toilet) No, Mama, not my overalls!\n\nMother: I'm sorry, honey, but we can't keep them either. They're covered in the same yucky stuff. We need to flush them away so we can finish cleaning up and get you into your fresh outfit.\n\nDaughter: (pouting as she watches her overalls disappear down the drain) Bye bye, overalls. I'll miss you too.\n\nMother: (flushing the overalls)\n\nMother: (putting a new diaper on the daughter and helping her into a fresh outfit) There you go, all clean and fresh.\n\nDaughter: (excitedly looking at her new yellow sundress with white flowers and matching sandals) Yay, I love this dress!\n\nMother: (finishing cleaning up the bathroom) That's better.\n\nMother: (grateful for the extra set of clothes she had packed in the diaper bag) Thank goodness for that extra outfit.\n\nDaughter: (happy to be feeling fresh and clean again) I feel so much better now.\n\nMother: (relieved that everything had been successfully flushed away without any problems) Phew, that was a close one. Let's not have any more diaper blowouts for a while, okay?\n\nDaughter: (nodding) Okay, Mama. I'll be more careful.",
