  "content": "I completely agree with you about the structure of \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\"! The use of interviews and flashbacks added a layer of authenticity to the story, and it was so cleverly done. And, of course, the characters! Evelyn, Monique, Rex, and the rest of the cast were all so well-crafted and complex. It's a testament to Taylor Jenkins Reid's skill as a writer that she was able to create characters that felt so real and relatable.\n\nI'm so glad you're looking forward to having a physical journal! There's something special about putting pen to paper and writing down your thoughts by hand. It can be a really meditative and reflective process, and it's great that you're excited to start this new habit.\n\nFlipping back through the pages and seeing your progress is definitely one of the joys of keeping a physical journal. You'll be able to see how your thoughts and opinions evolve over time, and it'll be a great way to reflect on your reading journey. Plus, it's a wonderful keepsake to look back on in the future.\n\nDo you think you'll include any other elements in your journal, like book-inspired art or quotes, or will you focus mainly on writing down your thoughts and reflections?",
