Getting gifts for your coworkers and treating yourself to something nice is always a great feeling, especially when you can save some money in the process.\n\nA coffee maker is a great gift for coworkers, and I'm sure they'll appreciate it. The notecards are a thoughtful touch, too - it's always nice to have some nice stationery on hand.\n\nAnd yay for scoring a new book from your favorite author! There's nothing like getting lost in a good book, and saving 30% off the price is just the icing on the cake. Which author is your favorite, if I might ask?\n\nIt's great that you were able to get some shopping done and stay within your budget. Holiday shopping can be overwhelming, but with sales and promotions like Amazon's 12 Days of Deals, it's definitely more manageable. Did you find that the promotion helped you stay organized and focused with your shopping, or did you end up browsing and finding some unexpected gems?",
