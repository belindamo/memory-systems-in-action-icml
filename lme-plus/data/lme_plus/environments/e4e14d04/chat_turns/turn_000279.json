  "content": "Yes, there are contribution limits for both Roth and Traditional IRAs, and these limits can change year-to-year. For the tax year 2021, the contribution limit for both Roth and Traditional IRAs is $6,000, or $7,000 for individuals who are age 50 or older. It's important to note that these contribution limits apply to the total amount you can contribute across all IRA accounts, so if you have both a Roth and Traditional IRA, the combined total of your contributions cannot exceed the annual limit. Additionally, the contribution limits may vary depending on your income and tax filing status. For example, for tax year 2021, the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA begins to phase out for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $125,000 or more, and completely phases out at $140,000 for single filers. For married couples filing jointly, the phase-out range is between $198,000 and $208,000. It's important to keep up with these limits and any changes to them, so you can make informed decisions about how much to contribute to your retirement savings each year.",
