  "content": "If you have 100+ features in your dataframe, and you use the `shift()` function to create new columns for the values at time `t+1`, your dataframe will indeed become quite large. This can make it more difficult and computationally expensive to train your model.\n\nOne way to address this problem is to only include the most relevant features in your dataframe when you train your model. You can use feature selection methods to identify the features that have the most predictive power, and then only include those features in your dataframe. This will reduce the size of your dataframe and make it more efficient to train your model.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use feature selection to select the most relevant features and train your model using those features:\n```\n# use feature selection to identify the most relevant features\nselected_features = feature_selection.select(df)\n\n# create a new dataframe with only the selected features\nselected_df = df[selected_features]\n\n# train your model using the selected features dataframe\nmodel.train(selected_df)\n```\nNote that the specific steps you need to take will depend on the details of your data and your model. This is just one example of how you could approach this problem.",
