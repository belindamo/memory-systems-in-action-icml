  "content": "I'm glad you're interested in my book! My favorite author is actually a mystery writer, and I've been following her series for years. I was thrilled to see her latest release was part of the 12 Days of Deals promotion, so I snapped it up right away.\n\nAs for staying organized, I have to say that the promotion did help me stay focused on what I needed to get. I had a list of people I needed to buy for, and I was able to check off a few gifts during the sale. Of course, I did end up browsing a bit and finding some other things I wanted, but overall, I think the promotion helped me stay on track and avoid impulse buys. Plus, it was nice to have some extra time to think about my purchases and make sure I was getting the best deals.",
