  "content": "To use the information from `return_t+1` to improve the prediction of `return_t+3`, you will need to create a new feature in your dataframe that includes the `return_t+1` value. Then you can train your model using this new feature and see if it improves the prediction of `return_t+3`.\n\nHere is one way you could do this:\n\n1. Create a new column in your dataframe called `return_t+1`.\n2. Copy the values from the `return_t+1` target column into the new `return_t+1` feature column.\n3. Use the `pandas` `drop()` method to remove the `return_t+1` target column from your dataframe.\n4. Train your model using the updated dataframe with the new `return_t+1` feature.\n\nHere is an example of how you could implement these steps:\n```\n# create a new column in the dataframe called 'return_t+1'\ndf['return_t+1'] = df['return_t+1']\n\n# remove the 'return_t+1' target column\ndf = df.drop('return_t+1', axis=1)\n\n# train your model using the updated dataframe\nmodel.train(df)\n```\nNote that the specific steps you need to take will depend on the details of your data and your model. This is just one example of how you could approach this problem.",
