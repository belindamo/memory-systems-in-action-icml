  "content": "I loved Evelyn's story! I think my favorite part of the book was the way the story was structured, with the interviews and the flashbacks. It added a layer of depth to the narrative and made it feel more realistic. And, of course, the characters! Evelyn herself, but also Monique and Rex and all the rest. They were so well-written and complex.\n\nAs for the Notes app, it was okay, but I'm definitely looking forward to having a physical journal. There's something about writing down my thoughts by hand that feels more intimate and personal. Plus, I like being able to flip back through the pages and see my progress. The Notes app was just a temporary solution because I didn't have a dedicated journal at the time.",
