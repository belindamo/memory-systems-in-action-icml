  "content": "I'm excited to try out the homemade marinara sauce recipe. I've been experimenting with different types of vegan protein sources, including tofu, tempeh, and seitan, and I think the tofu meatballs will pair well with the sauce. Can you give me some recommendations for a good vegan mozzarella cheese alternative to go with my lasagna? I've been using cashew cream and nutritional yeast to make vegan cheese sauces, but I'm not sure what to use for a melted mozzarella substitute.",
