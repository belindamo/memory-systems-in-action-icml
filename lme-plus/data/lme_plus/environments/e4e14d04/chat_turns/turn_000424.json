  "content": "I think I'll start with \"The Lincoln Lawyer\" and see how I like it. I've heard great things about Michael Connelly's writing style, and I'm curious to see how he develops Mickey Haller's character. By the way, do you have any recommendations for book clubs or online forums where I can discuss the book with other readers? I just attended a meetup organized by a group last week where we discussed the latest bestseller by John Grisham, and it was so much fun debating the plot twists and characters with fellow book lovers.",
