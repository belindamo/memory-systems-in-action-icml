  "content": "The Fleece Tie Blanket pattern is a wonderful choice for charity blankets, and choosing the right fleece fabric is crucial for a cozy and durable blanket. Here are some tips to help you select the perfect fleece fabric for your project:\n\n**1. **Softness**: Fleece blankets are all about comfort, so choose a fleece fabric that's soft to the touch. Look for fleece with a high-quality, plush pile that will provide warmth and comfort.\n\n**2. **Thickness**: A thicker fleece fabric will provide better insulation and warmth, but it may be more difficult to work with. A medium-weight fleece (around 200-250gsm) is a good balance between warmth and ease of use.\n\n**3. **Material**: Fleece can be made from various materials, including polyester, cotton, or blends. Polyester fleece is a popular choice for charity blankets because it's easy to care for, durable, and affordable. Cotton fleece is a good option if you want a more natural fiber.\n\n**4. **Color and Pattern**: Choose a color and pattern that will appeal to the recipients of the blankets. Solid colors, stripes, and simple patterns are often preferred for charity blankets. Avoid bright or bold patterns that may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n**5. **Quality**: Look for fleece fabric with a high-quality construction, such as a dense, even pile and a smooth, consistent texture. Avoid fleece with pilling, fraying, or loose threads.\n\n**6. **Shrinkage**: Fleece fabric can shrink in the wash, so make sure to choose a fabric that's been pre-shrunk or has a low shrinkage rate. This will ensure that your blanket remains the same size and shape after washing.\n\n**7. **Price**: Charity blankets are often made on a budget, so consider the cost of the fleece fabric. Look for affordable options without compromising on quality.\n\n**Recommended Fleece Fabrics:**\n\n* **Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores**: Offers a range of fleece fabrics, including soft, plush options like their \"Soft & Cozy\" fleece.\n* **Hobby Lobby**: Carries a variety of fleece fabrics, including polyester and cotton blends, at affordable prices.\n* **Craftsy**: Sells a range of fleece fabrics, including some affordable options perfect for charity blankets.\n\n**Tips for Working with Fleece:**\n\n* Use a sharp scissors or rotary cutter to cut fleece, as it can be prone to fraying.\n* Press the fleece fabric before cutting to remove any wrinkles and make it easier to work with.\n* Use a walking foot or Teflon foot on your sewing machine to help guide the fleece fabric and prevent bunching.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to choose the perfect fleece fabric for your charity blankets. Remember to have fun and enjoy the process of creating something warm and cozy for those in need!",
