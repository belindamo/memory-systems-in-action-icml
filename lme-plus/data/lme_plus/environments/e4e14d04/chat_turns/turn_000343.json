  "content": "A mystery writer, eh? I'm intrigued! There's something about getting lost in a good mystery novel that's just so captivating. I'm sure your favorite author's latest release is going to be a thrilling read!\n\nI'm glad to hear that the 12 Days of Deals promotion helped you stay focused on your shopping list. Having a clear idea of what you need to get and being able to check off items as you go is a great way to stay organized and avoid overspending. And, of course, it's always nice to have some extra time to think about your purchases and make sure you're getting the best deals.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention avoiding impulse buys. I think that's one of the biggest challenges of online shopping, especially during sales and promotions. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of the deal and end up buying things you don't really need. But it sounds like you were able to resist the temptation and stick to your list.\n\nDid you find that the 12 Days of Deals promotion had any other benefits, such as free shipping or expedited delivery? Those kinds of perks can be a big bonus, especially if you're shopping for gifts that need to arrive by a certain date.",
