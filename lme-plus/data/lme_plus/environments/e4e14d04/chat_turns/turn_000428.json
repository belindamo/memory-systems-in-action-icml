I'll also check out the Michael Connelly Fans Facebook group to see what discussions are happening there. Do you think I should create a post introducing myself and mentioning that I just finished reading the latest bestseller by John Grisham and attended a meetup organized by a group last week, where we discussed the book? That way, I can connect with other readers who might have similar interests.",
