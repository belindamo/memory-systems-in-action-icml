  "content": "Yeah, my parents definitely faced some of those challenges. They've told me about how hard it was to adjust to the new culture and language, and how they had to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet. But they've also shared some really positive experiences, like how they found a sense of community with other Indian immigrants and how they were able to build a new life for themselves here. I'm really interested in learning more about the Indian American community during the 1980s. Can you tell me more about that?",
