(carefully removing the soiled diaper, overalls, and shirt)\n\nDaughter: (whining) I don't want to take these off, they're my favorite!\n\nMother: I know, honey, but they're all dirty now. We need to get you into some clean clothes.\n\nMother: (putting the dirty diaper and wipes in the toilet) Alright, let's get this over with.\n\nDaughter: (mildly protesting as she watches her shirt go into the toilet) No, Mama, not my shirt!\n\nMother: I'm sorry, sweetie, but we can't keep it. It's covered in yucky stuff from the diaper. We need to flush it away so we can clean up and get you into some fresh clothes.\n\nDaughter: (pouting) But I like my shirt, Mama.\n\nMother: I know, honey, but it's not clean anymore. We need to say goodbye to it so we can get you into some fresh clothes and feel all clean and happy again.\n\nDaughter: (reluctantly) Bye bye, shirt. (waving)\n\nMother: (flushing the shirt)\n\nDaughter: (mildly protesting as she watches her overalls go into the toilet) No, Mama, not my overalls!\n\nMother: I'm sorry, honey, but we can't keep them either. They're covered in the same yucky stuff. We need to flush them away so we can finish cleaning up and get you into your fresh outfit.\n\nDaughter: (pouting as she watches her overalls disappear down the drain) Bye bye, overalls. I'll miss you too.\n\nMother: (flushing the overalls)\n\nMother: (putting a new diaper on the daughter and helping her into a fresh outfit) There you go, all clean and fresh.\n\nDaughter: (excitedly looking at her new yellow sundress with white flowers and matching sandals) Yay, I love this dress!\n\nMother: (finishing cleaning up the bathroom) That's better.\n\nMother: (grateful for the extra set of clothes she had packed in the diaper bag) Thank goodness for that",
