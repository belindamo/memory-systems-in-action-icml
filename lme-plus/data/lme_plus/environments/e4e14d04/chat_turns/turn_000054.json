However, based on data from online sources such as Glassdoor, Indeed, and LinkedIn, here are some approximate average salary ranges for software engineers in the Bay Area:\n\n* Junior Software Engineer (0-3 years of experience): $120,000 - $150,000 per year\n* Mid-level Software Engineer (4-7 years of experience): $150,000 - $200,000 per year\n* Senior Software Engineer (8-12 years of experience): $200,000 - $250,000 per year\n* Lead/Principal Software Engineer (13+ years of experience): $250,000 - $350,000 per year\n\nKeep in mind that these are general estimates and can vary widely depending on the specific company, industry, and other factors.
