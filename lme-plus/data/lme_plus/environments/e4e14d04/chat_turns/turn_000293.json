  "content": "The Ring Stick Up Cam can be used to monitor your garage door, but it's not the most ideal solution for receiving alerts if the garage door is left open. Here's why:\n\n**Motion Detection:**\n\nThe Ring Stick Up Cam has motion detection capabilities, which means it can detect movement within its field of view. However, it's not specifically designed to detect the status of your garage door (open or closed). If you mount the camera to monitor your garage door, it may not consistently detect the door's status, especially if the door is partially open or closed.\n\n**False Alerts:**\n\nYou might receive false alerts due to various reasons, such as:\n\n* Animals or pets triggering the motion detection\n* Shadows or reflections causing false motion alerts\n* Wind or weather conditions affecting the camera's motion detection\n\n**Garage Door Sensors:**\n\nA more effective way to monitor your garage door and receive alerts if it's left open is to use a garage door sensor. These sensors are specifically designed to detect the door's status and can be integrated with smart home systems or security cameras.\n\nRing offers a separate product called the Ring Garage Door Controller, which is a sensor that attaches to your garage door and tracks its status. It integrates with the Ring app, allowing you to receive notifications if your garage door is left open. However, this is a separate device from the Ring Stick Up Cam.\n\n**Workaround:**\n\nIf you still want to use the Ring Stick Up Cam to monitor your garage door, you can try the following workaround:\n\n1. Mount the camera to capture a clear view of the garage door.\n2. Set up a custom motion zone around the garage door area.\n3. Adjust the motion sensitivity to reduce false alerts.\n4. Use the Ring app to receive motion notifications, and then check the live feed to see if the garage door is open or closed.\n\nKeep in mind that this method is not foolproof and may still result in false alerts or missed notifications.\n\nIn summary, while the Ring Stick Up Cam can be used to monitor your garage door, it's not the most reliable solution for receiving alerts if the door is left open. Consider using a dedicated garage door sensor or the Ring Garage Door Controller for more accurate and reliable notifications.",
