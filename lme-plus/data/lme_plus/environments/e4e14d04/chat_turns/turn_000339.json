  "content": "That's a great idea! A gourmet coffee selection is a perfect fit for a gourmet food basket, and it allows you to offer a variety of flavors and brands. Your coworkers will appreciate the thought and effort you put into curating a selection of specialty coffees.\n\nAnd yay for scoring some great deals during Amazon's 12 Days of Deals promotion! Those types of events can be a great way to save money on gifts and household items. Amazon always offers some amazing discounts during their holiday promotions, and it's smart of you to take advantage of them.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what were some of the best deals you scored during the 12 Days of Deals promotion? Were there any particular categories or products that you were looking for?\n\n(By the way, I'm glad I could help you with your gift ideas and questions.
