  "content": "That is correct. When you are making predictions at time `t`, you will not have the `return_t+1` data yet, because it will only be available at time `t+1`.\n\nIn this case, you can still use the `return_t+1` data to improve your predictions, but you will need to do it in two steps. First, you will make a prediction of the `return_t+3` value using the available data at time `t`. Then, when the `return_t+1` data becomes available at time `t+1`, you can use that data to update your prediction of the `return_t+3` value.\n\nHere is one way you could do this:\n\n1. At time `t`, make a prediction of the `return_t+3` value using the available data (features `a`, `b`, and `c`).\n2. At time `t+1`, update your prediction of the `return_t+3` value using the `return_t+1` data.\n\nYou can do this by first creating a new feature in your dataframe that includes the `return_t+1` values, and then using that feature to train a new model. This new model can be used to update your prediction of the `return_t+3` value using the information from the `return_t+1` data.\n\nHere is an example of how you could implement these steps:\n```\n# make a prediction of the 'return_t+3' value using the available data at time 't'\nprediction = model.predict(df)\n\n# at time 't+1', create a new feature in the dataframe that includes the 'return_t+1' values\ndf['return_t+1'] = df['return_t+1']\n\n# train a new model using the updated dataframe with the new 'return_t+1' feature\nupdated_model = model.train(df)\n\n# use the updated model to update your prediction of the 'return_t+3' value\nupdated_prediction = updated_model.predict(df)\n```\nNote that the specific steps you need to take will depend on the details of your data and your model. This is just one example of how you could approach this problem.",
