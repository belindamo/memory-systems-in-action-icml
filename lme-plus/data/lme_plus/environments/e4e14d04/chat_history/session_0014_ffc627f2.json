      "content": "\"The Song of Achilles\" is an amazing book! If you're looking for more mythology-inspired books, I've got some fantastic recommendations for you. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Circe** by Madeline Miller: Another beautifully written novel by the same author as \"The Song of Achilles\". This one retells the story of Circe, the witch from Homer's \"The Odyssey\".\n2. **The Silence of the Girls** by Pat Barker: A retelling of the Trojan War from the perspective of Briseis, a Trojan princess who becomes a concubine to Achilles. It's a powerful and thought-provoking novel that explores the experiences of women in war.\n3. **The Penelopiad** by Margaret Atwood: A novella that retells Homer's \"The Odyssey\" from the perspective of Penelope, Odysseus's wife. It's a witty and clever reimagining of the classic tale.\n4. **The Women of Troy** by Pat Barker: The sequel to \"The Silence of the Girls\", this novel continues the story of Briseis and the women of Troy as they navigate the aftermath of the war.\n5. **The Heroes of Olympus** series by Rick Riordan: If you're looking for a more YA-oriented series, Riordan's books are a great blend of mythology and adventure. This series is a continuation of his Percy Jackson series, but can be read as a standalone.\n6. **The Golem and the Jinni** by Helene Wecker: While not strictly mythology-inspired, this novel draws heavily from Jewish and Middle Eastern mythological traditions. It's a beautifully written tale of a golem and a jinni living in early 20th-century New York City.\n7. **The Buried Giant** by Kazuo Ishiguro: A novel set in post-Arthurian England, exploring the intersection of myth and reality. It's a haunting and thought-provoking read.\n8. **The Odyssey** by Gareth Hinds: If you're interested in a graphic novel adaptation of Homer's classic epic, Hinds' version is a stunning and engaging retelling.\n9. **Lore Olympus** by Rachel Smythe: A webcomic that reimagines Greek mythology in a modern setting, with a focus on the gods and goddesses as complex, relatable characters.\n10. **The Myths of Greece and Rome** by Michael Grant: If you're interested in delving deeper into the original myths themselves, Grant's collection is a comprehensive and engaging retelling of the classic stories.\n\nI hope you find something that piques your interest in this list!"

It added a layer of depth to the narrative and made it feel more realistic. And, of course, the characters! Evelyn herself, but also Monique and Rex and all the rest. They were so well-written and complex.\n\nAs for the Notes app, it was okay, but I'm definitely looking forward to having a physical journal. There's something about writing down my thoughts by hand that feels more intimate and personal. Plus, I like being able to flip back through the pages and see my progress. The Notes app was just a temporary solution because I didn't have a dedicated journal at the time."
