The Aurora, a deep-space vessel constructed by the Alterra Corporation, has been sent to a system at the outer reaches of known space on its maiden voyage under the pretenses of constructing high-speed space travel infrastructure. Unknown to the crew is that the ship was also sent to the system to search for and, possibly, rescue the crew of a ship named the Degasi, which crashed on planet 4546B ten years prior. As the Aurora does a gravity slingshot around 4546B, it is attacked by a mysterious energy-pulse and crashes on the planet. Several crew members manage to eject from the ship in escape pods, but only the player character\u2014non-essential systems maintenance chief Ryley Robinson\u2014survives.\n\nDuring this time, Ryley repairs the radio in his lifepod and gets messages through it from a trading ship called Sunbeam, led by Captain Avery Quinn. Quinn talks to Ryley and states that Sunbeam is on the far side of Andromeda but promises to take Ryley home, telling him that they will pick him up upon landing on a location Mountain Island. As the Sunbeam flies down, a giant alien facility fires upon it and it explodes in mid-air as Ryley watches. If the player manages to disable the facility before the Sunbeam lands, Quinn tells Ryley they are unable to land due to a debris field and will instead inform Alterra Corporation of the situation.\n\nRyley finds records of the Degasi's crew stating that only three survived the initial crash, but later two out of the three are confirmed dead and one is presumed dead. Ryley also learns of the existence of the 'Precursors', an ancient, advanced alien species that came to planet 4546B approximately one thousand years ago in search of a cure for a highly infectious disease, known as the Kharaa Bacterium. The Precursors discovered Kharaa during the exploration of an unknown planet, and the disease spread due to a failure in quarantine procedures, killing over 140 billion individuals. Investigating thousands of planets in an attempt to find a cure, the Precursors eventually located a species of organism on 4546B they named the Sea Emperor Leviathan, which produced an enzyme that could cure Kharaa. However, the only living Sea Emperor was too old to produce the enzyme in enough potency to have any effect, and the Precursors were unable to force its only eggs to hatch. In an attempt to investigate the egg-hatching process of the Sea Emperor, the Precursors took the egg of a related Leviathan, the fire-breathing Sea Dragon, but the mother destroyed a Precursor research facility and released samples of Kharaa into the planet's ecosystem. Forced to evacuate, the Precursors enabled a facility known as the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, which consists of a large weapon that fires on any ships attempting to leave or land on the planet \u2014 including the Degasi, Aurora and Sunbeam.\n\nThe Sea Emperor, which seeks the freedom of her children, communicates telepathically with Ryley and helps him discover the prison in which she is held captive. She gives Ryley information on how to hatch her eggs, who does so and is cured by the enzyme produced by the juvenile Sea Emperors. Ryley then disables the Quarantine Enforcement Platform (only achievable by one not infected with Kharaa) and constructs a rocket with blueprints transmitted by Alterra Corporation to the crashed Aurora. After escaping the planet, the Sea Emperor communicates with Ryley a final time, promising that the two \"go together\" although they are different."

      "content": "It's difficult to determine an exact number of minutes of video time that can be obtained from a given amount of words since it can vary depending on the pace of the video and the content being covered. However, a rough estimate for a video narration of this text would be around 4-5 minutes."

      "content": "There are a few ways you could make a video based on this text longer than 10 minutes:\n\n1. Add more details: You could expand on the story of Subnautica by including more information about the characters, their motivations, and the world they inhabit. This could help to create a richer and more immersive narrative that viewers will be interested in watching for longer periods of time.\n2. Include gameplay footage: If you are making a video about the game Subnautica, you could include gameplay footage of your own experiences playing the game. This would allow you to show off different aspects of the game and provide context for the story being told in the narration.\n3. Analyze the themes: You could take a more analytical approach to the story of Subnautica by exploring the themes and ideas that the game touches on. For example, you could talk about the dangers of unchecked corporate greed or the consequences of interfering with natural ecosystems.\n4. Include interviews: If possible, you could interview people involved with the development of Subnautica or experts in fields related to the game's themes. This could provide additional insights and perspectives that would make the video more engaging and informative.\n\nBy incorporating some or all of these elements, you could create a video that is longer than 10 minutes and provides a deeper exploration of the world and story of Subnautica."
