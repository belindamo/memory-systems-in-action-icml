If you're the type of player who enjoys replaying games to uncover all their secrets, buying it now might be worth it.\n3. **New game, new experience**: As a relatively new game, Resident Evil Village still has a strong online community and active discussion surrounding it. Buying it now allows you to join the conversation and experience the game alongside others.\n\n**Reasons to wait for a sale:**\n\n1. **Price**: Resident Evil Village is a AAA title, and its current price might be steep for some budgets.

Waiting for a sale might give you access to more content, potentially making the game feel more complete.\n3. **Other games to prioritize**: If you have a backlog of games or other titles you're eager to play, waiting for a sale might allow you to prioritize those games first and come back to Resident Evil Village when the price is more appealing.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether or not to buy Resident Evil Village now or wait for a sale. If you're excited about the game and want to experience it as soon as possible, buying it now might be the best option.
