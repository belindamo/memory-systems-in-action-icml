      "content": "Yes, you can search Google for files with specific extensions such as .exe or .msi. You can do this by using advanced search operators.\n\nTo search for files with a specific extension, enter the following into the Google search bar:\n```makefile\nsite:example.com filetype:exe\n```\nIn this example, replace \"example.com\" with the website you want to search and \"exe\" with the file extension you are looking for. This will return all files with the .exe extension on the specified website.\n\nYou can also search for multiple file types at once by separating them with the OR operator. For example:\n```makefile\nsite:example.com filetype:exe OR filetype:msi\n```\nThis will return all files with either the .exe or .msi extension on the specified website."

You can modify the phrase to better fit your specific search, such as searching for specific domain names or email formats.\n\nSo the full search query would be:\n```vbnet\nfiletype:xls OR filetype:xlsx OR filetype:ods \"email address\" OR \"e-mail address\"\n```\nThis should return spreadsheets that contain email addresses in them."
