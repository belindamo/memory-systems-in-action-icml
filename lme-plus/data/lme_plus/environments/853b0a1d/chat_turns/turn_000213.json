  "content": "As a student who has always been passionate about solving problems, I am excited to pursue a degree in computer science. I have prepared for my intended major through both classroom and real-world experience, and I am ready to succeed in upper-division courses once I enroll at the university.\n\nThroughout high school, I took AP Computer Science and six community college courses in computer science. In addition to this, I gained experience in mobile development through an internship, and I learned several frameworks through extra-curricular projects. I have also participated in four hackathons, and my team recently became a finalist in the Google Health Case Competition, where we worked on improving patient adherence to tailored nursing care-plans.\n\nI have found that my experience in the community has been just as valuable as my classroom learning. I have volunteered for 7 Cups, a counseling organization, for over 150 hours over the past two years. In this role, I have connected with teens as a listener to support them through mental illnesses. This experience has taught me the importance of mental health, and I have also gained valuable knowledge about mental illnesses and psychotherapies through classes, books, and discussions with professionals.\n\nAs a mentor, I have also taught other volunteers how to mentor, expanding the organization's impact. Through these experiences, I have learned the value of community-building and the importance of supporting others. I believe that this experience will be valuable as I pursue a degree in computer science, as I know that the skills I develop will be a tool to solve problems beyond the screen.\n\nI am eager to continue building my foundation and discipline in computer science as I progress through college. I know that my diverse experiences, community-building skills, and passion for solving problems will make me a great computer science student. I am excited to see what the future holds, and I am ready to tackle the challenges that upper-division courses will bring.",
