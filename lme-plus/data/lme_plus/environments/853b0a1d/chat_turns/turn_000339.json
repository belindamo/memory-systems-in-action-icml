  "content": "I'm glad to hear about these authors and their inspirations. I've been in a huge romance novel phase lately, which is unusual for me since I usually prefer mystery and thriller books. I think it's because I recently devoured three Colleen Hoover novels in a row and loved them. Anyway, I'll definitely keep an eye out for those upcoming releases, especially Colleen Hoover's new book. Can you recommend any other romance novels that feature complex characters and a slow-burn romance?",
