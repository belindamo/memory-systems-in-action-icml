By the way, I'm curious about film festivals - I've attended a few recently, including the Los Angeles Film Festival, Outfest Los Angeles LGBTQ+ Film Festival, and Comic-Con International Independent Film Festival. Do you have any recommendations for other film festivals I might be interested in?",
