For the past two years, I have been volunteering with 7 Cups, a counseling organization that connects people with trained listeners. Through my work with 7 Cups, I have learned how to effectively communicate with teens, especially those who are struggling with mental health issues.\n\nOne of the most rewarding experiences I had with 7 Cups was my work with a teenager named Kinga. When I first started talking to her, she was struggling with alcoholism and feeling very isolated.

I also learned a lot from her, and began reading books and taking classes on psychotherapies to better understand how to help her.\n\nOver time, Kinga's condition improved and she was able to reconnect with her family and friends. She even texted me to say that talking to me had helped her see that not everyone in the world was evil, and that she was able to surround herself with good people. This experience showed me the power of effective communication and the importance of mental health support for teens.\n\nIn addition to my work with 7 Cups, I have also been developing my computer science skills.

I also participated in hackathons and worked on a team that became a finalist in the Google Health Case Competition. Through these experiences, I have gained the technical knowledge and skills to build products that can make",
