  "content": "Yes, the costumes in Giselle do reflect the time period in which the story takes place. The ballet was first performed in 1841, so the costumes that were designed for the original production were based on the fashions of the mid-19th century. The peasant costumes would have been more rustic and simple, while the noble costumes would have been more elaborate and fashionable. In the second act of the ballet, the \"Wilis\" wear flowing white dresses or tutus, which are meant to evoke a ghostly, ethereal quality. These costumes have become iconic over the years, and are often associated with the ballet. Throughout the history of the production, different designers and choreographers have put their own spin on the costumes, but they typically maintain the overall aesthetic and style of the time period in which the story takes place.",
