Since you didn't mention the specific Netflix show you've been watching, could you please share the title of the show? Additionally, what is it about the show that you enjoy the most? Is it the characters, plot twists, genre, or something else?\n\nAlso, what type of genres are you generally interested in? For example, do you prefer drama, sci-fi, fantasy, horror, comedy, or a mix of everything?\n\nLastly, how much time do you have to commit to a new show? Are you looking for something quick to binge or a longer series to follow?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your viewing preferences, I can suggest some TV shows that might be up your alley!",
