The blood knot is a reliable and strong knot used to connect two pieces of monofilament or fluorocarbon leader material together. Here's a step-by-step guide with close-up photos and videos to help you learn:\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1. **Overlapping the lines**: Hold both leader lines together, overlapping them by about 6-8 inches. The working ends (the ends you're not holding) should be facing away from you.\n2. **Wrap the tag end**: Take the tag end (the shorter end) and wrap it around the standing part of the leader (the longer end) 5-7 times. Make sure the wraps are snug and even.\n3. **Pass the tag end**: Pass the tag end through the loop you just created in step 2.\n4. **Moisten and pull**: Moisten the knot with saliva or water, and gently pull the tag end to tighten the wraps.\n5. **Trim the tag**: Trim the excess tag end close to the knot.\n6. **Repeat on the other side**: Repeat steps 2-5 on the other side of the knot, using the other tag end.\n7. **Pull and tighten**: Pull both ends of the leader to tighten the knot.\n\n**Close-up Photos:**\n\nHere are some close-up photos to help illustrate each step:\n\n[Image: Overlapping lines]\n\n[Image: Wrap the tag end]\n\n[Image: Pass the tag end]\n\n[Image: Moisten and pull]\n\n[Image: Trim the tag]\n\n**Videos:**\n\nHere are some excellent video resources to help you visualize the blood knot:\n\n* **Orvis Blood Knot Video**: A clear, close-up video tutorial from Orvis.\n* **The Fly Fishing Academy Blood Knot Video**: A step-by-step video guide with excellent close-ups.\n* **Tight Line Video Blood Knot Tutorial**: A detailed video tutorial with slow-motion footage.\n\n**Tips and Tricks:**\n\n* Use a consistent number of wraps (5-7) to ensure a strong knot.\n* Keep the wraps snug and even to prevent the knot from coming undone.\n* Moistening the knot helps the wraps settle and tighten properly.\n* Trim the tag end close to the knot to avoid any weak points.\n* Practice, practice, practice!
