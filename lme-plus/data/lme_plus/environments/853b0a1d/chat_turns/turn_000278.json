  "content": "Fertilizing your plants! That's a great step towards a bountiful harvest! I'd be happy to recommend some organic fertilizers that would be perfect for your heirloom tomatoes and basil.\n\nFor heirloom tomatoes, you'll want a fertilizer that's high in phosphorus to promote fruiting and flowering. Here are some organic options:\n\n1. **Bone meal**: A natural, slow-release fertilizer made from ground animal bones. It's rich in phosphorus, nitrogen, and calcium, making it an excellent choice for tomato plants.\n2. **Fish bone meal**: Similar to bone meal, but made from fish bones. It's a great source of phosphorus, nitrogen, and micronutrients.\n3. **Compost tea**: A liquid fertilizer made by steeping compost in water. It's a nutrient-rich, microbe-friendly option that will promote healthy soil and plant growth.\n4. **Alfalfa meal**: A natural fertilizer made from the dried and ground leaves of the alfalfa plant. It's high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, making it an excellent all-purpose fertilizer.\n\nFor basil, you'll want a fertilizer that's high in nitrogen to promote leaf growth and flavor. Here are some organic options:\n\n1. **Blood meal**: A natural, slow-release fertilizer made from dried animal blood. It's high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron, making it an excellent choice for leafy greens like basil.\n2. **Feather meal**: Similar to blood meal, but made from ground feathers. It's another natural, slow-release fertilizer that's high in nitrogen and phosphorus.\n3. **Compost**: A general-purpose fertilizer that's perfect for basil and other leafy greens. It's rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and will promote healthy soil and plant growth.\n\nRemember to always follow the instructions on the packaging and start with a small amount to avoid over-fertilizing, which can harm your plants.\n\nAnd congratulations on pruning your apple tree! Pruning can be a big job, but it's essential for maintaining the health and productivity of your tree. I'm sure it's looking great now!\n\nDo you have any other questions about fertilizing or pruning?",
