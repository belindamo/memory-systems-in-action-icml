It is also a governance token, controlled by token holders through a set of smart contracts, allowing for decentralized decision-making within the ecosystem. Additionally, it serves as a community token, empowering individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume through participating in Fresh Earth Projects, advocacy groups, Buying Groups and Research Groups.\n\nThe FET is an asset-backed token, representing fractional ownership of the ecosystem and is valued based on the assets of the ecosystem and the impact of regenerative projects. This includes assets such as the monetizable value of carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention, and food nutritional density. These assets are measured by key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide verified measurements of impact, which can be leveraged to secure external funding from government schemes such as carbon trading. The token also serves as a stablecoin, as its underlying value is tied to the value of real-world assets, and the ecosystem has the ability to buy back tokens to maintain its value.\n\nThe FET drives adoption of regenerative practices by creating an economic engine for the ecosystem through internalizing the costs of the food system and redistributing the money back into the ecosystem through token sales and rewards. This aligns with the growing consumer trend towards sustainable and regenerative food systems, as well as addressing the urgent need to address climate change and food security. By connecting farmers on the regenerative pathway with consultants, suppliers, funding and markets, the ecosystem helps to reduce costs and risks for farms and allows businesses and consumers to access verified, locally developed regenerative food products directly from the designers, manufacturers, and producers.\n\nThe FET also changes the economics of the food system by monetizing the verified impact of regenerative practices through the use of KPIs and external funding from government schemes such as emissions trading schemes and carbon trading futures. This leads to an increase in the value of the token as regenerative practices lead to higher crop yields, increased resilience to climate change, and improved water retention and soil health. As consumer demand for regenerative food increases, the ecosystem and the value of the token also grows. Overall, the FET serves as a logical and stable investment opportunity for individuals and organizations to financially benefit from the growth of the ecosystem and play a role in creating a more sustainable and regenerative food system for the planet and society.",
