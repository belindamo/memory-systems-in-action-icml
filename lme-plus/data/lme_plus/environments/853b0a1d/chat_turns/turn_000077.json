  "content": "I'm thinking of rearranging the plants on my balcony to get more sunlight. I moved the fern to the eastern corner, where it gets more morning sun, and shifted the succulent planter to the western corner, where it gets more afternoon sun. It's amazing how much of a difference it's made - the fern is looking more vibrant than ever, and the succulents are starting to plump up again. Do you have any other tips on how to optimize the layout of my balcony for maximum sunlight and plant health?",
