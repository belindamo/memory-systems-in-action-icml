I've been taking weekly lessons at the community center and I'm thinking of joining a local league soon. By the way, I've been pretty active lately - just started playing in a recreational co-ed volleyball league with my friend Rachel, and we made it to the semifinals over the next 6 weeks, which was a lot of fun! Do you have any recommendations for badminton rackets for beginners?",
