Self-watering systems can be a game-changer for busy people or those who tend to forget to water their plants. Here are some recommendations and options to consider:\n\n1. **Self-Watering Planters**: These planters have a built-in water reservoir that allows plants to draw water as needed. They're available in various sizes and materials, such as ceramic, plastic, or wood.\n2. **Smart Watering Systems**: These systems use sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and automatically water your plants when necessary. Some popular brands include Smart Garden, Parrot Flower Power, and Click & Grow.\n3. **Ollas**: Ollas are clay pots with a porous design that allows water to seep into the soil as needed. They're a low-tech, eco-friendly option that works well for small plants.\n4. **Wicking Systems**: These systems use a wick to draw water from a reservoir into the soil. They're often DIY-friendly and can be customized to fit your planters.\n5. **Automatic Watering Timers**: If you already have a watering can or hose, consider investing in an automatic watering timer.
