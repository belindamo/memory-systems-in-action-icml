This will give the roots a fresh start and provide essential nutrients for blooming.\n\n**Additional Tips to Promote Blooming:**\n\n1. **Provide bright, indirect light**: Orchids need bright light to bloom, but direct sunlight can cause the leaves to become scorched.\n2. **Maintain good air circulation**: Good air circulation helps prevent fungal diseases that can prevent blooming.\n3. **Water correctly**: Over-watering can prevent blooming, so make sure to water your orchid correctly (watering once a week is usually sufficient).\n4. **Prune old flower spikes**: After an orchid finishes blooming, prune the old flower spike to encourage a new bloom.\n\nBy following these tips and using a high-quality orchid fertilizer, you should start to see an improvement in your orchid's health and blooming. Good luck, and happy growing!",
