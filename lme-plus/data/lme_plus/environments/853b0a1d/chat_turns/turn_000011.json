  "content": "I didn't want to give away the title of the show just yet, but I can tell you that it's a sci-fi horror series with a lot of plot twists and nostalgic value. I love how it pays homage to the 80s and has a really strong cast of characters. As for genres, I'm open to anything, but I tend to lean towards sci-fi, horror, and drama. I've got a pretty flexible schedule, so I can commit to a longer series or something quick to binge, whatever catches my interest.",
