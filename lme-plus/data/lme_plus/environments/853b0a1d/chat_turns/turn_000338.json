They're also co-authors of the young adult novel, \"Spoiled,\" and its sequel, \"Messy.\" With \"The Royal We,\" they ventured into adult fiction, drawing inspiration from their fascination with British royalty, romance, and fairy tales.\n\nIn an interview, Heather Cocks mentioned that they were inspired by the idea of an American commoner falling for a British prince, much like Kate Middleton and Prince William. They wanted to explore the challenges and absurdities that come with royal life, while still crafting a romantic and relatable story.\n\n**Sally Thorne (The Hating Game)**\n\nSally Thorne is an Australian author who worked as a paralegal before pursuing her passion for writing. \"The Hating Game\" is her debut novel, which was released in 2016 to critical acclaim.\n\nThorne has stated that she drew inspiration from her own experiences in the corporate world, where she observed the dynamics between colleagues and the tension that can arise from working in close quarters. She wanted to write a romance that was both funny and heartfelt, with a strong focus on character development.\n\n**Upcoming Romance Releases**\n\nHere are some highly anticipated romance novels releasing in the next few months:\n\n1. **\"Get a Life, Chloe Brown\" by Talia Hibbert** (August 2019): A romantic comedy about a chronically ill computer geek who enlists the help of her handsome neighbor to complete her bucket list.\n2. **\"Well Met\" by Jen DeLuca** (September 2019): A romance set at a Renaissance Faire, where a volunteer and a performer clash, only to discover their feelings for each other.\n3. **\"Twice in a Blue Moon\" by Christina Lauren** (October 2019): A romantic comedy about a woman who reconnects with her former flame, now a famous actor, on the set of a movie.\n4. **\"Regretting You\" by Colleen Hoover** (January 2020): A novel about a mother-daughter duo, exploring themes of love, forgiveness, and redemption.\n5. **\"In Five Years\" by Rebecca Serle** (March 2020): A romantic novel that follows a woman who, after a chance encounter, gets a glimpse of what her life would be like five years in the future.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many more exciting releases on the horizon. I recommend following your favorite authors, book bloggers, and romance review websites to stay up-to-date on the latest news and reviews.\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Royal We\" and \"The Hating Game,\" and that you find some new titles to add to your reading list!",
