In this exercise, you will use Pandas to perform time series analysis on banking transaction data.\n\n### Objective:\n\nTo demonstrate how to perform time series analysis using Pandas and extract useful insights from banking transaction data.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. Load the banking transaction data from the CSV file using Pandas\n2. Convert the 'Transaction Date' column to a Pandas datetime format\n3. Set the 'Transaction Date' column as the index for the DataFrame\n4. Resample the data to daily frequency and aggregate by the sum of the 'Amount' column\n5. Calculate the rolling mean and standard deviation of the daily transaction amounts over a 7-day period\n6. Plot the daily transaction amounts, rolling mean and standard deviation on a line chart using Matplotlib\n\n### Example Solution:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Step 1: Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('banking_data.csv')\n\n# Step 2: Convert the 'Transaction Date' column to datetime format\ndf['Transaction Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Transaction Date'])\n\n# Step 3: Set the 'Transaction Date' column as the index\ndf.set_index('Transaction Date', inplace=True)\n\n# Step 4: Resample the data to daily frequency and aggregate by sum\ndaily_transactions = df['Amount'].resample('D').sum()\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the rolling mean and standard deviation\nrolling_mean = daily_transactions.rolling(window=7).mean()\nrolling_std = daily_transactions.rolling(window=7).std()\n\n# Step 6: Plot the data\nplt.plot(daily_transactions, label='Daily Transactions')\nplt.plot(rolling_mean, label='Rolling Mean (7-day)')\nplt.plot(rolling_std, label='Rolling Std (7-day)')\nplt.legend(loc='upper left')\nplt.show()\n```\n### Expected Output:\n\nA line chart showing the daily transaction amounts, rolling mean and standard deviation over a 7-day period. The chart should be properly labeled and have a legend showing the different series.",
