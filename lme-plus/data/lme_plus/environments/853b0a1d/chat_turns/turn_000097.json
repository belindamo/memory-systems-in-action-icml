  "content": "Congratulations on receiving the partial scholarship from the University of Edinburgh! That's a great achievement, and it'll definitely help with your financial burden.\n\nIt's also smart of you to have arranged a student loan from a bank in your home country to cover the remaining tuition fees and living expenses. Having a solid financial plan in place will help you focus on your studies and make the most of your time in Edinburgh.\n\nRemember to also budget for other expenses, such as accommodation, food, transportation, and miscellaneous costs. You might want to consider opening a UK bank account to manage your finances more easily while you're in Scotland.\n\nSince you've got your tuition fees and living expenses covered, you can now focus on preparing for your move to Edinburgh. Have you started looking into accommodation options in Marchmont or other areas? Do you have any plans for arriving in Edinburgh and getting settled before the academic year begins?\n\nI'm here to help with any questions or concerns you might have, so feel free to ask!",
