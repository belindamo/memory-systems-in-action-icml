  "content": "I think I'll check out the Bell Zephyr MIPS, it sounds like a great helmet. By the way, speaking of safety, I was thinking of finding a charity run to participate in soon. Do you know of any upcoming charity runs in the area, preferably a 5K or 10K? I've had a good experience with charity runs in the past, like the one I did on March 12th where I finished in 32 minutes and 15 seconds, and I'd like to do another one soon.",
