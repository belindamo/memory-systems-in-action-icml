  "content": "I'm so glad you're interested in authors who tackle deeper issues in their romance novels. As I mentioned earlier, I just finished reading \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" by Taylor Jenkins Reid, which deals with themes of identity, love, and the power of storytelling. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an author who consistently tackles deeper issues in her work, and I think you might enjoy her other novels as well.\n\nIn fact, her novel \"Maybe in Another Life\" explores the concept of parallel universes and the choices we make in life, while \"After I Do\" delves into the complexities of marriage, relationships, and personal growth. Both novels deal with deeper themes in a thoughtful and relatable way.\n\nWhat do you think about exploring more of Taylor Jenkins Reid's works, or would you like to discover other authors who tackle similar themes?",
