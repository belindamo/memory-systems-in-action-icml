  "content": "The Versailles-Washington System refers to the political and economic order established in Europe after World War I. The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers, and imposed severe penalties and reparations on Germany. The Washington Naval Conference of 1921-1922 established a set of agreements on naval disarmament and aimed to prevent an arms race between major naval powers, including the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy.\n\nThese two events marked the beginning of the Versailles-Washington system, which aimed to promote peace, stability, and international cooperation in the aftermath of World War I. The system was based on the principles of collective security, as expressed in the League of Nations, and the reduction of armaments to prevent future wars.\n\nHowever, the Versailles-Washington system ultimately failed to achieve its goals, as the harsh terms imposed on Germany contributed to the rise of Nazi dictatorship, and the Great Depression of the 1930s weakened the global economy and the political order established after World War I. The failure of the system ultimately led to World War II, which marked the end of the Versailles-Washington system.",
