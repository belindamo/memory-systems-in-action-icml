In this exercise, you will practice reading and cleaning data from a CSV file using Python.\n\nObjective: The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate how to use Python to read in a CSV file containing banking data and clean it by removing any null values and converting data types as necessary.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries, including Pandas.\n2. Read in the banking data CSV file using the Pandas read\\_csv() function.\n3. Use the Pandas dropna() function to remove any rows with null values.\n4. Convert any necessary columns to the appropriate data types using the Pandas astype() function.\n5. Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file using the Pandas to\\_csv() function.\n\nExample Solution:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the banking data CSV file\nbank_data = pd.read_csv('banking_data.csv')\n\n# Remove any rows with null values\nbank_data = bank_data.dropna()\n\n# Convert any necessary columns to the appropriate data types\nbank_data['Transaction Date'] = pd.to_datetime(bank_data['Transaction Date'])\nbank_data['Transaction Amount'] = bank_data['Transaction Amount'].astype(float)\n\n# Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file\nbank_data.to_csv('cleaned_banking_data.csv', index=False)\n```\nExpected Output: The cleaned banking data will be saved to a new CSV file called `cleaned_banking_data.csv` with any null values removed and data types appropriately converted.",
