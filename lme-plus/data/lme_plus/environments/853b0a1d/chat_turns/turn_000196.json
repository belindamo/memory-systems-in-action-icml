Some common programming languages used in the industry include:\n\n1. Python\n2. JavaScript\n3. Java\n4. PHP\n5. Ruby\n6. C#\n7. Go\n\nFor each of these programming languages, there are resources available to learn application security concepts. Below is a list of resources for each language:\n\n1. Python:\n\t* Book: \"Black Hat Python\" by Justin Seitz\n\t* OWASP Python Security Project: <https://owasp.org/www-project-python-security/>\n\t* Secure coding with Python (YouTube playlist): <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKI1h_nAkaQoDzGe4_pk-NCk8KsbQdiyc>\n2. JavaScript:\n\t* Book: \"Web Application Security: Exploitation and Countermeasures for JavaScript Apps\" by Andrew Hoffman\n\t* OWASP Cheat Sheet Series - DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet: <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html>\n\t* Node.js Security Handbook: <https://snyk.io/learn/node-js-security-handbook/>\n3. Java:\n\t* Book: \"Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications\" by Jim Manico and August Detlefsen\n\t* OWASP Java Security Project: <https://owasp.org/www-project-java-security/>\n\t* Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE: <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/seccodeguide.html>\n4. PHP:\n\t* Book: \"Securing PHP Web Applications\" by Tricia Ballad and William Ballad\n\t* OWASP PHP Security Cheat Sheet: <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/PHP_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html>\n\t* PHP: The Right Way (Security): <https://phptherightway.com/#security>\n5. Ruby:\n\t* Book: \"Secure Your Node.js Web Application\" by Karl Duuna (relevant for Ruby developers as well)\n\t* OWASP Ruby on Rails Security Guide: <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html>\n\t* Rails Security Best Practices: <https://www.railstutorial.org/book/security>\n6. C#:\n\t* Book: \"C# and .NET Core Test-Driven Development\" by Dr. Vivina Bartram (includes security testing)\n\t* OWASP .NET Security Cheat Sheet: <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DotNet_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html>\n\t* Microsoft's Security Best Practices for C#: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/secure-coding-guidelines>\n7. Go:\n\t* Book: \"Black Hat Go\" by Tom Steele, Chris Patten, and Dan Kottmann\n\t* Go Secure Coding Practices: <https://github.com/OWASP/Go-SCP>\n\t* Go Security Cheatsheet: <https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Go_Security_Cheat_Sheet.md>\n\nKeep in mind that application security concepts extend beyond specific programming languages. It's essential to familiarize yourself with general security best practices and principles, such as the OWASP Top Ten Project (<https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/>) and OWASP Cheat Sheet Series (<https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/>).",
