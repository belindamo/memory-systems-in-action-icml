  "content": "For cleaning a stubborn bathtub stain, I recommend using the baking soda and vinegar solution. The combination of these two ingredients creates a powerful reaction that can help dissolve difficult stains, soap scum, and grime. Make a paste using baking soda and water and spread it all over the stained area of the bathtub. Then, spray the mixture of equal parts vinegar and water on top of the baking soda paste. Leave it to sit for 10-15 minutes, then use a scrub brush to scrub away the stain. Finally, rinse the bathtub thoroughly with water.",
