      "content": "As a student who has always been passionate about solving problems, I am excited to pursue a degree in computer science. I have prepared for my intended major through both classroom and real-world experience, and I am ready to succeed in upper-division courses once I enroll at the university.\n\nThroughout high school, I took AP Computer Science and six community college courses in computer science. In addition to this, I gained experience in mobile development through an internship, and I learned several frameworks through extra-curricular projects. I have also participated in four hackathons, and my team recently became a finalist in the Google Health Case Competition, where we worked on improving patient adherence to tailored nursing care-plans.\n\nI have found that my experience in the community has been just as valuable as my classroom learning. I have volunteered for 7 Cups, a counseling organization, for over 150 hours over the past two years. In this role, I have connected with teens as a listener to support them through mental illnesses. This experience has taught me the importance of mental health, and I have also gained valuable knowledge about mental illnesses and psychotherapies through classes, books, and discussions with professionals.\n\nAs a mentor, I have also taught other volunteers how to mentor, expanding the organization's impact. Through these experiences, I have learned the value of community-building and the importance of supporting others. I believe that this experience will be valuable as I pursue a degree in computer science, as I know that the skills I develop will be a tool to solve problems beyond the screen.\n\nI am eager to continue building my foundation and discipline in computer science as I progress through college. I know that my diverse experiences, community-building skills, and passion for solving problems will make me a great computer science student. I am excited to see what the future holds, and I am ready to tackle the challenges that upper-division courses will bring."

      "content": "As a teacher, I have always been passionate about making a difference in the lives of my students. For the past two years, I have been volunteering with 7 Cups, a counseling organization that connects people with trained listeners. Through my work with 7 Cups, I have learned how to effectively communicate with teens, especially those who are struggling with mental health issues.\n\nOne of the most rewarding experiences I had with 7 Cups was my work with a teenager named Kinga. When I first started talking to her, she was struggling with alcoholism and feeling very isolated. Through our conversations, I was able to provide her with the support she needed to start dealing with her issues. I also learned a lot from her, and began reading books and taking classes on psychotherapies to better understand how to help her.\n\nOver time, Kinga's condition improved and she was able to reconnect with her family and friends. She even texted me to say that talking to me had helped her see that not everyone in the world was evil, and that she was able to surround herself with good people. This experience showed me the power of effective communication and the importance of mental health support for teens.\n\nIn addition to my work with 7 Cups, I have also been developing my computer science skills. I took several advanced courses in community college and completed an internship in mobile development. I also participated in hackathons and worked on a team that became a finalist in the Google Health Case Competition. Through these experiences, I have gained the technical knowledge and skills to build products that can make"
