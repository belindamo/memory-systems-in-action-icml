This exercise will cover how to use Pandas groupby and pivot table functionality to group and aggregate data, and how to generate summary statistics.\n\n### Objective\n\nThe objective of this exercise is to learn how to use the groupby and pivot table functions in Pandas to summarize transactional data.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Load the banking transaction data from the CSV file using Pandas.\n2. Use the groupby function to group the data by customer ID and transaction type.\n3. Aggregate the data using sum, mean, and count functions.\n4. Use the pivot table function to generate summary statistics by customer ID and transaction type.\n5. Output the summary statistics to a new CSV file.\n\n### Example Solution\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the banking transaction data\ndf = pd.read_csv('banking_data.csv')\n\n# Group the data by customer ID and transaction type\ngrouped_data = df.groupby(['customer_id', 'transaction_type'])\n\n# Aggregate the data using sum, mean, and count functions\naggregated_data = grouped_data.agg({\n    'amount': ['sum', 'mean'],\n    'transaction_type': 'count'\n})\n\n# Use the pivot table function to generate summary statistics\npivot_table = pd.pivot_table(df, \n               values='amount', \n               index=['customer_id'], \n               columns=['transaction_type'], \n               aggfunc={'amount': [sum, 'mean']})\n\n# Output the summary statistics to a new CSV file\naggregated_data.to_csv('transaction_summary.csv')\npivot_table.to_csv('pivot_summary.csv')\n```\n### Expected Output\n\nTwo new CSV files will be generated, `transaction_summary.csv` and `pivot_summary.csv`, each containing summarized data based on the steps outlined above. The output will show the total and average transaction amounts, as well as the number of transactions, grouped by customer ID and transaction type."

In this exercise, you will use Pandas to perform time series analysis on banking transaction data.\n\n### Objective:\n\nTo demonstrate how to perform time series analysis using Pandas and extract useful insights from banking transaction data.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. Load the banking transaction data from the CSV file using Pandas\n2. Convert the 'Transaction Date' column to a Pandas datetime format\n3. Set the 'Transaction Date' column as the index for the DataFrame\n4. Resample the data to daily frequency and aggregate by the sum of the 'Amount' column\n5. Calculate the rolling mean and standard deviation of the daily transaction amounts over a 7-day period\n6. Plot the daily transaction amounts, rolling mean and standard deviation on a line chart using Matplotlib\n\n### Example Solution:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Step 1: Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('banking_data.csv')\n\n# Step 2: Convert the 'Transaction Date' column to datetime format\ndf['Transaction Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Transaction Date'])\n\n# Step 3: Set the 'Transaction Date' column as the index\ndf.set_index('Transaction Date', inplace=True)\n\n# Step 4: Resample the data to daily frequency and aggregate by sum\ndaily_transactions = df['Amount'].resample('D').sum()\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the rolling mean and standard deviation\nrolling_mean = daily_transactions.rolling(window=7).mean()\nrolling_std = daily_transactions.rolling(window=7).std()\n\n# Step 6: Plot the data\nplt.plot(daily_transactions, label='Daily Transactions')\nplt.plot(rolling_mean, label='Rolling Mean (7-day)')\nplt.plot(rolling_std, label='Rolling Std (7-day)')\nplt.legend(loc='upper left')\nplt.show()\n```\n### Expected Output:\n\nA line chart showing the daily transaction amounts, rolling mean and standard deviation over a 7-day period. The chart should be properly labeled and have a legend showing the different series."
