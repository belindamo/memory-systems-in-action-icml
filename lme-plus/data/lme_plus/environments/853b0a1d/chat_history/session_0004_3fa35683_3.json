      "content": "I'm glad to hear that your plants are still thriving despite your forgetfulness! Self-watering systems can be a game-changer for busy people or those who tend to forget to water their plants. Here are some recommendations and options to consider:\n\n1. **Self-Watering Planters**: These planters have a built-in water reservoir that allows plants to draw water as needed. They're available in various sizes and materials, such as ceramic, plastic, or wood.\n2. **Smart Watering Systems**: These systems use sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and automatically water your plants when necessary. Some popular brands include Smart Garden, Parrot Flower Power, and Click & Grow.\n3. **Ollas**: Ollas are clay pots with a porous design that allows water to seep into the soil as needed. They're a low-tech, eco-friendly option that works well for small plants.\n4. **Wicking Systems**: These systems use a wick to draw water from a reservoir into the soil. They're often DIY-friendly and can be customized to fit your planters.\n5. **Automatic Watering Timers**: If you already have a watering can or hose, consider investing in an automatic watering timer. These devices attach to your watering system and can be programmed to water your plants at set intervals.\n\nSome popular brands for self-watering systems include:\n\n* **Aqua Globe**: Known for their self-watering planters and globes that can water plants for up to 2 weeks.\n* **Miracle-Gro**: Offers a range of self-watering planters and systems, including smart watering options.\n* **Haws**: Provides self-watering planters and systems, including ollas and wicking systems.\n\nWhen choosing a self-watering system, consider factors such as:\n\n* Plant size and type: Different systems are suited for different plant sizes and types.\n* Watering frequency: If you have plants that require frequent watering, look for systems that can water more often.\n* Budget: Self-watering systems vary in price, from affordable to more expensive.\n* Space: Consider the size of your balcony or space when choosing a system.\n\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions and adjust the system according to your plant's specific needs.

Considering a Wi-Fi connected timer is a great idea, but it depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here are some pros and cons to help you decide:\n\n**Pros of a Wi-Fi connected automatic watering timer:**\n\n1. **Remote control**: With a Wi-Fi connected timer, you can control and monitor your watering schedule from your smartphone, tablet, or computer, no matter where you are.\n2. **Real-time monitoring**: Many Wi-Fi timers allow you to check the current watering schedule, soil moisture levels, and even receive notifications when the water tank is running low.\n3. **Customization**: Some Wi-Fi timers offer advanced features like customizable watering schedules, weather-based watering, and even integration with other smart home devices.\n4. **Convenience**: Imagine being able to water your plants while you're on vacation or at work, ensuring they receive the right amount of water at the right time.\n\n**Cons of a Wi-Fi connected automatic watering timer:**\n\n1. **Higher cost**: Wi-Fi connected timers are generally more expensive than traditional, non-connected timers.\n2. **Dependence on internet connection**: If your internet connection is unreliable or you experience outages, you may not be able to access or control your timer remotely.\n3. **Battery life**: Wi-Fi connected timers often require batteries, which may need to be replaced periodically, adding to the overall cost.\n4. **Complexity**: Some users might find the app and setup process overwhelming or difficult to understand.\n\n**Alternatives to consider:**\n\n1. **Simple, non-Wi-Fi timers**: If you don't need remote control or advanced features, a basic automatic watering timer can still provide reliable, scheduled watering.\n2. **Smart plugs**: You can use a smart plug to control your existing timer or watering system, allowing for remote control and scheduling without the need for a specialized Wi-Fi timer.\n\nIf you:\n\n* Are comfortable with technology and want the added features and convenience of remote control.\n* Have a reliable internet connection.\n* Are willing to pay a premium for the advanced features.\n\nThen, a Wi-Fi connected automatic watering timer might be a great choice for you.\n\nHowever, if you:\n\n* Are on a budget or prefer a more straightforward solution.\n* Don't need remote control or advanced features.\n* Are concerned about complexity or internet connectivity issues.\n\nA simple, non-Wi-Fi automatic watering timer or a smart plug might be a better fit.\n\nUltimately, weigh your needs and preferences to decide which option is best for you and your plants."

Label each container so you can easily find what you need.\n5. **Keep shoes in order**: Store shoes in a designated area, such as on a shoe rack or in a shoe organizer, to keep them organized and prevent clutter.\n6. **Consider a closet organizer system**: Invest in a custom or pre-made closet organizer system that includes shelves, drawers, and hanging rods specifically designed to maximize your closet's space.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Keep frequently worn items accessible**: Store your most-worn items in easy-to-reach locations to save time and effort.\n2. **Hang clothes by type**: Organize clothes by type (e.g., all dresses together, all tops together) to make it easier to find what you need.\n3. **Store out-of-season items**: Consider storing out-of-season clothing in labeled bins or containers to free up space and reduce clutter.\n4. **Maintain your space**: Set aside time each week to maintain your newly organized closet, putting away items after use and tidying up as needed.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to declutter your closet, maximize your space, and make the most of your favorite pieces \u2013 like your newly cleaned wool coat!"
