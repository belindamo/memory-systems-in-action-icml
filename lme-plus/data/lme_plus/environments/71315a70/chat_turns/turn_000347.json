While floor numbers can vary, I can give you an idea of the typical floor ranges with great city views for each hotel:\n\n1. **The Ritz-Carlton, Los Angeles**: The hotel has 26 floors, and rooms with great views of the city skyline are typically on floors 10-24. The Ritz-Carlton Club Level rooms, which offer access to a private lounge, are on floors 22-24.\n2. **The Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza**: The hotel has 17 floors, and rooms with great views are typically on floors 10-16. The Premier rooms, which offer upgraded amenities, are on floors 14-16.\n3. **InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown**: The hotel has 73 floors, making it one of the tallest buildings in LA. Rooms with great views are typically on floors 31-60, with the highest floors (61-73) offering the most spectacular views. The Club InterContinental rooms, which offer access to a private lounge, are on floors 51-60.\n4. **The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites**: The hotel has 35 floors, and rooms with great views are typically on floors 15-30.

The hotel's \"Skyview\" rooms, which offer upgraded amenities, are on floors 14-16.\n\nBased on your previous experience, it seems like you might be looking for a room around the 15th floor or higher. All of these hotels have rooms on or around that floor with great city views. However, keep in mind that the best views can vary depending on the room category, direction, and location within the hotel.\n\nWhen booking your room, I recommend specifying your floor preference and asking about the view from that specific floor. You can also consider booking a room with a higher floor or a corner room, which may offer more expansive views.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect room with a stunning view of the LA skyline!",
