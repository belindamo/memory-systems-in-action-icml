For Rocky Mountain National Park, I highly recommend the following maps and guides:\n\n**Maps:**\n\n1. **National Park Service (NPS) Map**: The official NPS map of Rocky Mountain National Park is a must-have.

It's a great resource for planning your route and navigating the park's backcountry.\n3. **USGS Topographic Maps**: If you plan to venture into the park's more remote areas, consider bringing USGS topographic maps (e.g., 7.5-minute series).
