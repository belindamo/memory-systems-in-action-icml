Here are some tips to help you remove tough mud stains from your Air Force Ones:\n\n**Before you start**\n\n1. **Let them dry**: Allow the shoes to air dry completely before attempting to clean them. This will make it easier to remove the mud and prevent further damage to the materials.\n2. **Remove loose debris**: Use a soft-bristled brush or a clean cloth to gently remove any loose dirt or debris from the surface of the shoes.\n\n**Removing mud stains**\n\n1. **Mix a cleaning solution**: Create a solution of warm water and a small amount of mild soap, such as dish soap or hand soap. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the materials.\n2. **Soak the shoes**: Submerge the shoes in the cleaning solution and let them soak for about 30 minutes to an hour. This will help loosen the mud and make it easier to remove.\n3. **Use a soft-bristled brush**: After soaking, use a soft-bristled brush to gently scrub the mud stains.

Follow the product's instructions and test it on a small, inconspicuous area first.\n6. **Repeat if necessary**: If the stain is still present after the first treatment, you may need to repeat the process a few times until the stain is removed.\n\n**Drying and conditioning**\n\n1. **Air dry**: Allow the shoes to air dry completely, away from direct sunlight and heat.\n2. **Use a cleaning solution for the midsole**: If the midsole is also stained, you can use a cleaning solution specifically designed for midsoles.
