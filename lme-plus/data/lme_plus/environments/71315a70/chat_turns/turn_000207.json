You mentioned you've lost 2 pounds, but you didn't share your current weight. Could you please tell me what your current weight is, as well as your height in feet and inches (or just inches if you prefer)?\n\nOnce I have that information, I can calculate your BMI and let you know what category you fall into (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).\n\nAnd by the way, great deal on the digital scale from Target!",
