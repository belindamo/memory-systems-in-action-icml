Make time for each other and keep the channels of communication open through phone calls, video chats, messaging, and emails.\n\n2. Trust: Trust is essential in any relationship, but it takes on an even greater role in a long-distance relationship. Trust that each other will stay committed and faithful to each other, and trust that the distance is only temporary.\n\n3. Creative Dates: Although you may be miles apart, you can still plan creative dates to stay connected. Schedule date nights where you both do something fun together such as watching the same movie, cooking the same meal, or playing online games.\n\n4. Surprise gestures: Small surprises that show you are thinking of your partner can be great ways to stay connected. Send your partner a surprise care package, bouquet of flowers, or a handwritten note in the mail.\n\n5.
