Since you're planning to visit IKEA this weekend, I'll give you some tips on what to look for in their stores:\n\n1. **Markus**: The Markus chair is a popular and affordable option (around $100). It's a great starter chair, but it might not offer the highest level of adjustability or support.\n2. **Poang**: The Poang chair is another popular option (around $50-$100). It's known for its comfort and affordability, but it might not be as durable as other options.\n3. **Idasen**: The Idasen chair is a step up from the Markus (around $200-$300). It offers more adjustability and better lumbar support.\n4. **J\u00e4rvfj\u00e4llet**: The J\u00e4rvfj\u00e4llet chair is a higher-end option (around $300-$400). It features a more ergonomic design, adjustable headrest, and better lumbar support.\n\nWhen you're at IKEA, be sure to:\n\n* **Try before you buy**: Sit in each chair for a few minutes to get a feel for the comfort and support.\n* **Adjust and test**: Adjust the chair to your preferred height, tilt, and armrest position to see how it feels.\n* **Check the warranty**: IKEA typically offers a 10-year warranty on their chairs, but it's always good to confirm.\n* **Inspect the build quality**: Look for sturdy frames, comfortable cushioning, and durable materials.\n* **Consider the assembly**: If you're not comfortable assembling the chair yourself, check if IKEA offers assembly services or look for pre-assembled options.\n\nRemember to prioritize your needs and don't hesitate to ask IKEA staff for assistance or recommendations. They can help you find the best chair for your budget and preferences.\n\nLastly, since you mentioned your current chair is affecting your back, I recommend taking a photo of your current chair's dimensions and bringing it with you to IKEA. This can help you compare the dimensions and features of the chairs you're considering to your current chair.\n\nHave a great time at IKEA, and I hope you find the perfect chair for your needs!",
