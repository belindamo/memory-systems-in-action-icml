Congratulations on your solo hunting trip to Wisconsin, and I'm happy to help you prepare for your fishing trip to Colorado.\n\nLate fall on the Arkansas River can be an excellent time to catch brown trout, as they tend to be more active during this period. Here are some fly recommendations and techniques that might increase your chances of landing some nice browns:\n\n**Flies:**\n\n1. **Streamer patterns**: Brown trout love streamers in the fall, especially those that imitate baitfish, leeches, or crawdads. Consider using patterns like:\n\t* Woolly Buggers (black, olive, or brown)\n\t* Muddler Minnows\n\t* Sculpzilla\n\t* Leech patterns (e.g., Bunny Leech or Hare's Ear Leech)\n2. **Nymphs**: As the water cools, trout may focus on nymphs more than surface food. Try:\n\t* Hare's Ear Nymph ( sizes 12-16)\n\t* Pheasant Tail Nymph (sizes 12-16)\n\t* Copper John (sizes 12-16)\n\t* Stonefly nymphs (e.g., Salmonfly or Golden Stone)\n3. **Dry flies**: Although not as prominent in the fall, dry flies can still be effective, especially during warmer days:\n\t* Blue-winged Olives (BWOs) or small mayfly patterns\n\t* Caddisfly patterns (e.g., Elk Hair Caddis or X-Caddis)\n\n**Techniques:**\n\n1. **Streamer fishing**: Use a 9-10 ft leader with a weighted streamer and a sink-tip line or a streamer-specific line. Cast across the river, allowing the streamer to sink, then strip it back quickly to imitate a fleeing baitfish.\n2. **Nymphing**: Use a 9-12 ft leader with a weighted nymph and a strike indicator. Fish the nymph close to the bottom, especially in deeper pools and runs.\n3. **Dry fly fishing**: Use a 9-12 ft leader with a dry fly and a dry fly-specific line. Look for rising fish and cast to them, or try prospecting likely spots with a dry fly.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Fish the Arkansas River during the warmest part of the day (usually between 11 am and 3 pm), as the water temperature will be at its highest.\n* Pay attention to water levels and clarity, as high water or muddy conditions can make fishing more challenging.\n* Be prepared for changing weather conditions, as fall weather in Colorado can be unpredictable.\n* Respect the river and its habitat, and always follow local regulations and catch-and-release guidelines.\n\nRemember to check with local fly shops, guides, or online resources for up-to-date information on the Arkansas River's fishing conditions and any specific regulations before your trip.\n\nGood luck on your fishing trip, and I hope you have a great time on the Arkansas River!",
