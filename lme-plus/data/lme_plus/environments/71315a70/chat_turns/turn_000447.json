Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Rice Bowl with Grilled Chicken and Veggies**: Marinate chicken breast in your favorite seasonings and grill it for 5-6 minutes per side. Serve with leftover rice, roasted veggies (like broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers), and a drizzle of your favorite sauce.\n2. **Rice and Lentil Bowl with Spinach and Feta**: Cook lentils according to package instructions, then mix with leftover rice, wilted spinach, and crumbled feta cheese. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for extra flavor.\n3. **Korean-Style Rice and Veggie Stir-Fry**: Heat some oil in a wok or large skillet and saut\u00e9 your favorite veggies (like bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms) with some garlic and ginger. Add cooked rice, soy sauce, and a fried egg on top.\n4. **Rice and Black Bean Tacos**: Mix cooked black beans with diced tomatoes, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice.
