  "content": "That sounds like a great idea! A simple, distressed wood frame can add a lot of character to your vintage travel posters, and it's a perfect fit for a 1960s Paris travel poster. The distressed finish will also help to create a sense of nostalgia and age, which will complement the vintage aesthetic of the posters.\n\nUsing similar frames for the other vintage travel posters will also help to create a sense of cohesion and unity in your gallery wall. The distressed wood frames will tie the whole collection together, and the subtle variations in the wood grain and distressing will add a touch of uniqueness to each individual poster.\n\nTo take it to the next level, you could also consider the following:\n\n* **Choose frames with a similar wood tone**: Select frames with a similar wood tone to create a sense of continuity. For example, if you're using a weathered oak frame for the Paris poster, look for frames with a similar oak tone for the other posters.\n* **Distressing level**: Consider the level of distressing on each frame. If you want a more uniform look, you could opt for frames with a similar level of distressing. If you want to add some visual interest, you could mix frames with varying levels of distressing.\n* **Frame width and profile**: Choose frames with a similar width and profile to create a sense of consistency. This will help to create a sense of rhythm and flow in your gallery wall.\n\nBy using similar distressed wood frames for your vintage travel posters, you'll create a beautiful and cohesive collection that will add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your office.",
