Coordinate with their schedule: Make sure to confirm their schedule for the day and coordinate the delivery around their availability. You don't want the delivery to arrive when they're not home, which could ruin the surprise.\n\n2. Leave a note: When placing the order, request a personalized note to be included in the delivery. This could be a message that expresses your love and excitement for the delivered meal. If the meal is from their favorite restaurant, you could add a note like, \"I knew you were craving this dish, so I got it for you.\"\n\n3. Keep the delivery a secret: Work with the restaurant to request that the delivery driver does not reveal the sender's name until the meal is delivered. This will add an element of excitement and surprise for your partner.\n\n4. Choose the right timing: If your partner is having a stressful day, receiving a surprise meal delivery from you can be a great mood booster. Alternatively, you could choose to surprise them on a special occasion, like their birthday or anniversary.\n\n5. Capture their reaction: If possible, try to capture your partner's reaction when they receive the surprise meal delivery. If you can't be there in person, ask them to send you a picture or video of their reaction.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make them feel loved and special. So, be creative, thoughtful, and sensitive to their schedule and preferences.",
