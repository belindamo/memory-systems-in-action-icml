  "content": "Absolutely! Here are some tips for how to perfectly poach an egg:\n\n1. Start with a fresh egg: Fresh eggs with their thick whites and defined yolks are easier to poach compared to older ones. So, make sure to use fresh eggs.\n\n2. Use a deep pot of water: Bring a pot of water to a gentle simmer and add a tablespoon of vinegar to it. The vinegar helps the egg hold its shape and prevents the whites from spreading.\n\n3. Create a whirlpool: Use a spoon to create a whirlpool in the water, then crack the egg into the center of the pot. The swirling motion will ensure the egg white wraps around the yolk, creating a neater shape.\n\n4. Cook for 3-4 minutes: Cook the egg for about 3 to 4 minutes for a runny yolk, or 5 minutes for a firmer yolk. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the egg from the water.\n\n5. Serve immediately: Serve the poached egg on top of the avocado toast, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and enjoy!\n\nI hope these tips help you successfully poach an egg for your avocado toast. Good luck!",
