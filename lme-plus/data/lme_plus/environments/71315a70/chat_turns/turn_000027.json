I'm happy to help you with recommendations for water filters and purification tablets.\n\n**Water Filters:**\n\n1. **Sawyer Mini Water Filter**: A popular and highly-rated option, this filter is lightweight (2 oz), compact, and effective against bacteria, viruses, and particulate matter.\n2. **MSR TrailShot Water Filter**: Another popular choice, this filter is also lightweight (3 oz) and compact, with a high flow rate and effective against bacteria, viruses, and particulate matter.\n3. **Katadyn Hiker Water Filter**: A reliable and compact option, this filter is effective against bacteria, viruses, and particulate matter, and has a high flow rate.\n\n**Water Purification Tablets:**\n\n1. **AquaSafe Water Purification Tablets**: These tablets are effective against bacteria, viruses, and Giardia, and are a good option for emergency situations or when a filter isn't practical.\n2. **MSR AquaTabs Water Purification Tablets**: Another reliable option, these tablets are effective against bacteria, viruses, and Giardia, and have a long shelf life.\n3. **Potable Aqua Water Purification Tablets**: These tablets are a popular choice among backpackers, effective against bacteria, viruses, and Giardia, and have a long shelf life.\n\nWhen choosing between a water filter and purification tablets, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Weight and space**: If you're looking to save weight and space, purification tablets might be a better option.\n* **Flow rate**: If you need to treat large quantities of water quickly, a filter might be a better choice.\n* **Maintenance**: Filters require occasional cleaning and maintenance, while purification tablets are a one-time use solution.\n* **Effectiveness**: Both filters and purification tablets are effective against bacteria, viruses, and particulate matter, but filters may be more effective against Giardia and other parasites.\n\nFor Rocky Mountain National Park, where you'll be hiking at high elevations, it's essential to prioritize water treatment to avoid waterborne illnesses. You can also consider bringing a combination of both a filter and purification tablets as a backup, depending on your personal preferences and the specific conditions you expect to encounter.\n\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions for use and maintenance, and to test your water treatment system before your trip to ensure you're comfortable with its operation.\n\nDo you have any other questions about water treatment or backcountry travel in general?",
