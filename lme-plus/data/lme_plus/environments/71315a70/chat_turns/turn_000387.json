  "content": "As with any major shift in an industry, there may be some negative impacts on Michigan's economy as the auto industry adapts to changing technologies. For example, some jobs in traditional automotive manufacturing may become obsolete, while new jobs requiring different skills and expertise will emerge.\n\nHowever, Michigan's economy is already diversifying with the growth of other industries such as healthcare, tech, and education, which can help offset any negative impacts. Additionally, the state and automotive industry leaders are actively working to mitigate any negative employment impacts, such as offering retraining and skills development programs for affected workers.\n\nFurthermore, the shift towards new technologies in the auto industry offers significant opportunities for economic growth in the long run. Michigan is already positioned to be a leader in this area due to its history of manufacturing and engineering expertise, and it can leverage its existing resources to take advantage of new opportunities in the changing auto industry.\n\nOverall, while there may be some short-term negative impacts on Michigan's economy, the state is well-positioned to adapt to the changing landscape of the auto industry and reap long-term benefits from new technologies.",
