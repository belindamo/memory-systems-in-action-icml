Here are some tips to help you frame your posters and create a unified look:\n\n**Frame Style:**\n\n1. **Choose a consistent frame style**: Select a frame style that complements the era and aesthetic of your vintage posters. For example, a simple, distressed wood frame or a slim, metal frame with a vintage flair would work well for 1960s travel posters.\n2. **Consider a white or cream-colored mat**: A white or cream-colored mat can help to brighten and unify the appearance of your posters, especially if they have yellowed with age.\n3. **Opt for a simple, non-ornate frame**: Avoid overly ornate or decorative frames, as they can distract from the beauty of the posters themselves.\n\n**Frame Size and Scale:**\n\n1. **Choose frames that are proportional to the poster size**: Ensure that the frame is not too large or too small for the poster. A general rule of thumb is to leave about 1-2 inches of matting around the poster.\n2. **Consider using a consistent frame width**: Using frames with a consistent width can create a sense of continuity throughout your gallery wall.\n\n**Matting and Glazing:**\n\n1. **Use acid-free matting**: Acid-free matting will help preserve your posters and prevent them from yellowing or deteriorating over time.\n2. **Consider UV-filtering glass or acrylic**: UV-filtering glass or acrylic can help protect your posters from fading and damage caused by sunlight.\n3. **Use a spacer or fillet**: A spacer or fillet can be used to create a gap between the poster and the glazing, preventing the poster from touching the glass or acrylic and reducing the risk of damage.\n\n**Tips for a Cohesive Look:**\n\n1. **Use a consistent frame color**: Choose a frame color that complements the dominant colors in your posters. For example, if your posters have a lot of warm tones, a wood frame with a warm finish could work well.\n2. **Frame all posters similarly**: Use the same frame style, matting, and glazing for all your posters to create a cohesive look.\n3. **Consider creating a \"anchor\" frame**: Choose a larger or more striking frame for a central poster, and then use smaller or simpler frames for the surrounding posters to create a sense of balance.\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a beautifully framed collection of vintage travel posters that will add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your gallery wall.",
