I'd be happy to help you with gear recommendations.\n\nFor a waterproof jacket, you'll want a reliable and breathable option that can withstand the unpredictable mountain weather. Here are some key features to look for:\n\n1. **Waterproof and breathable membrane**: Look for a jacket with a waterproof and breathable membrane like Gore-Tex, eVent, or similar technology. This will ensure that moisture from outside is kept out while allowing your body heat and sweat to escape.\n2. **Waterproof rating**: Opt for a jacket with a high waterproof rating, measured in millimeters (mm). A rating of 20,000mm or higher is ideal for high-elevation hiking.\n3. **Wind resistance**: A wind-resistant jacket will help protect you from harsh mountain winds.\n4. **Adjustable hood**: A adjustable hood will help keep rain and wind out of your face.\n5. **Durable and lightweight materials**: Choose a jacket made from durable, lightweight materials that can withstand rough weather conditions.\n\nBased on these criteria, here are some top recommendations:\n\n1. **The North Face Venture 2 Jacket**: A popular choice among backpackers, this jacket features a 2-layer Gore-Tex membrane, a 20,000mm waterproof rating, and a adjustable hood.\n2. **Patagonia Tres 3-in-1 Parka**: This versatile jacket can be worn as a single layer or as a 3-in-1 system.

This jacket is known for its exceptional durability and wind resistance.\n4. **Marmot Precip Eco Jacket**: A more affordable option with a 2-layer Marmot M2 membrane, a 20,000mm waterproof rating, and a adjustable hood. This jacket is a great value for its price.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider factors like your budget, personal preferences (e.g., fit, color, features), and the specific conditions you expect to encounter on your trip.\n\nAdditionally, don't forget to pack other essential gear for your Rocky Mountain adventure, such as:\n\n* Insulating layers (fleece, down, or synthetic)\n* Base layers (moisture-wicking tops and leggings)\n* Hiking boots or trail running shoes\n* Sleeping bag and pad\n* Backpack and accessories (e.g., rain cover, trekking poles)\n* First aid kit and emergency shelter (e.g., space blanket, bivy sack)\n\nEnjoy your trip planning, and I hope you have an amazing time in Rocky Mountain National Park!",
