They often offer a wider variety of fruits and vegetables than larger corporate farms, including many heirloom varieties that are not commonly available in supermarkets. This makes shopping at farmer's markets or buying directly from small farmers a great way to discover new and unique produce, as well as support local agriculture. Additionally, small farmers may be more knowledgeable about the crops they grow and can offer valuable advice on how to pick, store and prepare their produce.
