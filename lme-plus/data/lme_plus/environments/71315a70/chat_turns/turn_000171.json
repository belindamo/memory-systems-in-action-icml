However, based on general traffic patterns in urban areas, rush hour traffic is typically busiest in the mornings and evenings during weekdays, as people commute to and from work. Congestion may also occur on major roads during holiday periods and special events.\n\nIf you're looking to avoid congestion, there may be alternate routes you can take depending on your destination and starting point. It's best to consult with local resources such as traffic reports, GPS apps, or city officials to identify the best alternate routes.",
