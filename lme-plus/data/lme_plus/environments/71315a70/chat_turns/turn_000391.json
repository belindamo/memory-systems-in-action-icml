Due to COVID-19, there has been a significant slowdown in production, which has had a ripple effect across the entire automotive supply chain.\n\nAs a response, the state government is taking measures to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic on businesses in the automotive industry. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the Michigan Small Business Development Center have both created programs to provide relief funding, grants, and loans to small- and medium-sized businesses in Michigan.\n\nFurthermore, the state government is working with major employers in the automotive industry, such as Ford and General Motors, to ensure that they have the resources they need to remain solvent during this challenging time. Michigan officials have been actively seeking ways to restart production while ensuring the protection of workers in the factories.\n\nThe government is also working with healthcare providers to ensure a safe and healthy return to work for automotive workers. It has created comprehensive guidelines for workplace safety in the automotive industry, including protocols for cleaning and disinfecting workspaces and mandatory use of personal protective equipment.\n\nOverall, although the COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges for the auto industry and the economy of Michigan, the state is taking steps to address the ongoing challenges caused by the virus, providing necessary support to businesses, and ensuring that workplace safety is prioritized when activities are restarted.",
