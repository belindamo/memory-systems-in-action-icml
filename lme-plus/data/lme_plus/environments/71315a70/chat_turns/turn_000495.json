  "content": "There are several easy ways to start eating sustainably and reduce the impact of overfishing:\n\n1. Choose sustainable seafood: You can choose seafood that is certified by reliable organizations such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC). These organizations ensure that seafood products are sourced from sustainable fisheries or farms.\n\n2. Avoid endangered species: Avoid purchasing seafood from endangered or unsustainable species. You can check the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch List or the Seafood Guide app to find out which species are safe to consume.\n\n3. Purchase locally sourced seafood: Local seafood may be a better option as it is likely to be caught or farmed sustainably and has a lower carbon footprint than seafood that is imported from other countries.\n\n4. Reduce meat consumption: By eating less meat, you can reduce the demand for animal feed which often includes unsustainable seafood, and as a bonus, you'll be reducing your carbon footprint.\n\n5. Choose seafood substitutes: There are several plant-based seafood substitutes available such as tofu, tempeh or seaweed that can be a great alternative to consuming seafood.\n\nBy making these small changes to your diet and shopping habits, you can contribute to reducing overfishing and preserving our marine ecosystem.",
