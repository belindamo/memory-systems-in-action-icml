A good cobbler can fix the loose heel and make your shoes look like new again.\n\nAs for your Air Force Ones, it's no surprise they got muddy from a day at the park! Cleaning them properly will help maintain their appearance and extend their lifespan. You can try using a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently remove any loose dirt and debris from the surface. Then, use a mild soap and warm water to clean the shoes. Be sure to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could damage the materials.\n\nIf you're not comfortable cleaning them yourself, you could take them to a shoe repair shop or a sneaker cleaning service. They'll be able to give them a thorough cleaning and make them look like new again.\n\nRemember to condition your Air Force Ones after cleaning to keep the materials soft and supple. This will help prevent them from cracking or drying out over time.\n\nTake care of your shoes, and they'll take care of you!",
