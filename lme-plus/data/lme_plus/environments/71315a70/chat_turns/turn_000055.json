The registration process is free, and it's a great way to help recover your bike if it's ever stolen.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider registering your bike with the National Bike Registry, which is a national database that helps recover stolen bikes. This service is optional, but it can increase the chances of recovering your bike if it's stolen.\n\nRemember to also take photos of your bike and keep a record of its serial number, make, and model in a safe place. This will help you identify your bike if it's stolen and make it easier to report to the authorities.\n\nOnce you have all the necessary documents, you can start shopping for your new bike and enjoy the beautiful Berkeley bike-friendly streets!",
