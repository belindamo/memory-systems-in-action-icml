If you're not much of a cook and looking for something easy to prepare, the Greek yogurt bowl, cottage cheese and fruit, and avocado toast with egg are all simple and quick options that don't require much cooking. \n\nJust mix together the ingredients, slice some fruit, and you're good to go! Overnight oats are also very easy to prepare - just mix the ingredients in a jar or cup the night before and refrigerate. You can also find pre-made smoothie mixes or protein powders to make the protein smoothie even easier to prepare. \n\nI hope that helps!",
