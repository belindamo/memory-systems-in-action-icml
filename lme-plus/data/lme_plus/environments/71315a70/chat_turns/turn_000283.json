  "content": "There is not yet a clear answer on how genetics influences sexual orientation. While scientists have proposed genetic, hormonal, and neurological factors may contribute to sexual orientation, no specific gene or set of genes has been identified as determining attraction to a particular gender. Some studies have suggested a correlation between genetics and sexual orientation, particularly for male homosexuality, but more research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors that influence sexual orientation. It is important to note that sexual orientation is multifaceted and not solely determined by genetic factors.",
