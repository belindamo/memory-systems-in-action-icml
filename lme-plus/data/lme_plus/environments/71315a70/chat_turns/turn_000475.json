It's possible that someone found your Reebok CrossFit shoes and turned them in, and they might be waiting for you there.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check the lost and found section, especially if you're not sure where you last had your shoes. You can also ask the gym staff if anyone has turned in a pair of blue Reebok CrossFit shoes.\n\nEven if you're not sure if you'll find them, it's worth a try.
