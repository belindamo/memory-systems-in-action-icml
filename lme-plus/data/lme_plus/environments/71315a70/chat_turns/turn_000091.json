Here's an updated version of the email with your suggested changes:\n\nSubject: Streamlining Your Team's Meetings with Fellow\n\nHi [Name],\n\nI hope you're doing well and finding value in using Fellow to manage your team's meetings! I noticed that while you're using the platform, you haven't yet taken advantage of all its features to streamline your meetings.\n\nOne of the most powerful features of Fellow is the ability to create and share meeting agendas ahead of time, ensuring everyone is on the same page and meetings stay on track. Fellow also integrates with other productivity tools, like Slack and the Google Meet extension, making it easy to incorporate it into your team's workflow.\n\nIf you're interested in getting the most out of Fellow and streamlining your meetings, I'd love to schedule a 20-minute custom session with you. During this session, I'll review your workspace setup, show you how to use Fellow's advanced features and integrations, and provide custom best practices to help you create effective meeting agendas.\n\nLet me know if this sounds helpful, or you can schedule directly using this link: [insert scheduling link].\n\nThanks for using Fellow!\n[Your Name]",
