      "content": "Yes, the best time of year for whale watching in Norway is generally from November to February, which is the winter season. During this time, humpback whales, orcas, and other types of whales migrate to feed on herring in the waters off the Norwegian coast. The peak of the whale-watching season in Norway is usually in December and January, though the specific timing can vary depending on the location and weather conditions.\n\nIt's important to note that whale watching companies in Norway follow strict guidelines to ensure the safety of both the whales and the tourists. They use small, electric boats to reduce noise pollution and avoid disturbing the whales. They also maintain a respectful distance from the whales and follow international guidelines for responsible whale watching. By choosing a responsible whale watching company, you can have an unforgettable experience while also contributing to sustainable tourism efforts in Norway."
