I'd be happy to help you with that! Chicken tikka masala is a popular Indian-inspired dish that's rich, creamy, and utterly delicious. Here's a simple and flavorful recipe you can try:\n\n**Creamy Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the chicken:\n\n* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\n* 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt\n* 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n* 2 teaspoons garam masala\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander\n* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\nFor the sauce:\n\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 2 medium onions, thinly sliced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes\n* 1 cup chicken broth\n* 1/2 cup heavy cream\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* 2 teaspoons garam masala\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Fresh cilantro, for garnish\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.\n2. Preheat the grill or oven to cook the chicken. Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Grill or bake the chicken until cooked through, about 6-8 minutes. Let it rest for a few minutes before cutting into bite-sized pieces.\n3. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they're lightly browned and caramelized, about 8-10 minutes.\n4. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.\n5. Stir in the diced tomatoes, chicken broth, heavy cream, tomato paste, garam masala, cumin, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer.\n6. Add the cooked chicken to the saucepan and stir to coat with the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is fully coated.\n7. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n8. Serve the chicken tikka masala over basmati rice or with naan bread, garnished with fresh cilantro.\n\nThis recipe makes about 4-6 servings. You can adjust the level of spiciness to your liking, and also add other spices or herbs to give it your own twist.\n\nHow does this recipe sound?
