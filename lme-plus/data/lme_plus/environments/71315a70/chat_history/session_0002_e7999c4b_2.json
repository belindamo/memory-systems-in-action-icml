A rating of 20,000mm or higher is ideal for high-elevation hiking.\n3. **Wind resistance**: A wind-resistant jacket will help protect you from harsh mountain winds.\n4. **Adjustable hood**: A adjustable hood will help keep rain and wind out of your face.\n5. **Durable and lightweight materials**: Choose a jacket made from durable, lightweight materials that can withstand rough weather conditions.\n\nBased on these criteria, here are some top recommendations:\n\n1. **The North Face Venture 2 Jacket**: A popular choice among backpackers, this jacket features a 2-layer Gore-Tex membrane, a 20,000mm waterproof rating, and a adjustable hood.\n2. **Patagonia Tres 3-in-1 Parka**: This versatile jacket can be worn as a single layer or as a 3-in-1 system.

You can also consider bringing a combination of both a filter and purification tablets as a backup, depending on your personal preferences and the specific conditions you expect to encounter.\n\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions for use and maintenance, and to test your water treatment system before your trip to ensure you're comfortable with its operation.\n\nDo you have any other questions about water treatment or backcountry travel in general?"
