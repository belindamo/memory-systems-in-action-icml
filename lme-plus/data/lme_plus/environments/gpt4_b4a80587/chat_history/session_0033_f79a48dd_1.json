It's possible that the sale might have ended by the time you visited the mall, which could explain why the laptop you wanted was out of stock.\n\nNow, about upcoming sales and discounts on HP laptops:\n\n1. **Cyber Monday**: Although Black Friday has passed, Cyber Monday is just around the corner (November 28th). You can expect online retailers like HP's website, Amazon, Best Buy, and others to offer discounts on laptops during this event.\n2. **HP's Holiday Sales**: HP usually runs holiday sales and promotions on their website during the winter season. Keep an eye on their website for discounts on popular laptop models.\n3. **Green Monday**: Green Monday, which typically falls on the second Monday in December, is considered one of the best days to buy electronics, including laptops. Expect discounts from online retailers during this time.\n4. **Pre-Christmas Sales**: Many retailers offer pre-Christmas sales to drive sales before the holiday season. You might find discounts on HP laptops during this time.\n5. **Deal Days**: Keep an eye on online retailers like Amazon, which often runs Deal Days or Lightning Deals on specific products, including laptops.
