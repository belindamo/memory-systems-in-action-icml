Here are a few ways that restaurants are improving their menu offerings:\n\n1. Allergen-friendly options: Some restaurants offer specific dishes or menu items that are free from common allergens, such as nuts, gluten, or dairy. This can make it easier for customers with allergies to find safe options.\n\n2. Clearly labeled menus: Many restaurants now label their menus with the allergens contained in each dish. This can help customers make informed decisions about what to order.\n\n3. Online allergen information: Some restaurants provide detailed allergen information on their websites or in a separate menu booklet. This can include information about cross-contamination risks and steps taken to prevent exposure to allergens.\n\n4. Customization options: Some restaurants are willing to customize dishes to accommodate specific allergies or dietary restrictions. This can be a good option for customers who are limited in their choices due to allergies.\n\nIf you have a specific allergy, it may be helpful to research restaurants ahead of time and call ahead to inquire about allergen policies and menu options. Don't be afraid to ask for more information or to make special requests. Ultimately, it's important to prioritize your safety and health when dining out."
