These symptoms result from an overgrowth of ectopic endometrial tissue2. Endometriosis is commonly misdiagnosed for several reasons, the most notable being that pelvic pain is a symptom which overlaps with other gynecological diseases, and the lack of knowledge regarding its pathogenesis3.\n\nHowever, research demonstrates that endometriosis is a partly genetically inherited disease (with a heritability of ~50%)4,5 By defining the genetic profile of endometriosis, genetic screening could provide an alternative diagnosis method and eliminate unnecessary diagnostic procedures, which would facilitate patients receiving the treatment they require.\n\nRecently, genome research tools have been developed, such as genome-wide association (GWA) studies and exome sequencing. Through GWA studies, several candidate genes associated with endometriosis risk have been discovered, which will be discussed further on in light of a systematic literature review on endometriosis GWA studies. On the other hand, exome sequencing of endometriosis has been conducted in very few studies; there are no relevant systematic literature reviews published to date. Thus, a case-control study in Greece (Matalliotakis et al, 2017)6 will be discussed to illustrate the importance of investing in exome sequencing.\n\nIn light of this research, this paper proposes a novel combined research method of GWA and exome sequencing studies, addressing the lack of multidisciplinary studies on this topic. This could contribute to identifying the endometriosis genome, which is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.\n\nA systematic review of GWA-studies of endometriosis\nA GWA study takes a large population of patients that share a characteristic (ie, a disease) and a population of controls that do not share this characteristic. Then, the most frequently appearing genetic risk variants in these genomes are highlighted and considered as possible contributing genes to this characteristic\u2014in this case endometriosis risk. These highlighted genes are the candidate genes.\n\nIn 2020, Cardoso et al7 published a systematic literature review on endometriosis. The goal of this systematic review was to describe the candidate genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified thus far, and to discuss the conflicting results of these 15 studies. The results of this review pointed to 11 candidate genes or SNPs that might be associated with an increased endometriosis risk. However, the authors identified a number of confounding factors, the most notable being the overrepresentation of Caucasian patients, and the small sample sizes of many studies. Therefore, the authors emphasize the importance of conducting GWA studies on large populations of differing ethnic backgrounds to accurately identify the risk variants specific to these distinct populations.\n\nExome sequencing of endometriosis: a study in Greece\nSimilar to GWA studies, exome sequencing selects a patient population and a control group. A specific portion of DNA of these populations are sequenced, which contain the loci of the candidate genes found through GWA studies. Then, a correlation between the possible risk variants and the disease is determined. Mutations in protein-coding DNA sequences contribute to increased disease risk. Therefore, exome sequencing does not sequence the entire genome\u2014which includes junk DNA as well\u2014but only the exome. Therefore, exome sequencing is a cost-effective approach to genome research, which is interesting for conducting these studies in larger quantities, globally.\n\nIn a population of 166 Greek women with endometriosis and 150 controls, Matalliotakis et al (2017)6 examined three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine if they were correlated with endometriosis risk. These SNPs were rs7521902, rs10859871, rs11031006 which map to the genetic loci WNT4, VEZT, and FSHB, respectively. These SNPs were selected based on a meta-analysis of GWA studies8. Their findings indicate that the allele variants located on the loci WNT4 and FSHB could be correlated with endometriosis risk. These results are promising and could extend our knowledge of endometriosis genomics. However, they may not be applicable to every population.\n\nThe importance of combining GWAS and exome sequencing, and discussing study parameters\nGWA studies are a fairly novel tool to quickly identify the allele frequency in patients\u2019 genomes to find a relatively plausible set of candidate genes, which subsequently can be examined in exome sequencing studies. However, there are underlying genetic factors that complicate the study of endometriosis genomics. For instance, epistatic reactions, where one gene variant can \u201covershadow\u201d another gene, thereby rendering the causal gene unidentifiable1. This is, as of date, impossible to examine through the software used in GWA studies due to limited computational power. Thus, the use of exome sequencing to fill in these gaps of genetical information will be crucial to unravel the endometriosis genome1.\n\nHowever, exome sequencing remains critically dependent on reliable GWA data. More specifically, small sample size, lack of ethnic diversity, and incomplete patient characteristics are detrimental to the proper interpretation of a GWA study1. In the study by Matalliotakis et al (2017)6, candidate genes association rates differed according to clinical disease stage. Thus, Lalami et al1 insist that classifying patients according to their clinical characteristics is a key component to improving the detection of relevant candidate genes.\n\nThe inheritable nature of endometriosis has been well established for decades. The study of genome-wide association has improved our understanding of the genetic basis of this disease. However, endometriosis is heterogeneous and complex; its genomics have yet to be extensively researched to the point where these findings can be utilized in clinical practice. The limited amount of research published to date is a testament to this. Clearly, additional exome sequencing studies are required.\n\nOverall, researchers agree on the need to conduct GWA studies in large, ethnically diverse, and clinically well characterized patient populations.. This is expected to yield a selection of reliable candidate genes which in turn may be investigated thoroughly in smaller (familial) populations through exome sequencing. Narrowing down this selection will ensure that exome sequencing can be utilized cost-effectively, therefore more studies may be conducted. Consequently, our knowledge of its pathogenesis can be broadened. This would lead to opportunities in developing medicine for treatment and genetic screenings for diagnoses. As a result, women with endometriosis would benefit from this advancement in women\u2019s medical health.\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n1. Lalami I, Abo C, Borghese B, Chapron C, Vaiman D.
