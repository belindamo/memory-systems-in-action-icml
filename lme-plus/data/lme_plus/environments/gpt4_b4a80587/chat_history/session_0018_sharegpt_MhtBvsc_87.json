Go to the Amplify Console dashboard and select the app you want to add the service to.\n2. In the left-hand navigation, select \"Backend environments\".\n3. Click on the environment you want to add the service to.\n4. Click on \"Add backend API, function or resource\".\n5. Select the service you want to add, such as Amazon Polly.\n6. Follow the prompts to configure the service and add it to your Amplify app.\n\nNote that the steps may vary slightly depending on the service you are adding, but this should give you a general idea of how to add backend services from the Amplify Console."

      "content": "Sure, here are the steps to choose the backend on Amplify Studio:\n\n1. Go to the Amplify Console and click on the \"Get started\" button under \"Host web app\".\n2. Select the repository you want to use for your app and click on the \"Next\" button.\n3. On the \"Add backend environment\" page, select the type of backend environment you want to use. You can choose from AWS Mobile Hub, AWS Amplify CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.\n4. If you choose AWS Amplify CLI, you will need to provide the path to your project's root directory, the name of the environment, and the editor you want to use. If you choose AWS Mobile Hub or AWS CloudFormation, you will be prompted to provide more details about your backend environment.\n5. After you have configured your backend environment, you can choose the services you want to add to your project. For example, you can add Amazon Polly to enable text-to-speech functionality or Amazon S3 to store and retrieve files.\n6. Once you have added the backend services you need, you can configure them by selecting the \"Backend environments\" tab in the left menu and then selecting the environment you want to configure. From there, you can manage your backend resources, configure APIs and data stores, and set up authentication and authorization.\n7. Finally, you can connect your Amplify Studio app to your backend by selecting the \"Connect backend\" button in the top right corner of the Amplify Studio editor. From there, you can select your backend environment and choose the APIs and data stores you want to use in your app.\n\nThat's it! With these steps, you should be able to choose and configure your backend services on Amplify Studio and connect them to your app."

Select the platform for your mobile app (iOS, Android, or React Native).\n5. Choose your preferred development framework (e.g. Swift for iOS or Java/Kotlin for Android).\n6. Enter a name for your app and click \"Create App\".\n7. Once your app is created, navigate to the \"Backend Environment\" section and click \"Create new environment\".\n8. Choose a name for your environment and select the type of environment you want to create (e.g. \"Dev\" or \"Prod\").\n9. Choose the backend services you want to include in your environment (e.g. Amazon Polly for text-to-speech and Amazon S3 for file storage).\n10. Configure the settings for each service you selected (e.g. the S3 bucket name and region).\n11. Click \"Save and Deploy\" to create your backend environment.\n12. Once your backend environment is created, you can use Amplify Studio to create your mobile app's user interface and connect it to your backend services."
