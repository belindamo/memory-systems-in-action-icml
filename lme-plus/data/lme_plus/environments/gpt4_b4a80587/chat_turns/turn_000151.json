In situations like these, it can be challenging to stay motivated, and it's reasonable to focus on taking care of yourself.\n\nHere are some suggestions that could help you in this situation:\n\n1. Protect your well-being: Ensure that you are taking care of yourself. This might include setting healthy work boundaries, practicing self-care, and maintaining non-work-related interests that are meaningful to you.\n\n2. Build your support network: Connect with colleagues who share your concerns, build healthy relationships with supportive colleagues and trusted friends outside of work.\n\n3. Assess your career goals: Evaluate your career goals and plan for what you want to do next. This could include seeking leadership, changing companies or industries or taking a career break to focus on your skills and wellbeing.\n\n4. Build skills: Continue to build your skills, knowledge, and experience that are interesting to you or could help elevate your career.\n\n5. Find allies: Reach out to those who can provide you with guidance and support, whether that includes a supervisor, mentor, or HR representative. Having allies at work can make you feel respected and valued.\n\n6. Consider finding a new job: If the situation is incredibly toxic, and the work environment is unbearable, sometimes it's best to leave for your well-being. Resist the temptation to leave impulsively and do some research before finding the right fit for you.\n\nRemember, the priority is to look after yourself and your goals, whether it means finding a new position or remaining in your current role to provide security for your life outside of work.",
