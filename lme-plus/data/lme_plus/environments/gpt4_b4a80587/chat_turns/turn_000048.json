The key is to balance the cool tone of the gray with the warmth of the beige. Here's a tip:\n\n* If your gray rug has a blue or purple undertone, look for a beige with a slightly warm, yellow undertone to create a nice contrast.\n* If your gray rug has a brown or beige undertone, you can opt for a beige with a slightly cooler, pink undertone to create a harmonious look.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've rearranged your room and it's made a huge difference! Rearranging furniture can completely refresh the space and give it a new feel. Did you try any specific organizing or decluttering techniques, or was it more about reconfiguring the layout?\n\nWhen it comes to pairing your beige walls with your gray rug, consider the following:\n\n* Add warm accents: Introduce warm-toned furniture, such as wood pieces or upholstery with a beige or golden undertone, to create a cozy atmosphere.\n* Balance with textures: Mix different textures, like smooth walls, plush rug, and chunky throw blankets, to add depth and visual interest to the space.\n* Bring in plants: Greenery can help tie the whole look together and add a touch of natural beauty to your room.\n\nRemember, the key to a successful design is balance and harmony. You can always experiment with different combinations and see what works best for your space.\n\nHow's your gray rug looking in the room? Is it a light, dark, or medium gray?",
