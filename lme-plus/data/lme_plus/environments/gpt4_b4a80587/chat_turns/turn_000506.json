  "content": "In risk analysis, the level of trust in how something will behave is determined through multiple methods such as testing, simulation, past performance data, design and implementation analysis, and expert judgment. The goal of risk analysis is to identify potential hazards and assess the likelihood and impact of those hazards. Based on this information, a risk management plan can be developed to determine the level of risk that is acceptable and identify the measures that should be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The process is iterative and involves ongoing monitoring and assessment to ensure that the level of risk remains acceptable.",
