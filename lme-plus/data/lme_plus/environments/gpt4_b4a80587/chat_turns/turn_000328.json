I'm thrilled to hear you had a great time learning about Thai cuisine and cooking techniques.\n\nAs a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences, taste buds, or the ability to take cooking classes. I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries. However, I'm always happy to help you explore new cuisines, cooking techniques, and recipes!\n\nThai cuisine is incredibly diverse and delicious, and it's great that you got to learn about it hands-on. Green curry is a classic dish, and mastering the art of cooking perfect jasmine rice is a valuable skill. Did you know that Thai cuisine is known for its balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy flavors? The combination of these flavors, along with the use of fresh herbs and aromatics, is what makes Thai dishes so aromatic and flavorful.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more Thai recipes or cooking classes, I'd be happy to provide you with some resources or recommendations. There are plenty of online cooking classes, recipe websites, and cookbooks that can help you continue your culinary journey.\n\nRemember, cooking is all about experimentation, practice, and having fun.
