They source high-quality beans and offer a variety of brewing methods.\n3. **Sightglass Coffee** (268 7th St): A beautifully designed coffee shop with a focus on seasonal, small-batch coffee. They're known for their delicious pour-overs and espresso drinks.\n4. **Cafe Union** (213 3rd St): A cozy, independently owned coffee shop with a warm atmosphere and a variety of coffee drinks.\n5. **The Creamery** (301 3rd St): A unique spot that serves coffee, sandwiches, and... ice cream!
