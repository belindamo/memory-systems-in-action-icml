  "content": "It is possible that Augustine's former colleagues felt threatened by his Christian beliefs. After all, at the time, the dominant religious and philosophical traditions were rooted in Paganism and Greek philosophy, and Christianity was still a relatively new and growing movement.\n\nAdditionally, Augustine was a respected and influential figure in the academic and intellectual circles of his time. His conversion to Christianity challenged the prevailing cultural norms and ideas, and may have been seen as a rejection of the intellectual pursuits and philosophical traditions that his colleagues held dear.\n\nFurthermore, Augustine's writing after his conversion was often critical of the ideas and beliefs that his former colleagues held, and this may have contributed to their criticism of him and his faith.\n\nOverall, there were likely a variety of factors that contributed to Augustine's former colleagues' criticism of his Christian beliefs. It is difficult to know for certain what their motivations were, but it is clear that Augustine's conversion was a significant and controversial event in the intellectual and religious landscape of his time.",
