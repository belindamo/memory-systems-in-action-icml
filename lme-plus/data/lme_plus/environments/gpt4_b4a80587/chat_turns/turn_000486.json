  "content": "System memory corruption can be a potential cause of a system exception. However, it's generally not feasible for developers to handle exceptions specifically related to memory corruption around every function call.\n\nMemory corruption is often a result of low-level issues, such as bugs in the operating system, hardware problems, or issues in the underlying memory management system. In many cases, these types of issues can only be resolved by fixing the underlying cause, rather than by adding exception handling to your application code.\n\nThat being said, it's still important to handle exceptions that may occur in your application code and log them appropriately. This can help you detect and diagnose issues that may be caused by memory corruption or other low-level problems. Additionally, it can also provide a better user experience by gracefully handling errors and allowing the application to continue running, if possible.",
