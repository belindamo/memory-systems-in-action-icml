  "content": "Risk analysis involves evaluating the likelihood and potential consequences of various events. It is not a guarantee of future outcomes, but rather an assessment of potential risks based on available information and historical data. The goal is to minimize risk and make informed decisions based on the best available information. It is not accurate to say that we don't know until we try, as risk analysis aims to anticipate potential outcomes and make proactive measures to prevent or mitigate harm.",
