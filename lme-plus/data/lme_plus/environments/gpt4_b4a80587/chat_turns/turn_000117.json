The image quality of a prime lens like the 50mm f/1.8 is often superior to a kit lens, and it's great that you're already seeing the difference.\n\nUsing the lens on your coastal trip was a great idea! The coastal scenery and natural light must have provided a fantastic backdrop for capturing portraits of your friends. I'm sure the lens performed beautifully in those conditions.\n\nManual focus can be a bit challenging, especially when working with moving subjects or in low-light conditions. However, with practice, you'll develop a sense of intuition about focusing, and it will become second nature.\n\nHere are a few additional tips to help you improve your manual focus skills:\n\n1. **Use the focus peaking feature**: If your camera has a focus peaking feature, enable it to help you identify the areas in focus.\n2. **Use the lens's focus scale**: The lens's focus scale can help you estimate the distance between your subject and the camera, making it easier to set the focus.\n3. **Zone focusing**: Divide your frame into zones and pre-focus on a specific zone before your subject enters it. This technique can be helpful when working with moving subjects.\n4. **Practice with static subjects**: Start by practicing with static subjects, like objects or still-life compositions, to get a feel for the focus ring and the lens's behavior.\n5. **Check your focus often**: Regularly check your focus by zooming in on the camera's LCD screen or using the camera's built-in focus magnification feature.\n\nRemember, the more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with manual focus. Keep experimenting, and you'll soon be capturing stunning portraits with ease!\n\nHow did you find the coastal trip, by the way? Was there a particular moment or shot that stood out to you?",
