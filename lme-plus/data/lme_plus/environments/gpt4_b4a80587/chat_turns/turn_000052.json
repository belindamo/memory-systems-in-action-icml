I'm really excited to get started on painting now.\n\nAnd yes, the Marie Kondo method is amazing! I was a bit skeptical at first, but it's really helped me focus on what's important and let go of things that don't bring me joy. I ended up donating a bunch of stuff to charity, which felt great.\n\nI rearranged my room about three weeks ago, over a lazy Sunday afternoon. It was one of those days where I just decided to tackle the clutter and mess, and I ended up spending hours sorting through everything and reorganizing my space. It was a bit exhausting, but so worth it in the end.\n\nSpeaking of which, I was thinking of adding some new decorative pieces to my room to really tie everything together. Do you have any suggestions for what might work well with the beige walls, gray rug, and white furniture? I'm thinking maybe some plants, but I'm not sure what else...\"",
