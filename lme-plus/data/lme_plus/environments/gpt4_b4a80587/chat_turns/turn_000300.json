  "content": "You're thinking ahead and planning for contingencies. That's a great attitude to have, especially when it comes to market setup.\n\nArriving at 6:30 am should give you plenty of time to set up your stall, get organized, and be ready for customers by 7 am. It's always better to err on the side of caution and build in some extra time for unexpected delays, like traffic, parking issues, or forgotten items.\n\nRemember to also plan for some time to grab a coffee, stretch your legs, and get yourself ready for the busy day ahead. You got this!\n\nBy the way, have you considered creating a pre-market checklist to help you stay organized and ensure you don't forget anything important? It might be helpful to make a list of all the items you need to bring, including products, displays, cash box, credit card reader, and any other essentials. That way, you can quickly check off each item as you load up your vehicle, and you'll be confident that you have everything you need for a successful market day.",
