  "content": "Investigating areas for improvement before an incident occurs is a proactive approach and it helps to mitigate the risk of incidents caused by planned and accepted risk events. This process is part of continuous improvement and it helps to ensure that systems, processes and procedures are as robust as possible. This can involve regular risk assessments, simulations, testing, and other forms of evaluation. The idea is to proactively identify and address areas of weakness before they result in a failure, rather than waiting for a failure to occur and then trying to fix it.",
