  "content": "Drawing the line on where and when to handle exceptions in your application code depends on various factors, including the nature of the exception, the context in which it occurs, the criticality of the operation, and the desired user experience.\n\nFor example, exceptions that are related to user input or data validation should generally be handled and handled immediately to provide a better user experience. Exceptions that are related to critical operations, such as database transactions or file I/O, should also be handled to ensure that the data remains consistent and the application can continue to operate normally.\n\nOn the other hand, some exceptions, such as those related to memory corruption, may be more difficult to handle and may require a more systemic solution, such as fixing the underlying issue or monitoring the system to detect and resolve problems before they occur.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to balance the need to handle exceptions and provide a good user experience with the need to minimize the amount of exception handling code, while also ensuring that critical issues are addressed in a timely manner.",
