The sun was shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the water. C took off her shoes and dug her toes into the soft grass, letting out a content sigh.\n\nAlex leaned back on his hands and closed his eyes, soaking up the warmth of the sun. Elena fiddled with a blade of grass, twirling it between her fingers. The three of them sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere.\n\n\"I love coming here,\" C said eventually, breaking the silence. \"It always feels so peaceful and calming.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know what you mean,\" Alex replied, opening his eyes. \"It's like all the stress and worries just melt away when you're by the water.\"\n\nElena nodded in agreement. \"It's like everything else just fades into the background and all that matters is this moment,\" she said quietly.\n\nC reached out and placed a hand on Elena's shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze. \"I'm sorry about what happened with Anna,\" she said softly. \"I know it's been hard for all of us, but I'm here for you if you ever want to talk about it.\"\n\nElena gave her a small smile. \"Thanks, C,\" she said. \"I appreciate it.\"\n\nThe three of them fell into another comfortable silence, each lost in their own thoughts. After a while, C stood up and held out a hand to Alex. \"Come on, let's go for a swim,\" she said with a grin.\n\nAlex chuckled and took her hand, letting her pull him to his feet. The three of them made their way to the water's edge, the cool lake water a refreshing contrast to the warm sun on their skin. They splashed around and swam for a while, laughing and enjoying each other's company.\n\nAs the sun began to set, they made their way back to the grassy spot where they had started. They lay down, letting the warm sun and the gentle sound of the water lull them into a peaceful slumber. For a little while, at least, they were able to forget about the weight of their loss and just be present in the moment.",
