Lightroom is an excellent choice for editing, and it's great that you're comfortable with it.\n\nAchieving a natural look with vibrant colors is a great goal for your coastal shots. Since you've already experimented with different apertures and shutter speeds for your flower and tree photos, you might want to focus on refining your editing skills to bring out the best in your coastal images.\n\nHere are a few more tips specifically for editing coastal photos in Lightroom:\n\n1. **Use the \"Camera Calibration\" panel**: This panel allows you to adjust the tone and color response of your camera. Since you've shot with a specific camera, you can use the built-in profiles to get a more accurate representation of the colors.\n2. **Adjust the \"Basic\" panel**: Pay attention to the \"Exposure\", \"Contrast\", and \"Highlights\" sliders. Coastal scenes often benefit from a slight contrast boost to separate the sky from the land. Be careful not to overdo it, as you don't want to lose details in the shadows.\n3. **Use the \"Tone Curve\"**: The tone curve is a powerful tool for adjusting the brightness and contrast of your image. You can use the \"Point Curve\" to add a gentle S-curve to your image, which can help separate the tones and add depth.\n4. **Local Adjustments**: Use the \"Graduated Filter\" and \"Adjustment Brush\" tools to make local adjustments to the sky, land, and sea. This will help you balance the exposure and color across the image.\n5. **Vibrance and Saturation**: Use the \"Vibrance\" and \"Saturation\" sliders to enhance the colors of the coast. Be careful not to overdo it, as you don't want to make the image look unnatural.\n6. **Split Toning**: Consider adding a subtle split tone to your image to enhance the blues and greens of the coast. You can use the \"Split Toning\" panel to add a warm tone to the shadows and a cool tone to the highlights.\n\nFor your coastal highway shots, you might also want to experiment with the following:\n\n1. **Panoramic Stitching**: If you have multiple shots of the same scene, you can use Lightroom's \"Photo Merge\" feature to stitch them together into a panoramic image.\n2. **Remove haze and fog**: If you shot on a misty or foggy day, you can use the \"Dehaze\" tool to remove some of the haze and bring out the details in the distance.\n\nI'm excited to hear that you have a collection of stunning coastal shots! Do you have a favorite spot or moment from your trip that you're particularly proud of capturing?",
