She stretched and made her way out of bed, careful not to disturb Elena, who was still asleep beside her. C made her way to the kitchen and started a pot of tea, letting the aroma of the spices fill the small apartment.\n\nAs she waited for the water to boil, C's thoughts turned to Alex. She had been so worried about hen after Anna's death, but hen seemed to be slowly improving. C hoped that spending some time together would help hen heal even more.\n\nJust as C was pouring the steaming tea into mugs, Elena and Alex stumbled into the kitchen, still half-asleep. C grinned at them and handed them each a mug. \"Good morning,\" she said. \"I made us some spicy tea to wake us up.\"\n\nElena gratefully accepted the mug and took a sip, while Alex simply nodded and leaned against the counter. C could see the pain in hen's eyes and knew that hen was struggling with Anna's death. She wrapped an arm around hen and gave a gentle squeeze.\n\n\"It's going to be okay,\" C said softly. \"We're here for you. And we'll get through this together.\"\n\nAlex nodded and took a deep breath, trying to push back the darkness that seemed to be constantly lurking at the edges of hens mind. Hen knew C was right - it was going to take time, but hen would get through this. Hen just had to keep moving forward, one day at a time.\n\nAs the three of them sat together in the kitchen, sipping their tea and passing around a vaping pen, a sense of warmth and companionship filled the room. They knew that they had each other, and that was all that mattered. They would face the future together, no matter what it held.",
