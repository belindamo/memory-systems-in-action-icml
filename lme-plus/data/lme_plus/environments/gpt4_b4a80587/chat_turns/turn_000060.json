  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot offer opinions, but I can provide more information about the academic promotion process. Although teaching is an essential part of an academic career, it is not the only criterion for promotion. Academic promotion is usually based on a combination of criteria including research, teaching, and service to the university or community. Candidates must also meet the minimum academic qualifications specified by the university, such as holding a specific advanced degree or certificate in the relevant field. While your teaching experience is valuable, it is likely that you will need to meet other criteria as well. Therefore, you may want to inquire about the specific promotion criteria at your university to determine your eligibility and, if appropriate, work on developing the necessary qualifications for promotion.",
