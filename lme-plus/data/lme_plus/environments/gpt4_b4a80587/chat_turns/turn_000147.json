Take breaks: Even if your company doesn't encourage them, take breaks throughout the day to relax and recharge. Use this time to do something that will make you feel better, like eating a healthy snack or taking a walk.\n\n2. Practice self-care: It's important to take care of yourself physically and emotionally, even if your company doesn't prioritize it. Get enough sleep, exercise, eat a healthy diet, and take time for hobbies and self-care activities you enjoy.\n\n3. Find meaning in your work: Try to find purpose and fulfillment in your work beyond just the tasks themselves. For example, focus on the people you are helping through your work or the skills you are learning that could help you in the future.\n\n4. Set boundaries: Don't let your employer take advantage of you. Set boundaries on your workload, and don't let them violate your work-life balance. Create space to care for yourself and prioritize non-work priorities.\n\n5. Consider speaking with HR or a supervisor: If you feel comfortable, consider discussing your concerns about workload, burnout, or workplace culture with HR or a supervisor. It could spark positive changes within the company.\n\n6. Look for opportunity elsewhere: If you are experiencing chronic stress and burnout, it may be time to consider finding a new job with a company better suited to your needs and values.\n\nRemember, while you may not be able to change the company culture on your own, it is possible to prioritize self-care and set boundaries within the company to maintain work motivation and wellbeing.",
