It's possible that the sale might have ended by the time you visited the mall, which could explain why the laptop you wanted was out of stock.\n\nNow, about upcoming sales and discounts on HP laptops:\n\n1. **Cyber Monday**: Although Black Friday has passed, Cyber Monday is just around the corner (November 28th). You can expect online retailers like HP's website, Amazon, Best Buy, and others to offer discounts on laptops during this event.\n2. **HP's Holiday Sales**: HP usually runs holiday sales and promotions on their website during the winter season. Keep an eye on their website for discounts on popular laptop models.\n3. **Green Monday**: Green Monday, which typically falls on the second Monday in December, is considered one of the best days to buy electronics, including laptops. Expect discounts from online retailers during this time.\n4. **Pre-Christmas Sales**: Many retailers offer pre-Christmas sales to drive sales before the holiday season. You might find discounts on HP laptops during this time.\n5. **Deal Days**: Keep an eye on online retailers like Amazon, which often runs Deal Days or Lightning Deals on specific products, including laptops. These deals can offer significant discounts for a limited time.\n6. **Manufacturer Refurbished Laptops**: Consider purchasing a manufacturer-refurbished HP laptop, which can offer significant savings. These laptops are certified by HP and usually come with a warranty.\n7. **Student Discounts**: If you're a student, you might be eligible for HP's education store discounts.\n8. **Price Comparison**: Always compare prices across different retailers, including HP's website, to find the best deal on the laptop model you want.\n\nTo stay informed about upcoming sales and discounts, I recommend:\n\n* Signing up for HP's newsletter or following their social media accounts to receive notifications about promotions and sales.\n* Following online retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Newegg to stay informed about their deals and discounts.\n* Using price comparison tools like PriceGrabber, Nextag, or Google Shopping to find the best prices on the laptop model you're interested in.\n\nI hope this information helps you find a great deal on your desired HP laptop!",
