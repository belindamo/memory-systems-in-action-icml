  "content": "The coastal trip was amazing! One of my favorite shots from the trip is a portrait of my friend standing on a cliff overlooking the ocean. I used a fast shutter speed to freeze the motion of the waves and the wind blowing through her hair. The 50mm f/1.8 lens really brought out the details in her face and the background, and the shallow depth of field helped to separate her from the scenery. I'm thinking of printing that one out and framing it for my living room.",
