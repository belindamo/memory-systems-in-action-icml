  "content": "I did have to make some adjustments to my camera settings to account for the bright coastal light. I had to dial down the exposure compensation to avoid blowing out the highlights in the sky, and I also used a polarizing filter to reduce the glare from the water. Additionally, I shot in RAW format to give myself more flexibility during post-processing.\n\nAs for printing and framing, I'm thinking of going with a traditional print and frame. I want the image to have a classic, timeless feel to it, and I think a traditional print and frame will help achieve that. I'm considering using a matte finish to reduce glare and add some texture to the image. I've also been looking at some different frame styles, maybe something with a bit of a rustic or coastal vibe to match the theme of the image.\n\nBy the way, speaking of post-processing, I've been meaning to learn more about Lightroom and Photoshop. Do you have any tips or resources you could recommend for getting started with those programs",
