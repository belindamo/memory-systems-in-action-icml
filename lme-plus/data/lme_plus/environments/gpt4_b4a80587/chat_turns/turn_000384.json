  "content": "The Dot Com bubble, also known as the Internet bubble, was a period of rapid growth and speculation in the technology sector, specifically in companies that were involved in the Internet. The bubble burst in the early 2000s, leading to a significant decline in the value of many technology stocks and a corresponding drop in the overall stock market. This had a negative effect on banks, as they had invested heavily in technology companies and saw the value of those investments decline. Some banks also made loans to technology companies that were not able to pay them back, leading to losses for the banks. The Dot Com bubble and the resulting crisis had a ripple effect on the economy, leading to a recession in 2001.",
