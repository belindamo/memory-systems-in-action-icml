  "content": "As C stood in the kitchen, stirring the spicy tea that she was preparing for her friends, she couldn't help but worry about Alex. She had noticed that he seemed to be slipping back into a darker state of mind, and she was determined to do everything in her power to help him through it.\n\nShe glanced over at Elena and Alex, who were lying on the bed, passing a vaping pen back and forth between them. C couldn't help but smile at the sight. Despite everything that had happened, she was grateful to have these two people in her life.\n\nAs she carried the steaming cups of tea over to the bed, C couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth and love for her friends. She knew that they were all struggling in their own way, but she was determined to do whatever she could to help them through it.\n\nAs they sipped their tea and puffed on the vaping pen, C could sense that Alex was slipping further and further into his own thoughts. She knew that he was still struggling to come to terms with Anna's death, and she couldn't imagine how difficult it must be for him.\n\nTrying to lighten the mood, C started telling stories and jokes, hoping to distract Alex from his darker thoughts. Elena joined in, and together they managed to bring a small smile to Alex's face.\n\nBut even as they laughed and joked, C couldn't shake the feeling that Alex was still struggling. She knew that she couldn't force him to open up, but she vowed to do everything she could to be there for him and support him through this difficult time.",
