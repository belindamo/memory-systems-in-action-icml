  "content": "Matte papers are an excellent choice for reducing glare, especially if you plan to hang your print in a room with a lot of natural light. However, matte papers can also make the image appear slightly softer and less vibrant.\n\nFor your seagull image, I would recommend considering a paper with a slight sheen or texture to bring out the details and colors. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Lustre paper**: Lustre paper has a slight sheen, which can help to enhance the colors and details of your image. It's a good choice if you want a paper that's not too glossy but still has a bit of depth.\n2. **Satin paper**: Satin paper has a smooth, even finish that's similar to lustre paper. It's a good choice if you want a paper that's easy on the eyes and won't produce too much glare.\n3. **Textured paper**: If you want to add an extra layer of depth and interest to your print, consider a textured paper. Textured papers can have a variety of finishes, such as canvas, linen, or even a rough, handmade texture.\n4. **Metallic paper**: If you want to really make your image pop, consider a metallic paper. Metallic papers have a reflective finish that can add a sense of depth and dimensionality to your image.\n\nUltimately, the choice of paper will depend on your personal preference and the overall aesthetic you're trying to achieve. If you're still unsure, you could consider ordering a few sample prints on different papers to see which one you like best.\n\nDo you have any experience with printing on different types of paper, or is this your first time exploring these options?",
