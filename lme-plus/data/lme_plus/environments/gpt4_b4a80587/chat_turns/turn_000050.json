I was a bit worried it might be too dark, but it's actually really brightened up the room. And I love how it complements my white furniture.\n\nI did a bit of a Marie Kondo tidy-up when I rearranged my room, and it's made such a huge difference. I got rid of so much clutter and it feels so much more peaceful in here now. I even found some old photos and mementos that I'd forgotten about, so it was nice to rediscover those.\n\nBut back to the paint color... I'm really drawn to the beige shade you mentioned, the Soft Chamois one. Do you think it would work well with my gray rug and white furniture? And what kind of trim color would you recommend? I was thinking of doing a crisp white trim to make the room feel even brighter.\"",
