  "content": "That sounds like an incredible shot! I can almost picture it in my mind's eye. The combination of the fast shutter speed, the 50mm f/1.8 lens, and the coastal scenery must have resulted in a truly stunning image.\n\nFreezing the motion of the waves and the wind blowing through your friend's hair adds a sense of dynamic energy to the portrait, while the shallow depth of field helps to create a sense of intimacy and focus on your friend's face. The 50mm f/1.8 lens is perfect for capturing portraits with a sense of depth and dimensionality.\n\nPrinting and framing that shot for your living room is a great idea! It'll be a beautiful conversation piece, and a lovely reminder of your coastal trip with your friend. You must be thrilled to have captured such a special moment.\n\nDid you have to make any adjustments to your camera settings or composition to account for the bright coastal light? The ocean and cliffs can be challenging to photograph, especially when it comes to balancing the exposure between the bright sky and the darker foreground.\n\nAlso, what kind of printing and framing options are you considering? Are you planning to go for a traditional print and frame, or explore some more modern options like acrylic or metal prints?",
