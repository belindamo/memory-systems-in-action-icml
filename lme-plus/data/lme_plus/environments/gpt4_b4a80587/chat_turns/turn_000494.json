  "content": "It depends on the specific circumstances of the incident. The investigation into an aircraft accident typically considers all relevant factors, including the design of the aircraft and its systems, the operating procedures and maintenance practices, and the environment in which the aircraft was operating. If the incident was caused by a catastrophic event that was beyond the capability of the aircraft or its systems to handle, then the design of the aircraft would likely not be considered at fault. However, if the investigation finds that the aircraft or its systems could have performed better in the given circumstances, or that the incident was caused by human error or a failure to follow procedures, then the design of the aircraft and its systems may be considered a contributing factor. Ultimately, the outcome of an aircraft accident investigation is determined based on the evidence gathered and the facts of the case.",
