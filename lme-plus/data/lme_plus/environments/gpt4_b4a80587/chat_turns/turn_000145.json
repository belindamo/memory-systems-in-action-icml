  "content": "I understand. Feeling overworked can be a major obstacle to staying motivated at work. Here are some additional suggestions that may help you:\n\n1. Speak up: Talk to your supervisor or manager about your workload, and explain how it is affecting your motivation and productivity. Try to work together to find solutions, such as delegating tasks or shifting priorities.\n\n2. Set boundaries: Know your limits and don't take on more than you can handle. Learn to say no, or negotiate deadlines if necessary.\n\n3. Break tasks into smaller ones: Large tasks can be overwhelming, which can drain your motivation. Try breaking them down into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n\n4. Take care of yourself: Make sure you are taking care of yourself, both physically and mentally. Get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and practice self-care. This can help you cope with stress and stay motivated.\n\n5. Focus on progress, not perfection: Instead of focusing on completing everything perfectly, aim to make progress. Celebrate small wins and break larger goals into achievable milestones.\n\n6. Prioritize self-improvement: Consider investing in yourself by learning new skills, taking training courses or workshops. Equipping yourself with new knowledge can also help you become better at your job, increase your efficiency, and stay motivated.\n\nRemember, overworking doesn't work - it tires us out and makes us less productive. Prioritization, rest, and communication are important strategies for managing workload related stress and maintaining motivation.",
