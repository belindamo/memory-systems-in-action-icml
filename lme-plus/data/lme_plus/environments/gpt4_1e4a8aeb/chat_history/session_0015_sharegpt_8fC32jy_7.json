I will give you the next content after you acknowledge the third content. \n\nWHAT ARE SUBCONTRACTOR STATEMENTS AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM?\nQ: A NSW business can be liable for the business\u2019s contractor\u2019s liability for NSW payroll tax, wages and workers compensation insurance premiums of the contractor unless the business complies with the subcontractor rules.\n\nA: The NSW industrial relations, payroll tax and workers compensation insurance laws potentially expose businesses that retain contractors to the contractor\u2019s payroll tax, wages and workers compensation insurance liabilities.\n\nEach of the laws that regulate the obligation to pay wages, payroll tax and workers compensation insurance make a business liable for their contractors wages, payroll tax and workers compensation insurance liabilities in respect only of the work done under the contract if:\n\nthe contractor does not satisfy them; and\n\nthe business did not get a subcontractor statement from the contractor that relates to the period for which work has been done.\n\nQ: In what situations will these rules apply?\n\nA: These rules apply to all contracts where work is being carried out after 1 July 2003 even if the contract was entered before then and:\n\nthere is a contract for work (whether oral or in writing) between a business and a contractor; and\n\nthe contractor employs or is deemed to employ workers who carry out the work; and\nthe work done is in connection with the business of the business that retained the contractor.\n\nQ: When don\u2019t these rules apply?\n\nA: There rules do not apply:\nwhere a contractor is in receivership, being wound up, or is bankrupt and payments under the contract are being made by the business to the receiver, liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy; or\n\nwhere a business has contracted for work to be carried out and that work does not relate the business of the business, for example it may be for work on a residence of a director\n\nQ: At what times must the subcontractor statement be given?\n\nA: The subcontractor statement must be given for each period for which work is actually done and technically, it does not matter if it has not been given before the work has been done.\n\nHowever, it is best that a statement be given before any work is done and that fresh statements are obtained if work continues beyond the period to which the earlier statement relates.\n\nQ: What is a subcontractor?\n\nA: The legislation defines \u201csubcontractor\u201d in broad terms. In short, it is an entity engaged to carry out work under a contract.\n\nHowever, the liability of a business for pay roll tax, wages and workers compensation insurance premiums will not arise where the subcontractor is a sole trader or a partnership without employees. Although there may still be the obligation to get a statement.\n\nQ: Is there an equivalent law in each state or territory of Australia?\n\nA: There is no equivalent law in the other states or territories that permits for subcontractor statements. However, there are for example laws in the other states and territories which deem a business to be jointly and severally liable to pay workers compensation with their contractors.\n\nThe practical implication of that is that there is no way to get out of these unpaid pay-roll tax, wages and workers compensation insurance premium obligations in states and territories other than NSW.\n\nQ: What happens if a subcontractor statement is knowingly false?\n\nA: A subcontractor statement provided by a contractor will not relieve a business of liability if at the time the statement was provided the business believed the statement to be false.\n\nQ: How long must the subcontractor statement be kept for?\n\nA: A business must keep a copy of the subcontractor statement for at least 5 years (payroll tax) 6 years (wages) and 7 years (workers compensation).\n\nIf a subcontractor statement relates to all 3 items, it will need to be kept for 7 years.\n\nQ: Does the subcontractor statement exclude liability if the contractor is actually an employee?\n\nA: A business will need to ensure that its contractors are not deemed employees because of their particular relationship with the business. If that happened, the business could not avoid these liabilities by using a subcontractor statement.\n\nSuggested action by businesses as a result of these laws\n\nBusinesses should review their contracts with their contractors:\n\nto ensure that they require subcontractor statements to be given\n\nto permit for termination of a contract when a subcontractor statement is not given\nso that it is clear to the contractor that the business has no obligation to pay any money due under the contract for the period for which a subcontractor statement has not been given (or any penalty or other fees for late payment of that money) (however each of the 3 laws do make some provision for this if the contract does not deal with it)"

I will give you the next content after you acknowledge the fourth content. \nHow Do Subcontractor Statements Work?\nA subcontractor statement is a written contract between a subcontractor and principal contractor. It is provided by a subcontractor and applies to specified periods of subcontracted work, most commonly performing work on a construction site. \n\nPurpose of Subcontractor Statements\nThrough subcontractor statements, subcontractors declare that they have met insurance premium payment, payroll tax payment and remuneration obligations. \n\nSubcontractor statements also give the subcontractor the right to work on the principal contractor\u2019s project, be paid for working on the project and take full responsibility in case of non-compliance with the law.\n\nWhat is included in a Subcontractor Statement?\nA subcontractor statement may include a subcontractor agreeing to the following: \n\nYou have paid and compensated your employed workers with appropriate insurance premiums.\nYou have paid your employees with their respective payroll taxes for their work.\nYou have paid remuneration, or the amount payable relevant to the employees of the project.\nAn example of a subcontractor statement is available on the NSW government website.\n\nDo I need to provide/obtain a Subcontractor Statement?\nA subcontractor statement must be submitted to the relevant principal contractor in order to comply with three laws; Workers Compensation Act 1987, Payroll Tax Act 2007, and the Industrial Relations Act 1996. \n\nAs a principal contractor, you should make sure you obtain a subcontractor statement from the subcontractor that relates to the period for which work has been done, otherwise you may face liability for the subcontractor\u2019s obligations. \n\nAs a subcontractor, you should make sure the subcontractor statement you provide is trustworthy. If information you stated in the subcontractor statement is false, then you may be subject to an offence.\n\nConsequences of failing to provide/obtain a Subcontractor Statement\nTwo main consequences of failing to provide a subcontractor statement are:\n\nThe principal contractor may be liable for the payment of the workers compensation premiums, payroll tax and wages due or payable by the subcontractor.\nThe principal contractor may withhold payment to a subcontractor until the subcontractor provides a subcontractor statement.\nKey Takeaways\nA subcontractor statement is a written contract provided by a subcontractor to a principal contractor that applies to specified periods of subcontracted work. It is a declaration that the subcontractor has met their insurance premium payment, payroll tax payment and remuneration obligations.\n\nShould you require further legal advice please contact OpenLegal by filling in the form on this page or calling 1300 982 068."
