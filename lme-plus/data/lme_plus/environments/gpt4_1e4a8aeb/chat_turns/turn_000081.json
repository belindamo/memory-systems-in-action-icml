It's always good to have that option available, especially when you're traveling for work or need to stay active.\n\nI'm glad to hear that the hotel staff handled the busy conference crowd efficiently and that everything felt organized. It can be overwhelming when there are a lot of people around, but it sounds like the Marriott Marquis Chicago was well-equipped to handle it.\n\nAnd wow, the 14th floor must have had an amazing view of the city! Chicago's skyline is so iconic, and I'm sure it was breathtaking to see it from your room. Did you have a favorite part of the view, or was there something in particular that caught your eye?\n\nAlso, how was the noise level in your room? Since the hotel was busy, I'm curious to know if you could hear any noise from the conference or other rooms.",
