  "content": "I understand your frustration. Misinformation and rhetoric can be a major barrier to having productive and respectful conversations around sensitive topics such as reproductive rights. It's important to approach these conversations with an open mind, a willingness to listen to and learn from others, and a commitment to stick to the facts. Engaging in respectful dialogue can help foster understanding and empathy, and can also encourage people to become more informed and active in advocating for reproductive justice. It is crucial to create a space for all voices to be heard in order to work towards a society that truly values and supports reproductive rights.",
