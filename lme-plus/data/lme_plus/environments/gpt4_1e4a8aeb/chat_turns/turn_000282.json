Here are some tips to help you block and reduce spam calls:\n\n1. **National Do Not Call Registry**: Register your number on the National Do Not Call Registry (donotcall.gov). This won't stop all spam calls, but it will reduce the number of calls you receive from legitimate telemarketers.\n2. **Call-blocking apps**: Download a call-blocking app like:\n\t* Truecaller (Android, iOS): Identifies and blocks spam calls, and provides a database of known spam numbers.\n\t* Hiya (Android, iOS): Offers real-time call blocking, caller ID, and spam detection.\n\t* Nomorobo (Android, iOS): Blocks robocalls and telemarketing calls, and provides a database of known spam numbers.\n3. **Carrier-level blocking**: Check with your carrier to see if they offer call-blocking services or features. For example:\n\t* Verizon: Offers a free call-blocking feature called \"Call Filter.\"\n\t* AT&T: Provides a \"Call Protect\" feature that blocks suspected spam calls.\n\t* T-Mobile: Offers a \"Scam Block\" feature that blocks suspected scam calls.\n4. **Android built-in features**: If you're using an Android device, you can:\n\t* Go to Settings > Call settings > Block numbers to add numbers to your block list.\n\t* Use the \"Call blocking\" feature in the Phone app to block specific numbers or unknown callers.\n5. **iOS built-in features**: If you're using an iPhone, you can:\n\t* Go to Settings > Phone > Blocked Contacts to add numbers to your block list.\n\t* Use the \"Silence Unknown Callers\" feature in Settings > Phone to silence calls from unknown numbers.\n6. **Report spam calls**: Report spam calls to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by filing a complaint online or calling 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357).\n7. **Be cautious with caller ID**: Be wary of calls from unknown numbers or numbers with suspicious caller ID information. Don't answer calls from numbers you don't recognize, and never give out personal information to unsolicited callers.\n8. **Use a VPN**: Consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to mask your phone number and make it harder for spammers to reach you.\n\nRemember, while these tips can help reduce spam calls, they might not eliminate them entirely. Be patient, and it's essential to stay vigilant and report spam calls to help authorities track down and stop these scammers.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns about blocking spam calls, feel free to ask!",
