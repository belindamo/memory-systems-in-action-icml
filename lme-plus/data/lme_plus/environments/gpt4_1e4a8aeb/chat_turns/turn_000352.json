It's always wonderful to draw inspiration from experiences that have resonated with you.\n\nIncorporating elements from your cousin's wedding can be a great way to make your own wedding feel more personal and meaningful. Which specific elements are you thinking of incorporating? Was there something about the ceremony, reception, decorations, or overall atmosphere that you particularly loved?\n\nRemember, it's all about making your wedding day feel authentic and true to you and your partner. Don't be afraid to take inspiration from others, but also don't be afraid to put your own spin on things and make them your own.\n\nAnd I'm thrilled that you're considering a garden ceremony and tented reception for your intimate wedding. It's going to be a beautiful and romantic setting, and I'm sure your guests will love it.\n\nNow, let's talk more about the details. What's your vision for the garden ceremony? Are you thinking of a formal, structured ceremony, or something a bit more relaxed and casual? And what about the tented reception?
