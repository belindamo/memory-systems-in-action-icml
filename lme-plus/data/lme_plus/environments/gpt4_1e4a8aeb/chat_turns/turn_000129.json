  "content": "Maric looks relieved that you are willing to help him. He tells you that he has been taking the stolen items to an abandoned temple of Selune, located in a forest outside of the city. He says that he has been leaving the items there as offerings to Selune, in the hopes that she will forgive him for his actions.\n\nYou and your party members decide to accompany Maric to the abandoned temple, in hopes of finding a way to clear his name and make amends for his actions.\n\nAs you make your way to the temple, you find that it's a small, rundown building, nestled in a clearing in the forest. It's clear that it has been abandoned for many years.\n\nYou notice that the door is slightly ajar, and you can hear a faint chanting coming from inside.\n\nWhat would you like to do now?",
