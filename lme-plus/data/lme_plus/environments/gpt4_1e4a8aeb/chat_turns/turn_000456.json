  "content": "While everyone is entitled to their opinion, it's important to recognize the amount of creativity, hard work, and dedication that goes into making an animated movie. Animation is a unique art form that requires an immense amount of time and skill, and it offers different creative opportunities than live-action movies.\n\nFurthermore, the choice to use dolls in Anomalisa was a deliberate artistic decision that was made to create a specific effect that could not have been achieved through live-action alone. The dolls allowed the filmmakers to create a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere that added to the film's themes of detachment and alienation.\n\nUltimately, whether or not someone wants to see animated characters on screen comes down to personal preference, but it's important to recognize and appreciate the creative effort and artistry that goes into making an animated movie.",
