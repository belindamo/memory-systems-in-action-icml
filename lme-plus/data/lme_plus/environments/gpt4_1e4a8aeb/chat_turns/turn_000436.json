Here are some tips to help you stay organized with your online orders:\n\n1. **Create a dedicated email folder**: Set up a specific folder in your email inbox to store all your online order confirmations, shipping updates, and tracking information. This will help you keep all your online order-related emails in one place.\n2. **Use a tracking spreadsheet**: Create a spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel) to track your online orders. Include columns for:\n\t* Order date\n\t* Store/website\n\t* Order number\n\t* Item(s) purchased\n\t* Tracking number\n\t* Expected delivery date\n\t* Actual delivery date\n3. **Sign up for package tracking services**: Services like Package Guard, ShipStation, or AfterShip allow you to track all your packages in one place.
