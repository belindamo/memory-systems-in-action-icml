  "content": "Combining social media usage with mental health outcomes is a crucial aspect of your research. While there might not be many datasets that directly combine social media usage with anxiety or depression scores, I've found a few datasets that could be relevant:\n\n1. **The MyPersonality dataset**: This dataset contains Facebook data from over 3,000 participants, including their Facebook status updates, likes, and personality traits. While not directly measuring anxiety or depression, it includes scores on the Big Five personality traits, which can be related to mental health outcomes. You can explore correlations between social media behavior and personality traits.\n2. **The Social Media and Mental Health Dataset** by the University of California, Irvine: I mentioned this dataset earlier. While not providing direct anxiety or depression scores, it contains survey responses on mental health indicators, such as self-esteem, life satisfaction, and emotional well-being, alongside social media usage data.\n3. **The Kansas State University's Social Media and Mental Health Study**: This dataset includes survey data from over 1,000 participants, covering social media usage, mental health symptoms (including anxiety and depression), and personality traits. Although the dataset is not publicly available, you can contact the researchers to request access.\n4. **The BBC's #MyMindMyFutures dataset**: This dataset contains survey data from over 2,000 participants, focusing on mental health, social media usage, and online behaviors. While not providing direct anxiety or depression scores, it includes data on mental wellbeing, self-esteem, and emotional resilience.\n5. **The UK's ESRC-funded \"Social Media, Mental Health and Wellbeing\" project**: This project includes multiple datasets, including one on social media usage and mental health among young adults. The dataset is not publicly available, but you can contact the researchers to request access.\n\nKeep in mind that some of these datasets might have access restrictions, and you may need to request permission or collaborate with the researchers to access the data.\n\nTo find more datasets, you can also try searching on academic databases like:\n\n1. **OpenICPSR**: Use keywords like \"social media and mental health,\" \"anxiety and social media,\" or \"depression and social media\" to find relevant datasets.\n2. **figshare**: Search for datasets using keywords like \"mental health and social media,\" \"social media usage and anxiety,\" or \"depression and social media use.\"\n3. **Data.gov**: Although primarily focused on government datasets, you can search for datasets related to mental health and social media.\n\nRemember to carefully review the dataset documentation, methodology, and variables to ensure they align with your research goals.",
