  "content": "While using live actors might have been faster and easier to achieve, animation is not a cop-out for filmmakers nor just an option for lazy filmmakers who can't make a real movie. Animation is a form of art that offers a unique creative outlet for filmmakers to bring their stories to life in ways that go beyond live action movies.\n\nAnimated movies require just as much creativity, time, and effort as live-action movies. In the case of Anomalisa, the filmmakers chose animation to achieve their vision of creating a visually unique and emotionally effectual story. From the stop-motion animation of the characters to the painstaking work of creating individual sets and props, the movie was a custom and labor-intensive production that required years of work by skilled artists, animators, and craftsmen.\n\nAnimation isn't just a medium for children's entertainment. It's a medium that can tell complex stories and evoke deep emotions with the added benefit of drawing viewers in with a visually unique style that opens new avenues of creativity.",
