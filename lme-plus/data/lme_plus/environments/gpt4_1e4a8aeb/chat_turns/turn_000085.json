I also don't have the ability to know your personal commute details or the exact area you're referring to.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you find a great coffee shop near your bus stop:\n\n1. **Google Maps**: Open Google Maps on your phone or computer and search for \"coffee shops near me\" or \"coffee shops near [your bus stop name]\". You can also use the \"Explore\" feature to discover popular coffee shops in your area. Filter the results by rating, distance, and hours of operation to find the perfect spot.\n2. **Yelp**: Yelp is a great platform to find reviews and ratings of local businesses, including coffee shops. Search for \"coffee shops near [your bus stop name]\" or \"best coffee shops in [your neighborhood]\" and filter the results by rating, distance, and hours.\n3. **Ask around**: Ask your colleagues, friends, or fellow bus riders for recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge about the best coffee shops in the area.\n4. **Check online directories**: Websites like Coffee Shop Finder or Coffee Guide can help you discover coffee shops in your area.\n\nRemember to check the coffee shop's hours of operation and menu to ensure they're open at 8:15 am and serve the type of coffee you like.\n\nHope this helps, and happy coffee hunting!",
