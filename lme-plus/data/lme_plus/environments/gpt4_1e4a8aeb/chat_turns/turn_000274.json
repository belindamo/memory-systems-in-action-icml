Here are some suggestions to help you optimize your phone's performance and extend its battery life:\n\n1. **Screen brightness and auto-brightness**: Lowering the screen brightness or enabling auto-brightness can help reduce battery consumption. You can do this by going to Settings > Display > Brightness or Auto-Brightness.\n2. **Background app refresh**: Some apps might be running in the background and consuming battery power. Go to Settings > Battery > Battery usage, and check which apps are using the most battery. You can then restrict background app refresh for those apps or uninstall them if you don't need them.\n3. **Location services**: Disable location services for apps that don't need them. Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services, and toggle off the switch for apps that don't require location access.\n4. **Push notifications**: Disable push notifications for apps that you don't need immediate notifications for. Go to Settings > Notifications, and toggle off the switch for those apps.\n5. **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth**: Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not in use to conserve battery life. You can do this by going to Settings > Wi-Fi and Settings > Bluetooth, respectively.\n6. **Power-saving features**: Enable power-saving features like Low Power Mode or Power Saver on your phone. This can limit background data usage, reduce screen brightness, and turn off some features to conserve battery life.\n7. **Close unused apps**: Regularly close unused apps to prevent them from running in the background and consuming battery power.\n8. **Update your operating system**: Ensure your phone's operating system is up-to-date, as newer versions often include battery life improvements.\n9. **Clear cache and data**: Clearing the cache and data of apps can help remove temporary files and free up storage space, which can improve overall performance. Go to Settings > Storage > Internal Storage > Apps, and select an app to clear its cache and data.\n10. **Battery calibration**: Calibrate your phone's battery by letting it drain to 0% and then charging it to 100%. Repeat this process a few times to help the battery gauge its capacity more accurately.\n\nAs for cleaning your phone's screen, it's great that you did that on January 15th! Regularly cleaning your phone's screen can help maintain its responsiveness and overall performance. However, it's unlikely to have a direct impact on battery life.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you should see some improvement in your phone's battery life. If the issue persists, you might want to consider visiting a authorized service center or contacting the manufacturer's support team for further assistance.",
