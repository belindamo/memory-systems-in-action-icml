Here are some suggestions:\n\n**Word Games:**\n\n1. **Scattergories**: A creative-thinking category-based party game where players have to come up with unique words that fit certain criteria, all starting with the same letter.\n2. **Taboo**: A fast-paced word-guessing game where players describe a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases.\n3. **Bananagrams**: A portable, fast-paced word game similar to Scrabble, but played with letter tiles instead of a game board.\n\n**Strategy Games:**\n\n1. **Ticket to Ride**: A popular train-themed game where players compete to build railroad routes across a map of North America. Easy to learn, but with plenty of depth.\n2. **Settlers of Catan**: A classic game of resource management and trading, where players build settlements, roads, and cities on an island.\n3. **Carcassonne**: A tile-laying game where players build a medieval landscape, placing tiles to create cities, roads, and fields.\n\n**Other Great Options:**\n\n1. **Codenames**: A word-guessing game where players try to identify words based on one-word clues given by their teammate.\n2. **Mysterium**: A cooperative game where one player takes on the role of a ghost trying to communicate with the other players (psychic mediums) to solve a murder mystery.\n3. **Azul**: A tile-laying game where players compete to create the most beautiful mosaic, with a clever twist on resource management.\n4. **Deception**: A social deduction game where one player takes on the role of a spy, and the others have to figure out who it is through clever questioning and deduction.\n5. **Pandemic**: A cooperative game where players work together to stop the spread of diseases and save the world.\n\nThese games offer a great mix of wordplay, strategy, and social interaction, and are all well-suited for a group of 4-6 players. Make sure to read the rules and instructions before the game night to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyone.\n\nRemember to have fun and be flexible \u2013 you can always adjust the game selection based on your group's preferences and interests. Happy gaming!",
