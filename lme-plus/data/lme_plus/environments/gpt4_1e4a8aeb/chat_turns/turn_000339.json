  "content": "That sounds amazing! I love the idea of incorporating natural materials, like reclaimed wood and stone, into the design. And having a big garden and orchard will not only provide us with fresh produce but also create a sense of self-sufficiency. I'm also interested in exploring sustainable features like solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and composting toilets. Can you tell me more about the costs and benefits of these features?",
