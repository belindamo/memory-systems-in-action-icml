If such a vehicle is imported from the\nUK (including via NI), the importer is required to complete a Customs import\ndeclaration, pay Customs Duty, if applicable and Value Added Tax (VAT) on import,\nprior to presenting the vehicle for registration. Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is\npayable at registration, with the VRT calculation and collection being completed by\nthe NCT centres.\nVehicles purchased from NI, that were in NI prior to 1 January 2021, are treated as\nEU goods and no customs formalities are required and VAT on import and customs\nduty are not applicable. However, where vehicles from Great Britain (GB) are moved\nto the EU, through NI, after 31 December 2020, including those re-registered to an\nNI owner, then customs formalities and VAT on import may apply.\nFull information on the requirements for importing second-hand vehicles is available\non the Revenue website here.\nAn overview of vehicle import scenarios is outlined in Appendix 1.\n2 Pre-requirements to make a Customs Import Declaration\nIf a vehicle is imported from the UK, then a customs declaration is required. This is\nusually completed by a customs agent on behalf of the importer. However, an\nindividual can also complete the declaration using the declaration portal in\nRevenue\u2019s import system, AIS.\nTo complete a customs import declaration an individual must:\n\uf0b7 Be registered for Revenue Online Service (ROS)\n\uf0b7 Be registered for Customs & Excise\n\uf0b7 Have an EORI number\nIf not already registered for ROS, for example if you are a PAYE employee, then a\nregistration request can be submitted through MyEnquiries. Please include your PPS\nnumber and brief note on the reason for the request. This can be submitted through\nthe following path:\n1) Sign into MyEnquiries\n2) Select 'Add new Enquiry'\n3) In the 'My Enquiry relates to' section, enter 'Customs':\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n4\n4) In the 'More Specifically' section, enter 'eCustoms - Systems Query' for\nenquiries relating to AEP (Import & Export Declarations), EORI, EMS, NCTS,\nICS and CD.\nIf it is not possible to register for MyEnquiries then the request can be sent by e-mail\nto ecustoms@revenue.ie\nOn receipt, eCustoms will register the applicant for C&E and complete an EORI\nregistration which will enable the import of the motor vehicle.\nOnce registration is confirmed by eCustoms, the next step is to register for ROS on\nwww.revenue.ie . Registration for ROS will provide access to the AIS trader portal\nand allow submission of an import declaration.\nIf importing a new vehicle into the State, the following information must be attached\nto the import declaration:\n\uf0b7 A valid Certificate of Conformity (CoC) that confirms EU type approval. Please\nnote that the type approval number on the CoC must correspond to an EU\nMember State.\nor\n\uf0b7 An Individual Approval or Small Series Approval Certificate issued by the\nNational Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n5\n3 Customs Import Declaration Submission\nThe type of declaration required is a \u201cH1\u201d import declaration\nStep 1:\nLog into ROS (guidance here)\nStep 2:\nSelect the \u2018Customs UCC Portal\u2019 under the My Services tab \u2013 Other Services\nFigure 1: ROS Customs UCC Portal\nStep 3:\nFollow the guidance on inputting a H1 customs declaration in the Customs UCC\nPortal here.\n4 Combined Nomenclature Code\nCombined Nomenclature (CN) codes are set out in TARIC. Vehicles are classified for\ncustoms purposes under goods code: 8700000000. This will be further broken down\nby the vehicle type (i.e. motor vehicle \u2013 8703) and then the specifics of the particular\nvehicle.\nThe CN code is entered at Data Element (DE) 6/15 (Commodity Code \u2013 TARIC Code)\non the customs import declaration.\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n6\nThe most common vehicle is:\n870321 - Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport\nof <10 persons, incl. station wagons and racing cars, with only spark-ignition internal\ncombustion reciprocating piston engine of a cylinder capacity <= 1.000 cm\u00b3 (excl.\nvehicles for travelling on snow and other specially designed vehicles of subheading\n870310).\nNOTE: there is a different code for new and used vehicles\n\uf0b7 8703211000 \u2013 new vehicle\n\uf0b7 8703219000\u2013 used vehicle\n5 Vehicle Identification Number\nIMPORTANT:\nThe inclusion of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is critical. From 1 January 2021, to\nenable an imported vehicle to be cleared by the NCT centre, evidence of a customs import\ndeclaration must be provided at the NCT centre. There will also be an electronic interface\nbetween the NCT centre and the Revenue Customs system, therefore the correct VIN must\nbe entered on the customs import declaration.\nProcedure at Import: When completing your customs import declaration, at DE 2/3,\ninsert 1D97 followed by the VIN. It should be noted that 1D97 (VIN) should be\nincluded at Goods Shipment item level.\nNOTE: If the item being imported does not have a VIN, please insert the text\nNOVIN033 after 1D97.\n6 Transfer of Residence\nPersons transferring their residence should include their private vehicles on their\nTransfer of Residence (TOR) declaration form (C&E 1076), which covers the\nimportation of personal items and household goods from outside the EU. There is\nmore information on how to claim TOR relief on the Revenue website. If an importer\nqualifies for TOR relief, no Customs Duty or VAT on import is payable on the\nvehicle(s). If you are personally importing your personal items and household goods\nand you are physically with the goods, then an electronic customs import declaration\nmay not be necessary. For further assistance contact Customs Clearance and Import\nor Export Controls on 01-7383685 or through Revenue MyEnquiries.\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n7\n7 UK Origin Vehicles\nFrom 1 January 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has\neliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain, where the\nrelevant rules on origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate\napplies. However, goods of EU origin that are in use in the UK and that are\nsubsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0%\ntariff rate, as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin.\nFurther information on preferential tariff treatment and details of how to claim it\ncan be found on the Revenue website here.\n7.1 Where the Vehicle is UK Origin\nWhere the vehicle was manufactured in the UK and complies with the origin terms\nas set out in the EU-UK TCA, a preferential tariff rate of 0% may be claimed.\nTo claim preferential origin for UK origin goods for release into free circulation in the\nEU, the following codes are used:\n\uf0b7 AIS Data Element 4/17 (Preference) should contain the code \u2018300\u2019.\n\uf0b7 AIS Data Element 5/16 (Country of preferential origin) is \u2018GB\u2019.\n\uf0b7 AIS Data Element 2/3 (Documents produced, certificates and authorisations,\nadditional references), one of the following codes should be used:\n- Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a\n'statement on origin\u2019 for a single shipment, use code \u201cU116\u201d.\n- Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on\n\u2018importer\u2019s knowledge\u2019, use code \u201cU117\u201d.\n- Where the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a\n'statement on origin\u2019 for multiple shipments of identical products, use\ncode \u201cU118\u201d.\nA list of codes which may be applicable is available in Appendix 2.\n8 Returned Goods Relief\nReturned Goods Relief may be available, subject to conditions, for vehicles that have\nbeen exported from the Customs territory of the Union. Vehicles can be exported\nfrom the EU to a 3\nrd country and re-imported into the EU without the payment of\nCustoms Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief are\nmet. In very specific circumstances, relief from Value-Added Tax may also apply\nwhere the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally\nexported the goods out of the EU. The conditions are:\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n8\n\uf0b7 The vehicle must have been originally exported from the EU\n\uf0b7 Must not have been altered and\n\uf0b7 Must be re-imported within three years of export from the EU.\nFurther information on the relief and details of how to claim it can be found on the\nRevenue website here.\n9 Postponed Accounting for VAT\nPostponed accounting for VAT on import is now available to all VAT registered\ntraders. Revenue may exclude traders who do not fulfil certain conditions and\nrequirements from using this scheme.\nThis scheme:\n\uf0b7 provides for postponed accounting for VAT on imports from non-EU countries\n\uf0b7 enables you to account for import VAT on your VAT return\n\uf0b7 allows you to reclaim VAT at the same time as it is declared in a return. This is\nsubject to normal rules on deductibility.\nMore information on postponed accounting is available here.\n10 Importing a Vehicle from Northern Ireland\nUnder the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue\nto apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods. The result is that there\nare no Customs formalities, including Customs declarations or payment of tariffs, on\ntrade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\nHowever, in January 2021, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT\nmargin scheme for used vehicles imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.\nThese changes mean that vehicles first registered in Great Britain, and subsequently\nregistered in Northern Ireland after 31 December 2020, will be subject to additional\nrequirements if imported into the State. These additional requirements must be\ncompleted prior to presenting the vehicle for registration at an NCT centre.\nA vehicle brought into Northern Ireland before 1 January 2021, and which has\nremained there since, can be registered in the State with no customs obligations.\nHowever, proof of the vehicle\u2019s status in Northern Ireland prior to 1 January 2021\nwill be required, for example:\n\uf0b7 a ferry ticket showing the date of arrival in NI, and which clearly identifies the\nspecific vehicle\n\uf0b7 a copy of an invoice from a transport company identifying the vehicle and\ndelivery date\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n9\n\uf0b7 tax and insurance details indicating use in NI prior to 1 January 2021\nor\n\uf0b7 a copy of the V5C showing the last registered keeper in NI and a date of\nregistration to that keeper prior to 1 January 2021.\nWhere a second-hand vehicle has been imported from Great Britain after 31\nDecember 2020 and the Customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland,\nthe person wishing to register the vehicle in Ireland should first contact Revenue as\nthere will be a VAT liability to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. A\nSupplementary Import Declaration\u2013 VAT on Import on Used Vehicles must be made\nto Revenue in respect of any vehicles that qualify for the UK VAT margin scheme.\nIf you do not have proof of a declaration to Customs in Northern Ireland you must\ncomplete a Customs import declaration and pay Customs Duty, if applicable, and\nVAT on the customs value of the vehicle plus the customs duty payable \u2013 see\nexamples at para 12 below. This must be done before presenting the vehicle for\nregistration.\nFull details are available in Appendix 3.\n11 Payment\nIf registered for ROS, you must also be registered for Customs & Excise (C&E) and\nhave an Economic Operator Registration Identification (EORI) to make payments for\nC&E. Full guidelines are available here.\n12 Examples of the Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT on\nImport\nCustoms Duty\nCustoms Duty of 10% is applicable to most vehicles imported from the UK, calculated\non the customs value of the vehicle. The custom value consists of the purchase price\nof the vehicle, plus transport and insurance costs and any handling charges.\nVAT\nThe payment of VAT at the standard rate of 23% is applicable to the importation of\nvehicles from GB. In most cases, VAT is not applied to used vehicles purchased in NI.\nHowever, a VAT charge may apply if the car is categorised as a \"new means of\ntransport\u201d or was previously registered in GB and moved to NI after 31 December\n2020.\nThe value on which VAT is levied at the point of importation is the customs value of\nthe car, plus customs duty.\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n10\nExample 1. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported\nfrom GB to Ireland, where no reliefs apply\nPrior to the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, vehicles imported from the UK were not subject\nto customs duty or VAT charges on import to Ireland as the goods were in free\ncirculation in the EU. VRT was payable on the vehicle being presented for\nregistration at a VRT office. However, from 1 January 2021, when the UK left the\nEU, customs duty and VAT are payable, in addition to VRT. The example below\nillustrates the calculation of customs duty and VAT, where no reliefs apply.\nPurchase price of car \u20ac32,000 (after conversion from sterling)\nTransport costs \u20ac500\nCustoms value of car \u20ac32,500\nCustoms duty @ 10% \u20ac3,250\nOverall value subject to VAT \u20ac35,750\nVAT @ 23% \u20ac8,223\nCustoms duty and VAT payable on import is therefore \u20ac3,250 and \u20ac8,223\nrespectively.\nExample 2. Calculation of Customs Duty and VAT payable on a car imported\nfrom GB to Ireland, where Returned Goods Relief is applicable\nIn this example a car is exported to the UK from another EU Member State (e.g.\nGermany) and re-imported to Ireland after 1 January 2021, within three years of the\ndate of export to the UK. As the car was not re-imported into the EU by the same\nperson that originally exported the goods out of the EU, no relief from VAT applies.\nPurchase price of car \u20ac32,000 (after conversion from sterling)\nTransport costs \u20ac500\nCustoms value of car \u20ac32,500\nCustoms duty @ 0% (Note the car qualifies for Returned Goods Relief)\nOverall value subject to VAT \u20ac32,500\nVAT @ 23% \u20ac7,475\nRelief from customs duty is applicable, with the VAT payable on import being \u20ac7,475.\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n11\nAppendix 1: Vehicle Import Scenarios\n1.

Introduction\nFollowing the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU),\nan import of a vehicle from Great Britain is treated as an import from a third country,\ni.e. a non-EU country. If a vehicle is imported from Great Britain (GB) into Ireland,\nthe importer is required to complete a customs declaration prior to import and pay\ncustoms duty, if applicable, and VAT at the standard rate. It will not be possible to\nregister the vehicle if an import declaration has not been filed. Under customs law,\nVAT at import is chargeable on the customs value of the goods. The fact that VAT has\nbeen charged in Great Britain on used vehicles subsequently imported into the State\nhas no bearing on their liability to VAT at import when imported into the EU.\nUnder the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue\nto apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods with the result that\nthere are no customs formalities, including customs declarations or payment of\ntariffs, on trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\nHowever, on 14 January, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT margin\nscheme for used cars imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. These\nchanges mean that vehicles first registered in Great Britain (GB), and subsequently\nregistered in Northern Ireland after 31 December 2020, will be subject to temporary\nadditional requirements if imported into the State. These additional requirements\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n20\nmust be completed prior to presenting the vehicle for registration at an NCT centre.\n2. Requirements to register a vehicle in Ireland\nWhere a second hand car has been imported from Great Britain since 1 January 2021\nand the customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland, the person wishing\nto register the car in Ireland should first contact Revenue as there will be a VAT\nliability that needs to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. A\n\u2018Supplementary Import Declaration\u2013 VAT on import\u2019 must be made to Revenue in\nrespect of margin scheme and qualifying cars.\nRevenue will request verification that the customs formalities have been completed\nin Northern Ireland (a Trader Support Service simplified frontier or supplementary\ndeclaration will suffice where the vehicle is identified but an Entry Summary\nDeclaration (ENS) declaration will not be accepted). Once the VAT (charged at the\nstandard rate) is either paid or accounted for (in the case of VAT registered\nbusinesses only), Revenue will provide the necessary documentation to the\ncustomer for presentation to the NCT centre. The NCT centre will only accept the\nRevenue provided documentation for such vehicles.\nIf proof cannot be provided that customs formalities have been completed in\nNorthern Ireland, then an import declaration will need to be made in Ireland.\nAs noted previously this is a temporary arrangement until the situation in regard to\nVAT at\nimportation is regularised for cars imported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThis is currently being discussed between the European Commission and the UK\nGovernment.\nThe person seeking to register the vehicle in Ireland is responsible for ensuring that\nprocedure outlined above is adhered to.\n3. Registering vehicles without proof of declaration to customs in Northern Ireland\nIf you do not have proof of declaration to Customs in Northern Ireland (NI) you must\ncomplete a customs declaration and pay customs duty if applicable, and ValueAdded Tax (VAT) on the import value of the vehicle. This must be done before\npresenting the vehicle for registration.\nKey details on how to complete the declaration on Revenue\u2019s Automated Import\nSystem (AIS) are outlined below.\nCars coming from Great Britain via Northern Ireland that require a H1 declaration\nsubmitted to AIS\n\u2022 Data Element (DE) 1/2: Declaration Type \u2013 A\n\u2022 DE 1/6: Goods Items Number \u2013 1 \u2013 1 vehicle being imported\nTax and Duty Manual Importation of Motor Vehicles from the UK\n21\n\u2022 DE 1/10: \u2013 Procedure Code \u2013 4000 (unless returned goods relief is\nbeing claimed \u2013 see below)\n\u2022 DE 1/11 \u2013 Additional Procedure Code \u2013 000 (unless returned goods\nrelief is being claimed \u2013 see below)\n\u2022 DE 2/1: previous document field - a commercial invoice number\n\u2022 DE 2/3: additional information:\no N730 1234 \u2013 this is the transport document.

Additional Information\nMore information on Filing a Supplementary Import Declaration form can be found\nhere:\nThe EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has eliminated tariff duties for\ntrade between the EU and Great Britain where the relevant rules of origin are met. If\nthe goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. Under the terms of the TCA,\ngoods of EU origin that were in use in the UK and that were subsequently imported\ninto Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0% tariff rate as they will\nnot qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin.\nTo import a car of EU origin from Great Britain into Ireland, a customs declaration\nmust be completed. Customs duty of 10% applies on the customs value of the car.\nThe customs value is the invoice price plus the cost of transport and insurance. VAT\nat the standard rate is calculated on the customs value plus customs duty.\nThere is a Returned Goods Relief available for vehicles subject to strict EU conditions.\nVehicles can be exported from the EU to a 3rd country and re-imported into the EU\nwithout the payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for\nReturned Goods Relief are met. In very specific circumstances, relief from ValueAdded Tax may also apply where the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same\nperson that originally exported the goods out of the EU. Details of how to claim\nreturned goods relief for cars is on eCustoms Helpdesk Notification Ref 24/2021.\nIf the car is of UK origin, it is important to note that the preferential tariff treatment\nmust be claimed on import on the Customs declaration. Details on how to do this are\nalso available on eCustoms Helpdesk Notification Ref 36/2020.\nPostponed accounting for Value-Added Tax (VAT) on imports is available to all\ntraders that are registered for VAT and Customs and Excise. The traders must fulfil\ncertain conditions. Further detail is available on eCustoms Helpdesk Notification Ref\n32/2020.",
