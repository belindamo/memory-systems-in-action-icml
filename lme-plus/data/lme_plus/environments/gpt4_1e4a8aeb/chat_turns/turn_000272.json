As a digital AI assistant, I don't have direct access to the hotel's maintenance schedule or plans, but I can offer some suggestions on how to request a maintenance check.\n\nYou can try the following:\n\n1. **Contact the hotel's front desk**: Let them know about the condition of the free weights in the fitness center. They might not be aware of the issue, and your feedback can help them prioritize maintenance.\n2. **Fill out a comment card**: Many hotels have comment cards or feedback forms in the fitness center or in your room. Take a moment to write down your concerns and suggestions. This will help the hotel's management team identify areas for improvement.\n3. **Talk to the fitness center staff**: If there's a fitness center attendant or personal trainer on duty, let them know about the worn-out free weights. They might be able to provide insight into the hotel's maintenance schedule or offer alternative equipment.\n\nIt's possible that the hotel is already planning to replace the free weights or has a maintenance schedule in place. By bringing it to their attention, you can help expedite the process.\n\nRemember to always be respectful and courteous when providing feedback. The hotel staff is there to ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable stay, and your input can help them improve their services.",
