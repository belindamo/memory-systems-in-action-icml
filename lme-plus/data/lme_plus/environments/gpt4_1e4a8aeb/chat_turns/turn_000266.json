Since I'm a large language model, I don't have direct access to the hotel's system, but I can guide you through the process.\n\nTo request an extra pillow for your room, you can try the following options:\n\n1. **Call the hotel's front desk**: Dial the hotel's internal phone number (usually 0 or a specific extension) and ask to speak with the front desk. Let them know you need an extra pillow for room 1408, and they'll take care of it for you.\n2. **Use the hotel's mobile app**: If the Hilton Hotel has a mobile app, you can download it and use it to request additional amenities, including extra pillows. Follow the in-app instructions to submit your request.\n3. **Visit the front desk in person**: Take a quick trip down to the lobby and let the front desk staff know you need an extra pillow. They'll be happy to assist you.\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other requests, feel free to ask!",
