However, many local governments in the UK have introduced various measures to help first-time buyers get a foot on the property ladder. Here are some examples of such measures:\n\n1. Help-to-Buy Equity Loan: This program allows first-time buyers to apply for a loan from the government to help with the purchase of a new build home, with only a 5% deposit required.\n\n2. Shared Ownership: First-time buyers can purchase a share of a property - typically around 25% to 75% - and make rent payments on the remaining share.\n\n3. Starter Homes: These are newly-built homes designed to be sold exclusively or primarily to first-time buyers at a discount of at least 20% off the market price.\n\n4. Stamp Duty Land Tax Relief: In some cases, first-time buyers may be eligible for a tax relief on Stamp Duty when purchasing a home up to a certain price threshold.\n\n5. Council Tax Reductions: First-time buyers may be eligible for a reduction in council tax payments on their new home.\n\nIt's possible that Walsall may have introduced one or more of these measures or similar measures to help first-time buyers get onto the property ladder. It's advisable to refer to the Walsall Council website or speak to a local estate agent or mortgage advisor for the latest information on available options.",
