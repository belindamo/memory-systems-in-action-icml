      "content": "First, I would like to introduce you place where Filon will go in that chapter.\n\nInazuma (Japanese: \u7a32\u59bb Inazuma) is one of the seven regions in Teyvat. It is an archipelagic region that worships Raiden Shogun, the Electro Archon, who is also the leader of its governing body, the Inazuma Shogunate. Inazuma is located approximately 4 km southeast from Liyue Harbor and is a close neighbor with the Dark Sea.[2]\n\nIn the past year relative to the current events of the game, the situation in Inazuma has made a drastic turn towards isolationism, locked down under the Sakoku Decree. \"Baal\" also enacted the related Vision Hunt Decree, declaring that Visions, as gifts from the gods, should be in the sole hands of divinity \u2014 and is now rounding up all Visions in Inazuma to inlay them in the hands of a statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God.[3]\n\nAtsuko, an Inazuman who defected to Liyue, describes the country as having a \"tense\" and \"dangerous\" environment and discourages traveling there; she also remarks that the Kanjou Commission, one of the Tri-Commission, conduct many assessments that citizens must pass in order to be given permission to leave Inazuma. She bypassed those assessments by making her own raft and fleeing to Liyue. However, the Fatui seem to be able to freely enter and exit due to their diplomatic immunity.[Note 1] \n\nThe Inazuma archipelago is sub-divided into three main factions: the islands ruled by the Raiden Shogun (Narukami Island, Kannazuka, Yashiori Island, and Seirai Island), Watatsumi Island which worships Orobashi, and Tsurumi Island which was destroyed by Kanna Kapatcir in the distant past and has largely been uninhabited since.\n\nWhile these islands are all considered part of Inazuma, the geographical and cultural makeup of these areas are vastly different. \n\nLife in Inazuma\n\nLife in Inazuma prior to the Ei's Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decree is unknown, but Paimon states that Inazuma did not have any problems the year before she began accompanying the Traveler.[1] After Ei issued her decrees, life in the region took a drastic turn for the worse for all, as available resources in the nation dropped and very few goods were imported in, forcing many businesses to look for alternate methods. Crime is particularly rampant in Inazuma's wilderness, with large numbers of Treasure Hoarders and ronin like Nobushi and Kairagi.\n\nAtsuko, a native of Inazuma, stated that Inazuma has a very tense and dangerous atmosphere.[2] Bibo likewise considers it to be very dangerous, claiming that while he can get anything at the right price, he refuses to get any Inazuman products.[3]\n\nFollowing the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree and expulsion of corrupt officials, life began to slowly improve for the better, although the Sakoku Decree meant that the economy was still struggling. After Ei abolished the Sakoku Decree, life took a turn for the better as the nation is finally able to conduct general trade and an outpouring of foreign visitors.\n\nBake-Danukis are known to live in Inazuma, who enjoy pranking passersby by pretending to offer food and shelter, disguising it as leaves and mud.[4] While humans are still the most predominant inhabitants of Inazuma, youkai such as tengu, oni and kitsune also reside in Inazuma; however, like the adepti of Liyue, few remain and most live in seclusion.\n\nInazuman samurai society often revolves around an honor system of sorts; samurai families, being relatively common in Inazuma, have an immense amount of pride and honor, often sending their children to serve in the Shogun's armies to glory and fame. Samurai are known to engage in duels from time to time. They are particularly prideful of their own skills; being bested in battle or duel by another or being helped by an outsider is typically considered to be shameful.[5]\nAgriculture\n\nWatatsumi Island has historically had very poor soil for growing crops, which was a primary motivating factor for the Narukami-Watatsumi War at the end of the Archon War. According to legend, Enkanomiya is constantly trying to pull the spirit of Watatsumi Island into the depths, causing soil erosion and bleaching that turns it into \"Holy Soil.\" The Watatsumi Mitama Omatsuri is a ritual performed to stave off the spread of Holy Soil. Tsuyuko, a shrine maiden who studied at Sumeru Akademiya, believes that \"Holy Soil\" is actually caused by the salinity and alkalinity of the seawater encroaching on the island, which leaches nutrients from the soil.[6]\n\nOther islands appear to be having a similar issue, as Konda Village of Narukami Island has difficulty in trying to grow crops.\n\nMany Lavender Melon trees can be found across Inazuma's islands. While Sunsettia and Apple trees cannot be found in Inazuma's overworld, this seems to be a purely gameplay phenomenon: the Expedition reward for Byakko Plain includes Sunsettias, which indicates that Sunsettias can be found in Inazuma's wilds.\nArchitecture\n\nInazuman buildings and furnishings typically make use of Aralia, Maple, Otogi or Yumemiru Wood. Yumemiru wood is typically used for creating shrines.\nCuisine\nMain page: Category:Inazuma Dishes\n\nAccording to Chongyun, authentic Inazuman cuisine is ice-cold fresh and can take the exhaustion away from a day of hard training.[7] Seafood plays an important role in Inazuman cuisine, such as sushi and tempura. Other foods include poultry like Imported Poultry, ramen, dango, and egg rolls.\nTechnology\n\nThe Maguu Kenki originate from Inazuma. They are magical autonomous puppets that use the powers of Cryo and Anemo, having been created by unknown people to mimic the Iwakura Clan sword arts.\n\nOnmyoudou was also developed in Inazuma by Kamuna Harunosuke. While mostly forgotten, traces of it still exist in legends and by the Kairagi, who utilise shikifuda to elementally infuse their swords despite not having a Vision.\nDuels\n\nA Duel Before the Throne is a traditional Inazuman duel between two combatants that is fought in Tenshukaku and witnessed by the Shogun.\n\nIf someone has a disagreement with another party or feels that they have been slighted in some way, they can challenge the offender to a duel before the throne. The two parties will travel to Tenshukaku and present their case to the Raiden Shogun. If the Shogun gives them the clearance to engage in combat, then they will begin fighting until someone is unable to duel any further. These duels always end in the death of one of the combatants. The loser is either killed by a lethal blow, or if they survive the duel, executed by the Musou no Hitotachi.\n\nTwo notable duels have been referenced so far. Kazuha's Friend challenged the Raiden Shogun to a duel for instituting the Vision Hunt Decree, and Kujou Sara accepted on her behalf. He ultimately lost the duel and was executed. Later, during Duel Before the Throne in the Omnipresence Over Mortals Archon Quest, the Traveler challenged Signora to a duel in an attempt to stop the Fatui from taking over Inazuma and also as an act of revenge for her stealing Venti's Gnosis. A hard battle was fought, and ultimately, Signora was defeated and executed by the Musou no Hitotachi.\nArts\nIkebana\n\nIkebana is the art of arranging flowers to create a floral courtyard. Current known practitioners are Kamisato Ayaka and Fushizome. \n\nEconomy\n\nBook printing appears to be one of the main trades in Inazuma, in part due to the Yae Publishing House, who are known throughout Teyvat as the giant in the printing industry. They occasionally host the \"This Novel is Amazing!\" contest.\n\nPrior to the Sakoku Decree, Inazuma frequently exported toys, fireworks and kimonos. After the Shogun issued the decree, only ships affiliated with the Kanjou Commission could bring items in and out, resulting in less trade domestically and internationally. Even then, the fierce storms generated by the Shogun meant that few ships dared to brave them and many goods were lost in the process. Fishing also saw a decline as the Tenryou Commission saw boats of all sizes as escape vessels. After the Sakoku Decree was abolished, all of these are slowly returning to pre-decree levels.\n\nLike Liyue, Inazuma also possesses a mining and smithing industry. Jakotsu Mine and the Mikage Furnace are well known in Inazuma, but the former closed after a \"sickness\" spread throughout the island, while the latter closed after the core went critical, threatening to leak Tatarigami energy until it was fixed, but even then, many are still hesitant to return. Inazuman swords are particularly well known due to the use of Jade Steel, a special material from Tatarasuna, although production has since halted following the peace treaty between Watatsumi and the Shogunate. \n\nPolitics\n\nThe Shogun is assisted by a group known as the Tri-Commission by its people; they act similarly to the collective of the Liyue Qixing and the Eight Trades, with each commission handling different responsibilities.[8][Note 1]\n\nThe Tri-Commission consists of three commissions; the Kanjou, Tenryou and Yashiro Commission. Each one tends to their own duties and are led by a prestigious clan the Hiiragi, Kujou and Kamisato Clan respectively.\n\nThe Kanjou Commission handles the nation's borders, checking documents of both foreigners and returning citizens. They were originally led by Hiiragi Shinsuke, who was dismissed for his role in the Fatui plot.\n\nThe Tenryou Commission handles the nation's security from all internal and external threats. They were originally led by Kujou Takayuki, who was dismissed for his role in the Fatui plot. Similarly to Shinsuke, an official successor has not been declared, although Kujou Sara currently fills the role.\n\nThe Yashiro Commission handles the management of shrines, festivals and cultural events, being the most connected to the people. They are currently led by Kamisato Ayato. Outside of this, Ayato is also responsible for handling corrupt officials and the Shuumatsuban, a ninja organization that directly answers to him. The Shuumatsuban handle clandestine operations such as intelligence gathering and counter-ops.\n\nWatatsumi Island is a unique outlier in that the island is mostly governed by the Divine Priestess of the Sangonomiya Clan due to the islanders' worship of Orobashi instead of Ei. The current Divine Priestess is Sangonomiya Kokomi.\n\nPrior to the Traveler's arrival in Inazuma, Ei had enacted both the Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decree as she felt that they aligned with her ideals of eternity at the time. In reality, this was a Fatui plot intended to cause instability in the nation and market their Delusions, convincing both Shinsuke and Takayuki to collude with them. Takayuki would feed the Shogun false information about the war while Shinsuke would provide the Fatui with Crystal Marrow. While the Kamisato siblings were suspicious of the unusual circumstances, their lack of influence and the potential consequences did not result in much activity. The resulting Vision Hunt Decree caused a civil war between the Watatsumi Army and the Shogunate.\n\nWhen the Traveler arrived, they were able to discover the whole truth of the plot and with the assistance of Yae Miko, convinced Ei to start listening to her people's wishes. After learning the full extent of the Fatui plot, she stripped both Shinsuke and Takayuki of their positions and roles, placing them under house arrest. The civil war subsequently concluded and talks were held between the Shogunate and Watatsumi Island. While spending more time with the Traveler,[9][10] Ei came to realize that her beliefs had been wrong from the start and decided to take a more active role in giving her people the happiness they deserved, abolishing the Sakoku Decree.\nMilitary\n\nInazuma has three military forces - the Shogun's Army, the Watatsumi Army and the Shuumatsuban. The Shogun's Army is the primary army of Inazuma; the Watatsumi Army simply upholds order on their lands while the Shuumatsuban is a clandestine force.\n\nThere are some ranks in the Shogun's Army - recruits, captains and samurai. Polearms are the common weapon of choice for non-samurai, while samurai exclusively use swords and bows, given that the art of the sword is highly regarded in the nation.[11]\nMotto\n\nOne of the national mottos of Inazuma (especially one during military campaigns) is \"Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!\"[12][13][14]\n\nThe corresponding motto in the Japanese localization and the Chinese original can be translated as \"The one who hath spread the unchanging way is the eternal Narukami!\", where the \"unchanging way\" means the unconditional truth of life and the universe, while Narukami (\"Thundering God\" or lit. \"Roaring God\") is a title of the Raiden Shogun (Japanese: \u5e38\u9053\u3092\u6062\u5f18\u305b\u3057\u306f\u3001\u6c38\u9060\u306a\u308b\u9cf4\u795e\u306a\u308a\uff01 Joudou wo kaikou seshi wa, eien naru Narukami nari!; Chinese: \u5e38\u9053\u6062\u5f18\uff0c\u9e23\u795e\u6c38\u6052\uff01 Ch\u00e1ngd\u00e0o hu\u012bh\u00f3ng, M\u00edngsh\u00e9n y\u01d2ngh\u00e9ng!, lit. \"The unchanging way [is] immense, Narukami [is] eternal!\").[Note 2]\nReligion\n\nCompared to Mondstadt and Liyue, Inazuma's religious devotion is much more visible in their culture, as Shogunate-held islands worship the Shogun. The people of Watatsumi Island worship Orobashi instead.\n\nA long time ago, a group of islanders on Tsurumi Island worshipped Kanna Kapatcir, calling her the Thunderbird. Due to unusual circumstances surrounding the island, they did not have any contact with the rest of Inazuma, as they believed that certain death awaited those who traversed the foggy ocean. This tribe was wiped out after Ruu sacrificed himself to appease the Thunderbird when he felt that the situation on the island was becoming worse."

      "content": "I see, so in this chapter, Filon will be visiting Inazuma and interacting with the characters and society there. You can have him learn about the history and culture of Inazuma, and perhaps come across some conflicts or challenges that he has to navigate. For example, he could have to deal with the strict regulations and assessments that citizens must pass in order to leave Inazuma, or he could find himself caught up in the tension and danger that Atsuko describes.\n\nAdditionally, you can have Filon explore the different islands and factions within Inazuma, and how they each have their own unique characteristics and customs. He could also learn about the samurai society and the importance of honor and pride in their culture. As he interacts with the people of Inazuma, he could learn about the impact of the Vision Hunt Decree and the Sakoku Decree on their daily lives, and perhaps even become involved in efforts to improve the situation.\n\nAlso, it could be interesting to see how Filon's experiences in Mondstadt and Liyue shape his perspective on the issues he encounters in Inazuma. He could use the skills and knowledge he gained from building the tram system in Mondstadt to help the people of Inazuma in some way, or he could draw parallels between the struggles of the people of Inazuma and those of Liyue.\n\nOverall, in this chapter, you can have Filon's visit to Inazuma serve as an opportunity to delve deeper into the world-building of the Genshin Impact universe and explore the different cultures and societies that exist within it."
