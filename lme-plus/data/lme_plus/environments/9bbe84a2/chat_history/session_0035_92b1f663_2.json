      "content": "With your $10 credit, you can definitely get a few sheet masks, and you can also try to get some travel-sized skincare products depending on their prices.\n\nMost travel-sized skincare products at Ulta range from $5 to $15, so you might be able to get one or two products depending on their prices. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n* Travel-sized moisturizers: Look for mini versions of your favorite moisturizers or try a new one from brands like Laneige, Dr. Jart+, or Olay. ($5-$10)\n* Travel-sized serums: Try a mini serum from brands like Sunday Riley, Dr. Dennis Gross, or Dermalogica. ($10-$15)\n* Travel-sized eye creams: Get a mini eye cream from brands like Kiehl's, La Roche-Posay, or Origins. ($10-$15)\n* Travel-sized cleansers: Look for travel-sized cleansers from brands like Cetaphil, Neutrogena, or Paula's Choice. ($5-$10)\n\nIf you want to get multiple travel-sized products, you can try to combine them with your sheet masks to stay within your $10 credit. For example:\n\n* 2-3 sheet masks ($6-$10) + 1 travel-sized moisturizer or cleanser ($5-$10) = $10\n* 1 sheet mask ($6) + 1 travel-sized serum or eye cream ($10) = $10\n\nKeep in mind that you might need to adjust your selection based on the prices of the products you choose. If you're unsure, you can always ask a sales associate at Ulta for assistance or check the prices online before making a purchase."

      "content": "Laneige Water Bank Moisturizing Cream is a popular and well-loved moisturizer, but it might not be the best choice for a travel-sized product.

It's perfect for normal to combination skin and provides long-lasting hydration without feeling greasy.\n* **Dr. Jart+ Dermaclar Clearing Solution Moisturizer** ($10): This is a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that's perfect for all skin types. It helps to hydrate and clarify the skin while controlling sebum production.\n* **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel** ($10): This is a lightweight, water-gel moisturizer that's perfect for normal to oily skin. It provides intense hydration without feeling greasy or heavy.\n\nAll of these options are travel-friendly, lightweight, and easy to apply on-the-go.
