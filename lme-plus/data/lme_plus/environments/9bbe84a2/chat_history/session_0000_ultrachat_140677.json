      "content": "Yes, GAIL has made major acquisitions and divestitures in the past five years which have affected the company's financial performance. Here are some of the major acquisitions and divestitures:\n\nAcquisitions:\n\n1. Acquisition of IL&FS Energy Development Company Limited (IEDCL): In March 2019, GAIL acquired IEDCL, which owns and operates a 180 MW gas-based power plant in Tamil Nadu. The acquisition has added to GAIL's power generation capacity and diversified its business portfolio.\n\n2. Acquisition of stake in ONGC Tripura Power Company Ltd. (OTPC): In May 2018, GAIL acquired a 5% stake in OTPC, which owns and operates a 726.6 MW gas-based power plant in Tripura. This acquisition has strengthened GAIL's presence in the power generation segment.\n\nDivestitures:\n\n1. Divestiture of stake in Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL): In August 2018, GAIL divested a 10.2% stake in MGL to comply with regulations that limit cross-holdings in the gas sector. This divestiture helped GAIL comply with regulations and unlock value for its shareholders.\n\n2. Divestiture of stake in Central UP Gas Limited (CUGL): In June 2018, GAIL divested its entire stake in CUGL to Adani Gas Limited as part of its strategy to exit non-core businesses. This divestiture helped GAIL streamline its business operations and focus on its core business segments.\n\nOverall, these acquisitions and divestitures have had a mixed impact on GAIL's financial performance. While some acquisitions have added to the company's revenue and profits, some divestitures have resulted in one-time gains but also resulted in reduced revenue and profits. However, GAIL's overall financial performance has remained stable, with consistent revenue and profits over the past five years."

However, it is worth noting that GAIL has set a target to be among the top 50 global energy companies by 2030, and it has been exploring opportunities to expand its business both domestically and internationally. In the past, GAIL has primarily focused on acquisitions in the areas of pipeline infrastructure, power generation, and petrochemicals. It is likely that GAIL will continue to evaluate opportunities in these areas or other sectors that complement its existing business. Similarly, GAIL may also consider divestitures or restructuring of non-core businesses to optimize its operations and focus on its core strength."
