      "content": "Data Collection:\n\nThe evaluation will use a mixed-methods approach to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The specific data collection methods for each measure are as follows:\n\n1. Physical activity tracking devices: Participants will be provided with a physical activity tracking device to wear for one week before and one week after the festival. The data collected will include daily step count, duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sedentary behavior.\n2. Surveys: Participants will complete an online survey before and after the festival. The survey will include questions about their physical activity levels, attitudes towards physical activity, perceived barriers to physical activity, and demographic information.\n3. Attendance rates: The number of people who attend the festival will be recorded by festival organizers.\n4. Focus groups: Two focus groups will be conducted with participants, one during the festival and one after the festival. The focus groups will be audio recorded and transcribed.\n5. Interviews: Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with festival organizers and community stakeholders. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed.\n6. Participant feedback: Feedback forms will be provided to participants at the end of the festival. The feedback forms will be analyzed for common themes and suggestions for improvement.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nThe quantitative data collected will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to assess changes in physical activity levels and attitudes towards physical activity before and after the festival.\n\nThe qualitative data collected will be analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The transcripts from the focus groups and interviews will be analyzed for common themes and patterns, and the feedback forms will be analyzed for common suggestions for improvement.\n\nThe mixed-methods data will be integrated by using a triangulation approach to compare and contrast the results from the quantitative and qualitative data.\n\nThe results of the evaluation will be presented in a final report, which will include recommendations for future festivals based on the findings."

The statistical analyses will be conducted using software such as SPSS or SAS.\n\nThe qualitative data collected will be analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The transcripts from the focus groups and interviews will be analyzed for common themes and patterns, and the feedback forms will be analyzed for common suggestions for improvement. The analysis will be conducted manually, using an iterative process to identify and refine the themes.\n\nThe mixed-methods data will be integrated by using a triangulation approach to compare and contrast the results from the quantitative and qualitative data. The aim will be to identify convergent, complementary, or divergent findings from both sets of data, and to provide a deeper understanding of the festival's impact.\n\nThe results of the evaluation will be presented in a final report, which will include recommendations for future festivals based on the findings. The report will be written in a clear and concise manner, with appropriate data visualization to enhance understanding. The report will also include a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the evaluation design and methods used."

      "content": "Future Evaluation:\n\nBased on the findings of this evaluation, recommendations for future festivals will be provided. It is recommended that the festival be held every 2-5 years to maintain interest and engagement in physical activity. The following aspects should be considered for future evaluations:\n\n1. Consider using a control group: Future evaluations could use a control group to assess the impact of the festival on physical activity levels, as this would provide more robust evidence of the festival's effectiveness.\n2. Increase sample size: To improve the statistical power of the study, it is recommended that a larger sample size be used in future evaluations. This would allow for more nuanced analyses of the impact of the festival on physical activity levels and attitudes towards physical activity.\n3. Include long-term follow-up: It is recommended that future evaluations include long-term follow-up to assess whether the festival has had a sustained impact on physical activity levels and attitudes towards physical activity.\n4. Expand data collection: In future evaluations, it would be beneficial to collect more detailed data on the types of physical activity engaged in by festival attendees, as well as demographic information to assess whether the festival is reaching a diverse range of individuals.\n5. Assess cost-effectiveness: It would be useful to assess the cost-effectiveness of the festival in future evaluations, to determine whether it represents good value for money in terms of its impact on physical activity levels.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations in future evaluations, the local government can gain a more robust understanding of the impact of the festival on physical activity levels and make evidence-based decisions about future festivals."
