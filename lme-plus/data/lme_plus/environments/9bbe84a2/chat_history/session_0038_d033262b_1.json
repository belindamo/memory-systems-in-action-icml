Here are some tips to help you incorporate them into your vegan stir-fry:\n\n**Preparation**\n\n1. **Bruise the lemongrass**: Before chopping, bruise the lemongrass stalks by bending them gently to release the oils and flavor. This will help to release the aromatic compounds.\n2. **Slice the galangal thinly**: Galangal can be quite fibrous, so slice it thinly to ensure it cooks quickly and evenly.\n3. **Mince or chop finely**: Mince or chop both lemongrass and galangal finely to release their flavors and oils. You can also use a microplane to grate them if you prefer.\n\n**Cooking**\n\n1. **Saute aromatics first**: Saute the minced lemongrass and galangal in a little oil until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. This will help to mellow out their flavors and aromas.\n2. **Add aromatics to the wok**: Add the saut\u00e9ed lemongrass and galangal to the wok with your other aromatics, such as onions, garlic, and ginger.\n3. **Add vegetables and tofu**: Add your mixed vegetables and cubed tofu to the wok, and stir-fry until they're cooked to your liking.\n4. **Balance the flavors**: Add a splash of soy sauce or tamari, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice to balance the flavors. You can also add a bit of chili flakes or sriracha for heat.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n1. **Use a combination of lemongrass and galangal**: Use both lemongrass and galangal for a more complex flavor profile.\n2. **Add coconut milk or cream**: Add a splash of coconut milk or cream to enrich the sauce and add creaminess.\n3. **Experiment with different vegetables**: Try using different vegetables, such as bell peppers, mushrooms, or broccoli, to change up the flavor and texture.\n4. **Add some Thai basil**: Add a sprinkle of fresh Thai basil leaves at the end of cooking to add a bright, fresh flavor.\n\nSome popular vegan stir-fry sauces that you can use as a base:\n\n1. **Peanut sauce**: Made with peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, and chili flakes.\n2. **Tamarind sauce**: Made with tamarind paste, soy sauce, and date syrup.\n3. **Sesame sauce**: Made with tahini, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.\n\nRemember to taste and adjust as you go, and don't be afraid to experiment with different combinations of ingredients and flavors.

Here are some tips on how to toast nuts for the best flavor and crunch:\n\n**Why Toast Nuts?**\n\nToasting nuts can:\n\n1. **Enhance flavor**: Toasting nuts brings out their natural oils, which can add depth and richness to your dish.\n2. **Improve texture**: Toasting nuts can help to crisp them up, making them more crunchy and satisfying.\n3. **Reduce bitterness**: Toasting can help to reduce the bitterness of some nuts, like cashews or almonds.\n\n**How to Toast Nuts**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven**: Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n2. **Spread nuts in a single layer**: Spread the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. This ensures even toasting and prevents nuts from steaming instead of toasting.\n3. **Toast until fragrant**: Toast the nuts for 5-10 minutes, or until they're fragrant and lightly browned. Stir the nuts halfway through the toasting time to ensure even browning.\n4. **Check on them**: Check on the nuts frequently to prevent burning. You can also listen for the nuts to start making a popping sound, which indicates they're toasting nicely.\n5. **Let them cool**: Once toasted, let the nuts cool completely before using them in your stir-fry.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* **Use different nuts**: Experiment with different nuts like peanuts, cashews, almonds, or pecans to find your favorite.\n* **Add aromatics**: Add aromatics like garlic, ginger, or chili flakes to the nuts during the last minute of toasting for added flavor.\n* **Spice them up**: Sprinkle toasted nuts with a pinch of salt, chili powder, or smoked paprika for added flavor.\n* **Try dry-roasting**: Dry-roasting nuts in a skillet over medium heat can also produce a delicious result. Simply stir frequently to prevent burning.\n\nFor your stir-fry, you can toast the nuts just before adding them to the dish. This will help to preserve their crunch and flavor. Simply chop or crush the toasted nuts and add them to your stir-fry towards the end of cooking.\n\nI hope this helps you to create deliciously toasted nuts for your stir-fry!"
