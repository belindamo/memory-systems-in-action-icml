Here are some tips on how to toast nuts for the best flavor and crunch:\n\n**Why Toast Nuts?**\n\nToasting nuts can:\n\n1. **Enhance flavor**: Toasting nuts brings out their natural oils, which can add depth and richness to your dish.\n2. **Improve texture**: Toasting nuts can help to crisp them up, making them more crunchy and satisfying.\n3. **Reduce bitterness**: Toasting can help to reduce the bitterness of some nuts, like cashews or almonds.\n\n**How to Toast Nuts**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven**: Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n2. **Spread nuts in a single layer**: Spread the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. This ensures even toasting and prevents nuts from steaming instead of toasting.\n3. **Toast until fragrant**: Toast the nuts for 5-10 minutes, or until they're fragrant and lightly browned. Stir the nuts halfway through the toasting time to ensure even browning.\n4. **Check on them**: Check on the nuts frequently to prevent burning. You can also listen for the nuts to start making a popping sound, which indicates they're toasting nicely.\n5. **Let them cool**: Once toasted, let the nuts cool completely before using them in your stir-fry.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* **Use different nuts**: Experiment with different nuts like peanuts, cashews, almonds, or pecans to find your favorite.\n* **Add aromatics**: Add aromatics like garlic, ginger, or chili flakes to the nuts during the last minute of toasting for added flavor.\n* **Spice them up**: Sprinkle toasted nuts with a pinch of salt, chili powder, or smoked paprika for added flavor.\n* **Try dry-roasting**: Dry-roasting nuts in a skillet over medium heat can also produce a delicious result. Simply stir frequently to prevent burning.\n\nFor your stir-fry, you can toast the nuts just before adding them to the dish. This will help to preserve their crunch and flavor. Simply chop or crush the toasted nuts and add them to your stir-fry towards the end of cooking.\n\nI hope this helps you to create deliciously toasted nuts for your stir-fry!",
