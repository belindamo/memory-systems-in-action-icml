  "content": "The Asus RT-AC68U is a solid router, and the range extender is a good addition to improve coverage. Given the distance and obstacles between the router and your bedroom, it's not surprising that you're experiencing some signal weakness.\n\nLet's dive deeper into some potential solutions:\n\n1. **Router Placement**: Even though the router is in a central spot, it's worth trying to optimize its placement. Try moving it to a higher location, like a shelf or a table, to improve the signal broadcast. Avoid placing it on the floor or behind furniture, as this can weaken the signal.\n2. **Range Extender Placement**: Since you have a range extender in the living room, try moving it closer to the bedroom to see if it improves the signal strength. You can also try placing it in a more central location between the router and the bedroom.\n3. **Channel Interference**: Interference from neighboring networks or devices can cause signal issues. You can use tools like Wi-Fi Analyzer (for Android or iOS) to scan for nearby networks and identify the least crowded channel. Then, log in to your router's settings (usually 192.168.1.1) and change the Wi-Fi channel to the one you've identified.\n4. **Quality of Service (QoS)**: If you have a lot of devices connected to your network, it might be worth setting up QoS to prioritize traffic to your laptop and smart speaker in the bedroom. This can help ensure that critical devices get sufficient bandwidth. You can do this through your router's settings.\n5. **Update Router Firmware**: Make sure your router's firmware is up to date, as this can improve performance and range. You can check for updates in the router's settings or on the manufacturer's website.\n6. **Wi-Fi Network Congestion**: If you have many devices connected to your network, it might be causing congestion. Consider setting up a guest network or segregating devices onto different networks to reduce congestion.\n7. **Physical Obstacles**: While you mentioned there are a couple of walls between the router and bedroom, it's worth checking if there are any other physical obstacles that might be blocking the signal. Move any large furniture or appliances away from the path between the router and bedroom.\n8. **Mesh Networking**: If you're still experiencing issues, you might consider upgrading to a mesh network system, which can provide a stronger and more reliable signal throughout your home. These systems typically include multiple access points that work together to create a network of interconnected nodes.\n\nTry these suggestions and see if they improve your Wi-Fi signal in the bedroom. If you're still experiencing issues, feel free to provide more details, and I can offer further assistance!",
