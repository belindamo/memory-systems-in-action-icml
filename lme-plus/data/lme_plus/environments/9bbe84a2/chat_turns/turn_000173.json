Since I'm a large language model, I don't have a physical calendar, but we can create a virtual one together.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me about your recent trips? What dates did you travel, and where did you go? Even if you're not sure of the exact dates, approximate dates or time periods would be helpful.\n\nWe can start with your most recent trip and work our way backward. And don't worry, I'll help you keep track of your Montreal trip today as well!\n\nLet's get started!",
