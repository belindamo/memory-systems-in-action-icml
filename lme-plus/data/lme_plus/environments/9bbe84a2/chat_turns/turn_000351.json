Here are a few options to consider:\n\n* Travel-sized moisturizers: Look for mini versions of your favorite moisturizers or try a new one from brands like Laneige, Dr. Jart+, or Olay. ($5-$10)\n* Travel-sized serums: Try a mini serum from brands like Sunday Riley, Dr. Dennis Gross, or Dermalogica. ($10-$15)\n* Travel-sized eye creams: Get a mini eye cream from brands like Kiehl's, La Roche-Posay, or Origins. ($10-$15)\n* Travel-sized cleansers: Look for travel-sized cleansers from brands like Cetaphil, Neutrogena, or Paula's Choice. ($5-$10)\n\nIf you want to get multiple travel-sized products, you can try to combine them with your sheet masks to stay within your $10 credit. For example:\n\n* 2-3 sheet masks ($6-$10) + 1 travel-sized moisturizer or cleanser ($5-$10) = $10\n* 1 sheet mask ($6) + 1 travel-sized serum or eye cream ($10) = $10\n\nKeep in mind that you might need to adjust your selection based on the prices of the products you choose. If you're unsure, you can always ask a sales associate at Ulta for assistance or check the prices online before making a purchase.",
