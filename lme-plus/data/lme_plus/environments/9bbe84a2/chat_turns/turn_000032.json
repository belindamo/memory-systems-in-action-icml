  "content": "I think the most challenging part is probably finding the time and energy to practice regularly, especially on days when I have a lot of work or other commitments. Some days I feel exhausted and just want to collapse on the couch instead of rolling out my yoga mat.\n\nBut I've found that even a short 10-15 minute practice can make a big difference in how I feel, so I'm trying to commit to practicing at least a few times a week, even if it's just a quick flow or some simple stretches. I've also been trying to prioritize self-care and make time for yoga by scheduling it into my daily routine, just like I would any other important appointment.",
