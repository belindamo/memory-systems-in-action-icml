I've been doing a daily writing challenge for 4 weeks now, and I've noticed that some of the stories I tell myself about myself are affecting my writing. Can you give me some examples of how to reframe negative self-talk and practice self-compassion when I'm writing, specifically in the context of my daily writing challenge?",
