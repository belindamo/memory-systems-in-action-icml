  "content": "Yes, emergency responders may also take into account the economic impact of an emergency when determining its severity. A significant economic impact can lead to long-term consequences and can further affect residents, businesses, and the local community. The impact on critical infrastructure, such as transportation networks, can hinder the ability to move goods and services, thus creating economic disruptions. Additionally, the extent of the emergency can also lead to the loss of jobs, a decrease in property value, and other economic concerns. All of these factors can create additional stress on the affected community and hinder their ability to recover. Therefore, emergency responders may consider the economic impact of the emergency as one of the many criteria used to evaluate the severity of the situation.",
