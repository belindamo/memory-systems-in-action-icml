  "content": "Data Analysis:\n\nThe quantitative data collected will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to assess changes in physical activity levels and attitudes towards physical activity before and after the festival. The statistical analyses will be conducted using software such as SPSS or SAS.\n\nThe qualitative data collected will be analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The transcripts from the focus groups and interviews will be analyzed for common themes and patterns, and the feedback forms will be analyzed for common suggestions for improvement. The analysis will be conducted manually, using an iterative process to identify and refine the themes.\n\nThe mixed-methods data will be integrated by using a triangulation approach to compare and contrast the results from the quantitative and qualitative data. The aim will be to identify convergent, complementary, or divergent findings from both sets of data, and to provide a deeper understanding of the festival's impact.\n\nThe results of the evaluation will be presented in a final report, which will include recommendations for future festivals based on the findings. The report will be written in a clear and concise manner, with appropriate data visualization to enhance understanding. The report will also include a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the evaluation design and methods used.",
