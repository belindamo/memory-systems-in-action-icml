  "content": "For a dinner party with 8-10 guests, a good rule of thumb is to plan for about 1/2 to 3/4 of a bottle of wine per guest for a 2-3 hour gathering. This assumes a moderate pace of wine consumption and allows for some flexibility in case some guests drink more or less than others.\n\nBased on this guideline, for 8-10 guests, you can estimate:\n\n* 4-6 bottles of wine for a 2-hour gathering (assuming 1/2 bottle per guest)\n* 6-8 bottles of wine for a 3-hour gathering (assuming 3/4 bottle per guest)\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and you should consider the following factors to adjust your calculations:\n\n* Wine style: If you're serving a lighter-style wine like Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc, guests might drink more than if you were serving a fuller-bodied wine like Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon.\n* Food pairing: If you're serving wine-pairing-friendly dishes like the Pesto Pasta and Bruschetta, guests might drink more wine. If you're serving dishes with stronger flavors or spices, wine consumption might be lower.\n* Guest preferences: If you have guests who don't drink wine or prefer beer or cocktails, you can adjust the estimate downward.\n* Personal preferences: If you're hosting wine enthusiasts or know that your guests tend to enjoy wine, you might want to lean toward the higher end of the estimate.\n\nTo be safe, consider stocking up on a few extra bottles to account for unexpected guests or second helpings. You can always store any leftover wine for future gatherings or enjoy it yourself!\n\nFor your dinner party, I'd recommend having 6-8 bottles of wine on hand, assuming a 2-3 hour gathering. This will give you a comfortable buffer and ensure that you have enough wine for your guests to enjoy throughout the evening.",
