If you're interested in architecture, Sherbrooke's Doors Open event might be the best to attend. If you're interested in music and cultural events, then the Jazz and Blues Festival or F\u00eate du Lac des Nations might be more up your alley. You can check the Sherbrooke tourism website for more information on events and activities to help decide which one fits your preferences.",
