Here are some tips to help you incorporate them into your vegan stir-fry:\n\n**Preparation**\n\n1. **Bruise the lemongrass**: Before chopping, bruise the lemongrass stalks by bending them gently to release the oils and flavor. This will help to release the aromatic compounds.\n2. **Slice the galangal thinly**: Galangal can be quite fibrous, so slice it thinly to ensure it cooks quickly and evenly.\n3. **Mince or chop finely**: Mince or chop both lemongrass and galangal finely to release their flavors and oils. You can also use a microplane to grate them if you prefer.\n\n**Cooking**\n\n1. **Saute aromatics first**: Saute the minced lemongrass and galangal in a little oil until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. This will help to mellow out their flavors and aromas.\n2. **Add aromatics to the wok**: Add the saut\u00e9ed lemongrass and galangal to the wok with your other aromatics, such as onions, garlic, and ginger.\n3. **Add vegetables and tofu**: Add your mixed vegetables and cubed tofu to the wok, and stir-fry until they're cooked to your liking.\n4. **Balance the flavors**: Add a splash of soy sauce or tamari, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice to balance the flavors. You can also add a bit of chili flakes or sriracha for heat.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n1. **Use a combination of lemongrass and galangal**: Use both lemongrass and galangal for a more complex flavor profile.\n2. **Add coconut milk or cream**: Add a splash of coconut milk or cream to enrich the sauce and add creaminess.\n3. **Experiment with different vegetables**: Try using different vegetables, such as bell peppers, mushrooms, or broccoli, to change up the flavor and texture.\n4. **Add some Thai basil**: Add a sprinkle of fresh Thai basil leaves at the end of cooking to add a bright, fresh flavor.\n\nSome popular vegan stir-fry sauces that you can use as a base:\n\n1. **Peanut sauce**: Made with peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, and chili flakes.\n2. **Tamarind sauce**: Made with tamarind paste, soy sauce, and date syrup.\n3. **Sesame sauce**: Made with tahini, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.\n\nRemember to taste and adjust as you go, and don't be afraid to experiment with different combinations of ingredients and flavors. Good luck and enjoy your delicious vegan stir-fry!",
