However, it is worth noting that GAIL has set a target to be among the top 50 global energy companies by 2030, and it has been exploring opportunities to expand its business both domestically and internationally. In the past, GAIL has primarily focused on acquisitions in the areas of pipeline infrastructure, power generation, and petrochemicals. It is likely that GAIL will continue to evaluate opportunities in these areas or other sectors that complement its existing business. Similarly, GAIL may also consider divestitures or restructuring of non-core businesses to optimize its operations and focus on its core strength.",
