You can also use red shallots or scallions for a different flavor profile.\n2. **Slice thinly**: Slice the shallots thinly, using a mandoline or sharp knife. Try to slice them to a uniform thickness for even frying.\n3. **Separate the rings**: Separate the shallot rings from each other to prevent them from clumping together during frying.\n4. **Dry the shallots**: Pat the shallot rings dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps them fry up crispy.\n5. **Fry in hot oil**: Heat about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of oil in a deep frying pan or a deep fryer to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Fry the shallot rings in batches until they're golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per batch.\n6. **Drain excess oil**: Remove the fried shallots from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.\n7. **Season immediately**: Sprinkle the crispy fried shallots with salt and any other desired seasonings (e.g., chili powder, garlic powder) immediately after frying, while they're still warm.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* **Use the right oil**: Use a neutral-tasting oil with a high smoke point, like peanut or avocado oil, for frying.\n* **Don't overcrowd**: Fry the shallots in batches to prevent them from clumping together and to ensure even cooking.\n* **Experiment with flavors**: Try adding different seasonings or aromatics to the oil before frying the shallots, like garlic, ginger, or chili flakes.\n* **Make ahead**: Crispy fried shallots can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days.\n\nTo add crispy fried shallots to your stir-fry, simply sprinkle them on top of your dish before serving. You can also use them as a garnish or add them to salads, soups, or other dishes for added flavor and texture.\n\nI hope this helps you to create delicious, crispy fried shallots for your stir-fry!",
