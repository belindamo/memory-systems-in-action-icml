This is due to Instagram's API limitations and privacy policies, which restrict third-party apps like Hootsuite from accessing certain data.\n\n**The Good News:**\n\nHowever, there are a few workarounds to help you keep track of your comments on Instagram:\n\n1. **Manual Tracking:** Take a screenshot of your comment or copy the text and save it in a note-taking app like Evernote or OneNote.\n2. **Instagram's Comment Section:** You can manually check the comment section of the post to see your comment and any subsequent responses.\n3. **Instagram Notifications:** If you have notifications enabled, you'll receive alerts when someone responds to your comment.\n\nWhile these methods aren't as convenient as having a built-in tracking feature, they can help you keep tabs on your comments and engage with your friends on Instagram.\n\nRemember, Hootsuite is primarily designed for scheduling and managing content, not tracking individual comments. If you need help with content scheduling or organization, I'm here to assist you!",
