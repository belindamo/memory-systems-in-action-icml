  "content": "Future Evaluation:\n\nBased on the findings of this evaluation, recommendations for future festivals will be provided. It is recommended that the festival be held every 2-5 years to maintain interest and engagement in physical activity. The following aspects should be considered for future evaluations:\n\n1. Consider using a control group: Future evaluations could use a control group to assess the impact of the festival on physical activity levels, as this would provide more robust evidence of the festival's effectiveness.\n2. Increase sample size: To improve the statistical power of the study, it is recommended that a larger sample size be used in future evaluations. This would allow for more nuanced analyses of the impact of the festival on physical activity levels and attitudes towards physical activity.\n3. Include long-term follow-up: It is recommended that future evaluations include long-term follow-up to assess whether the festival has had a sustained impact on physical activity levels and attitudes towards physical activity.\n4. Expand data collection: In future evaluations, it would be beneficial to collect more detailed data on the types of physical activity engaged in by festival attendees, as well as demographic information to assess whether the festival is reaching a diverse range of individuals.\n5. Assess cost-effectiveness: It would be useful to assess the cost-effectiveness of the festival in future evaluations, to determine whether it represents good value for money in terms of its impact on physical activity levels.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations in future evaluations, the local government can gain a more robust understanding of the impact of the festival on physical activity levels and make evidence-based decisions about future festivals.",
