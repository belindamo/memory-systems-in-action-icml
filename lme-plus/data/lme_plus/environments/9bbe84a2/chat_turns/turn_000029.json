Downward-facing dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana) and child's pose (Balasana) are two of the most popular and beneficial yoga poses, and for good reason!\n\nDownward-facing dog is an excellent stretch for the hamstrings, calves, and spine. It can also help:\n\n* Stretch the entire back side of the body, from the shoulders to the heels\n* Strengthen the arms, shoulders, and core\n* Improve flexibility in the hips and ankles\n* Reduce stress and anxiety by calming the nervous system\n\nChild's pose, on the other hand, is a wonderful resting pose that can help:\n\n* Stretch the back, hips, and legs\n* Relax the neck and shoulders\n* Calm the mind and reduce stress\n* Provide a gentle stretch for the spine and torso\n\nBoth poses are great for beginners and experienced practitioners alike, and they're easy to modify to suit your needs.\n\nWhen practicing downward-facing dog, remember to:\n\n* Keep your palms and heels grounded\n* Engage your core and maintain a straight line from head to heels\n* Breathe deeply and slowly, feeling the stretch in your hamstrings and calves\n\nFor child's pose, focus on:\n\n* Kneeling down and sitting back onto your heels\n* Stretching your arms out in front of you, lowering your forehead to the ground\n* Relaxing your shoulders, neck, and back, feeling the calmness spread through your body\n\nRemember to listen to your body and modify or come out of the pose if you experience any discomfort or pain.\n\nWhat do you like most about practicing downward-facing dog and child's pose? Is there a particular benefit or feeling you experience when you practice these poses?",
