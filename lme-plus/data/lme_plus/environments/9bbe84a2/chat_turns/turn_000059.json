While there are bike shops and repair services along the Elroy-Sparta State Trail, it's always better to be prepared and self-sufficient, especially if you're planning to ride during peak hours or in remote areas.\n\nHere are some basic tools and supplies you might consider packing:\n\n* A multi-tool or pocket tool with Allen wrenches, screwdrivers, and Torx bits\n* A pump or CO2 cartridge inflator\n* Spare tubes and tires (in case of a flat)\n* Chain breaker and spare chain links\n* Quick links or chain connectors\n* Cable adjusters and spare cables\n* Basic first-aid kit with supplies for minor injuries\n\nYou can also consider packing a small bag or saddle bag with these tools and supplies, so you can easily carry them with you on the trail.\n\nThat being said, there are indeed bike shops and repair services along the Elroy-Sparta State Trail that you can rely on in case you need more extensive repairs or assistance. Here are a few options:\n\n* The Sparta Bike Shop in Sparta, WI (near the trailhead)\n* The Elroy Bike Shop in Elroy, WI (near the trailhead)\n* The Tunnel Trail Cycles in Wilton, WI (mid-trail)\n* The Kendallville Cycles in Kendall, WI (mid-trail)\n\nThese shops offer a range of services, from basic repairs to more extensive overhauls, and they may also have rentals or demo bikes available if you need a replacement.\n\nRemember to check the trail's website or contact the bike shops directly to confirm their hours of operation, services, and availability before your trip.\n\nBy packing some basic tools and supplies, you'll be well-prepared for any minor issues that might arise on the trail. And with the bike shops and repair services along the way, you can rest assured that you'll have access to more extensive support if needed. Happy riding!",
