  "content": "While the surround sound issue might be a minor annoyance, it's not necessarily a dealbreaker for playing Apex Legends competitively. Here's why:\n\n1. **Apex Legends' audio design**: Apex Legends' audio design is relatively forgiving when it comes to surround sound. The game's sound cues are designed to be audible and intelligible, even with stereo sound. You'll still be able to hear enemy footsteps, gunfire, and other important sounds.\n2. **Competitive players often rely on visuals**: In competitive Apex Legends, players often rely more on visual cues than audio cues. You'll be focusing on your mini-map, watching for enemy movements, and using your crosshairs to track targets. While audio is important, it's not the only factor in competitive play.\n3. **Pro players often use stereo sound**: Many professional Apex Legends players, including pros and streamers, use stereo sound or even disable surround sound altogether. This is because they've developed their skills to rely more on visual cues and muscle memory.\n4. **The Cloud II's other strengths**: The HyperX Cloud II's comfort, microphone quality, and overall sound quality are still top-notch. These factors can contribute to a more immersive and engaging gaming experience, even if the surround sound isn't perfect.\n\nThat being said, if you're extremely particular about surround sound and rely heavily on audio cues in competitive games, you might want to consider other options. However, if you're looking for a comfortable, great-sounding headset with a good microphone, the Cloud II is still an excellent choice.\n\nRemember, competitive gaming is about adapting to your equipment and developing your skills. With practice and experience, you can learn to compensate for any minor limitations in the Cloud II's surround sound.",
