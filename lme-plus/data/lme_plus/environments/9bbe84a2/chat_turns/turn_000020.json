  "content": "I think the difficulty curve was well-balanced, it was challenging but not frustratingly difficult. I did die a few times, but it was mostly because I was trying to rush through certain sections. Once I took my time and played more strategically, I was able to overcome the tough parts. I'm not sure if I'll replay it again on an even higher difficulty, but I might try it out in the future. For now, I'm looking forward to trying out some of the other games we discussed earlier.",
