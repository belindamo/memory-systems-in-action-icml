  "content": "Data Collection:\n\nThe evaluation will use a mixed-methods approach to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The specific data collection methods for each measure are as follows:\n\n1. Physical activity tracking devices: Participants will be provided with a physical activity tracking device to wear for one week before and one week after the festival. The data collected will include daily step count, duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sedentary behavior.\n2. Surveys: Participants will complete an online survey before and after the festival. The survey will include questions about their physical activity levels, attitudes towards physical activity, perceived barriers to physical activity, and demographic information.\n3. Attendance rates: The number of people who attend the festival will be recorded by festival organizers.\n4. Focus groups: Two focus groups will be conducted with participants, one during the festival and one after the festival. The focus groups will be audio recorded and transcribed.\n5. Interviews: Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with festival organizers and community stakeholders. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed.\n6. Participant feedback: Feedback forms will be provided to participants at the end of the festival. The feedback forms will be analyzed for common themes and suggestions for improvement.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nThe quantitative data collected will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to assess changes in physical activity levels and attitudes towards physical activity before and after the festival.\n\nThe qualitative data collected will be analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The transcripts from the focus groups and interviews will be analyzed for common themes and patterns, and the feedback forms will be analyzed for common suggestions for improvement.\n\nThe mixed-methods data will be integrated by using a triangulation approach to compare and contrast the results from the quantitative and qualitative data.\n\nThe results of the evaluation will be presented in a final report, which will include recommendations for future festivals based on the findings.",
