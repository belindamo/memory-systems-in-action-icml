  "content": "I've got an Asus RT-AC68U router, and it's located in a central spot in my living room. The bedroom is about 20 feet away, with a couple of walls in between. I've got a range extender in the living room, which helps with coverage, but the signal is still a bit weak in the bedroom. I've got a laptop and a smart speaker connected to the Wi-Fi in the bedroom, and they both experience slow speeds and occasional disconnections. I've tried restarting the router, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.",
