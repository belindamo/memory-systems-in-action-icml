Exploring different genres and finding inspiration in the music you listen to can definitely influence your guitar playing style and the type of music you'll want to play.\n\nThe genres you mentioned - indie rock, electronic, and hip-hop - are quite diverse, but they can all have an impact on your guitar playing in different ways. Here are some possible ways these genres and artists might influence your playing style:\n\n**Indie Rock:**\n\n* Chord progressions: Indie rock often features catchy, memorable chord progressions. You might find yourself drawn to playing more complex, introspective chord progressions or experimenting with alternative tunings.\n* Rhythm and strumming: Indie rock often emphasizes rhythm and groove, so you might focus on developing a strong, consistent strumming pattern or exploring different rhythmic techniques like arpeggios or fingerpicking.\n* Atmospheric textures: Indie rock often incorporates ambient, atmospheric textures, which might inspire you to experiment with effects pedals or unconventional playing techniques to create a more ethereal sound.\n\n**Electronic:**\n\n* Rhythmic emphasis: Electronic music often features prominent, driving rhythms, which might influence your playing style to focus on strong, syncopated rhythms or incorporating electronic elements into your sound.\n* Sound design: Electronic music often involves heavy use of effects processing and sound design. You might experiment with using pedals, plugins, or other tools to create unique, synthesized sounds on your guitar.\n* Minimalism: Electronic music often features minimalist, repetitive phrases or hooks. You might find yourself drawn to playing simpler, more repetitive parts that build into a larger, atmospheric sound.\n\n**Hip-Hop:**\n\n* Rhythmic complexity: Hip-hop often features intricate, syncopated rhythms, which might challenge you to develop your timing and rhythmic accuracy.\n* Groove-oriented playing: Hip-hop emphasizes the groove and the feel, so you might focus on playing with a strong, infectious groove and experimenting with different rhythmic feels.\n* Sampling and interpolation: Hip-hop often incorporates samples and interpolations of other songs or sounds. You might find yourself drawn to incorporating samples or referencing other songs in your own music.\n\nAs for Tame Impala's \"Slow Rush,\" that album is a great example of psychedelic rock and indie psychedelia. Kevin Parker's guitar playing is characterized by:\n\n* Dreamy, effects-heavy soundscapes: Tame Impala's sound is heavily influenced by psychedelic rock and features extensive use of effects pedals, reverse audio, and other sound design techniques.\n* Intricate, melodic playing: Parker's guitar parts often feature intricate, melodic lines that weave together to create a rich, textured sound.\n* Experimentation with tone: Tame Impala's sound is known for its warm, fuzzy tone, which is achieved through a combination of guitar and effects choices.\n\nAs you continue to explore these genres and artists, you might find yourself drawn to certain aspects of their playing styles or soundscapes. Don't be afraid to experiment and incorporate these influences into your own playing!\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of learning and creating. The more you play and experiment, the more your own unique style will emerge.",
