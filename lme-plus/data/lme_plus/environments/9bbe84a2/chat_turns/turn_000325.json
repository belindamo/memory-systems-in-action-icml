  "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have have access to real-time information about specific local museums. I can suggest a few options to help you find out if the City Art Museum is open on Sundays:\n\n1. **Check their website**: Look up the City Art Museum's website and check their \"Hours\" or \"Visit\" section. Most museums list their hours of operation, including Sundays, on their website.\n2. **Call the museum directly**: Give the museum a call and ask about their Sunday hours. They'll be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information.\n3. **Check social media or online directories**: Look up the museum's social media profiles (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) or online directories like Yelp or TripAdvisor to see if they've posted their hours or have a listing with Sunday hours.\n4. **Visit their Facebook page or website's events calendar**: Sometimes, museums post their events and exhibitions on their Facebook page or website's events calendar, which might include information about Sunday hours.\n\nRemember to double-check the information before heading out to the museum to avoid any disappointment. Enjoy your visit!",
