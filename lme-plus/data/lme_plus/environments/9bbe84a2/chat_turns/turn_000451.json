  "content": "I've been thinking about ways to reduce my daily commute expenses, and carpooling is definitely one of them. I'm actually planning to start a carpool with some colleagues from next month. We're still discussing the logistics, but it seems like a great way to reduce our carbon footprint and commuting time. I got stuck in a massive traffic jam on the highway due to an accident two weeks ago, which was a nightmare, so I'm really hoping this carpool system will help me avoid that in the future. Do you have any advice on how I can calculate the fuel costs and tolls for our carpool?",
