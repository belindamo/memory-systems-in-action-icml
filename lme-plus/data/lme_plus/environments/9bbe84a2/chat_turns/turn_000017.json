You can check your playtime for each game by going to the \"My Games & Apps\" section, selecting the game, and then looking at the \"Achievements\" or \"Game Progress\" tab.\n2. **HowLongToBeat**: This website allows you to track your playtime and estimate how long it'll take to complete a game. You can create an account, add games to your list, and log your playtime. It also provides estimates based on other players' completion times.\n3. **TrueAchievements**: This website is primarily focused on tracking achievements, but it also allows you to log your playtime. You can create an account, add games to your list, and track your progress.\n4. **Game trackers like Playtime Tracker or Game Time Tracker**: These are third-party apps available on mobile devices that allow you to track your playtime across multiple platforms, including Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.\n5. **Spreadsheet or notes app**: If you prefer a more manual approach, you can create a spreadsheet or use a notes app to track your playtime. Simply create a table or list with columns for the game title, start date, end date, and total playtime.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and happy tracking!\n\nBy the way, I'm excited to hear that you're interested in Days Gone and Horizon Zero Dawn. Both games have excellent stories and gameplay mechanics. Let me know what you think of them once you've had a chance to play them!",
