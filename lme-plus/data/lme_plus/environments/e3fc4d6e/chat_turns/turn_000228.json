  "content": "I'm planning to focus on specific areas, like the tracks, hull, and turret, to create a more realistic weathered look. I want to add rust and dirt to the areas that would naturally accumulate it, like the tracks and lower hull, and then blend it into the surrounding areas to create a subtle, nuanced effect. I've also been thinking about adding some mud and dust to the wheels and tracks to give it a more battle-worn look.\n\nI've been looking at reference images of real T-34s and trying to study how the rust and dirt accumulate on the different surfaces. It's amazing how much detail and texture you can add to a model just by paying attention to the way the weathering forms in real life.\n\nDo you think I should try to add any additional details, like scratches or chipping, to the model to make it look more realistic? I've seen some models with really subtle scratches and chips that add a lot of character to the model.",
