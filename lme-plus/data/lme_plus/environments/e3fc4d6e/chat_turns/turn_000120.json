Verve Coffee Roasters for coffee, followed by lunch at The Apple Pan, and potentially sitting outside if the weather cooperates.\n\nRemember to be flexible and open to any changes or suggestions Sophia might have. The most important thing is to enjoy each other's company and have a great conversation.\n\nIf you need any more recommendations or tips, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you both have a fantastic time and a wonderful meetup!",
