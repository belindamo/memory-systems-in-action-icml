  "content": "Durr\u00ebs is one of the most important towns in Albania, located on the Adriatic Sea, and has a long history of cultural and economic importance. However, the town has been impacted by significant environmental factors such as coastal erosion and sea level rise, which have had negative effects on its cultural and economic sustainability over time.\n\nCoastal erosion is one of the significant environmental factors that have affected Durr\u00ebs' cultural and economic sustainability. The town is situated on the coast and has been experiencing severe coastal erosion for a long time, which has led to a significant loss of beach sand, degradation of the coastline, and damage to infrastructure. The loss of the beach sand has reduced the beach size, causing a decline in tourism, which is one of the significant sources of revenue for Durr\u00ebs' economy. Additionally, the coastal erosion has damaged the infrastructure, such as the beach promenade, which has negatively impacted the cultural identity of Durr\u00ebs.\n\nSea level rise is another environmental factor that has affected Durr\u00ebs' cultural and economic sustainability over time. Climate change has caused global warming, leading to a rise in sea level, which has impacted the town. The rise in sea level has caused frequent and severe flooding, resulting in property damage to buildings and infrastructure. This has affected the economic sustainability of the town as it may lead to reduced investment and tourism. Additionally, the flooding has also impacted the cultural sustainability of Durr\u00ebs as it has caused damage to historical buildings that have cultural significance, such as the Byzantine city walls.\n\nIn conclusion, environmental factors such as coastal erosion and sea level rise have significantly impacted Durr\u00ebs' cultural and economic sustainability over time. Urgent action is essential to mitigate these environmental factors' impact and ensure that Durr\u00ebs remains a sustainable and attractive place to visit and invest in.",
