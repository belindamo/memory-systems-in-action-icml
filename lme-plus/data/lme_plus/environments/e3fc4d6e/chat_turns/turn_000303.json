As a conversational AI, I don't have access to real-time information about specific art exhibitions or galleries. \"The Artisan's Space\" doesn't seem to be a well-known or prominent art institution, so I'm assuming it might be a local or fictional gallery.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to provide more general information about Abstract Expressionism and its key artists, or offer book recommendations that might help you learn more about the movement. If you're interested in learning more about a specific artist or exhibition, feel free to let me know and I'll do my best to help!\n\nAlternatively, if you have any questions about the artworks you saw at \"The Artisan's Space,\" I can try to provide some general insights or information about Abstract Expressionism that might help you better understand and appreciate the pieces.",
