As more and more tourists flock to the city in search of the perfect tapas experience, some locals may have changed the way they make and serve their tapas to cater to these expectations.\n\nFor example, some tapas bars may have adjusted their menus to offer more \"Instagrammable\" dishes that cater to tourists' desire for unique, visually stunning presentations. Others may have altered their recipes to incorporate more modern or fusion flavors, rather than traditional Andalusian ingredients and techniques.\n\nHowever, it's also worth noting that many locals are deeply passionate about the centuries-old tradition of tapas making and take great pride in preserving its authenticity. While they may cater to tourists' expectations to some extent, they are unlikely to compromise on the quality and authenticity of their dishes.\n\nMoreover, technology has also provided a platform for locals to showcase their traditional tapas-making skills and educate visitors about the cultural and historical significance of this beloved culinary tradition. Many tapas bars now offer cooking classes, food tours, and other experiential opportunities that allow visitors to learn about the history, culture, and techniques behind tapas making from local experts.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some impact of technology on the authenticity of Seville's tapas scene, the locals who are passionate about this culinary heritage are putting the emphasis on preserving the authenticity and educating visitors rather than compromising it.",
