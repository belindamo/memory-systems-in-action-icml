The key is to find a time that works for you and your lifestyle.\n\n**Why 9 or 10 PM might be a good starting point:**\n\n1. **Buffer time**: Stopping phone use 1-2 hours before bed allows your brain to wind down and relax, making it easier to fall asleep.\n2. **Reduced blue light exposure**: By stopping phone use earlier, you'll reduce your exposure to blue light, which can suppress melatonin production and make it harder to fall asleep.\n3. **Improved sleep quality**: A digital detox before bed can lead to better sleep quality, as you're giving your brain a chance to relax and recharge.\n\n**Tips to make it stick:**\n\n1. **Set a specific goal**: Choose a specific time, like 9 or 10 PM, and make it a non-negotiable part of your daily routine.\n2. **Use phone features to your advantage**: Enable features like Screen Time on iOS or Digital Wellbeing on Android to track your phone usage and set time limits for specific apps or categories.\n3. **Create a phone-free zone**: Designate your bedroom as a phone-free zone to associate it with sleep and relaxation.\n4. **Find alternative activities**: Replace phone time with relaxing activities like reading, journaling, or listening to calming music.\n5. **Make it a habit**: Consistency is key. Try to stick to your designated phone-free time even on weekends or days off.\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n1. **Implement a \"phone bedtime\" routine**: Develop a short routine to signal to your brain that it's time to put the phone away, such as storing your phone in a designated spot or doing a quick stretch.\n2. **Use apps that promote digital detox**: Apps like Freedom, SelfControl, or Moment can help you stay on track and block distracting websites or apps during your designated phone-free time.\n3. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it may take some time to adjust to a new routine. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up \u2013 simply acknowledge the setback and try again.\n\nBy setting a specific time to stop using your phone, you'll be taking a significant step towards creating a healthier relationship with your device and improving your overall sleep quality.",
