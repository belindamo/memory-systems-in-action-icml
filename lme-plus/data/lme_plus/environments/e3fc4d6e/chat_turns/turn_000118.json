  "content": "The Apple Pan is a fantastic choice for lunch, and their burgers and pies are indeed legendary!\n\nAccording to their website and various reviews, The Apple Pan does have a small outdoor seating area, but it's limited. They have a few tables and stools outside, but it's not a large patio or outdoor space. However, if the weather is nice, it's a great spot to people-watch and enjoy the West Hollywood atmosphere.\n\nKeep in mind that The Apple Pan is a classic diner, and the majority of their seating is indoors. But if you and Sophia are lucky, you might be able to snag one of the outdoor tables. If not, the diner's retro interior is still a lot of fun and a great place to catch up.\n\nIt's always a good idea to call ahead or check their social media to confirm their outdoor seating availability, especially if it's a busy day or during peak lunch hours.\n\nFingers crossed you'll get to enjoy the nice weather and a delicious meal at The Apple Pan!",
