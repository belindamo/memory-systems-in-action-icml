The Albanian government has set a goal to increase the country's share of renewable energy to 38% by 2020, and this will undoubtedly involve further investment in renewable energy projects and infrastructure in Durr\u00ebs.\n\nMoreover, the government is committed to promoting sustainable agriculture practices, such as agroforestry, as a way of improving soil health, benefiting small farmers, and reducing deforestation. Such programs may benefit farmers in Durr\u00ebs and surrounding communities by promoting the use of traditional crops requiring limited water and providing access to markets.\n\nFurthermore, Durr\u00ebs is a participant in the European Energy Award program, which is a certification scheme aimed at promoting sustainable energy use and management. The municipality has already achieved certification and is committed to maintaining and improving its standards.\n\nIn conclusion, there are indeed plans for further initiatives in Durr\u00ebs to promote sustainability. These initiatives range from renewable energy projects, sustainable agriculture practices to award certification schemes, and if successful, they will help to promote the long-term sustainability of the town's environment and economy.",
