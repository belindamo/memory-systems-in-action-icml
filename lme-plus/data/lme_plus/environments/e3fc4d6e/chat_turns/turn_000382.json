Chance or luck is often seen as an element that contributes to our destiny. Even with our best efforts, certain outcomes may seem random and unpredictable. There is a philosophical argument that the universe operates on a certain degree of chance or randomness, which may be reflected in our own lives.\n\nHowever, others may argue that our destiny is neither predetermined nor a matter of chance. Instead, our choices, motivations, and actions determine what we become, how we feel, and what we achieve. Therefore, while chance may play a role in shaping our lives, we still have a substantial amount of control to influence our future.\n\nIn the end, the debate on the role of chance in shaping our destiny is a largely philosophical and subjective one, with many factors contributing to the debate. It ultimately depends on your personal beliefs and perspective on the nature of the universe's order.",
