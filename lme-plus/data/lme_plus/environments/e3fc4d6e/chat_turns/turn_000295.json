  "content": "It is currently not clear whether galaxies can exist without black holes, as current observations do not provide any compelling evidence for such systems.\n\nMost large galaxies in the Universe, including our own Milky Way, are thought to host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their centers. These SMBHs have masses of millions or even billions of solar masses and are thought to have played an important role in shaping the evolution of their host galaxies, as I mentioned in my previous answer.\n\nThere are some low-mass galaxies, such as dwarf galaxies, that do not appear to have active SMBHs in their centers. However, these galaxies may still contain dormant or \"quiet\" black holes that do not accrete material and do not emit detectable radiation.\n\nFurthermore, there are some rare types of galaxies, called \"red nuggets,\" that are extremely compact and contain little gas or dust. These galaxies may have formed in the early Universe through intense bursts of star formation and subsequent mergers, without significant contributions from black hole feedback. However, even these systems are thought to have evolved into larger galaxies with SMBHs at their centers over time.\n\nTherefore, while galaxies without black holes cannot be ruled out, current observational evidence suggests that most if not all galaxies contain black holes at their centers, and that these black holes have played a significant role in shaping their evolution.",
