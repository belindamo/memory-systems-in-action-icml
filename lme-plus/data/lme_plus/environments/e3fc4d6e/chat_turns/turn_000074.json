  "content": "Evaluate this rough outline for an argumentative paper in MLA format for a college rhetoric class. I have to revise this outline and turn it into a formal outline with a lot more detail and specificity than what I have here, from both source material and my own analysis and contribution. Provide targeted, detailed and actionable suggestion. Be specific and precise. Evaluate first with what follows and then I will ask more targeted questions: A person's level of happiness is determined by their own choice and intentions. (Thesis)\nI. People can choose to be happy for the little things that happen in their lives.\n\uf076 Concession: Some people may not have the choice to be happy for the little things in their lives. For example, someone that has experienced a traumatic event may not be able to find happiness.\nCounter Arguments \na. Focusing on the frequency of positive moments makes people happy.\no Keeps people happy in the long term\no Learning to be happy for the things already in your life\no For example: productive job, romantic partner, several hobbies or interests (Road to happiness/ John Reich and Ed Diener)\no Frequency, not intensity (Ed Diener)\nb. Not waiting for big positive moments to come by\no Waiting may lead to disappointment\no Only lasts for a short period of time\nc. The amount of gratitude a happy person has\no Expressing gratitude makes you happy\n\uf0a7 Craig DeMartino (Kathleen McGowan)\no Study on showing gratitude for the people around you (The Science of Happiness)\nII. A happy person chooses to see the positive side of things.\n\uf076 Concession: On the other hand, some people might argue that a person that always sees only the positive may become gullible to deceit.\na. However, people will not ignore their difficulties/adversities but overcome them.\no John Keats story (Eric G.

To gain happiness people\u2019s perspectives need to change. \n\uf076 Concession: Some people may find that altering their outlook on life does not lead to happiness because they may be stuck in a cycle of negative thinking. Focusing too much on achieving happiness can cause feelings of guilt and pressure, leading to further unhappiness. \na. In spite of this, changing how you see social media can help reduce feelings of guilt and pressure. \no Choosing to not feel bad about your life because of what other people post online\no Choosing to disregard or ignore bad comments about yourself \nb. Surrounding yourself in a positive environment will have a major impact on your mindset.\no How you perceive the events happening around you\n\uf0a7 The negatives\no Taking in the emotions around\n\uf0a7 Surrounding yourself with good and happy vibes\no How you think people perceive you\nIV. A person can create his or her own happiness by intentionally engaging in activities and training their minds.\n\uf076 Concession: However, some people may be predisposed to happiness or unhappiness due to their genes.\na.

Relationships and friendships are a key part of having a fulfilling life, and having a purpose helps to keep us motivated and driven.\no what kind of people around you/ supportive people\n\uf0a7 surround yourself with people that are positive\n\uf0a7 giving or helping others makes you happy(Todd B. Kashdan and Robert Biswas-Diener)\no Deriving meaningful relationships or purpose at work or in what you do\n\uf0a7 Example TED talk (Chip Conley) maid\nVI. Happy people make conscious decisions to take care of their physical and mental wellbeing by eating nutritious food, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep. They also tend to be more mindful, focusing on the present moment and being more aware of their thoughts and emotions.\n\uf076 Concession: Other people, however, may not be able to make these choices due to outside stressors, and may not have the time or resources to do so.\na. People who suffer from an injury or illness still have ability to choose how much happiness they acquire.
