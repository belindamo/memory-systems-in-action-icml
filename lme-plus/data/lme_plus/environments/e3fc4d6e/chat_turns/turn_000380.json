The notion of free will versus destiny is a complex one that has been debated for centuries. Some hold the view that fate is predetermined, while others argue that we have agency and can shape our own destiny. In the end, it is a matter of interpretation and perspective as there is no conclusive answer.\n\nIn some ways, one could say that our choices and actions shape our own destiny. If we make certain decisions and take specific actions, it may influence the course of our lives. However, some events in life can occur without our control, such as natural disasters or other unforeseen circumstances. In those cases, it may seem that fate plays a role, but even then, our reaction and response to such events can shape our destiny moving forward. Ultimately, whether free will can override destiny is a subject of much debate, with both sides offering compelling arguments.",
