  "content": "Lee's defensive strategy played a significant role in the Confederate Army's performance during the Civil War. By defending the Confederate territory, Lee aimed to protect his army's resources and minimize casualties. This strategy allowed Lee to conserve his army's strength, limit Union advances, and prolong the war. \n\nLee's well-planned defenses enabled him to repel Union attacks and win tactical victories in several battles, such as the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1862. However, the defensive strategy also had its limitations. By staying on the defense, the Confederate Army could not seize the initiative and was forced to wait for the Union to attack. This lack of initiative was a disadvantage for the Confederacy, allowing the Union to advance and cut off Confederate supply lines.\n\nOverall, Lee's defensive strategy made a notable difference in the Confederate Army's performance during the Civil War. It allowed the army to conserve resources, limit Union advances, and prolong the war. However, it also had limitations that reduced the army's overall effectiveness, and the strategy alone could not overcome the significant resource disparity between the Union and Confederacy.",
