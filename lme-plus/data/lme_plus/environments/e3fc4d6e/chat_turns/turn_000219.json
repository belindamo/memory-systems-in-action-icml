  "content": "Achieving a realistic rust effect on a model tank can be a challenging but rewarding task! Oil washes are a good starting point, but there are many other techniques and materials you can use to enhance the realism. Here are some tips to help you achieve a more convincing rust effect:\n\n1. **Understand rust**: Before you start painting, research how rust forms and looks in real life. Study reference images of rusty tanks and notice the colors, textures, and patterns of rust. This will help you create a more authentic look.\n2. **Primer and base coat**: Start with a good primer and base coat to provide a solid foundation for your rust effect. Use a color that's close to the original metal tone, such as a dark grey or brown.\n3. **Rust colors**: Rust is not just one color; it's a range of hues, from orange to brown to red. Use a mix of acrylic paints, enamels, or oils to create a realistic rust color palette. You can also add a touch of yellow or green to give it a more realistic, weathered look.\n4. **Texture**: Rust is not smooth; it's rough and uneven. Use texture mediums, such as Vallejo's Texture paste or Mig Productions' Rust Texture, to add depth and dimension to your rust effect. Apply these mediums with a brush or a palette knife.\n5. **Layering**: Build up your rust effect in layers, starting with a light, general rust color and gradually adding more intense, darker shades. This will create a sense of depth and history.\n6. **Streaking and running**: Rust often streaks and runs down surfaces, especially on vertical areas. Use a small brush to create streaks and rivulets of rust, allowing the paint to flow and blend naturally.\n7. **Chipping and wear**: Rust often exposes underlying metal, so use a small brush to create chipped and worn areas. You can also use a toothpick or a small file to create subtle scratches and imperfections.\n8. **Oil washes and glazes**: While you mentioned oil washes didn't quite work for you, try using them in combination with other techniques. Apply a thin oil wash to enhance the rust color and create subtle, nuanced shading. You can also use glazes to add depth and luminosity to your rust effect.\n9. **Drybrushing**: Use a drybrush to add texture and roughness to your rust effect. This is especially effective on raised details like bolts, rivets, or hinges.\n10. **Weathering powders**: Weathering powders can add a subtle, dusty quality to your rust effect. Apply them with a small brush or a makeup brush to create a soft, muted look.\n11. **Experiment and blend**: Don't be afraid to experiment and blend different techniques and materials. Rust is a complex, organic process, and your model should reflect that.\n12. **Reference and patience**: Refer to your reference images frequently, and take your time when creating the rust effect. It's a process that requires patience, but the end result will be worth it.\n\nSome recommended products to help you achieve a realistic rust effect include:\n\n* Vallejo Model Color rust paints and texture mediums\n* Mig Productions rust paints, texture mediums, and weathering powders\n* AK Interactive rust paints and weathering products\n* Tamiya weathering masters (acrylic paints and washes)\n\nRemember, the key to a realistic rust effect is to create a subtle, nuanced look that suggests age, wear, and weathering. Don't be too heavy-handed, and be willing to experiment and adjust your techniques as you go. Good luck!",
