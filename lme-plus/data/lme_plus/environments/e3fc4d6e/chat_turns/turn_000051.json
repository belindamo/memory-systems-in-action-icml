Social Justice Law Clinic:\nHoward University's School of Law established the Social Justice Law Clinic to provide legal representation to underserved communities, particularly in cases of racial and social justice. The law clinic partners with local organizations and community groups to provide legal services, community education, and advocacy. In addition, law students work on cases involving civil rights, housing, and police misconduct.\n\n2. Howard University-NAACP partnership:\nHoward University has a longstanding partnership with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The NAACP is the largest and oldest civil rights organization in the United States. Through its partnership with Howard University, the NAACP has established student chapters, hosted speaker events, and supported student-led activism initiatives.\n\n3. Howard University-Sweet Honey in the Rock partnership:\nHoward University has partnered with Sweet Honey in the Rock, a Grammy Award-winning African-American a cappella ensemble, to establish the Sweet Honey in the Rock Endowed Professorship in the Fine Arts. This partnership supports the study of African American music, culture, and social justice through research, teaching, and public programming.\n\n4. Howard University-Civil Rights Tour:\nThe School of Communications at Howard University has established a Civil Rights Tour in partnership with the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The tour takes students on a journey through the Southern United States, visiting historical sites of the Civil Rights Movement. Through the tour, students learn about the struggle for racial and social justice and gain an appreciation for the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nThese partnerships are just a few examples of how Howard University has addressed issues of racial and social justice in the Washington D.C. area. Howard University continues to work with local organizations to promote social justice and equity through education, research, and community service.",
