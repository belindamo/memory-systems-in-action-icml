We usually grab some drinks and food together after the game, so it'll be a good opportunity to relax and have some fun. Maybe we'll even discuss some strategies for our next game and how we can improve our chances of moving up in the league standings.\n\nBut anyway, back to my dashboard. I like your idea of tracking my progress over time. I'll definitely consider adding some metrics to monitor my performance and my team's performance in the volleyball league. Do you think I should also track my progress in other sports, like running or cycling?",
