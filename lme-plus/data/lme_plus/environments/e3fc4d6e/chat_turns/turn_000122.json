As I mentioned earlier, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or connections, so you didn't actually meet Sophia on a flight from Chicago to New York. I'm just an AI, and our conversation started with your question about coffee shops in LA.\n\nHowever, if you did meet Sophia on a flight from Chicago to New York, then yes, mentioning that to her is a great way to break the ice and remind her of your initial conversation. It's always nice to reminisce about how you met and catch up on each other's lives.\n\nJust to clarify, I'm not aware of any prior conversations or interactions between you and Sophia. Our conversation started with your question about coffee shops in LA, and I've been providing recommendations and suggestions based on that.",
