That's amazing to hear that you've been experimenting with different cooking methods and making time to cook at least once a week. Sunday cooking sessions can be a great way to relax and prepare for the week ahead.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that your chicken fajita recipe turned out well! It's always satisfying to try a new recipe and have it become a hit. And kudos to you for meal prepping on the weekends! Making a big batch of rice and lentils can be a great way to save time and money during the week. It's also a healthy habit to get into, as it allows you to control the ingredients and portion sizes of your meals.\n\nMeal prep can be a game-changer for busy people, and it's great that you're taking advantage of it. Not only does it save you money on food delivery, but it also helps reduce food waste and can be a healthier option overall.\n\nWhat's your favorite part about meal prep? Is it the convenience, the cost savings, or something else entirely?\n\nAlso, have you considered trying any new cooking techniques or recipes in the near future? I'd be happy to provide some suggestions or recommendations if you're looking to mix things up!",
