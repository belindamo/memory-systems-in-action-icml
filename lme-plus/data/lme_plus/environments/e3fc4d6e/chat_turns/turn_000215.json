  "content": "Arnold Palmer was an American professional golfer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. Born on September 10, 1929 in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Palmer grew up working at the local country club and began playing golf at a young age.\n\nAs an amateur, Palmer had a string of impressive victories. He won the U.S. Amateur in 1954, and finished as the runner-up at the British Amateur in 1953 and 1955. He also won the NCAA individual championship in 1954 while attending Wake Forest University.\n\nPalmer turned professional in 1955, and quickly established himself as one of the top players on the PGA Tour. He won his first major championship at the 1958 Masters, and would go on to win a total of seven major championships during his career, including four Masters titles, one British Open, and two U.S. Opens.\n\nPalmer's main rivals during his playing career included Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. The three golfers, known as the \"Big Three\" of golf, helped to popularize the sport in the 1960s and 1970s with their intense rivalry and friendly camaraderie. Palmer and Nicklaus, in particular, had a legendary rivalry that was marked by several memorable duels, including their playoff at the 1960 U.S. Open.\n\nIn addition to his success on the course, Palmer was also known for his charitable work and his business ventures. He founded the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies, and was a strong advocate for the rights of golfers. In addition, he was the owner of several successful businesses, including a golf course design firm and a golf clothing line.\n\nAfter retiring from professional golf in 2006, Palmer continued to be involved in the sport as a course designer and as a member of the Golf Channel's broadcasting team. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.\n\nHere is a table of Palmer's major championship wins, listed in chronological order and including the venues where they were held:\n\n| Year | Major Championship | Venue |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1958 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club |\n| 1960 | U.S. Open | Cherry Hills Country Club |\n| 1962 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club |\n| 1962 | British Open | Troon |\n| 1964 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club |\n| 1966 | U.S. Open | Olympic Club |\n| 1970 | Masters | Augusta National Golf Club |\n\nPalmer was also known for his loyal fans, whom he affectionately referred to as \"Arnie's Army.\" The nickname was inspired by his military service in the Coast Guard, and his fans often wore army-style hats to show their support. Despite his many successes on the course, Palmer remained humble and grateful for the support of his fans throughout his career.",
