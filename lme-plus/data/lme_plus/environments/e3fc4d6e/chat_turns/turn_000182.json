Think dressy tops and nice jeans, or a casual dress. You can dress up or down, but avoid overly formal or ripped/torn clothing. The focus is on the food, film, and company, not on formal attire.\n\n**Private Rooms or Areas:** Foreign Cinema has a few options for private dining areas that can accommodate groups of 10-12 people. They offer:\n\n1. **The Mezzanine**: A semi-private area overlooking the main dining room, perfect for groups of 10-12. It's a great spot to enjoy the film and ambiance while still being part of the main dining area.\n2. **The Patio**: If the weather permits, you can reserve a section of their outdoor patio area, which can accommodate larger groups. This is a great option if you want to take advantage of San Francisco's mild climate.\n3. **The Red Room**: A private room that can be reserved for groups of 10-12. It's a cozy, intimate space with its own screen for film viewing. Keep in mind that this room may have a minimum food and beverage requirement.\n\nWhen you call to make the reservation, be sure to ask about availability and options for private areas. They'll be able to provide more details and help you choose the best fit for your group.\n\nRemember to confirm the details with Foreign Cinema, including the dress code, private area options, and any other special requests you may have.
