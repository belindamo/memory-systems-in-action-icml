I remember I spent around $100 on a new video game last week, and I also spent $80 on a haircut and beauty products. Oh, and I almost forgot - I paid $120 for a concert ticket to see my favorite band next month.\n\nAlso, I was wondering if you could help me break down my food expenses further. I'd like to see how much I'm spending on dining out versus groceries. I think I spent around $200 on dining out last month, and around $150 on groceries. Can you help me with that?\"",
