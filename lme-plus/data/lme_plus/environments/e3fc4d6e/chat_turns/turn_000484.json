  "content": "Yes, efforts have been made to prevent further damage to the town and its cultural heritage. The Albanian government has implemented various measures to address the impact of coastal erosion and sea level rise in Durr\u00ebs. For instance, a project was initiated to construct groins (structures that interrupt water flow) to reduce the impact of coastal erosion in the town. In addition, measures such as beach nourishment have been implemented to replenish the sand on the beach, thus enhancing tourism.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of sea level rise and minimize the risk of flooding, the government has also implemented various measures. For instance, coastal defense walls have been constructed to prevent flooding in low-lying areas. Also, the municipality has invested in flood prevention infrastructure, such as drainage systems, to reduce the impact of flooding.\n\nEfforts have also been made to preserve Durr\u00ebs' cultural heritage. The Albanian government has established regulations and laws to protect ancient heritage sites, such as the Byzantine city walls and the amphitheater, from damage due to coastal erosion and sea level rise. In addition, archaeological surveys have been conducted to protect and preserve cultural heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the impact of environmental factors such as coastal erosion and sea level rise on Durr\u00ebs' cultural and economic sustainability is evident, various preventive measures have been initiated to minimize the impact of these factors. The government's actions, along with tourism and investment activities, can help to ensure that Durr\u00ebs remains an attractive place to visit and invest in.",
