  "content": "I don't have access to up-to-date information on p&g's history with product safety. however, like most large companies, p&g has faced some incidents related to product safety in the past.\n\none of the most significant cases was the 1982 tylenol tampering incident, where someone added cyanide to tylenol capsules, causing the deaths of seven people. tylenol was a product of mcneil consumer products, a subsidiary of johnson & johnson, but the incident spurred p&g and other companies to improve tamper-proof packaging to protect consumers.\n\nin another example, in 2015, p&g recalled some of its old spice deodorant products due to reports of skin irritation caused by chemicals in the product.\n\nhowever, it's worth noting that p&g has a long history of taking product safety seriously and, for the most part, has had a good track record in ensuring the safety of its products. the company has implemented many safety measures and procedures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future, including conducting regular safety audits, implementing quality control systems, and improving packaging security.",
