We load the Iris dataset using `load_iris()` from scikit-learn.\n2. We select only the first two features of the dataset (`X = iris.data[:, :2]`) to make the clustering more visualizable.\n3. We create a `KMeans` object with 3 clusters (`n_clusters=3`) and set the random state to 42 for reproducibility.\n4. We fit the `KMeans` object to the data using `fit()`.\n5. We predict the cluster labels for each data point using `labels_`.\n6. We plot the clusters using `matplotlib`, where each point is colored according to its cluster label.\n\nThis will give you a simple visualization of the K-Means clustering result. You can experiment with different values of `n_clusters` to see how the clustering changes.\n\nSome tips:\n\n* You can use `kmeans.inertia_` to get the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center.\n* You can use `kmeans.cluster_centers_` to get the coordinates of the cluster centers.\n* You can use `kmeans.labels_` to get the cluster labels for each data point.\n\nNow, try experimenting with different clustering algorithms, such as Hierarchical Clustering or DBSCAN, and see how they compare to K-Means!"
