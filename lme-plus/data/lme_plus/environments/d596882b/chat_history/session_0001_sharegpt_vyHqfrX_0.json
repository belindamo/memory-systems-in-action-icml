When I became a librarian, I oriented my work and research toward universal instructional design and learner-centered information architecture. \nMy approaches to online pedagogy and evidence-based instructional design derive from my time at the UCLA Library. There I performed the roles of LibApps manager, co-lead site editor and accessibility champion, social media content creator, and instructional resource designer. It was the latter role in online module design that particularly influenced me. Our instructional resource design team, WI+RE, adhered to a design methodology that prioritized empathy for end-users\u2019 goals, employed an Agile methodology for rapid prototyping, charted pathways of formative and summative assessment, and established foundations for universal design in every open education resource our team designed. This user-centered, evidenced-based design philosophy cautioned us designers to contextualize ourselves in embodied realities of our end-users. In this empathy-generating exercise, we collected input from users that involved not only their expectations for a meaningful product, but also their perspective on the systems and communities in which these resources would be embedded ( in their LMS or a coursesite, for example). Our resources were well utilized across campus and I was often invited into discipline departments meetings to discuss opportunities for new open educational resources to be designed for asynchronous, scaffolded learning. My favorite about this design team was easily the opportunity to work with learner-designers, i.e., students who we designed for. My work with this team, in concert with my research in instructional design and technical knowledge of web development, prepares me to thrive and innovate in CUNY Online\u2019s collaborative community. What\u2019s more, I am prepared to invest in the next generation of designers, taking on mentor-mentee responsibilities.\n\nWhile I have not had the chance to do as much design work in my role at BMCC, I have used my one-shot information literacy sessions to introduce students to a host of multimedia tools that optimize their attempts to discover, synthesize, communicate on, and organize information. As you will note from my references, I am extremely comfortable incorporating my instruction in an array of presentation technologies. I have offered multiple resource workshops that help faculty critically navigate and effectively utilize emerging technologies in the classroom. In these workshops I have covered social annotation tools (Hypothes.is), instructional multimedia (H5P, Adobe creative cloud), text analysis software ( JSTOR\u2019s Constellate, Voyant), and generative AI (see my workshop with BMCC\u2019s CETLS).\nAs my experience and interests above reveal, I will have no issue integrating my passions for learning outcome-oriented, inclusive, and accessible instructional design. I would love the opportunity to grow and learn from the CUNY online community, deepening intellectual curiosity, equipping faculty with efficient support, and cultivating belonging for our CUNY students. The web development programming skills I have learned in my bootcamp will also help me achieve a standard of excellence and accessibility in my product design. I look forward to hearing more from the committee and am happy to address any questions."
