The contrast between the rugged jeans and sleek sneakers will add visual interest.\n2. **Slim-fit joggers**: Joggers in neutral colors like black, gray, or beige can create a stylish, athleisure-inspired outfit. Look for ones with a slim fit to balance out the bulk of the sneakers.\n\n**Streetwear-Inspired**\n\n1. **Oversized denim jeans**: Go for a trendy, oversized fit with a light or medium wash denim.

Pair them with a graphic tee and a denim jacket for a cool, casual look.\n\n**Smart Casual**\n\n1. **Dark wash skinny jeans**: A dark wash skinny jean can dress up your Air Force 1s. Try pairing them with a plain white or light-colored top and a blazer for a more polished look.\n2. **Chinos or dress pants**: If you want to dress up your AF1s, try pairing them with chinos or dress pants in neutral colors like beige, gray, or navy. This combo works well for a casual office setting or a night out.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Balance the bulk of the sneakers with a fitted top or a shorter jacket to create a more streamlined look.\n* Experiment with different colors and patterns on your pants or jeans to add visual interest to your outfit.\n* Don't be afraid to add a pop of color with a hat, scarf, or accessories to elevate your look.\n* Play with the lacing style of your AF1s to change the overall look of your outfit.
