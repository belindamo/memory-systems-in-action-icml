  "content": "The album I found is called \"Midnight Groove\" by a saxophonist named Teddy Wilson. It's on a small label called \"Jazzcraft Records\" and it says 1967 on the back. The cover art is really cool, it's a black and white photo of a city street at night. There are a few other musicians credited on the album, but I don't recognize their names. The music is a mix of soul-jazz and hard bop, with a lot of energetic solos. I've been listening to it non-stop and I'm really curious to know more about Teddy Wilson and how he fit into the jazz scene of the 1960s.",
