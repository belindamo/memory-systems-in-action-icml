Research the island: Before you go, it's important to research the island and understand what to expect. Look into the geography, weather, customs, and points of interest. This way, you can pack accordingly and be better prepared for the trip. 2. Pack appropriately: Since Christmas Island is a tropical island, it's important to pack lightweight, breathable clothing. You should also bring sturdy hiking shoes, a hat, sunscreen, and insect repellent. Additionally, consider bringing a reusable water bottle to minimize plastic waste. 3. Learn about the culture: The majority of the population on Christmas Island is of Chinese-Malay descent, so learning about the culture can help you better appreciate the island's unique customs and traditions. You can also try local cuisine and take part in cultural events. 4. Get vaccinated: Prior to traveling, check with your healthcare provider to ensure that all your vaccinations are up to date. Make sure to get vaccinated against mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue fever and chikungunya. 5. Respect the environment: When volunteering and travelling around Christmas Island, it's important to minimize your impact on the environment. Avoid littering, use biodegradable products, and be mindful of your energy and water usage.
