Here are some possible factors that might contribute to their distinct flavor and popularity:\n\nBulgogi:\n\n1. **Marinade**: A well-balanced and complex marinade can make a huge difference in bulgogi. Hwang's Kitchen might be using a proprietary blend of Korean chili flakes (gochugaru), soy sauce, garlic, ginger, sugar, and sesame oil to create a deep, savory flavor.\n2. **Meat quality**: The type and quality of beef used can affect the tenderness and flavor of the bulgogi. Hwang's Kitchen might be using a specific cut of beef, such as ribeye or sirloin, and aging it to enhance the tenderness and flavor.\n3. **Grilling technique**: The way the bulgogi is grilled can impact the caramelization and char on the meat. Hwang's Kitchen might be using a special grilling technique, such as a combination of direct and indirect heat, to achieve a perfect balance of crunch and tenderness.\n\nSpicy Pork Tacos:\n\n1. **Spice blend**: The spicy kick in the tacos might come from a custom spice blend that combines Korean chili flakes (gochugaru) with other spices, such as cumin, smoked paprika, or chipotle peppers.\n2. **Pork quality**: The type and quality of pork used can affect the tenderness and flavor of the tacos. Hwang's Kitchen might be using a specific cut of pork, such as pork belly or shoulder, and slow-cooking it to make it tender and juicy.\n3. **Kimchi slaw**: A tangy and spicy kimchi slaw might be adding a crucial element to the tacos. Hwang's Kitchen might be using a special kimchi recipe that incorporates Korean chili flakes, fish sauce, and other ingredients to create a bold and umami flavor.\n\nTaco fusion:\n\n1. **Korean-Mexican fusion**: The combination of Korean bulgogi and spicy pork with traditional Mexican taco elements, such as tortillas, cilantro, and lime, might be what sets Hwang's Kitchen's dish apart. The fusion of these two cuisines can create a unique and exciting flavor profile.\n2. **Tortilla quality**: The type and quality of tortillas used can affect the overall texture and flavor of the tacos. Hwang's Kitchen might be using a specific type of tortilla, such as a crispy corn tortilla or a soft flour tortilla, to complement their fillings.\n\nThese are just a few possibilities, and there might be other factors that contribute to the unique flavor and popularity of Hwang's Kitchen's bulgogi and spicy pork tacos. If you're curious, don't hesitate to ask the chef or staff about their secrets!",
