I'm assuming you're referring to a downtown area in a city, but I don't know which city.\n\nTo provide you with a list of in-person writing and photography workshops in your area, I would need to know your city or zip code. If you could provide me with that information, I can try to give you a list of workshops in your area.\n\nAlternatively, you can try searching online using the keywords I provided earlier, such as \"writing workshops near me\" or \"photography workshops near me.\" You can also check websites like Meetup.com, Eventbrite.com, and Facebook Events to find writing and photography workshops in your area.\n\nIf you're willing to share your city or zip code, I can try to provide you with a list of workshops in your area.",
