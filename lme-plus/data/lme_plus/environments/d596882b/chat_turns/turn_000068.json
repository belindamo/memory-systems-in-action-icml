  "content": "I've been trying to improve my overall fitness lately, and I think it all started about 2 months ago when I joined a recreational volleyball league with some friends from work. We've been playing every Thursday evening at the local community center, and I've really been enjoying it. I've been trying to get to the gym more regularly to improve my overall fitness, focusing on cardio and strength training. I've noticed that my endurance has improved significantly, and I feel more confident on the volleyball court. Do you have any tips on how to incorporate strength training exercises into my volleyball practice routine?",
