  "content": "I think getting a separate drum amp might be a bit premature at this stage, especially since your brother is just starting out.\n\nAs a beginner, your brother will likely be practicing at home, and the built-in amp on the Nitro Kit should be sufficient for quiet practice sessions. Adding a separate drum amp to the mix might be overwhelming and unnecessary at this point.\n\nHere are a few reasons why I think it's okay to hold off on a separate drum amp for now:\n\n1. **Cost**: Drum amps can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. As a beginner, it's better to invest in a good drum set and focus on developing skills before worrying about a separate amp.\n2. **Space and setup**: A separate drum amp takes up more space, and setting it up can be a hassle. As a beginner, it's better to keep things simple and focus on playing rather than worrying about amp settings and cable management.\n3. **Priorities**: At this stage, your brother should focus on developing his skills, learning basic techniques, and building a strong foundation. A separate drum amp can be added later when he's more comfortable with his playing and needs more power or features.\n\nThat being said, if your brother shows rapid progress, starts playing with a band, or needs more power for larger rooms, you can always consider getting a separate drum amp later on.\n\nFor now, I think the built-in amp on the Nitro Kit should be sufficient for his needs. It's a great starting point, and he can always upgrade or add a separate amp later when he's more experienced and knows exactly what he needs.",
