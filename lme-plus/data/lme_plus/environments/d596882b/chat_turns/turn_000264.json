  "content": "The brooch is a stunning silver piece with a large, blue gemstone in the center. I got it from an antique store in town, and the shop owner told me it's from the 1920s. It's in great condition, and I've been wearing it to work every day since I bought it. I don't have an estimated value, but the shop owner seemed to think it was quite valuable. I paid $200 for it, and it was definitely worth it.",
