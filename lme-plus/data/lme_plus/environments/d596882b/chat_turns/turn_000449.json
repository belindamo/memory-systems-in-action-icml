Nobel Prize: The Nobel Prize is perhaps the most famous scientific prize. It is awarded annually in several categories, including physics, chemistry, medicine or physiology, literature, and peace. To be considered for a Nobel Prize, a person must be nominated by a qualified individual or organization, such as a previous Nobel laureate or a professor in the relevant field.\n\n2. Fields Medal: The Fields Medal is often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of Mathematics.\" It is awarded every four years to mathematicians who are under the age of 40 and have made significant contributions to the field. Candidates for the Fields Medal are nominated by a committee of experts appointed by the International Mathematical Union.\n\n3. Breakthrough Prize: The Breakthrough Prize is a relatively new scientific prize, first awarded in 2013. It is awarded annually in several categories, including life sciences, fundamental physics, and mathematics. Nominees for the Breakthrough Prize are evaluated by a board of advisors, who consider both the scientific achievements of the nominee and their potential for future contributions to their field.\n\n4. Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award: The Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award is awarded annually to scientists who have made significant contributions to clinical medicine. Nominees for the award are selected by a committee of experts appointed by the Lasker Foundation.\n\n5. Turing Award: The Turing Award is awarded annually to computer scientists who have made significant contributions to the field of computer science. Nominees for the award are evaluated by a committee of experts appointed by the Association for Computing Machinery.\n\nOverall, the nomination and selection processes for scientific prizes vary depending on the specific award. Some require nominations from qualified individuals or organizations, while others have a more closed selection process.
