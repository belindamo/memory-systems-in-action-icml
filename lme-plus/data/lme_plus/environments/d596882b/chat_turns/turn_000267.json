Which item would you like to add next?\n\nPerhaps you have a vase, a piece of artwork, or a vintage item that you'd like to document? The more pieces you catalog, the more comprehensive your collection's history will be.\n\nIf you're not ready to add another piece just yet, I can offer some tips on how to organize your catalog, or we can discuss ways to research and value your items. Just let me know what's on your mind!\n\nType 'add another piece' to continue cataloging, or ask me a question about the process.",
