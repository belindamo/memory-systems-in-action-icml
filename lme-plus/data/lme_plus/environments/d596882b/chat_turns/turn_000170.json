  "content": "That's really helpful! I think I'll start by gathering a small group of friends who are interested in reading and discussing books. We can decide on the format and scope of the book club together. I've been wanting to discuss books with others for a while now, so I'm excited to finally take the step. By the way, speaking of books, I've been meaning to ask: have you heard of any good books that are similar to \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" by Taylor Jenkins Reid? I'm currently reading it with a friend and we're both loving it.",
