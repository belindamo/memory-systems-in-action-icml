  "content": "The `github.com/stripe/stripe-go/client` package provides a client that you can use to interact with the Stripe API directly. This package is lower level than some of the other packages in the Stripe Go library, and it provides more flexibility in terms of the requests you can make to the Stripe API.\n\nYou might use `github.com/stripe/stripe-go/client` if you need to perform an action that is not currently supported by the higher level packages in the Stripe Go library, or if you want more control over the requests being sent to the Stripe API.\n\nFor example, you might use the `client` package to make a custom request to the Stripe API that is not currently supported by one of the other packages. Or you might use it to configure the client with custom options such as timeouts, retry logic, or custom headers.\n\nIn general, if you're looking for an easy way to perform common Stripe operations in your Go server, you should use the higher level packages like `account`, `charge`, `customer` etc. But if you need more control over the requests being sent to the Stripe API, the `client` package might be the right choice for you.",
