Curbing snacking, especially in the office, can be tough, but with some strategies, you can overcome those temptations!\n\nHere are some tips to help you resist the vending machine's allure, especially on Fridays:\n\n1. **Stay hydrated**: Sometimes, thirst can masquerade as hunger. Keep a refillable water bottle at your desk and drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n2. **Healthy snacks at your desk**: Stock your desk with healthy snacks like nuts, seeds, dried fruits, or energy balls. This way, you'll have a better option when you feel the urge to snack.\n3. **Identify your triggers**: Reflect on why you tend to snack during team meetings. Is it boredom, stress, or excitement? Once you know your triggers, you can develop strategies to address them.\n4. **Find a healthy alternative**: If you're craving something crunchy, try baby carrots or air-popped popcorn instead of chips. If you need a sweet fix, opt for a piece of fresh fruit or a handful of dried fruit.\n5. **Get moving**: Take a short walk during the meeting or do some stretching exercises at your desk. This can help distract you from snacking and increase your energy levels.\n6. **Mindful eating**: Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly, savor your food, and stop when satisfied (not stuffed). This can help you enjoy your snacks more and reduce mindless munching.\n7. **Team up with a snack buddy**: Share your struggles with a colleague and ask them to hold you accountable. You can even plan healthy snacks together!\n8. **Schedule snack breaks**: Instead of grazing throughout the day, set specific snack times. This can help you stay focused and avoid impulsive snacking.\n9. **Remove the temptation**: If possible, avoid walking past the vending machine or keeping unhealthy snacks at your desk. Out of sight, out of mind!\n10. **Reward yourself**: Celebrate small victories, like making it through a meeting without snacking. Treat yourself to a healthy reward, like a piece of fruit or a short walk outside.\n\nFor Fridays, you could try:\n\n* Bringing a healthy snack to share with your team, like a bowl of fresh fruit or a batch of homemade trail mix.\n* Scheduling a short walk or stretching session during the meeting to get everyone moving and energized.\n* Setting a personal goal to resist the vending machine's temptation and rewarding yourself with a non-food item, like a fun pen or a new notebook.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to change habits, so be patient and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Keep working towards your goals, and you'll eventually develop healthier snacking habits!",
