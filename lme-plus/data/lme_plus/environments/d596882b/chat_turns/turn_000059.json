Here's a simple recipe:\n\n**Moroccan-Style Salad Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 large cucumbers, peeled and thinly sliced\n* 2 large tomatoes, diced\n* 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced\n* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Feta cheese, crumbled (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine.\n4. Sprinkle the chopped parsley over the top and toss again.\n5. If using feta cheese, crumble it over the salad and serve.\n\n**Wine Pairing Options**\n\nFor the Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken Tagine and Moroccan-Style Salad, I recommend the following wine pairing options:\n\n1. **White wine:** A dry and crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio will complement the bright, citrusy flavors of the dish.\n2. **Ros\u00e9 wine:** A dry Ros\u00e9 will add a refreshing touch to the meal, pairing nicely with the herbal notes in the tagine and the sweetness of the salad.\n3. **Red wine:** If you prefer a red wine, a light-bodied option like Pinot Noir or Beaujolais will work well, as they won't overpower the delicate flavors of the dish.\n\nSome specific wine pairing suggestions:\n\n* Sauvignon Blanc: Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough, New Zealand) or Sancerre Blanc (Loire Valley, France)\n* Ros\u00e9: Whispering Angel Ros\u00e9 (Provence, France) or Meiomi Ros\u00e9 (California, USA)\n* Pinot Noir: King Estate Pinot Noir (Oregon, USA) or Bourgogne Pinot Noir (Burgundy, France)\n\nRemember, personal taste plays a significant role in wine pairings, so don't be afraid to experiment and find your favorite pairing!\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for you to enjoy your Moroccan-inspired dinner party!",
