Traditionally, a tagine is a slow-cooked stew made with meat, vegetables, and dried fruits, but I've adapted it to a grilled version to make it perfect for your dinner party.\n\n**Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken Tagine Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the chicken:\n\n* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces\n* 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley\n* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\nFor the tagine sauce:\n\n* 1/4 cup olive oil\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley\n* 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro\n* 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 1/4 cup chicken broth\n* 1 tablespoon honey\n* 1 teaspoon ground ginger\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large bowl, whisk together lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, parsley, cilantro, cumin, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and pepper. Add the chicken and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.\n2. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Grill the chicken for 5-6 minutes per side, or until cooked through.\n3. Meanwhile, make the tagine sauce. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the parsley, cilantro, lemon juice, chicken broth, honey, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.\n4. To serve, place the grilled chicken on a platter or individual plates. Spoon the warm tagine sauce over the top.\n\n**Sides and Accompaniments**\n\nTo complement the Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken Tagine, I recommend the following sides and accompaniments:\n\n1. **Couscous with Preserved Lemon and Olives**: Cook couscous according to package instructions. Mix in chopped preserved lemon, pitted green olives, and a drizzle of olive oil.\n2. **Roasted Vegetables**: Roast a medley of vegetables such as zucchini, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and onions with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Add a sprinkle of cumin and smoked paprika for extra flavor.\n3. **Moroccan-Style Salad**: Combine chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, and parsley in a bowl. Drizzle with a vinaigrette made from lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and cumin.\n4. **Grilled Pita Bread with Spiced Almonds**: Grill pita bread until crispy and serve with a bowl of spiced almonds (made by mixing sliced almonds with olive oil, cumin, coriander, and cinnamon).\n\nFor the vegetarian option, the Stuffed Bell Peppers with Quinoa, Spinach, and Feta will pair beautifully with these sides. Simply adjust the amount of sides based on the number of guests.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance. I hope your dinner party is a resounding success!",
