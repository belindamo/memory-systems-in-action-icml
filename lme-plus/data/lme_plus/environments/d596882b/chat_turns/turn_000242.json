By the way, speaking of casual outfits, I've been wearing my Air Force 1s to the gym every day since I got them two weeks ago, and they're still breaking in, but they're super comfortable. I've worn them a total of ten times, including last Thursday when I went for a run in the park. Do you have any tips on how to keep them clean and fresh?",
