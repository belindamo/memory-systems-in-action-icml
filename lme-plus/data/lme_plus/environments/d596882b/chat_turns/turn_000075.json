It's awesome that you have a strong foundation to build upon from your high school days.\n\nGetting back into practice will definitely help you regain your form and confidence on the court. Here are a few tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Dust off your old racket**: Take your racket out of storage and give it a good cleaning. Check the strings, grip, and overall condition to make sure it's still in good shape.\n2. **Find a practice partner**: Having a regular practice partner can help you stay motivated and accountable. You can ask friends, family, or coworkers if they're interested in playing with you.\n3. **Start with basics**: Begin with basic drills like forehand, backhand, and volleys. Focus on proper technique and footwork. You can find plenty of online resources and videos to help you refresh your skills.\n4. **Practice regularly**: Aim to practice at least 2-3 times a week, for about 30-60 minutes per session. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase the duration and intensity of your practice sessions.\n5. **Join a local tennis community**: Look for local tennis clubs, parks, or recreation centers that offer tennis courts and programs. Many of these places offer group lessons, clinics, or social tennis events that can help you meet other players and get back into the game.\n6. **Get fitted for new gear**: If your old racket is no longer suitable, consider getting fitted for a new one. You may also want to invest in new tennis shoes, clothes, and accessories to help you perform at your best.\n\nRemember to be patient with yourself as you get back into the swing of things. It may take some time to regain your skills and endurance, but with consistent practice and dedication, you'll be back on the court in no time.\n\nGood luck with your tennis journey, and I hope you have a blast playing in the league!",
