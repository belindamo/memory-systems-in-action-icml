  "content": "I'm actually thinking of creating a capsule wardrobe as a way to make my shopping habits more mindful and budget-friendly. I've recently been oscillating between luxury and budget shopping, and I want to find a balance. Since I recently splurged on a designer handbag, I'd like to focus on building a capsule wardrobe that complements my new investment. Do you have any specific advice on how to incorporate luxury items into a capsule wardrobe?",
