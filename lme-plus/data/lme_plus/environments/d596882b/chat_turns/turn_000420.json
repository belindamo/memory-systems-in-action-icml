  "content": "Yeah, the scare zones and haunted houses at Scream Fest were really well done, especially the \"Zombie Apocalypse\" zone. I was really impressed by the theming and attention to detail. Also, we rode the new \"Darkness\" rollercoaster three times in a row, and I screamed my lungs out each time. I'm looking for tips on how to minimize wait times because I'm planning to go to another theme park soon and I want to fit in as many rides as possible. Do you have any tips on how to plan my day and prioritize the most popular attractions?",
