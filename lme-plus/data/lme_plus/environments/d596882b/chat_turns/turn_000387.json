  "content": "Certainly, one example of a controversial executive order in the recent history of the US is the Executive Order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2017 to temporarily halt travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The order suspended entry of all refugees to the US for 120 days, indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the US, and imposed a 90-day suspension on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the US. Critics of the order argued that it was discriminatory against Muslims and violated the Constitution's protection of religious freedom. The order faced multiple legal challenges and was struck down by the courts on the basis of violating the Constitution's Establishment Clause. The controversy surrounding this order illustrates the potentially far-reaching implications of a president's use of executive orders and their legal and constitutional implications.",
