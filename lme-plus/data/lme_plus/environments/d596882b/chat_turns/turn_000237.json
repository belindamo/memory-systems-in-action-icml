I'd be happy to help you explore beyond the gym look.\n\nAir Force 1s are a great addition to many outfits, and the key is to balance their boldness with complementary pants or jeans. Here are some suggestions to get you started:\n\n**Casual Chic**\n\n1. **Distressed denim jeans**: A pair of distressed or ripped jeans in light wash can create a laid-back, casual look. The contrast between the rugged jeans and sleek sneakers will add visual interest.\n2. **Slim-fit joggers**: Joggers in neutral colors like black, gray, or beige can create a stylish, athleisure-inspired outfit. Look for ones with a slim fit to balance out the bulk of the sneakers.\n\n**Streetwear-Inspired**\n\n1. **Oversized denim jeans**: Go for a trendy, oversized fit with a light or medium wash denim. This combo will give you a relaxed, streetwear-inspired look.\n2. **Cargo pants**: Cargo pants in neutral colors like olive, beige, or black can add a utility touch to your outfit. Pair them with a graphic tee and a denim jacket for a cool, casual look.\n\n**Smart Casual**\n\n1. **Dark wash skinny jeans**: A dark wash skinny jean can dress up your Air Force 1s. Try pairing them with a plain white or light-colored top and a blazer for a more polished look.\n2. **Chinos or dress pants**: If you want to dress up your AF1s, try pairing them with chinos or dress pants in neutral colors like beige, gray, or navy. This combo works well for a casual office setting or a night out.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Balance the bulk of the sneakers with a fitted top or a shorter jacket to create a more streamlined look.\n* Experiment with different colors and patterns on your pants or jeans to add visual interest to your outfit.\n* Don't be afraid to add a pop of color with a hat, scarf, or accessories to elevate your look.\n* Play with the lacing style of your AF1s to change the overall look of your outfit. For example, try the \" lazy lace\" or \"double knot\" style for a more relaxed vibe.\n\nRemember, the key to styling Air Force 1s is to balance their boldness with complementary pieces. Experiment with different combinations, and most importantly, have fun with it!",
