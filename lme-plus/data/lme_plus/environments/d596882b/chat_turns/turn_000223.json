This will help ensure that you don't have any adverse reactions to the ingredients.\n\nAdditionally, if you have sensitive skin or allergies, you may want to start with a small batch of the recipe and gradually increase the amount as needed. It's also a good idea to avoid using the DIY makeup remover on broken or irritated skin.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about using the DIY makeup remover or concerns about your skin type, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!\n\nNow, go ahead and give the DIY makeup remover a try! Remember to shake the mixture well before each use, and gently massage it onto your skin to help break down the makeup.",
