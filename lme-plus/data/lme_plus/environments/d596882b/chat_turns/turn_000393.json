  "content": "Yes, there have been several proposed bills in Congress in recent years that seek to regulate the use of executive orders. For instance, in March 2021, two Republican lawmakers introduced a bill called the \"Separation of Powers Restoration and Transparency Act,\" which would require any presidential executive order to be published in the Federal Register, where it would be subject to public comment and review before it could take effect. The bill would also require executive orders to be approved by Congress before they could be enforced. Similarly, in 2017, a bill known as the \"Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments of the Law Act\" (ENFORCE the Law Act) was introduced in Congress, which would have allowed Congress to sue the executive branch if it failed to enforce the law.\n\nWhile some proposed bills have been introduced, it is worth noting that the chances of such legislation passing have been hampered by political polarization, with Democrats and Republicans often having competing views on the role of executive orders in American democracy. Nevertheless, the issue of executive orders and presidential powers is likely to remain a subject of debate and potential legislation, as lawmakers seek to address concerns about the balance of power in the US political system.",
