You can find travel-sized versions of the shampoo and conditioner at most retailers that carry Pantene products, including Walgreens, Target, and online marketplaces like Amazon.\n\nThe travel size is usually around 3.4 fl oz (100ml) and is perfect for tossing into your gym bag, purse, or luggage when you're on-the-go. It's also a great way to try out the product before committing to a full-size purchase.\n\nKeep in mind that travel sizes might not be available for every product in the Pantene Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal line, but you should be able to find them for the core shampoo and conditioner products.",
