Here are some general tips:\n\n1. **Dress according to the occasion**: Consider the dress code and formality of the dinner party. If it's a casual gathering, you can pair your vintage purse with a nice pair of jeans and a blouse. If it's a more formal event, you might want to opt for a dress or a skirt and top combination.\n2. **Complement the purse's style**: Take inspiration from the era and style of your vintage purse. If it's a 1950s-inspired purse, you might want to wear a fitted dress with a full skirt or a pencil skirt with a blouse. If it's a more bohemian-inspired purse, you could pair it with a flowy sundress or a pair of distressed denim jeans and a flowy top.\n3. **Keep the colors in harmony**: Choose colors that complement the purse's color scheme. If your purse has a bold or bright color, balance it out with more neutral colors in your outfit. If your purse is more subdued, you can add a pop of color with your shoes or accessories.\n4. **Add some vintage flair**: Consider adding some vintage-inspired accessories, like a statement necklace, a pair of earrings, or a vintage-style belt, to tie the look together.\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and express your personal style! You could also try experimenting with different outfits and taking selfies to see what looks best with your vintage purse.\n\nI hope these tips help, and I'm sure you'll look fabulous at the dinner party!",
