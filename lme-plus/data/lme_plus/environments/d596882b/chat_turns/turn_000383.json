  "content": "Yes, executive orders can be used to make major changes in law without the approval of Congress. However, the scope and extent of changes that can be made through executive orders are limited by the Constitution and judicial review. Executive orders can clarify or carry out existing laws, but they cannot contradict or usurp the authority of Congress to create new laws. If an executive order goes beyond the president's constitutional powers or is inconsistent with the legislative will of Congress, it can be challenged and overturned through judicial review. Nonetheless, executive orders can have significant effects on public policy, and presidents have used them to enact a range of significant policies, including immigration policy, regulatory policy, and social policy.",
