Here's a brief breakdown to help you prioritize:\n\n**Protein-rich foods:**\n\n* Help regulate blood sugar levels and provide a feeling of fullness and satisfaction\n* Can help increase alertness and focus due to the amino acid tyrosine, which is converted into neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine\n* Examples: eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, nuts, and seeds\n\n**Complex carbohydrates:**\n\n* Provide a sustained release of energy due to their slower digestion rate\n* Help regulate blood sugar levels and prevent energy crashes\n* Can help increase serotonin levels, which can promote a sense of calmness and relaxation\n* Examples: whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes\n\nFor a Sunday brunch, I'd recommend a balanced approach that includes both protein-rich foods and complex carbohydrates. This will help you feel full, satisfied, and alert, while also providing a sustained energy boost.\n\nHere's a rough guideline to aim for:\n\n* Include a source of protein (20-30 grams) to help regulate blood sugar levels and provide a feeling of fullness\n* Pair the protein with complex carbohydrates (30-40 grams) to provide a sustained energy release\n\nFor example, you could try:\n\n* Scrambled eggs with whole-grain toast and avocado (protein-rich eggs + complex carbohydrates from whole grain toast)\n* Greek yogurt with berries and granola (protein-rich yogurt + complex carbohydrates from granola)\n* Oatmeal with banana, almond butter, and a splash of low-fat milk (complex carbohydrates from oatmeal + protein-rich almond butter and milk)\n\nRemember, everyone's nutritional needs and preferences are different. Experiment with different combinations to find the perfect balance that works for you and helps you feel alert, awake, and satisfied on Sunday mornings!",
