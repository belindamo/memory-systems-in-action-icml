If art is a significant part of your identity, you don't want to stray too far from that. Here are some ideas for experimenting with different types of videos while still staying connected to your art niche:\n\n1. **Behind-the-scenes**: Share videos of your creative process, like preparing for a painting session or organizing your art supplies.\n2. **Tutorials or tips**: Offer instructional content, like a quick painting technique or a favorite art supply hack.\n3. **Q&A or vlogs**: Share your thoughts on art, answer questions from followers, or vlog about your daily life as an artist.\n4. **Challenges or collaborations**: Participate in art challenges or collaborate with other artists or creators.\n5. **Showcase your other skills**: If you have other talents, like music or writing, consider sharing those as well.\n\nRemember, the key is to **stay authentic and have fun**. Don't feel pressured to create content that doesn't resonate with you or your brand. Experiment, analyze your performance, and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any other types of videos you've been wanting to try or explore?",
