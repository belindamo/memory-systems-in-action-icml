  "content": "You're right, the current implementation creates a new board each time the \"Start Game\" button is clicked, which leads to multiple boards being created. To fix this, we can modify the `startGame` function to only create the board once and reset the game state when starting a new game.\n\nUpdate the `startGame` function in the JavaScript file (game.js) as follows:\n```javascript\nlet gameStarted = false;\n\nfunction startGame() {\n  startButton.disabled = true;\n  stopButton.disabled = false;\n\n  // Initialize game state here\n  if (!gameStarted) {\n    createBoard();\n    gameStarted = true;\n  }\n\n  resetBoard();\n  player = new Player(0);\n  setElement(player.position, 'player');\n\n  // Set up game loop\n  gameInterval = setInterval(() => {\n    // Update game state here\n  }, 100);\n}\n```\nThis change adds a `gameStarted` variable to track whether the game has been started before. If it's the first time starting the game, the board will be created. If the game has been started previously, only the game state will be reset, avoiding the creation of multiple boards.",
