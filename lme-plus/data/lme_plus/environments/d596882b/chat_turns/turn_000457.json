Advancements in science and technology have always been the result of individuals and teams working together, sharing their expertise and building on each other's ideas. No one individual has all the answers or expertise needed to solve complex scientific problems, so it is essential that scientists work collaboratively to achieve breakthroughs. Additionally, collaboration across different fields of science, such as biology and computer science, can lead to novel and innovative solutions to long-standing problems. Scientific prizes often recognize the contributions of entire research teams, highlighting the importance of collaboration in scientific discovery. By working together, scientists can achieve more than they would alone, and make a greater impact on our understanding of the world around us.",
