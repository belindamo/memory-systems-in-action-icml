Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nExtensions of Time \u2013 Basic Rules\n\nEither party, whether the contractor or owner, can request an extension of time on a construction project. Generally, when an extension of time is agreed on and granted, neither party can later claim liquidated damages.\n\nThis reflects a key principle in construction contracts that a party is not able to benefit from a contract by relying on their own breach of the contract. In other words, as a contractor, he cannot request an extension of time (and limit any claim for liquidated damages) when the contractor caused the delay. Therefore, as a contractor, he can claim an extension of time when:\n\nThe contractor is not the cause of any delays; and\nthose delays are out of the Contractor\u2019s control.\nIf the Contractor claim an extension of time, the contractor and the owner will agree to a new completion date, and the other rights under the contract will remain."

Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nWhen Can a Contractor Request a Time Extension?\n\nAs a contractor, any request for an extension of time should be for reasons outside of the contractor\u2019s control. Common reasons for delays requested by contractors can include:\n\ndelays in the delivery of essential materials;\ndelays resulting from variations requested by the owner;\nextreme or unusually bad weather;\nother disputes relating to the project.\n\nThe contractor should be able to provide evidence to show that external factors, and not the contractor\u2019s underperformance, caused the delay. The contractor should also aim to show that the contractor is otherwise performing well as a contractor on the project."

Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nWhat Does the Contract Say?\n\nAlways check the fine print on time extensions and the contractor\u2019s rights and obligations relating to those time extensions. Most contracts will include a clause allowing the contractor to request an extension of time for certain causes of delay. Many include tight limits on when extensions of time can be granted. These clauses will often also include a requirement to give a certain period of notice to the other party to the contract. It is essential that the contractor carefully follow any procedure for requesting an extension of time to avoid any disputes down the track."
