      "content": "Yes, that is correct. Release and Reclaim Religious Recovery Group has a team of facilitators who are helping professionals with lived experience of religious trauma. The facilitators include Dr. Marlene Winell, who is the founder of Journey Free and a leading expert on Religious Trauma Syndrome (RTS). The group also includes Christine Chenitz, a master\u2019s degree in Social Work and currently has a psychotherapy practice where she works with those who have experienced trauma of various types including religious and spiritual trauma and adverse religious experiences. Janice Selbie, a Registered Professional Counsellor, who was born and raised in a Canadian evangelical Christian home and experienced a series of tragedies which caused her sufficient doubt in the God of the Bible and prompted her to start researching other religions and exploring all that she had denied herself. Coco Owen, a licensed psychologist in Los Angeles, who grew up in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and Kevin Davison, a facilitator who recalls an early Southern Illinois Pentecostal church, where he first spoke in tongues after a laying on of hands in the children\u2019s church basement. Chase Marks, a former Jehovah's Witness, who after leaving the religion in his mid-20s, he faced the reality of losing his family, friends, community, worldview, and sense of self. He began his healing journey and began working with and studying under traditional healers and medicine people. They lead group discussions and provide support on Zoom conference calls twice a month."

I also felt empowered by the fact that I could be an encouragement to them, and it felt really good to find ways to lift up and respond to others in the group. \u2013 Janelle\n\nThere is great safety in exploring issues related to religious trauma with others who have shared similar experiences with the moderation and direction of an experience professional. Marlene is skilled, intuitive and informed. She has a gentle but firm way of guiding a person through the healing steps and skill building needed for coping with the negative aspects of religious upbringing. \u2013 Drew\n\nIt is priceless to be able to have people understand exactly what I\u2019m going through, and many times they have dealt with the same situation themselves. I feel like I have a base of friends that I know I can go to with any struggle I am having. I know they will be there for me and help me out. It\u2019s a great feeling. It\u2019s important to know others are there at some of the lowest points in my life. It also helps me to help them out, too. I am forced to think about other issues that are brought up, and it feels good to be there for someone else. \u2013 Tracey\n\nI\u2019ve begun a wonderful journey to reclaim my life, free from so many religiously inspired burdens and with few regrets weighing me down. . . As a therapeutic group facilitator for Release and Reclaim, both with her online forum and special retreats, Marlene is generous with her time and patient with our group progress. Her clinical skills are refined and impressive. . . I found her book, Leaving the Fold, invaluable in my ongoing healing process from authoritative religion and other authoritative ways. Marlene uses the exercises from her book combined with her own understanding and experience which has really made me feel like someone out there does understand and can help. \u2013 Frank\n\nThis group has been a very important part of my recovery from fundamentalism. Knowing that I am not alone or crazy in the journey has been a great gift! Other\u2019s stories, questions, struggles and insights have many times come across the net with perfect timing to encourage me in something I might be struggling with or questioning on any given day. I would highly recommend the group to anyone at any stage of questioning or leaving their faith. With gratitude, Anne"

      "content": "Religion is supposed to be good for you. Yet people get hurt in religious systems,\nsometimes seriously. I used to think that although damage was done by so-called\ncults, most religion is essentially benign. It could give you some comfort as a child\nand teach you some values, but then you grew up and away from it. It wasn\u2019t until I\nlooked back on my struggle to grow free of my own indoctrination, and heard the\nstories of others, that I realized that this kind of emotional and mental damage can\nbe profound.\nIn conservative Christianity you are told you are unacceptable. You are judged with\nregard to your relationship to God. Thus you can only be loved positionally, not\nessentially. And, contrary to any assumed ideal of Christian love, you cannot love\nothers for their essence either. This is the horrible cost of the doctrine of original\nsin. Recovering from this unloving assumption is perhaps the core task when you\nleave the fold. It is also a discovery of great joy \u2013 to permit unconditional love for\nyourself and others.\nThe problem of religious damage has not received much attention, perhaps because\nChristianity is so much a part of our culture and real criticism is taboo. Just consider\nwhat we have done to so-called heretics throughout history. Religious damage may\nalso seem less serious than other recovery issues such a alcoholism or child abuse.\nAnd since faith is thought of as a good thing in a world brimming with materialism,\nselfishness, and violence, many feel strange when complaining of church attendance\nor growing up in a religious home.\nBut leaving your faith is not like letting your library card expire or no longer believing\nin Santa Claus. It can be shattering to realize that your religion is creating problems\nin your life. Whether you leave abruptly or drift away over a long period of time, you\nmay experience profound sadness and confusion about what to do, think, and\nbelieve. You may also feel the rage of betrayal or struggle with persistent\ndepression.\nMany people are reluctant to talk about this subject for fear of hurting loved ones, of\nalienating others, of appearing foolish and self-centered. They sometimes fear\ndiving retribution. I have known therapists who were afraid to work openly with\npeople on these issues because they were concerned they might be labeled antireligious or anti-God. However, more often, therapists who have not been through\nthe experience themselves do not understand the difficulty of recovering from an\nauthoritarian religion."

      "content": "To address my recovery from religious trauma, I would first seek out resources and support from others who have gone through similar experiences. Joining a support group like RELEASE and RECLAIM Religious Recovery Group would provide me with a safe and understanding space to process my feelings and experiences. I would also look into working with a therapist or counselor who has experience in helping individuals recover from religious trauma.\n\nI would also focus on self-care and self-compassion, allowing myself time to grieve the loss of my former beliefs and understanding that it is a process. I would engage in activities that bring me joy and help me feel grounded in my identity and values.\n\nI would also aim to educate myself on the topic of religious trauma and the effects it can have on individuals, to better understand my own experiences and work through them. This may include reading books such as Dr. Marlene Winell's \"Leaving the Fold\" and exploring online resources.\n\nLastly, I would try to focus on building a new sense of community and connection, whether it be through friends, hobbies or volunteering. It is important for me to find people and activities that align with my new values and beliefs, and who support my journey of recovery."
