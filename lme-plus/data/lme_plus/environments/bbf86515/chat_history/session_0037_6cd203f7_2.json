Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Dealership:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Factory-trained technicians**: Dealership technicians are trained by the manufacturer and have extensive knowledge of your Camry's specific make and model.\n2. **Genuine parts**: Dealerships typically use genuine OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts, which are designed specifically for your vehicle.\n3. **Warranty and maintenance records**: Dealerships can update your vehicle's maintenance records and may offer warranties on their work.\n4. **Convenience**: Dealerships often have a one-stop-shop experience, where they can handle multiple services at once.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Higher cost**: Dealerships tend to be more expensive than independent shops.\n2. **Limited flexibility**: Dealerships may have strict procedures and protocols to follow, which can limit their ability to customize or negotiate prices.\n\n**Independent shop:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Cost-effective**: Independent shops often offer more competitive pricing than dealerships.\n2. **Flexibility**: Independent shops may be more willing to work with you on pricing, services, and customization.\n3. **Personalized service**: Independent shops often provide more personalized attention and may have a more relaxed atmosphere.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Variable quality**: The quality of work can vary greatly between independent shops, and it's essential to research and find a reputable one.\n2. **Non-OEM parts**: Independent shops may use aftermarket parts, which may not be of the same quality as OEM parts.\n3. **Limited warranty**: Independent shops may not offer warranties on their work, or the warranty may not be as comprehensive as a dealership's.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n1. Is your Camry still under warranty? If so, you may want to go to a dealership to maintain warranty coverage.\n2. Do you have a trusted independent shop in mind with a good reputation and experienced technicians? If so, they may be a cost-effective option.\n3. Are you looking for genuine OEM parts and manufacturer-specific expertise? Dealerships may be the better choice.\n4. Are you willing to pay a premium for the convenience and assurance of a dealership?\n\nUltimately, it's essential to research and compare prices, services, and reviews for both dealerships and independent shops in your area. You can also ask friends, family, or coworkers for recommendations to help you make an informed decision."
