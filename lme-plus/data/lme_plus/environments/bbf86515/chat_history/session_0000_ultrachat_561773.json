      "content": "There are some health benefits to using certain types of oil for stir-frying, in addition to considering the smoke point. For instance, using oils with higher levels of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats such as olive oil, avocado oil, or sesame oil may be beneficial for heart health compared to oils high in saturated fats like coconut oil or palm oil. However, it is important to note that all oils are high in calories, so it is best to use them in moderation. It is also important to balance the use of oils with other healthy cooking methods such as steaming or baking."

      "content": "Can I use olive oil for stir-frying or is it best used only for salads? I'm curious about trying it out."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, you can use olive oil for stir-frying. However, it is important to note that olive oil has a lower smoke point compared to oils like vegetable oil, canola oil, and peanut oil. This means that when heated to high temperatures for stir-frying, olive oil can break down and develop a bitter taste. To avoid this, use a lower heat setting and monitor the temperature of the pan when using olive oil for stir-frying. \n\nAdditionally, olive oil has a distinct flavor that may not complement all dishes, so it is important to consider the flavor profile of your ingredients before using it. For example, olive oil pairs well with Mediterranean-style dishes that feature herbs, garlic, and lemon, but may not work as well with stir-fries that have a more soy sauce or ginger-based flavor."
