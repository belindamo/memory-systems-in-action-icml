      "content": "Roof-mounted bike racks are a great option for cars without a hitch, and they can be very convenient. Since you have a road bike and want to carry just one bike, I'd recommend the following roof-mounted bike rack options:\n\n1. **Thule Evo 514 Bike Carrier**: This is a popular, easy-to-use roof-mounted bike rack that's compatible with most roof rails. It's a great option for road bikes, and it's relatively affordable (around $150).\n2. **Yakima FullBack 2 Bike Carrier**: This rack is designed for cars without a hitch and can carry one bike.

Look for racks with aerodynamic designs to minimize these effects.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I recommend checking customer reviews, watching installation videos, and reading the manufacturer's instructions to ensure you're comfortable with the installation and use of the rack.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these options or roof-mounted bike racks in general?"

      "content": "Decluttering the garage and making some extra cash is a great idea!\n\nThe condition of your skateboard plays a significant role in determining its resale value. Since you mentioned it's still in pretty good condition, you might be able to get a decent price for it. However, the demand for used skateboards can vary depending on several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Brand and model**: Is it a well-known brand like Tony Hawk, Birdhouse, or Element? Some brands hold their value better than others.\n2. **Age and rarity**: Is it a vintage skateboard or a more recent model? Limited edition or hard-to-find boards might be more valuable.\n3. **Condition**: As you mentioned, the condition is crucial. If it's still in good shape, with minimal wear and tear, it'll be more attractive to potential buyers.\n4. **Local demand**: Check if there are many skaters in your area looking for a used board. If there's high demand, you might get a better price.\n5. **Comparable sales**: Research similar skateboards that have sold recently in your area to determine a fair price range.\n\nTo get a good price on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, make sure to:\n\n1. **Take high-quality photos**: Show the skateboard from multiple angles, highlighting its condition and any unique features.\n2. **Write a detailed description**: Include the brand, model, age, condition, and any notable features or upgrades.\n3. **Set a competitive price**: Based on your research, set a price that's competitive with similar listings in your area.\n4. **Be prepared to negotiate**: Be open to reasonable offers and be prepared to negotiate the price.\n\nOn Craigslist, you can expect to get between 20% to 50% of the original retail price, depending on the condition and demand. On Facebook Marketplace, prices might be slightly lower due to the platform's more casual nature.\n\nBefore listing your skateboard, consider the following price ranges as a rough guide:\n\n* Low-end: $20-$50 (older boards, worn-out wheels, or minor damage)\n* Mid-range: $50-$100 (good condition, decent brand, and minimal wear)\n* High-end: $100-$200 (high-end brand, excellent condition, and recent model)\n\nRemember to stay safe when selling online by meeting potential buyers in a public place and being cautious of scams.\n\nGood luck with the sale, and I hope you find a buyer who appreciates your old skateboard!"
