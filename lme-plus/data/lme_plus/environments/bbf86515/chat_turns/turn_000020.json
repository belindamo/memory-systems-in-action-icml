  "content": "I'm looking to improve my overall fitness and coordination. I've recently started taking tennis lessons on Saturdays, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my serves and volleys. I used to play badminton with friends at the park every Sunday afternoon for about 3 months, which helped with my hand-eye coordination and reaction time. Can you recommend any exercises to help me further improve my hand-eye coordination?",
