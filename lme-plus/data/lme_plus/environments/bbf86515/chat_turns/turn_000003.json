  "content": "There are some health benefits to using certain types of oil for stir-frying, in addition to considering the smoke point. For instance, using oils with higher levels of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats such as olive oil, avocado oil, or sesame oil may be beneficial for heart health compared to oils high in saturated fats like coconut oil or palm oil. However, it is important to note that all oils are high in calories, so it is best to use them in moderation.
