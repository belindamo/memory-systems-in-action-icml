  "content": "As Odyl, Val and I have always had a certain rapport that kept us connected even when we were at odds with each other. We would often banter and tease each other, trying to get under each other's skin. It was during one of these sparring sessions that I called her \"Dearie\" in a sarcastic way, and it just stuck. I think it was partly because it was such an affectionate nickname, and partly because it was so opposite to the way we usually interacted with each other.\n\nOver time, as we continued to work together and go on missions, we began to realize that there was something deeper between us. Despite our differences and occasional conflicts, we had a strong connection and a mutual respect for each other's skills and intellect. It was that understanding that allowed us to eventually come together as partners, both in work and in life.",
