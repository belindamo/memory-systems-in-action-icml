  "content": "Yes, that's correct. R'kesh was a Novayan, and through our relationship, I learned a lot about their spirituality and beliefs. The Novayans have a deep connection to the natural world and believe that all things, including inanimate objects like ships, have a spirit or essence. This resonated with me, and I began to see my ship as more than just a collection of parts and wires. To me, the ship is a living being that we rely on for survival in the vast emptiness of space. The crash couch, in particular, is a critical connection point between myself and the ship, and I believe that by using it, I am able to better understand and communicate with the ship's spirit.",
