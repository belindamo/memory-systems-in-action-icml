  "content": "It seems like you are providing a set of experimental results for a system that is detecting objects in a specific environment. Each result corresponds to a specific distance (dist) and a specific threshold (thres) used by the detection system. For each combination of dist and thres, you provide the detection results for different angles (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 degrees), where each angle is divided into two categories based on whether the detected object's angle with respect to the system is less than 45 degrees or greater than 45 degrees.\n\nThe numbers in each angle's category represent the number of correct detections out of a total number of detections for that category. Finally, you provide the false positive (fp) rate for each combination of dist and thres, which is the ratio of the number of incorrect detections to the total number of detections.",
