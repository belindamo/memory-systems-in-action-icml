  "content": "Yes, there are ongoing efforts to digitize other indigenous languages around the world. Digital technology can play a crucial role in language revitalization efforts, especially for languages that are endangered or have very few speakers left. Digitization can help to create and archive language resources, including recorded speech, language dictionaries, oral histories, and other cultural materials, to make them more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nOne notable example is the Endangered Languages Project, which was launched by Google and the Alliance for Linguistic Diversity in 2012. The project is an online platform that provides resources for documenting, preserving, and promoting endangered languages around the world. It offers a range of digital tools, including a language documentation kit, a database of existing language resources, and an interactive map of endangered languages. \n\nMoreover, the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages is another organization dedicated to documenting and revitalizing endangered languages. They use technology, such as Rapid Word Collection, to document and analyze endangered languages around the world. \n\nIn short, digital technology has the potential to support the efforts of indigenous language speakers and researchers to preserve and revitalize their languages. By leveraging digital tools and platforms, speakers and learners of indigenous languages can gain access to a wide range of language resources, even when physical access is limited.",
