  "content": "Yes, you can find the optimal coordinates on the Excel spreadsheet.\n\nTo do this, you can use the Solver Add-in in Excel, which allows you to find the optimal values of the decision variables that minimize or maximize a given objective function subject to certain constraints.\n\nFirst, you would need to add the constraint \"x1 + x2 - 1 <= 0\" to the Solver by selecting \"Add\" in the Solver Parameters window. Then, you can set the objective function to `=A1^2 - A1*A2^2 + A2^2 - 2*A2`, and select \"Min\" for the optimization goal.\n\nYou can then run the Solver and it will find the optimal values of x1 and x2 that minimize the objective function subject to the constraint. The Solver results will provide you with the optimal coordinates and the minimum value of the function.",
