  "content": "Companion planting is a great way to create a harmonious and thriving garden ecosystem! Congratulations on taking the first step by planting a pollinator-friendly patch of sunflowers and zinnias. That's a wonderful way to attract beneficial insects to your garden.\n\nNow, let's talk about your tomatoes and basil. Here are some companion planting tips to keep in mind:\n\n**Tomatoes:**\n\n* **Good companions:** Basil (you're already doing this!), oregano, marigold, borage, and chives. These plants can help improve tomato flavor, repel pests, and attract beneficial insects.\n* **Bad companions:** Fennel, potato, and members of the Brassica family (broccoli, cauliflower, kale). These plants can inhibit tomato growth or attract pests that target tomatoes.\n\n**Basil:**\n\n* **Good companions:** Tomatoes (again, you're on the right track!), peppers, oregano, and marigold. Basil repels pests that target these plants and adds flavor to many dishes when used together.\n* **Bad companions:** None are known to cause significant harm, but keep in mind that basil can be sensitive to strong-scented herbs like sage and rosemary, which may overpower its flavor.\n\nSome general tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Plant marigold and nasturtium around the perimeter of your garden to repel nematodes, whiteflies, and other pests.\n* Avoid planting members of the same plant family (e.g., Solanaceae: tomatoes, peppers, eggplants) together, as they may share similar pests and diseases.\n* Consider the mature size of your plants and leave enough space between them to prevent overcrowding, which can lead to disease and pest issues.\n\nEnjoy your sunflowers and zinnias, and happy gardening!",
