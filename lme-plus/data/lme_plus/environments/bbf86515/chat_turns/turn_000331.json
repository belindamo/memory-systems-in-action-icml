It's possible that it's a local event or a fictional event.\n\nNow, let's talk about aerodynamics! Improving your car's aerodynamics can definitely help with performance, but it's essential to understand that a rear spoiler or front splitter alone might not make a significant difference for a street-driven car like your 2018 Ford Mustang GT.\n\n**Rear Spoiler:**\n\nA rear spoiler can help reduce drag and improve stability at high speeds, but its effectiveness depends on the design, size, and placement. For a street-driven car, a small to moderate-sized spoiler might be sufficient. However, if you're looking for a more aggressive look, a larger spoiler might be more suitable.\n\n**Front Splitter:**\n\nA front splitter can help improve downforce and reduce lift at high speeds, but it's essential to consider the following:\n\n* A front splitter is more effective on a track-focused car with a lower ride height.\n* It might not provide significant benefits for a street-driven car, especially if the ride height is not lowered.\n* A front splitter can be prone to damage from speed bumps, curbs, and other road hazards.\n\n**Aerodynamic Upgrades for Your 2018 Ford Mustang GT:**\n\nIf you're looking to improve your car's aerodynamics, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Start with a front air dam or lip spoiler:** A well-designed front air dam or lip spoiler can help improve airflow and reduce drag.\n2. **Consider a side skirt or rocker panel:** A side skirt or rocker panel can help smooth out airflow along the sides of the car and reduce drag.\n3. **Look into a rear diffuser:** A rear diffuser can help improve airflow exiting the rear of the car and reduce drag.\n4. **Consult with an aerodynamics expert:** If you're serious about improving your car's aerodynamics, consider consulting with an expert who can provide custom recommendations based on your car's specific design and needs.\n\nRemember to always prioritize functionality and safety when modifying your car. Ensure that any aerodynamic upgrades you make do not compromise your car's safety features or impede its performance.\n\nI hope this helps!",
