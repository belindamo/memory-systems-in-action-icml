  "content": "That sounds like a wonderful idea! Having a little get-together with your family before the dinner party is a great way to spend quality time with them and create some special memories. It's lovely that you prioritize family time, especially on Wednesdays.\n\nHaving a casual gathering before the dinner party can also help you relax and get into a good mood before the main event. You can catch up with your family, share some laughs, and just enjoy each other's company. It's a great way to set the tone for a wonderful evening.\n\nJust make sure to plan the timing wisely, so you have enough time to get everything ready for the dinner party. You might want to keep the family gathering relatively short and sweet, so you can focus on preparing the lasagna and other dishes for your friends.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding a balance and making time for the people who matter most. I'm sure your family will appreciate the extra attention, and your friends will love the delicious food and warm atmosphere you'll create for them.",
