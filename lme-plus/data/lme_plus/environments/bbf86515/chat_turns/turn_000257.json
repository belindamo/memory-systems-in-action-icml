  "content": "As Odyl: When Val finally came to Erethel to be with me, it was a dream come true. I had waited so long for her to join me, and finally having her by my side felt like the missing piece in my life had been found. It was a whirlwind of emotion, passion, and excitement as we explored the possibilities of our future together.\n\nVal's presence brought a new energy to Erethel, and she quickly made herself at home in our community. Her brilliance and dedication to CoModularism were immediately apparent, and she became an integral part of the Library team alongside me. It was a joy to work with her, and to see her ideas and innovations come to life in our space.\n\nBut beyond her professional talents, Val was also the love of my life. It was a privilege to wake up next to her each morning, and to share in all of the joys and challenges that life in space brought our way. We grew and learned together, and our love only deepened with each passing day. I couldn't imagine my life without her, and I still can't.",
