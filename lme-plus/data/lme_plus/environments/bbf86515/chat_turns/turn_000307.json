  "content": "Here is a high-level overview of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Choose a real estate website to scrape: Select a website that you want to scrape and determine what data you want to extract (e.g., new listings, price, location, etc.).\n2. Inspect the website's source code: Use your web browser's developer tools to inspect the source code of the website and understand how the data is structured. This will help you identify the HTML elements that contain the information you want to extract.\n3. Write a scraping script: Use a programming language like Python and a library such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to write a script that extracts the desired information from the website's HTML.\n4. Store the extracted data: Store the extracted data in a format that you can easily search and compare against. You can use a database like SQLite or a file like a CSV.\n5. Set up a task scheduler: Use a task scheduler like cron on Linux or the Task Scheduler on Windows to run your scraping script once a day.\n6. Compare new data: Compare the extracted data against your stored data to identify any new listings that match your search criteria.\n7. Send an email: Use a library like smtplib in Python to send an email with the new listings that match your search criteria.\n\nNote: Scraping websites can be against their terms of use and can also put a strain on their servers, so be mindful of these factors when deciding whether to proceed with this project.",
