Here are some plants that are known to be less appealing to slugs and snails:\n\n1. **Marigold:** These bright, cheerful flowers contain a natural pesticide that repels nematodes, whiteflies, and slugs.\n2. **Chives:** Chives are said to repel aphids and other pests, including slugs and snails. They're also a great addition to many dishes!\n3. **Garlic:** Like chives, garlic has natural insect-repelling properties that can help deter slugs and snails. Plant garlic around the perimeter of your garden to keep them away.\n4. **Hot Peppers:** Slugs and snails don't like the heat, so plants like hot peppers, chili peppers, and cayenne peppers can help deter them.\n5. **Borage:** This herb is known to repel pests like nematodes, beetles, and slugs. It's also a great attractor plant for beneficial insects like bees.\n6. **Radish:** Radish is a natural repellent for cucumber beetles and other pests, including slugs and snails.\n7. **Daffodil:** These beautiful flowers contain a toxic compound called lycorine, which is toxic to slugs and snails.\n8. **Hyacinth:** Hyacinth bulbs contain a toxic compound that's toxic to slugs and snails, making them a great addition to your garden.\n9. **Foxglove:** Foxglove contains a toxic compound called digitalis, which is toxic to slugs and snails.\n10. **Verbena:** This low-growing, spreading groundcover is said to repel slugs and snails, making it a great addition to your garden.\n\nKeep in mind that while these plants are more resistant to slugs and snails, they're not completely immune. It's still important to use other methods of control, like the ones I mentioned earlier, to keep your garden slug- and snail-free.\n\nRemember, a diverse and balanced ecosystem is key to a healthy garden. By incorporating these plants into your garden, you'll be creating a more resilient and slug-resistant environment.",
