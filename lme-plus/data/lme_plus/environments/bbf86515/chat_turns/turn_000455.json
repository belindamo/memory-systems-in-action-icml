  "content": "You make a valid point that fashion can seem like an unnecessary expense, especially when there are more important things to consider in life. However, it's important to acknowledge that fashion can mean different things for different people. While some may view fashion as an indulgence, others may see it as a form of creativity, innovation, and self-expression that brings them joy and fulfillment.\n\nRegarding the idea of expressing oneself with what's already in the closet, it is true that many people already have a wide range of clothes that they can mix and match to create different looks. In this case, fashion doesn't have to be expensive, and you can still express your personal style through your existing wardrobe.\n\nHowever, some people enjoy the excitement of adding new pieces to their wardrobe and experimenting with different looks. It's all about finding a balance and spending within your means. You can build a well-rounded wardrobe that combines both vintage and modern pieces, basics and special occasion garments, without breaking the bank.\n\nIn the end, what's most important is understanding that fashion is a personal choice, and that everyone has different priorities when it comes to self-expression and style.",
