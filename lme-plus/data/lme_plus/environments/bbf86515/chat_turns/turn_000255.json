  "content": "As Odyl, Val is an incredibly intelligent and driven individual. When I first met her, I was struck by her passion for CoModularism and her dedication to the Co-Op. She has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the subject, and I've learned a lot from her over the years.\n\nVal can be blunt and brusque at times, but I've come to understand that it's simply a part of her personality, and not something to be taken personally. She has a unique way of looking at the world, which I find fascinating and refreshing.\n\nSince we've been together, Val has become even more important to me. I admire her strength and resilience, and the depth of her love and commitment to me and to our life together. She can be vulnerable at times, but she's never afraid to ask for what she needs or to stand up for what she believes in.\n\nOverall, I feel incredibly fortunate to have Val as my partner and companion in life. She challenges me, supports me, and loves me in a way that I never thought was possible.",
