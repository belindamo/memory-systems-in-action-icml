We can set up a few tables and have some friendly competitions going on. It'll be a great way to catch up and have some laughs together.\n\nBy the way, speaking of family, I've been trying to call my grandma every Sunday evening to chat with her for at least 30 minutes. It's been really nice to hear about her week and share some stories with her. Do you have any suggestions on how I can make our conversations more engaging and meaningful?",
