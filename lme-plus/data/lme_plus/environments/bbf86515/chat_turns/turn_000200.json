You can find it listed under the \"Canon\" section, and it's marked as \"Supported\" for both camera control and live view.\n\nThis means you should be able to connect your EOS 80D to your computer via USB and use Capture One's tethered shooting features, including:\n\n* Camera control: Adjust camera settings, such as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, directly from within Capture One.\n* Live view: See a live preview of your camera's sensor on your computer screen, allowing for precise focus and composition control.\n* Instant review: Review your images on your computer as soon as you capture them, with the option to rate, tag, and organize them.\n\nTo get started, make sure you have the latest version of Capture One installed, and follow these general steps:\n\n1. Connect your EOS 80D to your computer using a USB cable.\n2. Open Capture One and go to File > Tethered Shooting > Canon EOS 80D (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+T on Windows or Command+Shift+T on Mac).\n3. Capture One will then establish a connection with your camera, and you can start shooting tethered.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have questions, Capture One's support team is always available to help.\n\nEnjoy shooting tethered with your EOS 80D and Capture One!",
