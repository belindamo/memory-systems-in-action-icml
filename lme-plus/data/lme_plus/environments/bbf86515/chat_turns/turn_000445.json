  "content": "Yes, traditionally, haute couture fashion has been exclusive to the wealthy and famous due to its high cost and exclusivity. The process of creating a haute couture garment is very labor-intensive, and each piece is made to measure for the individual client. Therefore, the prices can be astronomical, with some dresses costing tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nHowever, in recent years, some haute couture designers have made efforts to make their creations more accessible. For example, some designers have introduced ready-to-wear lines, which are more affordable and available to a wider range of customers.\n\nAdditionally, some designers have partnered with mass-market brands to create more affordable collections that are still inspired by haute couture fashion. These collaborations allow more people to experience the creativity and artistry of high fashion without the sky-high price tag.\n\nSo while haute couture fashion may still be mostly out of reach for the average person, there are more and more options available for those who appreciate its beauty and craftsmanship.",
