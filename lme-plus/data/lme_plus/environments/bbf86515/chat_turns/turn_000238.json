  "content": "In the table you provided, it looks like you have evaluated the objective function and the constraint function for a specific value of x2 (x2 = 0.51), and also computed the Lagrange multiplier (\u03bb) for the corresponding point.\n\nTo find the optimal coordinates, you would need to repeat this process for different values of x2 to explore the feasible region and identify the point where the objective function attains its minimum value subject to the constraint.\n\nOne approach is to use the Solver Add-in in Excel, as I described in my earlier response. Another approach is to use an iterative optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent,",
