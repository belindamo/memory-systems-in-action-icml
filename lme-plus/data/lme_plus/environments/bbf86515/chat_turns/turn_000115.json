  "content": "Roof-mounted bike racks are a great option for cars without a hitch, and they can be very convenient. Since you have a road bike and want to carry just one bike, I'd recommend the following roof-mounted bike rack options:\n\n1. **Thule Evo 514 Bike Carrier**: This is a popular, easy-to-use roof-mounted bike rack that's compatible with most roof rails. It's a great option for road bikes, and it's relatively affordable (around $150).\n2. **Yakima FullBack 2 Bike Carrier**: This rack is designed for cars without a hitch and can carry one bike. It's easy to install and has a sleek, aerodynamic design (around $170).\n3. **Rhino-Rack RBC035 Bike Carrier**: This is another great option for road bikes, and it's compatible with most roof rails. It's known for its durability and ease of use (around $180).\n\nWhen choosing a roof-mounted bike rack, make sure to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Roof rail compatibility**: Ensure the rack is compatible with your car's roof rails. Check the manufacturer's website or consult with a sales representative to confirm compatibility.\n2. **Bike weight capacity**: Road bikes are generally lighter, but it's still essential to check the rack's weight capacity to ensure it can handle your bike's weight.\n3. **Ease of installation**: Look for racks with easy installation processes, as you'll be putting the rack on and taking it off your car regularly.\n4. **Security**: Consider racks with built-in locks or additional security features to protect your bike from theft.\n5. **Wind noise and drag**: Some roof-mounted racks can create wind noise or increase drag, which can affect your car's fuel efficiency. Look for racks with aerodynamic designs to minimize these effects.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I recommend checking customer reviews, watching installation videos, and reading the manufacturer's instructions to ensure you're comfortable with the installation and use of the rack.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these options or roof-mounted bike racks in general?",
