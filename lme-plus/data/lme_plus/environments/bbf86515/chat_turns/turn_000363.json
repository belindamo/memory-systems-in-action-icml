Column name: distance, i.e. [0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180]. Row name: angle, i.e. [0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90] \n2. The first table is about recall rate. Each value is denominator / 10. \nFor example, the value of '30 degree: <45 = 5/8, >45 = 3/8' is 8/10=0.80\n3. The second table is about angle accuracy. Each value is fraction in the text. Select the value of <45 when degree is less than 45, and that of > 45 for the rest.\nFor example, the value of '30 degree: <45 = 2/9, >45 = 7/9' is 2/9=0.22 and the value of '60 degree: <45 = 1/10, >45 = 9/10' is 9/10=0.90",
