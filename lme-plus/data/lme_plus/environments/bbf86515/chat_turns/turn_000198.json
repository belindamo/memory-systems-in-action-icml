They have an extensive list of supported cameras from various manufacturers, including Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, and more.\n\nYou can filter the list by camera brand, model, or type (DSLR, mirrorless, medium format, etc.) to find your specific camera model. If your camera is listed, it's likely that Capture One supports tethered shooting with it.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check the Capture One website for the latest [Camera Support Policy](https://www.captureone.com/en/resources/camera-support-policy), which outlines their approach to supporting new camera models and firmware updates.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can reach out to Capture One's support team directly and ask about compatibility with your specific camera model. They're usually very helpful and can provide more detailed information.\n\nRemember, even if your camera is not officially supported, you can still try using Capture One's generic camera driver or explore other tethering options, such as using an adapter or third-party software. However, official support usually ensures the best performance and feature set.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you get to enjoy Capture One's tethered shooting capabilities with your camera!",
