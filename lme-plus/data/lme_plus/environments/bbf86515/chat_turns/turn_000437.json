Many countries have recognized the environmental and social impacts of forestry slash, including increased risks of wildfires, soil erosion, and water pollution.\n\nFor example, in Canada, the British Columbia government conducted a review of slash management in 2017 and made recommendations for improvements, including increased education and training for industry workers, better coordination between government agencies and industry, and improved monitoring and reporting of slash management practices. Similarly, in Australia, the New South Wales government has developed guidelines and regulations for slash management, including requirements for the removal of slash from high-risk areas and the use of best management practices to minimize environmental impacts.\n\nOverall, governments around the world have recognized the importance of effective forestry slash management and are taking steps to improve regulations, guidelines, and practices to minimize environmental and social impacts.",
