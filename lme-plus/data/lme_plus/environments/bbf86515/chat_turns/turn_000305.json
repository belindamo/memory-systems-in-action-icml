  "content": "As of our conversation, the Toronto Maple Leafs have been playing some solid hockey, with a mix of wins and losses in their recent games.\n\nAuston Matthews, in particular, has been on an absolute tear lately. He's been one of the hottest players in the league, with a streak of multi-point games and a goal-scoring pace that's hard to match. Over the past few games, Matthews has been averaging around a point per game, with a few games where he's scored multiple goals.\n\nIn his last 5 games, Matthews has 7 goals and 4 assists, which is an incredible pace. He's been playing with a lot of confidence, using his speed and skill to dominate games and create scoring opportunities for himself and his teammates.\n\nJohn Tavares, on the other hand, has been playing some solid hockey as well, although not quite at the same torrid pace as Matthews. Tavares has been averaging around 0.75 points per game over his last 5 games, with a few multi-point efforts mixed in.\n\nTavares has been playing a strong two-way game, using his speed and vision to create chances and also being responsible in his own end. He's been playing on a line with Matthews and another talented winger, and the three of them have been clicking lately.\n\nAs a team, the Leafs have been averaging around 3.5 goals per game over their last 5 games, which is a solid pace. They've been getting contributions from throughout their lineup, with different players stepping up on different nights.\n\nOf course, the Leafs' performance can be streaky at times, and they've had some inconsistent stretches this season. But with Matthews and Tavares leading the way, they're always a threat to score goals and win games.\n\nKeep in mind that stats can change quickly in the NHL, and teams can go on hot or cold streaks at any time. But as of now, the Leafs are looking like a formidable opponent, and the Bruins will need to be at the top of their game to take them down.",
