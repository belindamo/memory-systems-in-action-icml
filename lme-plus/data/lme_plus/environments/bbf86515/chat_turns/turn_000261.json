  "content": "As Odyl, the memory of the day Val showed up at my doorstep is still so vivid in my mind, even after all these years. I had been thinking about her constantly since our mission together, but I wasn't sure if she felt the same way. So when I opened the door and saw her standing there, looking even more beautiful than I remembered, I was completely stunned.\n\nAt first, we just stood there awkwardly, not knowing what to say. But then Val spoke up, and her voice was like music to my ears. We started talking, and it was like no time had passed since we last saw each other. Before I knew it, we were laughing and joking around like we used to, and it felt so good to be with her again.\n\nThat night was one of the most passionate and memorable nights of my life. We made love all night, and it was like nothing I had ever experienced before. I knew then that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Val, and I was so grateful that she had come to be with me at Erethel.",
