Having a 2-3 hour window before the dinner party should give you plenty of time to catch up with your family and still get everything ready.\n\nFor fun activities or games, I've got a few suggestions that are perfect for a casual family gathering:\n\n1. **Family Trivia**: Create a quick quiz with questions about your family's history, interests, or favorite TV shows/movies. You can even offer small prizes for the winners!\n2. **Board Games or Card Games**: Set up a few tables with popular board games like Scrabble, Monopoly, or Clue. Alternatively, you can play card games like poker, blackjack, or even just a classic game of Go Fish.\n3. **Karaoke Contest**: If your family loves music, set up a karaoke machine or use a karaoke app on a tablet/smartphone. Choose a few fun songs and have a sing-off with prizes for the best performance.\n4. **Cooking or Baking Together**: Since you're already cooking for the dinner party, why not involve your family in the process? You can make a simple dessert or appetizer together, like cookies or a fruit salad.\n5. **Family Story Time**: Gather everyone in a cozy spot and take turns sharing stories about your childhood, favorite memories, or funny anecdotes. This can be a great way to bond and create new memories.\n6. **Outdoor Activities**: If the weather permits, consider having a quick outdoor game session, like a game of catch, a water balloon toss, or even a short scavenger hunt around the house/yard.\n\nRemember to keep things simple and relaxed, as the focus is on spending quality time together. You can choose one or two activities that fit your family's interests and age range.\n\nI hope these ideas help make your family gathering a fun and memorable one!",
