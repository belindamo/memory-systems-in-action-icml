In the expression f(x1,x2) = (x1)^2 \u2212x1x^2 +(x2)^2 \u22122x2, the variables x1 and x2 should be represented by regular non-italicized characters.\n\nWhen entering the formula into Excel, you can use cell references to represent the variables. For example, you can enter the formula in cell B1 as \"=A1^2-A1*A2^2+A2^2-2*A2\". Here, A1 and A2 represent the values of x1 and x2, respectively, that you want to evaluate the function for.",
