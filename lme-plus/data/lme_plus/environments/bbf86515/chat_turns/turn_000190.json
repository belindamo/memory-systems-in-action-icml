Her expertise and insights would undoubtedly enrich the conversation.\n\n**Scheduling the Chat:**\n\n1. **Weekday vs. Weekend:** Both options have their pros and cons. Weekdays (Monday to Thursday) tend to be better for Twitter engagement, as they coincide with the traditional workweek when people are more active on social media. Weekends, on the other hand, might attract a more relaxed and leisurely audience, which could lead to a more conversational tone. Considering your topic, I'd recommend a weekday, as it might attract more professionals and enthusiasts in the sustainable fashion industry.\n2. **Time of Day:** For a weekday chat, I'd suggest scheduling it during the late morning to early afternoon (11 am - 2 pm EST). This time slot tends to have higher engagement rates, as it coincides with the peak hours of Twitter usage. Avoid scheduling the chat during lunch breaks (12 pm - 1 pm EST) or early morning hours (8 am - 10 am EST), as engagement might be lower.\n\n**Specific Time Options:**\n\nBased on Twitter's peak hours and considering your guest's schedule, here are three time options to consider:\n\n1. **Wednesday, 11:30 am EST**: This time slot is often considered a sweet spot for Twitter chats, as it's during the morning peak hour and before lunch breaks.\n2. **Thursday, 1:30 pm EST**: This time slot is still within the peak hour range and might attract a slightly more relaxed audience, which could lead to a more conversational tone.\n3. **Tuesday, 12:30 pm EST**: This time slot is during the peak hour and might attract a good balance of professionals and enthusiasts in the sustainable fashion industry.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Confirm with Maxine B\u00e9dat**: Before finalizing the time, make sure to confirm with Maxine B\u00e9dat to ensure she's available and comfortable with the scheduled time.\n2. **Promote the chat in advance**: Share the chat details on your Twitter account, and encourage your followers to participate. You can also create a Twitter Moment or a Facebook Event to promote the chat.\n3. **Use relevant hashtags**: Use relevant hashtags, such as #SustainableFashion, #FashionForACause, #EcoFriendly, and #TwitterChat, to attract a wider audience and make the chat more discoverable.\n4. **Prepare engaging questions**: Craft thought-provoking questions that will encourage participation and stimulate a valuable discussion.\n\nBy considering these factors, you'll be well on your way to hosting a successful Twitter chat with Maxine B\u00e9dat and sparking important conversations about sustainable fashion!",
