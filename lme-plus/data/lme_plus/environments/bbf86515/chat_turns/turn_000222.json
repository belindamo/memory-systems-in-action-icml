  "content": "Thank you for the clarification. The subscript notation indicates that the second variable x2 is being squared in the objective function, so the correct notation is f(x1,x2) = (x1)^2 \u2212x1x^2 +(x2)^2 \u22122x2.\n\nThe use of subscript notation does not affect how we solve the optimization problem in Excel. We can still use the same procedure as described earlier to minimize the function f(x1,x2) subject to the constraint g(x1,x2) = x1 + x2 - 1 \u2264 0, with the Lagrange multiplier \u03bb as a parameter.\n\nWe can enter the objective function f(x1,x2) in cell B1 as \"=A1^2-A1*A2^2+B1^2-2*B1^2\". We can enter the constraint function g(x1,x2) in cell C1 as \"=A1+A2-1\". We can enter the Lagrange multiplier \u03bb in cell D1 as a constant.\n\nWe can then use the Solver add-in in Excel to find the optimal solution, following the same steps as described earlier. The only difference is that we need to change the formula in cell B1 to use the correct subscript notation for x2.\n\nOnce we have found the optimal solution, we can use Excel to verify the solution by calculating the values of the objective function and the constraint function for different values of x1 and x2, and plotting the function and the constraint using a scatter plot.",
