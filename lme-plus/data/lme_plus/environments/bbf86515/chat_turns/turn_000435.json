  "content": "Yes, there was a New Zealand government review into forestry slash around five years ago. The review was conducted by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and was released in August 2018.\n\nThe review was prompted by concerns about the environmental impacts of forestry slash, which is the debris left over after logging, such as branches and foliage. The review looked at the current regulations and guidelines surrounding forestry slash management and made recommendations for improvements.\n\nThe review found that there were significant gaps in the regulations and guidelines, which were leading to inconsistent and inadequate management of forestry slash. It made a number of recommendations, including the development of national guidance for slash management, improved monitoring and enforcement of regulations, and better collaboration between industry, government, and other stakeholders.\n\nThe MPI has since been working to implement the recommendations of the review, including the development of new guidelines for forestry slash management, increased monitoring and enforcement, and improved collaboration with industry and other stakeholders.",
