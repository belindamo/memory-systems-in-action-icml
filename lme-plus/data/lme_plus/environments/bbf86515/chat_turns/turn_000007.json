  "content": "Yes, you can use olive oil for stir-frying. However, it is important to note that olive oil has a lower smoke point compared to oils like vegetable oil, canola oil, and peanut oil. This means that when heated to high temperatures for stir-frying, olive oil can break down and develop a bitter taste. To avoid this, use a lower heat setting and monitor the temperature of the pan when using olive oil for stir-frying. \n\nAdditionally, olive oil has a distinct flavor that may not complement all dishes, so it is important to consider the flavor profile of your ingredients before using it. For example, olive oil pairs well with Mediterranean-style dishes that feature herbs, garlic, and lemon, but may not work as well with stir-fries that have a more soy sauce or ginger-based flavor.",
