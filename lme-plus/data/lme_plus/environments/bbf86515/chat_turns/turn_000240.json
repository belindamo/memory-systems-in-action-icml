  "content": "No, the optimal solution is not necessarily at the point where the Lagrange multiplier is computed. The Lagrange multiplier helps to identify the slope of the constraint boundary at the optimal point, but it does not directly give you the optimal coordinates.\n\nIn your table, you have evaluated the objective function and constraint function for a specific value of x2 (x2 = 0.51), and found that the minimum value of the objective function within the feasible region is -0.5202, which corresponds to a specific value of x1 (x1 = 0.08005).\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that this point is the optimal solution. To find the optimal solution, you would need to explore the feasible region more systematically and identify the point where the objective function attains its minimum value subject to the constraint. This can be done using an optimization algorithm, such as the Solver Add-in in Excel or a gradient-based method like gradient descent.",
