  "content": "The cost of developing an app like Careem, which offers ride-hailing, ride-sharing, and taxi services, for iOS, Android, and web platforms with a back-end solution, with a team of 3-4 developers for a 6-month period, in Canada, could range from $150,000 to $500,000 or more.\n\nPlease note that this is a rough estimate and the actual cost could vary based on the specific requirements and complexity of the project. Building an exact replica of Careem may require additional features, functionalities, and licensing fees that could impact the overall cost. It is recommended to have a detailed scope of work and requirements from the client to provide a more accurate cost estimate.",
