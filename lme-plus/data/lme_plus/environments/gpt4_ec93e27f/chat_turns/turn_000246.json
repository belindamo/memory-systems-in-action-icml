  "content": "With that information, let's calculate how many candles you should make to restock your inventory.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate average daily sales in units**\n\nYou mentioned you earned $150 on April 16th, and your candles are priced at $15 each. To find out how many candles you sold that day, divide the sales amount by the price per candle:\n\n$150 \u00f7 $15 = 10 candles\n\nSo, you sold 10 candles on April 16th. Let's assume this is a good representation of your average daily sales.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate total sales for the lead time**\n\nSince it takes you 2 weeks to restock, you'll want to calculate your total sales for that period. Assuming 14 days in 2 weeks, multiply your average daily sales by 14:\n\n10 candles/day \u00d7 14 days = 140 candles\n\n**Step 3: Add a buffer for the desired inventory level**\n\nYou want to keep 100 candles in stock. To ensure you have enough stock during the restocking period, add your desired inventory level to the total sales for the lead time:\n\n140 candles (total sales) + 100 candles (desired inventory) = 240 candles\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo restock your inventory, you should make approximately **240 candles**. This will cover your sales for the 2-week lead time and provide a buffer of 100 candles to ensure you have enough stock on hand.\n\nKeep in mind that this calculation assumes your sales remain consistent and don't fluctuate significantly. If you experience seasonal changes or other factors that affect your sales, you may need to adjust your calculations accordingly.",
