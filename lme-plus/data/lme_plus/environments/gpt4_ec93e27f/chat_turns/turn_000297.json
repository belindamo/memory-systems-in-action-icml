I'm planning to write a thorough review of \"The Silent Forest\" and I want to make sure I cover all aspects of the film. By the way, I was wondering if you could recommend some other documentary films that explore similar themes of identity, community, and social justice. I'm really interested in watching more films that tackle complex issues and spark important conversations.",
