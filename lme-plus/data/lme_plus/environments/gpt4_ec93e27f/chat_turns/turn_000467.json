  "content": "The capstone project is a crucial part of each program, and it's an excellent way to apply the skills and knowledge you've gained to a real-world problem. Here's more information on the capstone projects for each program:\n\n**Stanford University - Master of Science in Data Science (MS-DS)**\n\n* **Past projects:** Students have worked on a wide range of capstone projects, including:\n\t+ Developing a recommender system for a music streaming service\n\t+ Building a predictive model to identify high-risk patients for hospital readmission\n\t+ Creating a natural language processing tool for sentiment analysis in customer feedback\n\t+ Analyzing NBA player performance data to inform team strategy\n* **Evaluation:** The capstone project is evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\t+ Technical merit and complexity\n\t+ Data quality and relevance\n\t+ Insight generation and interpretation\n\t+ Communication and presentation\n\t+ Impact and potential for real-world application\n* **Industry partnerships:** Yes, Stanford has a strong network of industry partners that can provide capstone project opportunities. In the past, students have worked with companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, and startups in the Bay Area. The program also has a dedicated industry relations team that helps facilitate partnerships and project opportunities.\n\n**Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Master of Business Analytics (MBAn)**\n\n* **Past projects:** Students have worked on capstone projects with top companies and organizations, including:\n\t+ Developing a predictive model for customer churn at a major telecommunications company\n\t+ Building a recommender system for a leading e-commerce platform\n\t+ Analyzing sensor data to optimize manufacturing processes for a global manufacturer\n\t+ Creating a data-driven strategy for a non-profit organization\n* **Evaluation:** The capstone project is evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\t+ Business impact and relevance\n\t+ Technical complexity and innovation\n\t+ Data quality and relevance\n\t+ Insight generation and interpretation\n\t+ Communication and presentation\n* **Industry partnerships:** Yes, MIT has a strong network of industry partners that provide capstone project opportunities. The program has partnered with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Deloitte, among others. The program also has a dedicated industry relations team that helps facilitate partnerships and project opportunities.\n\n**University of California, Berkeley - Master of Science in Data Science (MS-DS)**\n\n* **Past projects:** Students have worked on capstone projects with a range of organizations, including:\n\t+ Developing a predictive model for energy consumption in buildings\n\t+ Building a natural language processing tool for sentiment analysis in social media\n\t+ Analyzing genomic data to identify disease biomarkers\n\t+ Creating a data-driven strategy for a non-profit organization\n* **Evaluation:** The capstone project is evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\t+ Technical merit and complexity\n\t+ Data quality and relevance\n\t+ Insight generation and interpretation\n\t+ Communication and presentation\n\t+ Impact and potential for real-world application\n* **Industry partnerships:** Yes, UC Berkeley has a strong network of industry partners that provide capstone project opportunities. The program has partnered with companies like Google, Tesla, and Kaiser Permanente, among others. The program also has a dedicated industry relations team that helps facilitate partnerships and project opportunities.\n\nIn all three programs, the capstone project is an excellent opportunity to work on a real-world problem, apply your skills and knowledge, and demonstrate your abilities to potential employers. The programs also provide resources and support to help you find industry partners or clients for your capstone project.",
