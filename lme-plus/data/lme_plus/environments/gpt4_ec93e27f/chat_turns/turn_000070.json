  "content": "After their collaborations with Brian Eno in the 1980s and early 1990s, U2 continued to collaborate with a range of musicians and explore new genres and sounds to evolve their sound. Some notable collaborations include:\n\n1. Daniel Lanois: Like Eno, Lanois is a producer known for his atmospheric style, and he worked with U2 on many of their albums, including The Unforgettable Fire, The Joshua Tree, All That You Can't Leave Behind, and No Line on the Horizon. Lanois helped to bring out the best elements of U2's sound, refining their sound and polishing their songs.\n\n2. Passengers: U2 collaborated with producer and electronic artist Brian Eno once again in the mid-1990s on an album called Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1. The album featured contributions from several other musicians, including Howie B, Luciano Pavarotti, and Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. The collaboration resulted in an experimental, ambient sound that blended together elements of rock, electronica, and classical music.\n\n3. Danger Mouse: U2 worked with producer and songwriter Danger Mouse on their 2014 album Songs of Innocence. The collaboration resulted in a more stripped-back sound that emphasized melody and emotion, while still retaining the band's trademark passion and energy.\n\n4. Lady Gaga: U2 collaborated with Lady Gaga on the song \"Ordinary Love\" for the soundtrack to the Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom film in 2013. The collaboration saw the band incorporating elements of pop and electronic music into their sound, creating a unique hybrid that featured U2's signature stadium rock sound alongside Lady Gaga's pop sensibilities.\n\nOverall, U2's collaborations with other musicians over the years have helped the band to evolve their sound and incorporate new elements into their music, while still retaining their signature style and passion.",
