This helps prevent moisture from accumulating and causing the bread to become soggy.\n2. **Room temperature:** Store the bread at room temperature in an airtight container, such as a bread box, paper bag, or plastic bag with a twist tie. This will keep the bread fresh for 2-3 days.\n3. **Refrigerate:** If you won't be consuming the bread within 3 days, store it in the refrigerator to slow down the staling process. Place the bread in an airtight container or plastic bag and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 5-7 days.\n4. **Freeze:** For longer storage, freeze the bread. Wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place it in a freezer-safe bag. Frozen bread can be stored for up to 3-4 months.
