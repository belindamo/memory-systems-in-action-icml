  "content": "A scented candle can be a wonderful gift, especially if your niece enjoys candles or has a favorite scent. However, it's essential to consider a few things before giving a scented candle to a child:\n\n1. **Age appropriateness**: Candles can be a fire hazard if not supervised properly. If your niece is under 10 years old, it's crucial to ensure she understands the importance of candle safety and has adult supervision when using it.\n2. **Scent preferences**: Make sure the scent you've chosen is appealing to kids. Some scents, like lavender or vanilla, are generally popular among children, while others might be too strong or overwhelming.\n3. **Parental approval**: It's a good idea to check with your niece's parents before giving her a scented candle. They might have concerns or preferences regarding candles in their home.\n\nIf you've considered these factors and still think a scented candle is a good fit, the $20 candle you purchased could be a lovely gift. You could also consider adding a nice touch, like a decorative candle holder or a matching room spray, to make it an even more thoughtful present.\n\nRemember, it's the thought that counts, and if you think your niece will enjoy the candle, she'll likely appreciate the gift.",
