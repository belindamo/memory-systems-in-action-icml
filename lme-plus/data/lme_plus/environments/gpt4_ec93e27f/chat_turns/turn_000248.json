  "content": "With the additional data from the Downtown Farmers Market on May 14th, we can refine our calculation.\n\n**Re-evaluating the average daily sales**\n\nYou sold 10 candles on April 16th and 15 candles on May 14th. Since the May 14th sale was at a bigger event, it's likely that this sale is not representative of your average daily sales. However, we can use this data to get a better sense of your overall sales trend.\n\nLet's calculate the average of these two sales:\n\n(10 candles + 15 candles) \u00f7 2 = 12.5 candles\n\nThis average sale of 12.5 candles is higher than the initial 10 candles from April 16th. However, we should still consider the April 16th sale as a more representative average daily sales figure, since it's a more regular, smaller event.\n\n**Adjusting production based on the bigger event**\n\nTo be cautious, you could adjust your production upward to account for the possibility of more sales at similar bigger events in the future. A simple way to do this is to add a small buffer to your initial calculation.\n\nLet's add 10-20% to the initial production calculation of 240 candles, based on the higher sales at the Downtown Farmers Market:\n\n240 candles \u00d7 1.1 (10% increase) = 264 candles\nor\n240 candles \u00d7 1.2 (20% increase) = 288 candles\n\nThis would give you a new production target of 264 or 288 candles, depending on how much you want to account for the potential increase in sales at bigger events.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nConsidering both sales data points, I would recommend producing around 264-288 candles to restock your inventory. This takes into account your average daily sales, desired inventory level, and the potential for higher sales at bigger events.\n\nKeep in mind that it's always better to have a little extra stock on hand, but not so much that you're overstocked and wasting resources. You can always adjust your production levels as you gather more sales data and refine your understanding of your market.",
