  "content": "It's common to feel like you're just dragging through each day after experiencing a loss, and reminders of the person can make it challenging to move forward. One suggestion may be to try to reframe your thoughts from what you've lost to what you've gained from the experience. For example, you may have gained skills and knowledge that you can apply to future relationships or friendships. Similarly, you might want to set goals for yourself to create new experiences and memories, which can help shift your focus away from the past. Engaging in new hobbies or activities, meeting new people, and practicing self-care techniques like mindfulness, exercise, or meditation can also help. Overall, try to be patient with yourself, take the time you need to grieve, and be open to new experiences and opportunities that can help you move forward in a positive direction.",
