It's amazing that you're open to learning and growing, and that you're finding inspiration from the people around you.\n\nAs a neutral AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can definitely provide you with some resources and recommendations for learning more about gender identity and expression:\n\n1. **GLAAD's Media Reference Guide**: A comprehensive guide to understanding and reporting on gender identity, expression, and sexuality.\n2. **The Trevor Project**: A organization that provides crisis intervention, education, and advocacy for LGBTQ youth, including resources on gender identity and expression.\n3. **Gender Spectrum**: A website that offers education, support, and resources for families, educators, and professionals who work with gender-diverse children and teens.\n4. **Nonbinary Wiki**: A community-driven wiki that provides information and resources on nonbinary identities, genderqueerness, and gender nonconformity.\n5. **Books**: Some recommended reads include \"Gender Outlaw\" by Kate Bornstein, \"Sissy\" by Jacob Tobia, and \"I'm Afraid of Men\" by Vivek Shraya.\n\nRemember, learning about gender identity and expression is an ongoing process, and it's essential to listen to and amplify the voices of people who identify as LGBTQ+, especially those who are gender-nonconforming or nonbinary.\n\nWhat do you think about these resources? Is there anything specific you'd like to learn more about or discuss?",
