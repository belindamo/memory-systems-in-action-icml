Open your phone's calendar or reminder app.\n2. Create a new event or reminder.\n3. Set the reminder to go off at the same time every day (e.g., 6:30 am, 7:00 am, or whenever you want to start your creative session).\n4. Choose a title or label for the reminder, such as \"Morning Creativity Boost\" or \"Drawing Time.\"\n5. Add a brief note or description to the reminder, like \"Spend 30 minutes drawing or writing.\"\n6. Set the reminder to repeat daily or Monday to Friday, depending on your preference.\n\nTo make it even more effective:\n\n* Place your phone across the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn off the alarm. This will help you start your day by getting out of bed, rather than hitting the snooze button.\n* Choose a gentle, soothing alarm tone or a favorite song to wake you up. Avoid harsh or jarring sounds that might make you want to hit the snooze button.\n* Leave your drawing or writing materials in a convenient spot, so you can easily access them as soon as you wake up.\n\n**Tips to help you stick to your morning creativity routine:**\n\n1. **Start small**: Begin with a manageable goal, like 15-20 minutes of creative time. As you get into the habit, you can gradually increase the duration.\n2. **Make it enjoyable**: Choose a creative activity that brings you joy, so you look forward to waking up and doing it.\n3. **Be kind to yourself**: Don't worry if you miss a day or two. Get back on track as soon as possible, and remember that it's a process to develop a new habit.\n4. **Track your progress**: Keep a journal or log to track your progress, note your accomplishments, and reflect on what works for you.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make creativity a consistent part of your daily routine. With time and persistence, you'll find that it becomes an essential part of your morning ritual.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to give it a try?",
