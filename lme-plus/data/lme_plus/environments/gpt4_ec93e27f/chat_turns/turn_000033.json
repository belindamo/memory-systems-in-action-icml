  "content": "Feta cheese has a stronger, saltier flavor than cheddar, so you may want to adjust the amount of garlic powder and parsley to balance out the flavors. Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Garlic powder:**\n\n* Reduce the amount of garlic powder to 1/4 teaspoon or even less, depending on your personal taste. Feta has a strong flavor, and too much garlic might overpower the bread. Start with a smaller amount and add more to taste.\n\n**Parsley:**\n\n* You can keep the same amount of parsley (1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley) or reduce it slightly to 1/3 cup. Feta has a salty, tangy flavor, and the parsley will help balance it out. However, if you prefer a stronger parsley flavor, you can keep the original amount.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Consider adding a pinch of dried oregano (about 1/4 teaspoon) to complement the feta cheese. Oregano and feta are a classic Greek combination that will add depth to your bread.\n* If you're using a strong, salty feta, you might want to reduce the amount of salt in the recipe (from 1 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon or even less). Feta can be quite salty, and you don't want to over-salt the bread.\n\nBy making these adjustments, you'll create a beautiful balance of flavors in your Feta-Zucchini Bread. The feta will add a tangy, salty element, while the parsley and oregano will provide freshness and depth. Enjoy!",
