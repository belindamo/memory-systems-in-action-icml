  "content": "With the additional data from the Downtown Farmers Market on May 14th, we can refine our calculation.\n\n**Re-evaluating the average daily soap sales**\n\nYou sold 8 soaps at the St. Patrick's Day Market in March and 8 soaps at the Downtown Farmers Market on May 14th. Since both sales are equal, we can consider them both representative of your average daily soap sales.\n\nLet's calculate the average of these two sales:\n\n(8 soaps + 8 soaps) \u00f7 2 = 8 soaps\n\nThis average daily soap sales figure remains the same as the initial calculation. However, we can take into account the fact that the Downtown Farmers Market on May 14th is a bigger event, which might indicate a potential increase in sales at similar events.\n\n**Adjusting production based on the bigger event**\n\nTo be cautious, you could adjust your production upward to account for the possibility of more sales at similar bigger events in the future. A simple way to do this is to add a small buffer to your initial calculation.\n\nLet's add 10-20% to the initial production calculation of 134 soaps, based on the higher sales potential at bigger events:\n\n134 soaps \u00d7 1.1 (10% increase) = 147.4 soaps\nor\n134 soaps \u00d7 1.2 (20% increase) = 160.8 soaps\n\nThis would give you a new production target of 147-161 soaps, depending on how much you want to account for the potential increase in sales at bigger events.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nConsidering both sales data points, I would recommend producing around 147-161 soaps to restock your inventory. This takes into account your average daily soap sales, desired inventory level, and the potential for higher sales at bigger events.\n\nAs with the candle production, it's always better to have a little extra stock on hand, but not so much that you're overstocked and wasting resources. You can always adjust your production levels as you gather more sales data and refine your understanding of your market.",
