  "content": "It can definitely be tough to see the positive side of things when you're feeling so down about a past relationship that could have been. One strategy that can help is to try to bring more mindfulness into your life. Mindfulness involves being present in the moment and focusing on the sensations in your body, rather than getting caught up in thoughts about the past or future. You might also try to practice self-compassion by reminding yourself that it's okay to feel sad and that your emotions are valid. Finally, it can be helpful to connect with others who have been through similar experiences so you can share your feelings and get support from people who understand what you're going through. Remember, healing is a process and it's okay to take it one day at a time.",
