Here are some suggestions that would complement the snake plant and the new floor lamp from IKEA:\n\n1. **Woven Basket**: A natural fiber woven basket can add warmth and texture to your reading nook. Use it to store books, magazines, or even the snake plant's pot. Choose a basket with a natural color like wicker, rattan, or jute to complement the plant's greenery.\n2. **Vase or Urn**: A simple, minimalist vase or urn can add a touch of elegance to your reading nook. Fill it with fresh flowers, branches, or greens to bring in some color and fragrance. A white or cream-colored vase will blend nicely with the IKEA lamp and snake plant.\n3. **Wooden Decor**: Wooden decorative items like a wooden wall art, a wooden coaster, or a wooden bookend can add warmth and coziness to your reading nook. Choose a wood tone that complements the lamp's metal or the snake plant's pot.\n4. **Textiles**: Throws, blankets, or pillows in natural fibers like cotton, linen, or wool can add texture and warmth to your reading nook. Choose a subtle pattern or a solid color that complements the snake plant's greenery and the lamp's metal.\n5. **Metal Accents**: Add some metallic accents like a metal bookend, a metal vase, or a metal picture frame to create a sense of balance and harmony. Choose a metal tone that complements the lamp's metal, such as brass, copper, or silver.\n6. **Personal Mementos**: Display personal mementos like family photos, artwork, or collectibles that bring you joy and make the space feel more personalized.\n7. **Nature-Inspired Decor**: Add some nature-inspired decor like a shell, a pebble, or a piece of driftwood to bring the outdoors into your reading nook. This will create a sense of connection to nature and complement the snake plant's natural beauty.\n\nRemember, the key is to keep the decorative items simple, understated, and harmonious with the existing elements in your reading nook. Avoid cluttering the space, and leave some breathing room for your eyes to rest.\n\nWhich of these decorative items resonates with you, or do you have any other ideas in mind?",
