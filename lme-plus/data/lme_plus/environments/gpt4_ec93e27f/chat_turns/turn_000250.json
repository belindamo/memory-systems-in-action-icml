  "content": "To calculate how many soaps to make, we'll need to know a few things about your soap sales:\n\n1. **Average daily soap sales**: How many soaps do you typically sell in a day? If you have sales data from the same events or period as the candle sales, that would be ideal.\n2. **Soap price**: How much do you sell each soap for?\n3. **Desired soap inventory level**: How many soaps do you want to keep in stock?\n4. **Lead time**: How long does it take you to restock soaps?\n\nIf you have the soap sales data from the same events as the candle sales, we can use that. If not, we can try to estimate based on the candle sales and the relative popularity of your soaps compared to candles.\n\nLet's assume you have some soap sales data. Please provide the following information:\n\n* Average daily soap sales (or total soap sales from a specific event)\n* Soap price\n* Desired soap inventory level\n* Lead time to restock soaps\n\nI'll help you calculate how many soaps to make to restock your inventory.",
