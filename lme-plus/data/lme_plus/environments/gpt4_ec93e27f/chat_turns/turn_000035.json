Onions pair well with both feta and zucchini, so it's a great addition to the bread.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when adding diced onions to the dough:\n\n**Cook the onions first:**\n\n* Before adding the diced onions to the dough, saut\u00e9 them in a little bit of oil until they're translucent and caramelized. This will bring out their natural sweetness and add a richer flavor to the bread.\n\n**Use a moderate amount:**\n\n* Start with a moderate amount of diced onions, about 1/2 cup or 1/4 cup finely chopped. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess onion flavor from the dough.\n\n**Balance the flavors:**\n\n* Since feta has a strong flavor, you might want to reduce the amount of garlic powder or omit it altogether to avoid overpowering the bread. The caramelized onions will add a sweet, savory flavor that will balance out the tanginess of the feta.\n\n**Consider the type of onion:**\n\n* Use a sweet onion like Vidalia or Maui for a milder flavor, or a red onion for a slightly sweeter, more robust flavor. Avoid using yellow onions, as they can be too pungent and overpower the other ingredients.\n\nBy adding caramelized onions to your Feta-Zucchini Bread, you'll create a rich, savory bread with a complex flavor profile. The onions will complement the tangy feta, the earthy zucchini, and the fresh parsley, resulting in a delicious, flavorful bread that's perfect for snacking or serving alongside your favorite soups or salads.",
