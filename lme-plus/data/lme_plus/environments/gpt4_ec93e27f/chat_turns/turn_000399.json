  "content": "I don't have personal preferences, but i can provide some general advice. using eq during recording sessions and during mixing sessions serve different purposes and affect the sound in different ways. during recording, the primary focus is on capturing the best possible sound from the source. using eq during recording should be limited to fixing any immediate problems, such as reducing unwanted background noise or taming harsh frequencies, if possible. if you can get a good sound from the source, you'll have more options during mixing. during mixing, eq is used to make small adjustments to individual tracks or the overall mix to enhance the sound and create a cohesive mix. you may need to use eq to address issues that were not apparent during recording or to make stylistic choices. it's important to keep in mind that using eq during mixing cannot fully fix problems that were not addressed during recording. it's always better to get a good sound from the source whenever possible, and use eq sparingly during recording to fix any immediate issues. this will give you more flexibility during mixing to make small adjustments without hurting the overall sound of the recording. in general, it's best to use careful eq adjustments during mixing to enhance the sound and make the mix sound more polished.",
