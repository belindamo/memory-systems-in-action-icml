  "content": "Yes, that's correct. Based on the current scientific understanding of the Big Bang, it is believed that the universe began as an incredibly hot, dense, and small point of space and energy, which then rapidly expanded in a process known as inflation. This expansion is thought to have occurred due to a combination of quantum fluctuations and other natural processes, rather than as a result of any supernatural or divine intervention. While the exact details of how the Big Bang occurred are still a subject of ongoing scientific investigation and debate, there is currently no compelling evidence to suggest that a supernatural cause was involved.",
