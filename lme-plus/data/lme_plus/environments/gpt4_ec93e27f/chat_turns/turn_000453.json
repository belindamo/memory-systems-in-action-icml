  "content": "It's completely understandable to feel stuck in emotional limbo after a relationship ends or never materializes. However, it's important to recognize that there are steps you can take to move forward. One suggestion may be to take some time to reflect on what you learned from the experience and what you're looking for in your future relationships. You may also find it helpful to focus on self-care and activities that bring you joy and a sense of fulfillment. Additionally, speaking with a mental health professional or a trusted friend or family member can provide you with the support and guidance you may need to move forward. Remember, healing and moving forward is a process that takes time, but it is possible.",
