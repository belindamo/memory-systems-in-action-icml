  "content": "I've been doing a mix of both cardio and strength training at the gym. I usually start with 20-30 minutes of cardio, followed by weightlifting exercises that target different muscle groups. I've been trying to increase the intensity and weight I lift over time to continue challenging myself.\n\nSpeaking of challenging myself, I've been thinking about taking up running more seriously. I've had some good experiences with it, like that 30-minute jog around my parents' neighborhood on Sunday morning that covered 0.5 miles. Do you have any tips for a beginner like me who wants to start running more regularly?",
