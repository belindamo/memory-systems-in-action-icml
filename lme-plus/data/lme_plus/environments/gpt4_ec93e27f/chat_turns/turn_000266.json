  "content": "You're welcome! Booking a one-way flight to NYC is a great decision, especially since you're unsure about your return plans. This way, you'll have the flexibility to decide on your return journey later, without being locked into a specific date or flight.\n\nRemember to keep an eye on prices and flight schedules, and be prepared to book your return flight when you're ready. You can also set up price alerts or track flights to get notifications when prices drop or when your preferred flights become available.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, have a great trip to NYC, and I hope your friend has a wonderful birthday celebration!",
