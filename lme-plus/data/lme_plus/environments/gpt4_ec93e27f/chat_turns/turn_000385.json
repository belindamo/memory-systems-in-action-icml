Here's a brief comparison:\n\n* **eBay**:\n\t+ Best for: Rare or collectible items, high-demand brands, or bulk listings.\n\t+ Fees: 8%-12.5% of the sale price, depending on the category and your seller level.\n\t+ Shipping: You're responsible for shipping, which can add to your costs.\n* **Poshmark**:\n\t+ Best for: Gently used, trendy clothing and accessories, especially for a younger audience.\n\t+ Fees: Flat rate of $2.95 for items under $15, and 20% of the sale price for items over $15.\n\t+ Shipping: Poshmark provides pre-paid, pre-addressed shipping labels, which makes it easy to send items.\n\nConsidering you're selling old college t-shirts, Poshmark might be a better fit. It's a more casual, social platform, and the fees are relatively low.
