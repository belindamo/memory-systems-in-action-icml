This can include concepts such as gods, angels, demons, spirits, and other supernatural beings or forces that are often associated with religious or spiritual belief systems.\n\nOn the other hand, the term \"natural\" generally refers to phenomena or entities that can be explained or understood through natural laws and scientific inquiry, and are typically not attributed to any sort of supernatural or divine force. This can include everything from the behavior of subatomic particles to the evolution of species to the functioning of the human brain.\n\nIt's worth noting that these definitions can be somewhat fluid and may vary depending on context or individual perspectives, but I hope that helps provide a broad starting point for our discussion.",
