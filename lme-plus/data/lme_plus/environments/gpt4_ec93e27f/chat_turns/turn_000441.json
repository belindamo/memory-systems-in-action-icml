Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Tailor your approach**: Instead of leading with your TikTok video, start by introducing yourself, your pet-centric Twitter account, and your interest in collaborating with local pet businesses. Explain how you can help them reach a targeted audience, increase their online presence, or create engaging content.\n\n**Highlight the benefits**: Emphasize the benefits of collaborating with you, such as:\n\n* Reaching a local audience interested in pets\n* Creating engaging content that resonates with pet owners\n* Building brand awareness and credibility through social media\n* Potential increase in foot traffic or sales through joint promotions\n\n**Mention your TikTok video strategically**: If the conversation progresses and you've established a connection with the business owner, you can mention your popular TikTok video as an example of your content creation skills and your ability to engage with pet owners. This can help demonstrate your value as a collaborator.\n\nExample:\n\n\"Hi [Business Owner], I'm [Your Name], a local pet enthusiast with a strong online presence on Twitter. I've been creating content around my pet, Luna, and have built a small but engaged audience. I'd love to explore ways we could collaborate on content or promotions to help increase your online visibility and reach local pet owners. As an example, I've had success with a TikTok video of Luna chasing a laser pointer, which has garnered over 1,400 views. I believe we could create similar engaging content together that would benefit both our audiences.\"\n\nBy taking a more collaborative and benefit-focused approach, you're more likely to pique the interest of local pet businesses and start a fruitful conversation.",
