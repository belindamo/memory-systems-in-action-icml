  "content": "Congratulations on your new coffee table! IKEA has a wide range of styles, so I'd love to know more about the specific table you got to give you more tailored recommendations.\n\nCould you please tell me the name of the coffee table you purchased or describe its style, color, and material? For example, is it a modern and sleek design, a rustic wooden piece, or a minimalist Scandinavian-inspired one?\n\nAdditionally, what is the overall aesthetic you're aiming for in your living room? Do you prefer bold and bright, neutral and calming, or a mix of patterns and textures?\n\nWith that information, I can suggest some throw pillow styles that would complement your new coffee table and tie in with your desired living room vibe.",
