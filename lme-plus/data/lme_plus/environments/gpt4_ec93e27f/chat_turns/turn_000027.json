Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Zucchini-Cheddar Bread Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 cups of all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon of salt\n* 1 teaspoon of sugar\n* 1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) of active dry yeast\n* 1 cup of warm water (around 100\u00b0F to 110\u00b0F)\n* 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter, melted\n* 1 cup of grated zucchini (about 1 medium-sized zucchini)\n* 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese (divided)\n* 1/2 cup of chopped fresh parsley\n* 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder\n* 1 egg, beaten (optional for egg wash)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast.\n2. Gradually add the warm water to the dry ingredients and mix until a shaggy dough forms.\n3. Add the melted butter, grated zucchini, 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, parsley, and garlic powder. Mix until the dough comes together in a sticky ball.\n4. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.\n6. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.\n7. Punch down the dough and shape it into a round or oblong loaf. Place the loaf on the prepared baking sheet.\n8. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the loaf.\n9. If desired, brush the egg wash (beaten egg mixed with a little water) over the loaf for a golden glaze.\n10. Bake the bread for 35-40 minutes, or until it's golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n11. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To enhance the cheese flavor, you can add 1-2 tablespoons of grated Parmesan or Romano cheese to the dough.\n* If you want a more pronounced zucchini flavor, you can use 1 1/2 cups of grated zucchini.\n* Consider adding some diced onions, bell peppers, or jalape\u00f1os to the dough for extra flavor.\n* For a more rustic crust, bake the bread for an additional 5-10 minutes.\n\nThat's it! Your Zucchini-Cheddar Bread is ready to be devoured. Enjoy!",
