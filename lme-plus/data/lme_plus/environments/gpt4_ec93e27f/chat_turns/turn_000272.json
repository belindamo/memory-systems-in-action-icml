  "content": "Building a scalable application from the start typically requires more time, resources, and expertise compared to a basic version of the app. As a result, the cost of developing a scalable Uber-like application for iOS, Android, and web platforms with a back-end solution on AWS cloud, with a team of 3-4 developers for a 6-month period, in Canada, could range from $150,000 to $500,000 or more.\n\nPlease note that this is a rough estimate and the actual cost could vary based on the specific requirements and complexity of the project. It is recommended to have a detailed scope of work and requirements from the client to provide a more accurate cost estimate.",
