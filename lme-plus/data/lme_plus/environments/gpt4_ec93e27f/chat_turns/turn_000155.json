  "content": "Ok, I am ok with the combination of quantum fluctuations and other natural processes as part of the cause of the Big Bang, but you also realize then we have to account for the case of these combination of quantum fluctuations and other natural processes. In other words we are indeed talking about the \"First Cause,\" so these things also require a first cause. Therefore, when talking about he origins of the universe we are as discussed talking about the \"something\" that preceded the existence of the universe before all time and space. Thus, even quantum fluctuations and other natural processes would not have existed and cannot be considered the first cause which is what this entire conversation is after; what is the first cause. That is the question. We agreed on \"something,\" but we have yet to define something.",
