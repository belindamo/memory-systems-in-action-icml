  "content": "Totto Ramen in Meguro is an excellent choice! Unfortunately, Totto Ramen is not particularly vegetarian or vegan-friendly. They're known for their rich, pork-based tonkotsu broth, and most of their menu items feature pork or chicken. They don't have any vegan or vegetarian ramen options.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to compromise, you could try asking them to customize your bowl. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **No-pork option:** You can ask them to hold the pork slices (ch\u0101shu) and instead add extra vegetables or boiled egg. This way, you'll still get the rich tonkotsu broth, but without the pork.\n2. **Vegetable-only topping:** You can ask them to add extra vegetables like green onions, bean sprouts, and bok choy to your bowl. This won't make the broth vegetarian, but you'll get a vegetable-heavy topping.\n\nKeep in mind that these customizations might not be possible during peak hours or if the shop is very busy. It's always a good idea to call ahead or ask your server about options before ordering.\n\nIf you're looking for a vegetarian or vegan ramen option, I can recommend some other shops in Tokyo that cater to plant-based diets. Let me know, and I'd be happy to suggest some alternatives!",
