Getting them professionally cleaned can make a big difference in their appearance and longevity.\n\nAnd, oh no, I remember you mentioning your brother borrowing your favorite bomber jacket earlier! I hope he returns it to you soon, and in the same condition it was in when you lent it to him. Losing or damaging a favorite item can be frustrating, especially when it's something with sentimental value.\n\nYou might want to gently remind your brother to return the jacket, and maybe even offer to pick it up from him to ensure it doesn't get lost or misplaced. Fingers crossed it comes back to you soon, and in perfect condition!\n\nIn the meantime, take care of those sneakers and get them looking fresh and clean again. You deserve to enjoy your favorite items, and I'm sure your brother will appreciate the reminder to return your beloved bomber jacket.",
