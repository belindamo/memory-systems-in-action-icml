  "content": "Sure, here's a screenplay for the first part of a sequel to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story:\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT. SPACE - DAY\n\nA Star Destroyer floats in the distance as a small ship, piloted by JYN ERSO, flies towards it.\n\nINT. JYN'S SHIP - DAY\n\nJyn sits in the pilot's seat, staring ahead at the looming Star Destroyer.\n\nJYN: (to herself) This is insane. What am I doing?\n\nSuddenly, the ship shakes as it's hit by a laser blast.\n\nJYN: (into comm) K-2, we've got incoming!\n\nK-2SO, the reprogrammed Imperial droid, responds through the comm.\n\nK-2SO: (through comm) Thank you for informing me of the obvious, Jyn.\n\nJyn steers the ship, dodging laser blasts as she heads towards the Star Destroyer's docking bay.\n\nINT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY\n\nJyn and K-2SO exit the ship, their blasters drawn.\n\nJYN: (to K-2SO) Keep an eye out for any stormtroopers.\n\nK-2SO: (sarcastic) Oh, of course, Jyn. I was planning on just taking a nap instead.\n\nThe two of them move through the Star Destroyer, avoiding detection as they make their way to the ship's control room.\n\nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY\n\nJyn and K-2SO enter the room, taking out the Imperial officers stationed there.\n\nJYN: (into comm) Bodhi, we've taken control of the Star Destroyer.\n\nBODHI ROOK, the former Imperial pilot turned Rebel, responds through the comm.\n\nBODHI: (through comm) Great work, Jyn. We'll start downloading the ship's data banks now.\n\nSuddenly, the door to the control room opens, and a group of stormtroopers enter.\n\nJyn and K-2SO take cover as blaster fire fills the room.\n\nJYN: (to K-2SO) We've got to get out of here.\n\nK-2SO: (determined) I'll cover you. Go!\n\nJyn runs out of the room as K-2SO stays behind, blasting away at the stormtroopers.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nJyn runs down the corridor, ducking behind cover as laser blasts fly past her.\n\nJYN: (into comm) Bodhi, we've got to get out of here now.\n\nBODHI: (through comm) We're almost done. Hold on just a little longer.\n\nJyn hears footsteps behind her and turns to see a group of stormtroopers closing in.\n\nSuddenly, a blaster bolt hits one of the stormtroopers, and CASSIAN ANDOR, the Rebel intelligence officer, steps into view.\n\nCASSIAN: (to Jyn) Come on, we've got to move.\n\nJyn and Cassian fight their way through the stormtroopers, making their way to the docking bay.\n\nINT. DOCKING BAY - DAY\n\nJyn, Cassian, and Bodhi board a small ship as K-2SO covers their escape.\n\nK-2SO: (through comm) I'll meet you back at the fleet. Good luck.\n\nThe ship takes off, narrowly avoiding laser blasts as it exits the Star Destroyer's docking bay.\n\nEXT. SPACE - DAY\n\nThe small ship flies towards a Rebel fleet, with the Star Destroyer exploding in the background.\n\nJyn, Cassian, and Bodhi breathe a sigh of relief as they make their way back to their base.\n\nFADE OUT.",
