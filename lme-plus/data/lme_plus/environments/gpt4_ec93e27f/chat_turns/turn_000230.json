  "content": "Yes, Muchmusic airing concerts and festival coverage reflected a broader trend in the music industry during the 1990s and early 2000s. \n\nOne of the key drivers for this trend was the increasing importance of live music in the industry. As music became more accessible and digitized, artists began relying more on live music as a way to connect with their audiences on a personal level. As a result, live music events like concerts and festivals became increasingly important for promoting music and building fan bases.\n\nAdditionally, the trend also reflected the growing importance of visual media in the music industry. With the rise of music videos and the growing popularity of MTV and VH1 in North America, live event coverage became an important part of music programming. This was especially true for Muchmusic, which positioned itself as a leader in music programming by offering extensive coverage of live events and concerts.\n\nFinally, the trend also reflected the growing influence of music on youth culture. Through live event coverage, Muchmusic was able to tap into a growing audience of young music fans who were interested in not just the music, but the lifestyle and culture that came with it. By showcasing live events and festivals, Muchmusic was able to capture this audience and provide them with an experience that went beyond just listening to music.",
