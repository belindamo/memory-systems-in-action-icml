  "content": "Yes, you can improve soil moisture retention by adding fertilizers that help improve soil structure and water-holding capacity. Organic fertilizers such as compost, manure, and worm castings are excellent choices for improving soil moisture retention because they increase soil porosity and water-holding capacity.\n\nAdditionally, amendments such as peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite can also improve soil structure and water retention. These materials can be mixed into the soil or used as top dressing around the base of the plants.\n\nIt is important to note that over-fertilizing can harm the plants and lead to nutrient imbalances. Therefore, it is recommended to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for application rates and schedule, and to periodically test the soil to determine if additional fertilization is necessary.",
