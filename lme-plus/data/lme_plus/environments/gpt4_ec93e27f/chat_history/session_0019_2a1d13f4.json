Since you currently have 8GB of DDR4 RAM, you can definitely upgrade to a 16GB DDR4 RAM stick.\n\nTo confirm compatibility, I've checked the Lenovo ThinkPad E490's specifications, and it supports DDR4-2400MHz RAM. So, a 16GB DDR4-2400MHz RAM stick should work seamlessly with your laptop.\n\nBefore making the purchase, ensure that the new RAM stick has the following specifications:\n\n* Type: DDR4\n* Speed: 2400MHz\n* Capacity: 16GB\n* Voltage: 1.2V (standard for DDR4 RAM)\n\nYou can purchase a single 16GB RAM stick or opt for a kit that includes two 8GB sticks, depending on your needs and budget.\n\nRemember to follow proper installation procedures when upgrading your RAM to avoid damaging your laptop. If you're not comfortable with the process, consider consulting a professional or Lenovo's support resources.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any further questions or concerns!"
