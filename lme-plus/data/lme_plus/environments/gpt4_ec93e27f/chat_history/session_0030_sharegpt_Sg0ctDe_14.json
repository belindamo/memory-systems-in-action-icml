But one of the most enduring legacies of the Roman Empire lies not in its palaces or temples, but in its roads. For the Romans were not only master builders, but also expert engineers, and their network of roads is a testament to their ingenuity, vision, and skill.\nRecently, archaeologists from the National Museum of the History of Transylvania made a remarkable discovery in the city of Cluj-Napoca in northwest Romania. They unearthed a well-preserved 2,000-year-old Roman road that offers a fascinating glimpse into the past. Cristian Dima, an archaeologist from the National History Museum of Transylvania, stated that they discovered Roman road remnants. These fragments were made of river stones and covered with slabs, sometimes held together with mortar, at a depth of around 80 cm. The road was oriented in a north-south direction and might be connected to the street system of the Roman settlement of Napoca.\nThe discovery of the road is significant not only for its historical value but also for its engineering prowess. The Romans were famous for constructing straight roads with strong bases, curved surfaces to help with water flow, and utilizing a special type of concrete made from volcanic ash and lime.These features allowed for quick and safe travel over long distances, and helped to facilitate trade, commerce, and the movement of armies across the empire.\nRoman roads have a greater meaning beyond their impressive construction. Dima explains that some of the Roman road systems are still intact today. However, in larger cities where there has been development, the roads may have undergone some changes. But, when traveling between localities, the same routes are generally followed. In Transylvania, where there were Habsburg and Austro-Hungarian Empires, a lot of construction work was done, and many of them were modified.In other words, Roman roads have not only endured through the ages but have also played a role in shaping the modern landscape of Europe.\nThe discovery of the Roman road in Cluj-Napoca is not an isolated incident. Archaeologists in the UK have also recently unearthed a hidden 2,000-year-old Roman road that could be of 'global importance.' By mapping newly discovered ancient Roman roads with those that were previously known, scientists can gain a better understanding of movement across the European continent at the peak of the Roman Empire and even after it fell.\nFor instance, a while back, archaeologists in Wales discovered a well-preserved ancient road that offers evidence that Romans moved much deeper into Wales than historians previously thought. \"For some reason, the road had been completely missed, but knowing about its existence will shed new light on Roman\u2019s presence in Britain,\" notes one archaeologist.\nThe legacy of Roman roads is not limited to Europe either. The Roman Empire extended across three continents and left its mark on many different cultures and civilizations. In fact, one of the most famous Roman roads in the world, the Appian Way (Via Appia), was built in Italy over 2,000 years ago and is still in use today.\nBut what makes Roman roads so remarkably enduring? Dima explains, \"The fortitude and longevity of Roman infrastructure like roads and buildings can be attributed to their continual reuse and maintenance, along with the advanced Roman technology used during their construction.\" In essence, the reason why Roman roads have lasted so long is not solely due to their initial construction, but also because they have been repurposed and modified over time.\n\nAnother factor that has contributed to the endurance of Roman roads is their design. The Romans were master engineers and architects, and they put a lot of thought and effort into designing their roads. Roman roads were built to be as straight and level as possible, which made them more efficient for travel and transport. The roads were also constructed with a crown, or a slight upward slope towards the center, which helped to drain rainwater off the surface and prevent erosion.\nIn addition to their design, the Romans also used high-quality materials to construct their roads. They typically used a base layer of large stones or gravel, followed by layers of smaller stones and mortar or concrete. This layering technique helped to distribute weight and prevent cracking and sinking. The Romans also used a variety of materials to surface their roads, including gravel, crushed stone, and even seashells.\nHowever, despite their impressive design and construction, Roman roads were not invincible. Over time, the roads would inevitably develop cracks and potholes, especially in areas with heavy traffic or extreme weather conditions. When this happened, the Romans would send out maintenance crews to repair the damage. These crews were highly skilled and specialized in repairing roads, and they would use a variety of techniques to fix the damage, such as filling in cracks with gravel or clay and repaving sections of the road.\nAs the Roman Empire began to decline, so too did the maintenance of the roads. Without the resources and manpower to keep up with repairs, many of the roads fell into disrepair and were eventually abandoned. However, even in their neglected state, the roads continued to serve a purpose. They were often used as footpaths or for local transport, and many of the stones and materials from the roads were repurposed for other construction projects.\nToday, many of the Roman roads that still exist are popular tourist attractions and historical landmarks. They serve as a tangible reminder of the ingenuity and skill of the ancient Romans and their enduring legacy. Many of the roads have been incorporated into modern transportation networks, and some are still in use today.\nIn conclusion, the enduring legacy of Roman roads is a testament to the ingenuity, skill, and resourcefulness of the ancient Romans. The roads were built to last, with careful consideration given to their design, materials, and maintenance. Although many of the roads have fallen into disrepair over time, they continue to serve as a reminder of the lasting impact of Roman civilization on the world."
