      "content": "Totto Ramen in Meguro is an excellent choice! Unfortunately, Totto Ramen is not particularly vegetarian or vegan-friendly. They're known for their rich, pork-based tonkotsu broth, and most of their menu items feature pork or chicken. They don't have any vegan or vegetarian ramen options.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to compromise, you could try asking them to customize your bowl. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **No-pork option:** You can ask them to hold the pork slices (ch\u0101shu) and instead add extra vegetables or boiled egg. This way, you'll still get the rich tonkotsu broth, but without the pork.\n2. **Vegetable-only topping:** You can ask them to add extra vegetables like green onions, bean sprouts, and bok choy to your bowl. This won't make the broth vegetarian, but you'll get a vegetable-heavy topping.\n\nKeep in mind that these customizations might not be possible during peak hours or if the shop is very busy. It's always a good idea to call ahead or ask your server about options before ordering.\n\nIf you're looking for a vegetarian or vegan ramen option, I can recommend some other shops in Tokyo that cater to plant-based diets. Let me know, and I'd be happy to suggest some alternatives!"

They're known for their rich, savory tonkotsu broth, but they also offer some vegetarian and vegan options.\n\nRamen Nagi has a few options that can be modified to suit vegetarian or vegan diets:\n\n1. **Vegetable Ramen:** They offer a Vegetable Ramen bowl with a light, clear vegetable broth, topped with a variety of vegetables like bok choy, green onions, and bean sprouts. This option is vegetarian, but not vegan, as it contains egg noodles.\n2. **Vegan Ramen ( seasonal):** Ramen Nagi occasionally offers a limited-time vegan ramen option, usually during certain seasons or promotions. This bowl features a vegan broth made with plant-based ingredients and is topped with vegan-friendly ingredients like tofu and vegetables. Be sure to check their website or social media for availability.\n3. **Customization:** You can also ask your server to customize your bowl by holding the pork slices (ch\u0101shu) and adding extra vegetables. They might be able to accommodate other requests, like using a different broth or noodle type.\n\nKeep in mind that Ramen Nagi's menu and options may change, so it's always a good idea to check their website or call ahead to confirm their current offerings.\n\nIf you're looking for more vegan or vegetarian ramen options in Tokyo, I can definitely provide some recommendations. There are some amazing shops that cater specifically to plant-based diets!"

Make sure to purchase it before your trip, as it's not available for purchase in Japan.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!"
