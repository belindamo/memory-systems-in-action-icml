Here are some tips to help you adjust your driving style to the new suspension setup:\n\n**1. Start with a baseline:** Begin with a conservative driving style, similar to how you drove your car before the suspension upgrade. This will give you a baseline to compare to as you make adjustments.\n\n**2. Focus on body control:** Pay attention to how your car's body responds to corners, bumps, and transitions. Note how it pitches, rolls, and settles. This will help you identify any areas where the new suspension is affecting the car's behavior.\n\n**3. Brake and turn-in smoothly:** With a new suspension, your car's braking and turn-in characteristics may have changed. Focus on smooth, gradual brake application and turn-in to avoid upsetting the car.\n\n**4. Explore the limits gradually:** As you gain confidence, gradually push the limits of your car's grip and handling. Start with small increments of speed and braking, and gradually increase them as you become more comfortable.\n\n**5. Listen to your car:** Pay attention to the feedback from your car, including the sounds, vibrations, and sensations. If the car is telling you it's not happy with your driving style, adjust accordingly.\n\n**6. Experiment with different lines and braking points:** Try different lines through corners and experiment with braking points to see how the new suspension responds. This will help you find the optimal approach for your car.\n\n**7. Take notes and review:** Take notes during and after your track day, including observations about your car's behavior, your driving style, and any changes you made. Review your notes to identify areas for improvement.\n\n**8. Seek feedback from instructors or experienced drivers:** If possible, work with an instructor or an experienced driver who can provide feedback on your driving style and offer suggestions for improvement.\n\n**9. Be patient and persistent:** Adjusting to a new suspension setup takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged if you don't immediately see improvements. Keep working at it, and you'll eventually find the sweet spot.\n\n**10. Have fun:** Most importantly, remember to have fun and enjoy the experience! A new suspension setup can be a game-changer, and exploring its capabilities can be a thrilling experience.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well-prepared to get the most out of your car's new suspension setup at VIR on April 24th. Have a great time on track!",
