You can also check their social media profiles, like Facebook or Instagram, for contact information.\n3. **Review Sites**: Websites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google Reviews often have contact information for businesses, including phone numbers and addresses.\n4. **Phone Directories**: Online phone directories like Whitepages or Yellow Pages can help you find contact information for local businesses.\n5. **Community Boards**: Check community boards at local coffee shops, libraries, or bookstores for flyers or posters advertising venues that can be rented for events.\n6. **Word of Mouth**: Ask friends, family, or colleagues if they know of any good venues for a meetup.
