I'm happy to help.\n\nFirst, kudos on investing in a slim RFID-blocking wallet \u2013 that's a great start to streamlining your belongings. Now, let's dive into some tips to help you optimize your bag's space:\n\n1. **Purge and categorize**: Take everything out of your bag and sort items into categories (e.g., electronics, papers, personal care, etc.). Be ruthless \u2013 if you haven't used something in a while, consider leaving it behind or storing it elsewhere.\n2. **Assign a home**: Designate a specific spot in your bag for each category or item. This will help you maintain organization and make it easier to find what you need quickly.\n3. **Use compartments and pockets**: Utilize your bag's built-in pockets and compartments to keep items separated and organized. Consider adding additional pouches or organizers if your bag lacks these features.\n4. **Pack multipurpose items**: Choose items that serve multiple purposes, like a phone case with a built-in wallet or a portable charger with a cable storage compartment.\n5. **Roll clothing and accessories**: To save space, roll your clothes, scarves, and other accessories instead of folding them. This helps reduce wrinkles and allows you to pack more items in a smaller space.\n6. **Utilize the \"dead space\"**: Make the most of the empty areas in your bag, like the space between the laptop compartment and the bag's walls. Use small pouches or packing cubes to fill these gaps and store small items like cables, earbuds, or a portable power bank.\n7. **Keep frequently used items accessible**: Place your most frequently used items, like your wallet, phone, and keys, in easy-to-reach locations to save time and reduce clutter.\n8. **Consider a bag with a built-in organizer**: If you're in the market for a new bag, look for one with built-in organizers, like a laptop sleeve, phone pocket, or key hook. These features can help keep your belongings organized and make the most of your bag's space.\n9. **Pack a \" essentials-only\" kit**: Create a small kit with essentials like a phone charger, earbuds, and a portable power bank. This will help you avoid overpacking and ensure you always have the most important items with you.\n10. **Maintain your bag's organization**: Set aside time each week to tidy up your bag and remove any items you no longer need. This will help prevent clutter from building up again.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to optimize your bag's space, reduce clutter, and enjoy a more organized and stress-free daily routine.\n\nHow's your bag organization journey going so far? Do you have any specific questions or areas you'd like more guidance on?",
