  "content": "The margin of error is the amount of uncertainty in a poll's results. It is a measure of how closely the poll's results are likely to reflect the opinions of the entire population being studied. \n\nFor example, if a poll has a margin of error of +/- 3%, it means that if the same poll were conducted multiple times with different samples from the same population, the results would be expected to vary by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction.\n\nA larger margin of error means that the poll's results are less reliable, as they are more likely to be influenced by chance or sampling error. On the other hand, a smaller margin of error indicates a more accurate poll, but it also means that the sample size was likely larger, or the responses more uniform.\n\nIn summary, a margin of error affects the accuracy of poll results by indicating the amount of uncertainty in the data and how closely they are likely to reflect the views of the population being studied.",
