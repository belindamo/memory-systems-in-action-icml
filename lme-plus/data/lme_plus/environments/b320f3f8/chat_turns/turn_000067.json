Including those ticket stubs and brochures will definitely make your journal more personal and special.\n\nI totally understand about getting used to being back home after a trip. It can take some time to adjust to your daily routine again, especially when you've had such an amazing experience abroad. But it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your trip and preserve your memories in a journal.\n\nRemember, your journal is a personal reflection of your experiences, so don't worry too much about making it perfect. The imperfections and mistakes are all part of the process, and they'll make your journal even more unique and special.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need any further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have fun working on your journal and reliving your amazing experiences in Japan!",
