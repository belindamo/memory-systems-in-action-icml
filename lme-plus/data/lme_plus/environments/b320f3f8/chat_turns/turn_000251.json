  "content": "Sure, here's an example of how two players could both flop quads in Texas Hold'em:\n\nPlayer 1: AhAc (pocket aces)\nPlayer 2: ThTs (pocket tens)\nFlop: AcTsTs (ace of clubs, ten of spades, ten of hearts)\n\nIn this example, both players have been dealt a pocket pair, and the flop contains two of the remaining aces and two of the remaining tens. This means that both players have flopped quads, with player 1 having four aces (including the ace of hearts in their hand) and player 2 having four tens (including the ten of spades in their hand).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the probability of both players flopping quads is incredibly low, but it is still technically possible.",
