They'll not only purify the air but also add a touch of greenery to the room. For other ideas, what about some minimalist wall art or a few framed photos? Something simple and understated to complement the beige walls and white furniture. Or maybe a small vase or decorative bowl to add some visual interest to your nightstand or desk?\"",
