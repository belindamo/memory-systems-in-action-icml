That daily habit will make a huge difference in the long run.\n\nNow, let's tackle those kitchen cabinets! Here are some tips to help you organize them:\n\n1. **Purge and declutter**: Start by removing everything from your cabinets and sorting items into categories (e.g., baking supplies, cookware, dinnerware, etc.). Get rid of anything broken, expired, or no longer used.\n2. **Categorize and group**: Once you've purged your items, group similar items together (e.g., all spices, all coffee-related items, etc.). This will make it easier to find what you need when you need it.\n3. **Assign a home**: Designate a specific cabinet or shelf for each group of items. This will help maintain order and make it easier to put things back where they belong.\n4. **Use vertical space**: Maximize your cabinet's vertical space by using stackable containers, baskets, or shelves. This will help keep items off the countertops and make the most of your cabinet's storage capacity.\n5. **Utilize the back of the cabinet door**: Take advantage of the often-wasted space on the back of cabinet doors by using adhesive hooks, baskets, or a spice rack to store small items like oils, spices, or utensils.\n6. **Store heavy items below**: Heavy items like pots and pans should be stored in lower cabinets to make them easier to access and to prevent them from falling and causing damage.\n7. **Label and sign**: Label each cabinet and shelf with its contents, and consider adding a sign or a chalkboard label to the outside of the cabinet to make it easy to identify what's inside.\n8. **Store items by frequency of use**: Store your most frequently used items in easy-to-reach locations, and less frequently used items towards the back or on higher shelves.\n9. **Consider a Lazy Susan**: Install a Lazy Susan in a corner cabinet or on a shelf to make it easy to access items that are hard to reach.\n10. **Maintain your space**: Set aside some time each week to maintain your newly organized cabinets. Go through each cabinet, tidy up, and make sure everything is still in its assigned home.\n\nRemember, the key to maintaining an organized kitchen is to create systems that work for you and your cooking style. Experiment with different layouts and storage solutions until you find what works best for you.\n\nAnd kudos on using the water and white vinegar mixture to clean your counters and sink! That's a great natural and eco-friendly cleaning solution.\n\nDo you have any specific cabinet organization challenges or questions I can help with?",
