  "content": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous example. You are correct that there is only one Ace on the flop in that scenario, which means that it would not result in both players having flopped quads.\n\nHere's a corrected example:\n\nPlayer 1: KhKs (pocket kings)\nPlayer 2: QdQc (pocket queens)\nFlop: KdKcQh (king of diamonds, king of clubs, queen of hearts)\n\nIn this example, both players are dealt pocket pairs, and the flop contains two Kings and a Queen. This means that both players have flopped quads, with player 1 having four Kings (including the two in their hand) and player 2 having four Queens (including the one in their hand).\n\nThis scenario is extremely rare, but it is technically possible for both players to flop quads in this way.",
