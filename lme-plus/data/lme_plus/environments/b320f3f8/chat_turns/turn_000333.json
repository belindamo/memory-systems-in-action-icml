I feel so much more relaxed and focused now that everything has its own place.\n\nOoh, I love those ideas! Minimalist wall art or framed photos would be perfect for adding some visual interest to the room without overwhelming the space. And a small vase or decorative bowl is a great idea for adding a pop of color and texture to my nightstand or desk.\n\nI was also thinking about adding some textiles, like throw blankets or pillows, to bring in some extra color and coziness. Do you think that would work well with the beige walls and gray rug? And what kind of colors do you think would complement the space best?\"",
