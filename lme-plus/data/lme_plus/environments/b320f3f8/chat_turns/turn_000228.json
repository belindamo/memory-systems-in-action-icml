It is recommended to plan at least a week to visit the popular attractions, including the Geirangerfjord, Trollstigen, \u00c5lesund, Runde Island, and the Atlanterhavsveien (Atlantic Road). However, if one wants to explore the region more thoroughly and do outdoor activities like hiking and skiing, it is advisable to spend two weeks or more.",
