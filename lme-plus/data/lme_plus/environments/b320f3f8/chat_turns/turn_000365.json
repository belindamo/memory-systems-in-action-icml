It's great that you're thinking about your specific needs and customizing the template to fit your lifestyle.\n\nAdding a section for gym supplies is a fantastic idea. You might also consider including other items like:\n\n* Gym clothes/shoes\n* Lock for your locker\n* Earbuds/headphones\n* Post-workout snacks/towels\n* Gym membership card\n\nAnd, of course, adding your portable power bank to the technology section is a no-brainer! You might also consider including other tech-related items like:\n\n* Phone case and screen protector\n* Laptop sleeve\n* Headphone adapters\n* Extra charging cables\n\nRemember to review your checklist regularly and update it as your needs change. You might find that you need to add or remove items over time.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Consider creating a \"Gym Bag\" or \"Tech Kit\" with all the items you need for those specific activities. This can help you quickly grab everything you need and avoid forgetting essential items.\n\nNow that you have your checklist, how do you plan to use it? Will you keep it digital or print it out and stick it somewhere visible?",
