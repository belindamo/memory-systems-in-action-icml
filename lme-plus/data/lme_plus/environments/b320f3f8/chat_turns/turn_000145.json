This stage marks the formation of the Earth from a molten blob of rock and dust. The Moon was also formed during this time after a massive impact of a Mars-sized body on Earth. The first atmosphere consisted of hydrogen, helium, methane, and ammonia.\n\n2. Archean Eon (4 billion years ago \u2013 2.5 billion years ago)\nDuring the Archean Eon, the Earth began to cool and solidify, and the first life forms, bacteria, and blue-green algae, evolved. The oceans also formed, and the atmosphere began to change, with the development of photosynthetic life.\n\n3. Proterozoic Eon (2.5 billion years ago \u2013 541 million years ago)\nThe Proterozoic Eon saw the rise of eukaryotic cells, which had a nucleus and specialized organelles. Simple plants, animals, and fungi evolved during this time. The atmosphere began to oxygenate, marking the decline of anaerobic bacteria and the rise of aerobic organisms.\n\n4. Paleozoic Era (541 million years ago \u2013 252 million years ago)\nDuring the Paleozoic Era, the supercontinent of Pangaea formed and broke apart, causing massive changes in climate and sea levels. During this time, marine life dominated, with the evolution of trilobites, crinoids, and the first fish, amphibians, and reptiles.\n\n5. Mesozoic Era (252 million years ago \u2013 66 million years ago)\nThe Mesozoic Era saw the rise of the dinosaurs, as well as the evolution of the first mammals and birds. Pangaea began to break apart, and the climate became warmer and more humid. This era also saw the rise of flowering plants, which played a significant role in the evolution of new species.\n\n6. Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago \u2013 present)\nThe Cenozoic Era is the era we are currently in, and it saw the rise of the mammals, including humans. The continents continued to drift apart, and the climate started to cool. During this time, many species became extinct, leading to the rise of new species. Humans evolved during the later part of this era, and they have had a significant impact on the evolution of life on Earth.\n\nEach stage has had a significant impact on the development of life on Earth. For example, the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere during the Proterozoic Eon marked the rise of more complex life forms. The break-up of Pangaea during the Mesozoic Era led to the evolution of new species, and the evolution of humans during the Cenozoic Era has had a profound impact on the environment and other species.",
