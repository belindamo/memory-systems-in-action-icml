  "content": "Your understanding of the passage is correct. However, there are a few minor issues with the wording. Here is a suggested rewording:\n\nWhile altruism is widely considered the highest moral virtue in contemporary society, characterized by selfless concern for the welfare of others and a willingness to sacrifice one's own interests for their benefit, Ayn Rand challenges this view. She argues that altruism is actually immoral and that humans must prioritize their own interests to survive, as nature does not ensure automatic survival. According to Rand, if a doctrine like altruism says that prioritizing one's own interests (selfishness) is wrong, then the mere desire to live becomes immoral. If organisms were to lead an altruistic lifestyle, they would perish. Rand goes so far as to assert that no teaching can be more evil than this.",
