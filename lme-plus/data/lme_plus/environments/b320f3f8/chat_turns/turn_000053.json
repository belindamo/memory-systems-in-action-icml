Am I correct?\n\nThe Rocky Mountains offer some of the best skiing in the country, and the weather can be quite cold and snowy in February. After a fun-filled skiing trip, it's natural to look forward to warmer weather and the beauty of the mountains in the summer.\n\nIf I'm correct, I can provide more specific recommendations for scenic drives and hiking trails in the Rocky Mountains. Let me know if I'm on the right track, or if I need to keep guessing!",
