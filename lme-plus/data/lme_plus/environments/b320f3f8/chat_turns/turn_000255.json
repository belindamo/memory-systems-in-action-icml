You are correct that it is impossible for both players to have quads on the flop in Texas Hold'em, since there are only three cards on the flop and it is not possible for two different players to have four of a kind with the same rank.\n\nI should have been more careful in my earlier responses and provided more accurate information. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I apologize for any confusion or incorrect information I may have provided.",
