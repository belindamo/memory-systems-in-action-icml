You can use any fruit you like, but watermelon, hibiscus, or tamarind are popular choices.\n2. **Iced Tea with Lime:** Brew a pot of tea, add fresh lime juice, and sweeten with sugar or honey to taste. Serve over ice with a sprig of mint for a refreshing twist.\n3. **Fresh Limeade:** Mix freshly squeezed lime juice, water, and sugar to taste. You can also add a splash of sparkling water for some fizz.\n4. **Cerveza (Beer):** If you're feeling festive, a cold beer can be a great match for fajitas. Choose a light, crisp lager or pilsner to cut the richness of the meal.\n5. **Agua de Jamaica (Hibiscus Tea):** A caffeine-free, fruity, and refreshing drink made by steeping dried hibiscus flowers in hot water. Sweeten with sugar to taste and serve over ice.\n6. **Sparkling Water with Lime and Cilantro:** Add a few slices of lime and a sprig of cilantro to a pitcher of sparkling water for a light, refreshing drink.\n\nThese drinks are all easy to make and require minimal ingredients. You can't go wrong with any of them!\n\nIf you want to get a bit fancier, you could try making some **Margaritas** or **Palomas** (a grapefruit-based cocktail).
