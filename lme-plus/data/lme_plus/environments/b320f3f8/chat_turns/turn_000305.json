Add chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.\n2. **Add beans and spices:** Add soaked and drained pinto beans, cumin, chili powder, and salt to the pot. Stir to combine.\n3. **Add broth and simmer:** Add vegetable broth to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1-2 hours or until the beans are tender.\n4. **Mash and refry:** Use an immersion blender or a potato masher to mash the beans. Then, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the mashed beans and cook, stirring constantly, until they're refried and thickened, about 10-15 minutes.\n\n**Store-bought Refried Beans Options:**\n\nIf you're short on time or prefer the convenience, here are some popular store-bought refried bean brands:\n\n1. **Old El Paso:** A classic brand with a mild flavor and creamy texture.\n2. **Rosarita:** A popular brand with a slightly spicy flavor and a smooth consistency.\n3. **La Preferida:** A Mexican brand with a more authentic flavor and a slightly firmer texture.\n\nThese brands are widely available in most supermarkets and are a good substitute for homemade refried beans.\n\nAs for Spanish rice, you can make it from scratch or use a store-bought mix. If you'd like a simple recipe, I can provide one. Otherwise, you can use a mix like **Mahatma** or **Zatarain's**, which are both popular and easy to prepare.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
