This behavior is generally seen as good and moral in society. However, Ayn Rand, an American philosopher, challenges this perspective. She believed that people should prioritize their own interests first because that's the only way they can survive in the world. She thought that nature does not guarantee our survival, so we have to take care of ourselves to live.\n\nRand argued that being completely unselfish and giving everything to others would ultimately harm oneself and harm the society in the long run. She also believed that the idea of selflessness could be manipulated to promote the idea that the individual does not matter, and that the state or collective is more important. This, in turn, could be used to justify the suppression of individual rights and freedoms by dictators. In fact, some historians believe that the Nazi government used altruism to promote their ideology. \n\nWhile Ayn Rand's ideas are controversial, they are significant because they challenge conventional beliefs about selfishness and altruism. By reversing the traditional view of selfishness as negative and altruism as positive, Rand's ideas have made a significant contribution to the ongoing debate about the role of the individual and collective good in society.",
