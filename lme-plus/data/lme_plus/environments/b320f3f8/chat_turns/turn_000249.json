  "content": "It is not impossible for two players to get quads on the flop in Texas Hold'em, but it is extremely rare. It would require both players to have one of the two remaining cards of the same rank as their hole cards, and for all four of those cards to be among the three flop cards dealt.\n\nThe probability of this happening is very low, approximately 0.000073%, or 1 in 1.36 million. Therefore, the chances of two players both flopping quads in a Texas Hold'em game are incredibly low, but still technically possible.",
