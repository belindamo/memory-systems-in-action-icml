IBM Food Trust: IBM Food Trust is a blockchain-based platform that allows food suppliers, retailers, and restaurants to track their products from farm to table. This provides consumers with more information about the source and quality of their food, and helps companies respond more effectively to food safety issues and recalls.\n\n2. BitPesa: BitPesa is a blockchain-based money transfer platform that allows users to send and receive money across borders more quickly and at lower fees than traditional methods. It currently operates in several countries in Africa and is expanding to other regions.\n\n3. Everledger: Everledger is a blockchain platform that allows diamond companies to track the origins and ownership of their diamonds. This helps prevent the trade of conflict diamonds and ensures that companies are sourcing their diamonds ethically and responsibly.\n\n4. Brave Browser: Brave is a blockchain-based web browser that aims to give users greater control over their online privacy and data. It blocks ads and trackers by default and allows users to opt into a rewards program for viewing ads, with payouts in cryptocurrency.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many other companies and industries experimenting with blockchain technology. It's an exciting time for the technology, and we're likely to see even more innovative applications emerge in the coming years!",
