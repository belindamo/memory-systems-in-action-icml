The Anatolian Leopard Project - This project aims to protect the Anatolian leopard, which is one of the most endangered big cats in the world. The project works to improve public awareness, carry out scientific research, and implement conservation measures to save the species from extinction.\n\n2. The Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Monitoring Project - This project focused on identifying ecologically significant areas and determining their status and trends through habitat inventory and monitoring. The government uses this information to make informed decisions about managing these protected areas.\n\n3. The Monitoring of Loggerhead Sea Turtles - Every year, loggerhead sea turtles migrate to the coasts of Turkey to lay their eggs. The monitoring program aims to conserve and protect these turtles by increasing public awareness, identifying their nesting areas, and monitoring illegal activities that threaten their survival.\n\n4. The Anti-Poaching Campaign - This project aims to reduce illegal hunting by conducting awareness-raising activities and increasing the number of patrols in protected areas. The goal is to reduce poaching activities that put endangered species at risk.\n\nI hope this information helps. Please note that these are just a few examples of conservation efforts in Turkey, and there may be more projects that address specific wildlife protection and conservation issues in Lydia or nearby regions.",
