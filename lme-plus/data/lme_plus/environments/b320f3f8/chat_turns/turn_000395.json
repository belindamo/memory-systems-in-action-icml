  "content": "The recommended amount of sealant to use for a 700x25c tire can vary depending on the specific sealant brand and type, as well as personal preference. However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n**Latex-based sealants:**\n\n* Stan's NoTubes Sealant: 30-60ml (1-2 ounces) per tire\n* Orange Seal: 30-60ml (1-2 ounces) per tire\n* Other latex-based sealants: typically 30-60ml (1-2 ounces) per tire\n\n**Non-latex sealants:**\n\n* Slime Tubeless Sealant: 40-80ml (1.4-2.7 ounces) per tire\n* Oko Tubeless Sealant: 40-80ml (1.4-2.7 ounces) per tire\n* Other non-latex sealants: typically 40-80ml (1.4-2.7 ounces) per tire\n\n**Coating-style sealants:**\n\n* Silca's Sil-Coat: 10-20ml (0.3-0.7 ounces) per tire\n* Squirt's Long Lasting Sealant: 10-20ml (0.3-0.7 ounces) per tire\n* Other coating-style sealants: typically 10-20ml (0.3-0.7 ounces) per tire\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, it's better to start with a smaller amount of sealant and add more as needed, rather than overfilling the tire. You can always add more sealant later, but it's harder to remove excess sealant from the tire.\n\nFor a 700x25c tire, a good starting point would be to use 30-40ml (1-1.4 ounces) of sealant. This should provide adequate protection against punctures while minimizing the risk of overfilling the tire.\n\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations for the specific sealant you're using. It's also a good idea to consult with a professional mechanic or experienced tubeless user if you're new to tubeless tires.",
