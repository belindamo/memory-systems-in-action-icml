      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, I agree. Each character brings something different to the play. But I have to say, I feel so sorry for Willy. He's so desperate to succeed and be respected, but it seems like everything falls apart for him."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, Willy Loman is a tragic figure who represents the struggles and limitations of the American Dream. He spends his entire life striving for success and recognition, but ultimately fails to achieve his goals. His desperation and sense of disillusionment are heartbreaking, and his inability to face reality only exacerbates his problems. However, his character also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of placing too much emphasis on material success and failing to appreciate the value of personal relationships and self-awareness. Through Willy's story, the play prompts the audience to reflect on their own values and priorities, and the role that society and culture play in shaping our aspirations."
