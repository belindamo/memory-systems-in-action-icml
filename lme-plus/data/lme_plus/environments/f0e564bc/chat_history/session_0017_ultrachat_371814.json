It is a great way to observe the Japanese bathing culture at its most unadulterated form. 2. Watch a Sumo Wrestling Match: Sumo wrestling is Japan's national sport and watching a sumo match is a unique cultural experience. There are several sumo tournaments held throughout the year, and it is worth checking out. 3. Take a Traditional Japanese Tea Ceremony: Joining a traditional tea ceremony is a chance to experience a unique aspect of Japanese hospitality and culture. 4. Visit a Shinto Shrine: While Tokyo is full of shrines, some of the lesser-known ones provide a quieter and more authentic experience. For instance, the Nezu Shrine is famous for its tranquil atmosphere and has fewer crowds compared to the more popular ones like Meiji Shrine or Sens\u014d-ji. 5. Do a Local Workshop: There are many places in Tokyo where you can try your hands on Japanese crafts like pottery, calligraphy, and kimono making.
