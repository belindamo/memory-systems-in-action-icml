      "content": "Ramen in Roppongi sounds like a great idea!\n\nI'd be happy to help you with that! Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to browse the internet in real-time, so I can't look up the menu online for you. However, I can provide you with some helpful phrases to ask if they have an English menu:\n\n**Phrases to ask if they have an English menu:**\n\n1. **Eigo menu arimasu ka?** () - Do you have an English menu?\n2. **Gaijin menu arimasu ka?** () - Do you have a foreigner menu? (Note: \"Gaijin\" is a polite way to refer to foreigners in Japanese)\n3. **English de menu o kudasai** () - Can I have the menu in English, please?\n\nIf they don't have an English menu, you can also ask:\n\n**Phrases to ask for help with ordering:**\n\n1. **O-nomi o oshiete kudasai** () - Can you tell me about the menu?\n2. **Recommendation arimasu ka?** () - Do you have any recommendations?\n3. **Sumimasen, [point to an item on the menu] kono [item] wa nan desu ka?** () - Excuse me, what is this [item]?\n\nIf all else fails, you can always try using a translation app on your phone or asking a friend who speaks Japanese to help you out.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try checking the ramen shop's website or social media pages (if they have one) to see if they have an English menu posted online. Some restaurants may also have a picture menu or a menu with photos, which can be helpful even if you don't read Japanese.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you enjoy your ramen adventure in Roppongi!"

IKEA**: Yes, IKEA is available in Tokyo! They have several locations, including one in Shibuya and another in Funabashi. IKEA is a great option for affordable, stylish furniture. Just be prepared for crowds and a potentially long commute.\n\n**2. Nitori**: Nitori is a Japanese furniture store with multiple locations throughout Tokyo. They offer a wide range of affordable furniture, including desks, chairs, and shelving units. Their prices are generally lower than IKEA's, and they often have sales.\n\n**3. Second-hand and thrift stores**: Tokyo has a vibrant second-hand culture, and you can find great deals on gently used furniture. Some popular options include:\n\t* **Book Off**: A chain of second-hand stores with multiple locations in Tokyo. They often carry a selection of used furniture.\n\t* **Hard Off**: Similar to Book Off, Hard Off is a chain of second-hand stores with a variety of used furniture.\n\t* **Jupiter**: A thrift store with several locations in Tokyo, Jupiter often carries a selection of used furniture at affordable prices.\n\t* **Local flea markets**: Keep an eye out for local flea markets or \"recycle shops\" in your neighborhood, which may carry used furniture at bargain prices.\n\n**4. Online marketplaces**: Websites like **Mercari**, **Letgo**, and **Facebook Marketplace** often have people selling gently used furniture at discounted prices. Just be sure to exercise caution when purchasing from individuals online.\n\n**5. Discount stores**: Stores like **Daiso** (100-yen store) and **Seria** (300-yen store) may not have a wide selection of furniture, but you can find some basic items like stools, tables, or shelves at very low prices.\n\n**6. Local classifieds**: Check online classifieds like **GaijinPot** or **Tokyo Craigslist** for people selling used furniture in your area.\n\nWhen shopping at these places, keep in mind that sizes and styles may vary, and you might need to assemble the furniture yourself (if you're not comfortable with DIY, consider asking a friend for help).\n\nFor a desk and chair, you can expect to pay around \u00a55,000-\u00a510,000 (around $45-$90 USD) at IKEA or Nitori. Second-hand options might be even cheaper, depending on the condition and quality of the items.\n\nGood luck with your furniture hunt, and I hope you find the perfect pieces for your apartment!"
