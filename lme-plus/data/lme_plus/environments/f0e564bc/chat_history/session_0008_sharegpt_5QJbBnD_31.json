      "content": "The following are more numerical details about the company and the problem:\n\n\"Congestion of the ports\" makes imports more expensive for bulk and general cargo ships.\nCurrently, after waiting at sea for more than eight days, importers pay bulk and general cargo ship owners between $8,000 and $50,000 per day, when average waiting time in 2021 was about 30 to 40 days. In the end, the consumer pays the additional cost outlined above. \nIn addition, the cost of land near the sea shores in the center of the State of Israel is very high.\nA square meter of a residential or tourism/commercial building in high-demand areas for example at Gush Dan the costs are approximately NIS 60,000.\nGMBM got the solution: An Israeli patent with 20 approved claims for exclusivity claims that used containers are filled with a lightweight material that weighs only 200 kilograms per cubic meter which serves as the floatation body for the barges.\nIn what ways does the solution solve the problems?\nNew containers cost 40,000 NIS, but after their service at sea is over, they can be sold for only 8,000 NIS.\nUsing Bat-Kel, which weighs only 200 pounds per cubic meter and contains 75.835 tons, to fill the used container\nThe buoyancy force reaches 56.268 tons per container when the self weight is 4.4 tons and the light weight is 15.16 tons.\nUsing barges 18 meters wide and 100 meters long, we will unload the silos from ships at their moorings in the sea without having to bring them into port.\nAs an example, we will use barges to carry residents, tourists, traders, entertainers, and more for a variety of purposes.\nCompared to a residential barracks on the coast, the price per square meter is less than a third the price. \nWrite me 5 options for a paragraph describing the vision of the company"
