      "content": "The controls in God of War (2018) are indeed different from those in The Last of Us, and it's worth discussing.\n\nGod of War's combat system is more action-oriented and requires a bit more precision and strategy compared to The Last of Us. Here are some key differences:\n\n1. **Camera perspective**: God of War features a third-person, over-the-shoulder camera perspective, similar to The Last of Us. However, the camera is closer to Kratos, and the angle is slightly more dramatic, which can take some getting used to.\n2. **Combat mechanics**: God of War's combat is more fluid and fast-paced, with a greater emphasis on combos, dodging, and parrying. You'll need to time your attacks, dodges, and blocks carefully to take down enemies effectively. In contrast, The Last of Us has a more methodical, cover-based combat system.\n3. **Weapon handling**: Kratos wields the Leviathan Axe, which has a distinct feel compared to Joel's guns in The Last of Us. The axe has a weighty, brutal feel, and you'll need to use it to stun and dispatch enemies. You'll also need to use the axe to solve puzzles and interact with the environment.\n4. **Shield mechanics**: Kratos has a shield that can be used to block attacks, but it's not as straightforward as Joel's cover system. You'll need to time your blocks carefully, and the shield can be shattered if you're not careful.\n5. **Runic abilities**: God of War introduces a variety of runic abilities, which are magical attacks that can be used to deal damage, stun enemies, or create opportunities for combos. These abilities are tied to the square button, and you'll need to experiment with them to find the ones that suit your playstyle.\n6. **Atreus assistance**: Atreus, Kratos' son, is an integral part of the combat system. He can be commanded to attack enemies, distract them, or provide assistance in other ways. This adds a new layer of strategy to combat, as you'll need to coordinate with Atreus to take down tougher enemies.\n\nIt may take some time to adjust to the new combat mechanics, especially if you're coming from The Last of Us. However, the controls are responsive, and the game does an excellent job of introducing new mechanics gradually.\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get started:\n\n* Take your time to learn the combat mechanics, and don't be afraid to die a few times (you will, it's a tough game!).\n* Experiment with different runic abilities and find the ones that work best for you.\n* Use Atreus' assistance to your advantage, especially in tougher fights.\n* Don't be afraid to retreat and regroup when necessary; God of War's combat can be challenging, but it's also forgiving.\n\nOverall, the controls in God of War are well-designed and rewarding once you get the hang of them. With practice, you'll be tearing through Norse gods and monsters in no time!"
