  "content": "I am not capable of predicting the future, but i can tell you that the ideas of augustine and aquinas have been and continue to be a significant influence on catholic doctrine and theology. given the enduring importance of their ideas and the ongoing relevance of the issues they addressed, it seems likely that their teachings will continue to shape catholic thought and practice in the future. of course, the church is always evolving and adapting to new circumstances, so it is difficult to predict exactly how their ideas will be applied in the future. however, the intellectual and spiritual legacy of augustine and aquinas is likely to remain a vital part of the catholic tradition for generations to come.",
