  "content": "Yes, many Neoclassical artists did focus on historical, mythological, or literary subjects, often portraying them in a grand, idealized way, as was common in Classical art. This was in line with the movement's emphasis on reason, order, and an epitomized view of human endeavor. \n\nFor example, Jacques-Louis David created several works that depicted historical or mythological scenes, such as \"Oath of the Horatii,\" \"The Death of Marat,\" and \"The Intervention of the Sabine Women.\" Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres is known for his \"Odalisque\" paintings, which are based on literary themes and portray Orientalist images of concubines. Angelica Kauffman created portraits, historical and mythological scenes, and decorative art inspired by Classical motifs, which aimed to elevate the role of women in art.\n\nIn general, Neoclassical art sought to portray ideal beauty, stark simplicity, and heroism, which was why themes tended to revolve around subjects with a high-minded and elevated cultural or historical pedigree.",
