  "content": "That's great to hear that you're prioritizing your spiritual growth! It's wonderful that you participated in the weekly prayer group at the mosque near your office. I'm happy to help you with recommendations for nearby places to grab lunch.\n\nHowever, I need a bit more information from you. Could you please tell me which local landmarks you're planning to visit this weekend? That way, I can give you more tailored recommendations for lunch spots in the area.\n\nAlso, do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.) that I should take into consideration when making recommendations?",
