  "content": "Yes, the Neoclassical movement had a significant impact on other art forms beyond visual arts. It also influenced music and literature, among others. \n\nIn music, composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Franz Joseph Haydn were inspired by the Classical period and its emphasis on balance, order, and clarity. Their music was characterized by simple and elegant melodic lines and an emphasis on form and structure.\n\nIn literature, the Neoclassical movement coincided with the Age of Enlightenment, which emphasized reason, logic, and individualism. Writers like Voltaire, Jonathan Swift, and Alexander Pope produced works that used Classical motifs and forms, like epic poetry, tragedy, and satire, to explore moral and philosophical themes.\n\nOverall, the Neoclassical movement had a broad cultural impact, influencing not just visual arts but also literature, music, and philosophy. Its emphasis on rationality, order, and classicism helped shape the cultural outlook of the Western world during the 18th and 19th centuries.",
