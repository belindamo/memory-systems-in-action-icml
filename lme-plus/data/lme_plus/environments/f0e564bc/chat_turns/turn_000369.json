For the blog, I was thinking of a tagline that's something like \"Exploring the world, one dish at a time\" or \"A culinary journey through cultures and cuisines\". As for the tone, I want it to be casual and conversational, like I'm talking to friends about food. I don't want it to be too formal or professional, but still informative and helpful. What do you think?",
