  "content": "Yes, Vasco da Gama's biased views did contribute to the negative representation of non-European cultures in Western literature and media. The writings of early Western explorers and colonizers, including Vasco da Gama, often portrayed non-European cultures as primitive and inferior, reinforcing Western notions of cultural superiority.\n\nThese representations continue to be perpetuated in literature and media, which can have damaging effects on the way non-European cultures are perceived and treated. By promoting stereotypes and misconceptions, such representations can contribute to discrimination, prejudice, and racism towards non-European cultures.\n\nIt is essential to recognize and challenge these biases, seeking to promote accurate and respectful representations of all cultures, regardless of their origin. Achieving this is key to promoting greater understanding and acceptance between different cultures, leading to a more inclusive and empathetic world.",
