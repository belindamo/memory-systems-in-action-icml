Here are some questions to consider:\n\n1. What is the project deadline?\n2. What specific tasks need to be completed to meet the deadline?\n3. How much time do you estimate each task will take?\n4. Are there any dependencies between tasks, or can they be worked on independently?\n5. Are there any other commitments or appointments you have scheduled for the week that might impact your availability to work on the project?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your project and tasks, I can help you create a to-do list and suggest a schedule to ensure you're on track to meet the deadline.\n\nAlso, just to confirm, you mentioned you had a team meeting on Tuesday at 2:00 PM, but you didn't specify the date of the meeting. Is the meeting in the past, or is it scheduled for an upcoming Tuesday?",
