  "content": "Thank you for providing the images and details of the stamp!\n\nAfter examining the images and information, I'm pleased to inform you that your stamp appears to be an authentic 1935 Silver Jubilee Stamp.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the verification process:\n\n* **Perforations:** The perforations on your stamp are indeed 13.5, which matches the correct perforation gauge for the 1935 Silver Jubilee Stamp.\n* **Watermark:** The Crown-A watermark is visible on the stamp, which is consistent with the watermark used on this issue.\n* **Gum:** The partially present gum on the back of the stamp is consistent with the original gum used on this issue.\n* **Design and printing:** The design and printing of the stamp match the known characteristics of the 1935 Silver Jubilee Stamp.\n\nConsidering the condition of your stamp, I'd estimate its value as follows:\n\n* **Mint value:** Given the minor creasing on the top right corner and the partially present gum, I'd estimate the mint value of your stamp to be around AU$15-AU$25.\n* **Used value:** If the stamp were postally used, its value would be lower due to the creasing and gum condition. In this case, I'd estimate the used value to be around AU$5-AU$10.\n\nPlease note that these estimates are based on my analysis and may vary depending on the current market demand and the opinions of other experts. If you're considering selling the stamp, I recommend consulting with a reputable stamp dealer or auction house to get a more accurate estimate of its value.\n\nCongratulations on owning an authentic 1935 Silver Jubilee Stamp!",
