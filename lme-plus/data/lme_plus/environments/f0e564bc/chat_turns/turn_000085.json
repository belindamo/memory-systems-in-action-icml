  "content": "I'd be happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time transit data or specific bus route information. I don't know the exact location of the park or the bus routes that stop near it.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you get a list of bus routes that stop near the park:\n\n1. **Transit Agency Website**: Visit the website of your city's public transportation agency (e.g., [www.yourcitytransit.com](http://www.yourcitytransit.com)) and use their trip planner tool or bus route finder to get a list of bus routes that stop near the park. You can enter the park's address or a nearby landmark to get the list of routes.\n2. **Google Maps**: Open Google Maps on your computer or mobile device and enter the park's address or a nearby landmark. Click on the \"Get Directions\" button and select \"Public Transportation\" as the mode of transportation. Google Maps will show you a list of bus routes that stop near the park.\n3. **Transit App**: Download a transit app like Moovit, Transit, or Citymapper that provides real-time transit information for your city. Enter the park's address or a nearby landmark, and the app will show you a list of bus routes that stop near the park.\n4. **Bus Stop Sign**: If you're near the park, you can check the bus stop signs near the park to see the list of bus routes that stop there.\n\nRemember to check the transit agency's website or a transit app for the most up-to-date information on bus routes and schedules.\n\nIf you provide me with more specific information about the park's location or the city you're in, I can try to give you more general guidance or point you in the right direction.",
