  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot provide an opinion on what is \"better\" or what should be done. However, it is important to consider that forcing ideas onto others without appropriately building support and coalitions can lead to resistance and dissent. This can create more obstacles and make it harder to achieve the desired change.\n\nBuilding coalitions and educating the public can be beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows activists to outline the importance of their cause and create a shared understanding around it. It can also help to bring together people who support the cause and enable them to work more effectively towards their goals.\n\nSecondly, education and communication are fundamental to creating a culture where change can occur in a sustainable way. When people are encouraged to reflect and make informed decisions, they become more invested in a cause and feel more responsible for making changes. The process of educating and communicating with others can help foster a sense of responsibility, and enable people to create meaningful change over time.\n\nIn short, building coalitions and educating the public are vital components of creating sustainable change. While it can take time and effort, it is essential to bring about lasting, meaningful transformation for communities or societies in a way that is mindful of the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders involved.",
