  "content": "The teachings of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas continue to influence Catholic doctrine under modern popes in several ways:\n\n1. The theology of grace: Both Augustine and Aquinas developed the theology of grace, which is still a central concept in Catholic theology today. Grace is seen as the gift of God that enables humans to attain salvation and live a life of virtue.\n\n2. Natural law: Aquinas developed the concept of natural law, which is the idea that there are certain moral values and principles that are inherent in nature and can be known through reason. This idea has been influential in Catholic social teaching, particularly in areas such as bioethics and environmental ethics.\n\n3. Theology and philosophy: Both Augustine and Aquinas were theologians and philosophers, and their works continue to be studied by Catholic theologians and philosophers today. Their ideas on topics such as the nature of God, the problem of evil, and the relationship between faith and reason continue to be influential in Catholic intellectual life.\n\n4. Moral theology: Augustine and Aquinas also had a significant impact on Catholic moral theology. Their ideas on topics such as sin, virtue, and the role of the conscience continue to be studied and applied in contemporary Catholic moral theology.\n\nOverall, the teachings of Augustine and Aquinas continue to be an important part of the intellectual and theological tradition of the Catholic Church, and their ideas continue to shape Catholic doctrine under modern popes.",
