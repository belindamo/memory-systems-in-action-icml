I'd be happy to guide you through setting up a project in Todoist based on the outline we created earlier.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to get you started:\n\n**Step 1: Create a New Project**\n\n* Log in to your Todoist account and click on the \"New Project\" button.\n* Name your project, e.g., \"Project Deadline - 3 Weeks\".\n\n**Step 2: Create Sections**\n\n* Click on the \"Add Section\" button to create separate sections for each week.\n* Create three sections: \"Week 1\", \"Week 2\", and \"Week 3\".\n\n**Step 3: Add Tasks**\n\n* Under each section, add tasks based on the outline we created earlier. For example:\n\t+ Week 1:\n\t\t- Research and outline report (Days 1-3)\n\t\t- Write report (Days 4-6)\n\t\t- Prepare for client call (Day 2 or 3)\n\t+ Week 2:\n\t\t- Finalize report (Days 8-9)\n\t\t- Create presentation outline and structure (Days 10-12)\n\t\t- Design and finalize presentation slides (Days 13-14)\n\t+ Week 3:\n\t\t- Finalize presentation (Days 15-16)\n\t\t- Write proposal (Days 17-19)\n\t\t- Review and edit proposal (Days 20-21)\n\n**Step 4: Set Deadlines and Priorities**\n\n* Set deadlines for each task based on the days allocated in the outline.\n* Assign priorities to each task based on their importance and urgency. You can use numbers (1-4) or letters (A-D) to indicate priority levels.\n\n**Step 5: Add Labels and Filters**\n\n* Add labels to each task to categorize them, e.g., \"Report\", \"Presentation\", \"Proposal\", \"Client Call\".\n* Create filters to quickly view tasks by label, priority, or deadline. For example, you can create a filter to show only tasks with a high priority or tasks due today.\n\n**Step 6: Set Reminders and Notifications**\n\n* Set reminders for each task to ensure you stay on track.\n* Configure notifications to receive updates on task deadlines, assignments, or comments.\n\nThat's it! You've set up your project in Todoist based on the outline we created earlier. You can now use Todoist to track your progress, stay organized, and meet your project deadline.\n\nRemember to regularly review and update your tasks, deadlines, and priorities to ensure you're on track to meet your project deadline.\n\nDo you have any questions about setting up your project in Todoist?",
