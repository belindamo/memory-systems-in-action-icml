If you're looking for inspiration, you could try making a Chana Masala-inspired quinoa bowl with roasted butternut squash, chickpeas, and a blend of Indian spices.\n\nChana Masala is a popular North Indian dish made with chickpeas in a rich, flavorful tomato-based sauce. You could adapt this recipe to fit your quinoa bowl by using roasted butternut squash instead of potatoes and adding some aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala.\n\nHere's a rough outline you could follow:\n\n* Roast the butternut squash with some olive oil, salt, and pepper until tender and caramelized.\n* Cook chickpeas with onions, garlic, ginger, and a blend of Indian spices (like cumin, coriander, garam masala, and turmeric) until the flavors are well combined.\n* Add a can of diced tomatoes and some vegetable broth to the chickpea mixture and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly.\n* Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice to taste.\n* Serve the chickpea mixture over a bed of quinoa, topped with roasted butternut squash, chopped fresh cilantro, and a dollop of yogurt or raita (a yogurt and cucumber sauce).\n\nAs for the Indian restaurant your friend recommended, you should definitely give it a try! Indian cuisine is incredibly diverse and varied, and there are so many delicious dishes to explore. You might want to try some popular dishes like Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, or Vegetable Korma. And don't forget to order some naan bread or basmati rice to soak up all the flavorful sauces!\n\nEnjoy your quinoa bowl and your Indian food adventure!",
