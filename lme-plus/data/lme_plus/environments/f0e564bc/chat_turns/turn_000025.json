  "content": "Ramen in Roppongi sounds like a great idea!\n\nI'd be happy to help you with that! Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to browse the internet in real-time, so I can't look up the menu online for you. However, I can provide you with some helpful phrases to ask if they have an English menu:\n\n**Phrases to ask if they have an English menu:**\n\n1. **Eigo menu arimasu ka?** () - Do you have an English menu?\n2. **Gaijin menu arimasu ka?** () - Do you have a foreigner menu? (Note: \"Gaijin\" is a polite way to refer to foreigners in Japanese)\n3. **English de menu o kudasai** () - Can I have the menu in English, please?\n\nIf they don't have an English menu, you can also ask:\n\n**Phrases to ask for help with ordering:**\n\n1. **O-nomi o oshiete kudasai** () - Can you tell me about the menu?\n2. **Recommendation arimasu ka?** () - Do you have any recommendations?\n3. **Sumimasen, [point to an item on the menu] kono [item] wa nan desu ka?** () - Excuse me, what is this [item]?\n\nIf all else fails, you can always try using a translation app on your phone or asking a friend who speaks Japanese to help you out.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try checking the ramen shop's website or social media pages (if they have one) to see if they have an English menu posted online. Some restaurants may also have a picture menu or a menu with photos, which can be helpful even if you don't read Japanese.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you enjoy your ramen adventure in Roppongi!",
