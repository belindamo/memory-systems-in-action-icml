  "content": "I have combination skin that tends to get oily in the summer. My main concerns are acne and hyperpigmentation. I purchased the La Mer Moisturizing Cream, Sunday Riley Power Couple, and Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Peel Body & Face. My current routine is pretty basic - I wash my face morning and night, and then apply moisturizer. I'm not really sure how to incorporate the new products into my routine or if I should be using them morning, night, or both.",
