  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to the personal views or accounts of any human, including Martial. However, many activists face personal attacks and criticism on social media, and their responses can vary depending on their approach to activism and their personal convictions. Here are some possible ways that Martial might respond to harsh and personal attacks on social media:\n\n1. Ignoring the attacks: Some activists choose to ignore personal attacks on social media rather than engage with them. This can be a way to avoid giving the attackers more attention or amplifying their message.\n\n2. Responding publicly: Other activists choose to respond publicly to personal attacks on social media. This can be a way to defend themselves, set the record straight, and show that they are not afraid to speak their mind.\n\n3. Reporting or flagging the attacks: In some cases, activists might choose to report or flag personal attacks on social media, especially if they contain hate speech, threats, or other forms of harassment.\n\n4. Seeking support: Some activists may seek support from friends, family, or their community when dealing with personal attacks on social media. This can be a way of building resilience and coping with the stress of the attacks.\n\nUltimately, the way that Martial responds to personal attacks on social media will depend on his personal approach to activism, his values, and his available resources.",
