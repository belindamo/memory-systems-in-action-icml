  "content": "The Neoclassical movement was a Western art movement that emerged in the mid-18th century and lasted until the early 19th century. It was a reaction against the ornate, elaborate style of the Baroque and Rococo periods and sought to revive the principles and aesthetics of Classical art and culture.\n\nNeoclassicism is characterized by clean lines, minimal ornamentation, and a focus on symmetry and proportion. The movement drew heavily from ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture, seeking to revive the ideals of reason, order, and rationality that were associated with Classical art.\n\nProminent artists associated with Neoclassicism include Jacques-Louis David, who is famously known for his paintings of historical and mythological subjects such as \"The Death of Socrates\" and \"Napoleon Crossing the Alps.\" Other notable artists include Antonio Canova, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and Angelica Kauffman.\n\nNeoclassicism had a significant influence on art, architecture, and design in Europe and America during the 18th and 19th centuries. The movement is credited with helping to revive an interest in Classical culture and aesthetics, which would continue to influence Western art for many years to come.",
