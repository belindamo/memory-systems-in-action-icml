  "content": "In Todoist, you can't set a specific time block for a task, but you can use a workaround to achieve a similar result. Here are a few options:\n\n**Option 1: Use the \"Scheduled\" feature**\n\n* Open the task you want to schedule (e.g., \"Write report\" on Day 4)\n* Click on the three dots at the top right corner of the task and select \"Schedule\"\n* Choose the date and time you want to schedule the task (e.g., Day 4, 9:00 AM)\n* Set the duration of the task (e.g., 3 hours)\n* Click \"Save\"\n\nThis will schedule the task for the specified time and duration, but it won't block that time slot in your calendar. You'll receive a notification at the scheduled time, reminding you to start the task.\n\n**Option 2: Use a calendar integration**\n\n* Integrate Todoist with your Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, or iCal\n* Create a new event in your calendar for the specific time block you want to dedicate to the task (e.g., 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM on Day 4)\n* Add the task name and description to the event title or description\n* Invite yourself to the event (if using Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook)\n\nThis will block the time slot in your calendar, and you'll receive notifications and reminders about the event. You can then use Todoist to track the task's progress and mark it as completed when you're done.\n\n**Option 3: Use a third-party integration**\n\n* Integrate Todoist with a time management tool like Calendly, Schedule Once, or Time Doctor\n* Create a new event in the time management tool for the specific time block you want to dedicate to the task\n* Connect the event to the corresponding task in Todoist\n\nThis will allow you to schedule a specific time block for the task and track your time spent on it. You'll receive notifications and reminders about the event, and the task will be updated in Todoist accordingly.\n\nWhile these options don't allow you to set a specific time block directly in Todoist, they provide workarounds to help you dedicate specific times to your tasks and stay organized.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these options or Todoist in general?",
