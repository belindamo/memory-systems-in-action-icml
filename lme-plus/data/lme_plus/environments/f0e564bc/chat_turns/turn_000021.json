It's always better to have more storage than not enough, especially when it comes to backing up important files.\n\nSorry to hear that your desktop computer has been experiencing issues with the graphics card, leading to frequent bluescreens. That can be frustrating and disruptive to your workflow. Replacing the graphics card should resolve the issue, and it's great that you're planning to take care of it soon.\n\nOrganizing your computer desk is a great idea, too! A cluttered workspace can contribute to a cluttered mind, and it's easier to focus when your surroundings are tidy. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Clear off the surface**: Start by removing everything from your desk and sorting items into categories (e.g., papers to file, items to throw away, items to keep on your desk).\n2. **Designate zones**: Divide your desk into zones for different activities, such as a workspace, a paper tray, and a charging station.\n3. **Use cable management**: Consider using cable ties, cable organizers, or a cable management system to keep your cords and cables tidy.\n4. **Invest in a desk organizer**: Look for a desk organizer or tray to keep frequently used items, like paper clips, pens, or sticky notes, within easy reach.\n5. **Keep it minimal**: Try to keep only the essentials on your desk, and consider storing less frequently used items in a nearby cabinet or drawer.\n\nRemember to also take care of your desktop computer's maintenance, such as cleaning dust from the vents, updating drivers, and running disk cleanups regularly.\n\nHow's your experience been with the bluescreens? Have you tried troubleshooting the issue or running diagnostics to identify the root cause?",
