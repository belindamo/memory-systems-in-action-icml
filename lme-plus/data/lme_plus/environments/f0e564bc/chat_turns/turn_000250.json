  "content": "The project deadline is actually approaching fast, and I think it's around 3 weeks from now. I need to complete a report, make a presentation, and finalize the project proposal. I'm not sure how much time each task will take, but I know I need to work on them simultaneously. As for dependencies, the report is a prerequisite for the presentation, and the proposal needs input from the presentation. I have a conference call with a client on Wednesday at 11:00 AM, and I need to make sure I'm prepared for that.",
