Be open-minded: Try to approach your first session with an open mind and a willingness to explore new techniques and experiences. 2. Set goals: Think about what you hope to achieve through music therapy and write down some specific goals to bring with you to the session. Your therapist can help you develop a treatment plan based on these goals. 3. Bring any necessary materials: Depending on what your therapist has planned for your first session, you may need to bring an instrument or other materials. Make sure you bring everything you need so that you can fully participate in the session. 4. Wear comfortable clothing: You may be moving around and engaging in activities during the session, so wear comfortable clothing that allows for movement. 5. Be prepared to talk: Your music therapist will likely start by asking you some questions about your background, your mental health history, and your goals for therapy. Be prepared to talk about these topics and to answer any other questions that your therapist may have. Remember, your music therapist is there to support you and help you achieve your goals. Try to approach the therapy process with an open mind and a willingness to try new things, and be patient with yourself as you begin the process of healing and growth.",
