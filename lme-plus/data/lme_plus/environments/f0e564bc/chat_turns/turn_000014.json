  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks for the tips. The brand is actually a well-known gaming brand and the reviews are mostly positive. The mouse has a 12,000 DPI optical sensor and customizable buttons, which is what I'm looking for. It's also wireless, which is a plus. But I'll definitely check out other options and read more reviews before making a purchase. By the way, I've been thinking of organizing my computer cables and I'm considering getting a cable management system. Do you have any recommendations?",
