  "content": "Definitely! Here are a few examples of papal encyclicals that reflect the influence of Augustine and Aquinas:\n\n1. Centesimus Annus: In this encyclical, Pope John Paul II draws heavily on the teachings of Aquinas, especially his ideas about natural law, to argue for the importance of a just economic system that respects human dignity, promotes the common good, and operates according to the principle of subsidiarity.\n\n2. Veritatis Splendor: This encyclical, written by Pope John Paul II, draws on the teachings of both Augustine and Aquinas to make the case for objective moral truth and the importance of the conscience in discerning right from wrong. The document emphasizes the role of reason and natural law in moral decision-making, echoing key themes in the writings of Augustine and Aquinas.\n\n3. Caritas in Veritate: In this encyclical, Pope Benedict XVI builds on the themes of Centesimus Annus, drawing heavily on the philosophical and theological tradition of Aquinas to argue for a more just and sustainable global economy. The encyclical emphasizes the importance of the common good, subsidiarity, and solidarity in economic and social structures, echoing key principles in Aquinas' thought.\n\nOverall, the writings of Augustine and Aquinas continue to have an important influence on Catholic social teachings today, as seen in these and other papal encyclicals.",
