  "content": "Yes, music therapists typically have a variety of instruments available for their clients to use during music therapy sessions. These instruments may include percussion instruments like drums and shakers, string instruments like guitar and ukulele, and keyboard instruments like piano and synthesizer. \n\nYour music therapist will work with you to choose the instruments that are most appropriate for your needs and preferences. They may also provide guidance and support as you learn to play new instruments or explore new musical techniques. \n\nIt's important to note that you don't need to have any previous musical experience to benefit from music therapy, and your therapist will help you develop your musical skills at your own pace. So if you enjoy playing the drums and want to incorporate them into your music therapy sessions, your therapist will likely be happy to accommodate your interests and needs.",
