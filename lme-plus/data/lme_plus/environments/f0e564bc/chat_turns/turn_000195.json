  "content": "A blockchain is like a big notebook that lots of people can write in, but nobody can rip pages out or change what's already been written. Think of it like a group project where everyone writes one sentence and passes it on to the next person, and you can never go back and change what you wrote.\n\nFor example, imagine you and your friends start a chain story on a notebook, each one of you add one sentence to the story and then pass it to next person in the circle, at the end you have a story with many sentences from different people and nobody can change what have been written before. That's kind of like a blockchain!\n\nAnother example would be, a block chain is like a digital lego tower, where each block is a lego brick, and they all stack on top of each other in a certain order, you can add new brick at the top but you can never change or remove brick that are already in the tower.",
