  "content": "Wonderful to hear that you're getting into theater! Volunteering as an usher is a great way to get involved and experience the behind-the-scenes of a production.\n\nRegarding the smaller, independent theater downtown, I'd be happy to help you find out about their upcoming shows. However, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to specific theater schedules or information. But I can suggest a few options to help you find out about their upcoming productions:\n\n1. **Check their website or social media**: Look up the theater's website, Facebook page, or other social media platforms to see if they have a schedule of upcoming shows listed.\n2. **Visit their box office or call them**: Stop by the theater or give them a call to ask about their upcoming productions. They should be able to provide you with information on their schedule and any shows they have coming up.\n3. **Sign up for their newsletter or email list**: Many theaters have email newsletters or lists that they use to announce upcoming shows, special events, and promotions. This way, you'll get notified about new productions directly from the source!\n4. **Check local event calendars**: Look for local event calendars or arts and culture websites in your area, which often list upcoming theater productions.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find out about the theater's upcoming shows! Enjoy exploring the world of theater, and I'm sure you'll discover some amazing productions!",
