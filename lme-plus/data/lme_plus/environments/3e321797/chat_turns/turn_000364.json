And wow, it sounds like you're having a blast experimenting with new cooking techniques and tools!\n\nThe Instant Pot is an amazing tool for pressure cooking, and it can greatly reduce cooking time. If you're interested, you can even use it to cook the chicken and vegetables for the stir-fry before stir-frying them. Just be sure to adjust the cooking time and liquid levels accordingly.\n\nThe spiralizer is also a great tool for creating fun and healthy noodle alternatives. You can use it to make zucchini noodles (zoodles) or sweet potato noodles, which would pair nicely with the chicken stir-fry. Just saut\u00e9 the spiralized noodles with some oil, garlic, and ginger before adding the chicken and vegetables.\n\nRemember, the key to a great stir-fry is to cook the ingredients quickly over high heat, so be sure to have all your ingredients prepped and ready to go before you start cooking. And don't hesitate to experiment and adjust the recipe to your taste.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, have fun cooking and enjoy your delicious homemade stir-fry!",
