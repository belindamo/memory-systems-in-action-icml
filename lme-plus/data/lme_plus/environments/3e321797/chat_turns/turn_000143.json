Here's how you can set up reminders for your morning exercise routine and schedule your habits around your 6:30 am wake-up time:\n\n**Reminders:**\n\n1. **In-app reminders**: Habitica allows you to set reminders for your habits.

For your morning exercise routine, you can set a reminder for 6:45 am, for example.\n2. **Email reminders**: You can also set up email reminders for your habits. Habitica will send you an email at the designated time to remind you to complete your habit.\n3. **Mobile notifications**: If you have the Habitica mobile app (available for iOS and Android), you can enable push notifications to remind you of your habits.\n\n**Scheduling habits around your wake-up time:**\n\n1. **Set your wake-up time**: In your Habitica settings, you can set your wake-up time to 6:30 am. This will help Habitica understand your daily routine and schedule your habits accordingly.\n2. **Schedule habits**: When creating a habit, you can choose the specific time of day you want to perform it. For your morning exercise routine, you can schedule it for 6:45 am, immediately after waking up.\n3. **Prioritize habits**: You can also prioritize your habits, so that the most important ones (like your morning exercise routine) are displayed at the top of your task list.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Be consistent**: Try to perform your habits at the same time every day, so it becomes a consistent part of your routine.\n2. **Leave some buffer time**: Don't schedule your habits too close to your wake-up time.
