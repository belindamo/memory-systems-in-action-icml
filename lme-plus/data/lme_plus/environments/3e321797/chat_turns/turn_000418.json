Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Sahara**: A family-owned restaurant serving authentic Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine. Their falafel and shawarma are highly praised, and their tabbouleh is made fresh daily.\n2. **Mama's Kitchen**: A cozy, family-friendly spot with a wide variety of Middle Eastern dishes, including kebabs, gyros, and vegetarian options. Their falafel is crispy and flavorful, and their baklava is a must-try for dessert.\n3. **Caspian Grill**: A modern Middle Eastern restaurant with a focus on grilled meats and fresh ingredients. Their shawarma is made with tender, marinated lamb, and their tabbouleh is a refreshing side dish.\n\nAll three restaurants have great reviews and are well-loved by the local community. If you're looking for a more casual, quick bite, there's also a popular Middle Eastern food truck that parks in the city center. They serve amazing falafel and shawarma wraps, and their prices are very reasonable.\n\nI hope you enjoy exploring the Middle Eastern culinary scene in the city!",
