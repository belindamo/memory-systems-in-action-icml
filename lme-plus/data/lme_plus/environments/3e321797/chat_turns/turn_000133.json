  "content": "I can provide some general information, but for a more accurate estimate, it's best to contact a Toyota dealership or a trusted repair shop that specializes in Toyotas.\n\n**Repair Cost Estimate:**\n\nThe cost to repair a malfunctioning rearview camera on a Toyota 4Runner can vary depending on the cause of the issue, the extent of the damage, and the labor costs of the repair shop. Here are some possible scenarios:\n\n* Cleaning or adjusting the camera: $50-$100\n* Replacing the camera lens or housing: $100-$300\n* Replacing the entire rearview camera system: $500-$1,000 or more\n* Diagnostic fees: $50-$150 (if the issue is complex or requires extensive troubleshooting)\n\n**Same-Day Repair:**\n\nThe likelihood of same-day repair depends on several factors:\n\n* Availability of replacement parts: If the repair requires a new camera or components, the shop might need to order the parts, which could take a few days.\n* Complexity of the issue: If the problem is straightforward, the repair might be completed quickly. However, if the issue is more complex, it may require more time and potentially overnight diagnostics.\n* Shop's workload and schedule: The repair shop's schedule and workload can impact their ability to complete the repair on the same day.\n\nIt's best to contact a Toyota dealership or repair shop ahead of time to schedule an appointment and ask about their availability and estimated repair time. They can assess the issue and provide a more accurate estimate of the repair cost and timeframe.\n\nKeep in mind that some repair shops might offer loaner vehicles or shuttle services, so be sure to ask about these options when you schedule your appointment.",
