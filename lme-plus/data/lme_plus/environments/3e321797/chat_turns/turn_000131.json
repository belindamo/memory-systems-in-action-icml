You mentioned earlier that you have a silver Honda Civic EX-L, but now you're mentioning a black Toyota 4Runner? \n\nIf you have a Toyota 4Runner with a malfunctioning rearview camera, it's best to schedule a separate appointment with a Toyota dealership or a trusted repair shop that specializes in Toyotas. They'll be able to diagnose and repair the issue with the rearview camera.\n\nSince the 4Runner is a different make and model, the service requirements and procedures might differ from those for your Honda Civic. It's essential to have the 4Runner serviced by a technician familiar with Toyota vehicles to ensure the repair is done correctly.\n\nWhen you schedule the appointment, be sure to provide details about the issue you're experiencing with the rearview camera, such as:\n\n* When the problem started\n* How often it occurs\n* Any error messages or symptoms you've noticed\n* Any recent maintenance or repairs performed on the vehicle\n\nThis information will help the technician diagnose the issue more efficiently and provide an accurate estimate for the repair.\n\nRemember to schedule a separate appointment for the 4Runner, as it's a different vehicle from your Honda Civic.",
