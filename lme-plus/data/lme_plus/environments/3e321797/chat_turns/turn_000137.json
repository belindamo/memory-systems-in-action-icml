  "content": "Another great question! Yes, it's an excellent idea to have the belts and hoses inspected while the 4Runner is in for the rearview camera repair. In fact, it's a good idea to have them inspected regularly as part of routine maintenance.\n\n**Why inspect belts and hoses?**\n\nBelts and hoses are critical components of your 4Runner's engine and cooling system. If they fail, it can lead to costly repairs, engine damage, or even leave you stranded on the side of the road. Here's what can happen if you neglect belts and hoses:\n\n* Broken belts: Can cause engine overheating, damage to the engine, and costly repairs.\n* Cracked or brittle hoses: Can lead to coolant leaks, engine overheating, and damage to the engine and surrounding components.\n\n**What's involved in the inspection?**\n\nDuring the inspection, the technician will:\n\n* Visually inspect the belts for signs of wear, cracks, or damage.\n* Check the belt tension and adjust it if necessary.\n* Inspect the hoses for signs of wear, cracks, or damage.\n* Check the hose connections and clamps for tightness and corrosion.\n\n**When to replace belts and hoses:**\n\nThe recommended replacement interval for belts and hoses varies depending on the type, age, and condition of the components. As a general rule:\n\n* Serpentine belts: Typically replaced every 50,000 to 90,000 miles.\n* Timing belts: Typically replaced at the recommended interval specified in your owner's manual (usually between 60,000 to 105,000 miles).\n* Hoses: Typically replaced every 50,000 to 100,000 miles or when signs of wear or damage are present.\n\n**Ask the repair shop:**\n\nWhen you schedule the appointment for the rearview camera repair, let them know you'd like them to inspect the belts and hoses as well. They can assess the condition of these components and recommend replacement if necessary.\n\nThe cost of replacing belts and hoses varies depending on the type and quality of the components. However, it's usually a relatively affordable repair compared to the cost of repairing engine damage caused by a failed belt or hose.\n\nRemember to ask the repair shop to show you the condition of the belts and hoses and explain why they need to be replaced. This will help you understand the importance of regular inspections and maintenance.",
