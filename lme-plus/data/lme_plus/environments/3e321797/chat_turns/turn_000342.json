Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Start with a theme or story**: Before designing your page, think about the story you want to tell. What's the theme of your page? Is it a specific day, event, or memory from your NYC trip? Having a clear theme will help you decide on the layout and design elements.\n2. **Choose a color scheme**: Select a color scheme that fits your theme and complements your memorabilia. You can use colors from your photos, brochures, or other design elements to create a cohesive look.\n3. **Select a background**: Choose a background that complements your color scheme and theme. You can use patterned paper, cardstock, or even a photo as your background.\n4. **Create a focal point**: Identify the most important element on your page, such as a special photo or a meaningful piece of memorabilia. Use this element as your focal point and design the rest of the page around it.\n5. **Balance your design**: Balance your design by using visual elements like texture, shape, and size. Mix and match different textures, shapes, and sizes to create visual interest.\n6. **Use a grid or template**: If you're new to scrapbooking, consider using a grid or template to help you design your page. This will give you a structure to work with and ensure your elements are balanced and proportionate.\n7. **Leave white space**: Don't be afraid to leave some white space on your page. This will help create a clean and uncluttered design and draw attention to your focal point.\n8. **Embellish with journaling**: Journaling is an essential part of scrapbooking. Use it to tell the story behind your memorabilia and add context to your page.\n9. **Experiment and play**: Don't be afraid to try out different layouts and designs. Move elements around, swap out backgrounds, and experiment with different embellishments until you find a design that feels right.\n10. **Keep it simple**: Remember, the focus of your scrapbook should be on the memories and stories, not on the design itself. Keep your design simple, yet effective, and let your memorabilia shine.\n\nFor your NYC trip scrapbook, you might consider creating a layout that features:\n\n* A focal point, such as a large photo or a special piece of memorabilia\n* A background that complements the colors and theme of your trip\n* A mix of textures, such as paper, cardstock, and fabric\n* A simple, yet effective, journaling style that tells the story of your trip\n* A few well-placed embellishments, such as stickers, die-cuts, or washi tape, to add visual interest\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a beautiful and meaningful page layout that showcases your NYC memorabilia and tells the story of your trip.",
