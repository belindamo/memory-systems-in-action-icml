  "content": "No, storing potatoes in the refrigerator is not recommended. The cold temperature of the refrigerator can convert the potato starch into sugar, which can adversely affect the taste and texture of the potatoes. Moreover, the high humidity inside the refrigerator can lead to sprouting and spoilage of potatoes. The best way to store potatoes is to keep them in a cool, dry, and dark place with good ventilation, such as a pantry or a cellar.",
