Getting quotes from multiple sources and comparing them can help you find the best deal for your needs and budget.\n\nIt's also smart to consider a local body shop, especially if you've heard good things about them. They may be able to offer more personalized service and a more competitive price than a dealership.\n\nRemember to ask the body shop about their experience with your vehicle's make and model, their warranty or guarantee policy, and their process for repairing dents. Additionally, ask to see examples of their work and check online reviews to get a sense of their reputation.\n\nWhen you get the quotes, make sure to compare apples to apples. Check what's included in each quote, such as the type of materials used, the estimated time to complete the repair, and any additional services or fees.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with getting your quotes, and I hope you're able to get your car looking like new again!\n\n(And don't forget to send Mike the bill!)",
