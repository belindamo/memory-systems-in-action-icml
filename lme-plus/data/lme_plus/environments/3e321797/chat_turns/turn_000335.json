By the way, I was thinking about my cross-stitch project and I realized I started it on a Saturday morning, and I remember it was February 18th. I'd like to make good progress on it this week, so maybe I can allocate a bit more time to it. Can you suggest some ways to stay motivated and focused while working on my projects?",
