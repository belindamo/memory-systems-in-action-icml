  "content": "It's a good idea to have the rearview camera checked during your 5,000-mile service, especially since it's a safety feature. Since the camera is an electronic component, it's not typically part of the standard 5,000-mile service, but it's a good opportunity to have it inspected while the technician is already working on your vehicle.\n\nYou can ask the service advisor or technician to perform a quick inspection of the rearview camera as an add-on to your 5,000-mile service. They can check:\n\n1. Camera lens cleanliness: Make sure the lens is free of dirt, dust, or debris that might obstruct the camera's view.\n2. Image quality: Ensure the camera is providing a clear, distortion-free image on the display screen.\n3. Mounting and alignment: Verify that the camera is securely mounted and properly aligned to provide an accurate view behind the vehicle.\n\nIf the technician finds any issues, they can perform a cleaning or adjustment on the spot. If the problem is more serious, they might recommend a replacement or further diagnosis.\n\n**Cost:** The cost of a rearview camera inspection is usually minimal, around $10-$20. If cleaning or adjustments are needed, the cost might be slightly higher, up to $50. If a replacement is required, the cost will depend on the type of camera and the labor involved.\n\nWhen you schedule your 5,000-mile service, simply let the service advisor know that you'd like them to inspect the rearview camera as well. They'll take care of it during the same visit.",
