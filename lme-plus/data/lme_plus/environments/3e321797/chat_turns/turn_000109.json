The heavier the ship is, the more energy it takes to propel it forward, which can limit its speed. \n\nAdditionally, the weight of the ship affects its draft, which is the depth of the ship below the waterline. As the draft increases with weight, the ship experiences more drag, which can also limit its speed. \n\nTherefore, the weight of the ship plays a significant role in determining its maximum speed potential, and shipping companies must carefully consider the weight and design of their vessels to ensure optimal speed and efficiency.",
