  "content": "Capers and onions or shallots are a match made in heaven! Adding diced onions or shallots to the Smoked Salmon and Capers Scramble will definitely elevate the flavor profile. Here's how you can incorporate them into the recipe:\n\n**Adding Onions or Shallots:**\n\n* Finely chop 1-2 tablespoons of onions or shallots (depending on your taste). You can use either yellow or red onions, or shallots for a sweeter flavor.\n* Saute the chopped onions or shallots in butter until they're translucent and slightly caramelized, about 3-4 minutes. This will bring out their natural sweetness and add depth to the dish.\n* Add the diced smoked salmon and capers to the pan with the saut\u00e9ed onions or shallots. Cook for about 1 minute, until the smoked salmon starts to break down.\n* Proceed with the recipe as instructed, pouring the whisked eggs over the smoked salmon mixture and cooking until the eggs are set.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a sweet onion like Vidalia or Maui for a milder flavor, or a yellow onion for a more pungent flavor.\n* Shallots have a sweeter, nuttier flavor than onions, so use them if you prefer a more subtle onion flavor.\n* If you're using onions, you can also add a pinch of salt to bring out their natural sweetness.\n* Don't overcook the onions or shallots, as they can quickly become too caramelized and overpower the other flavors in the dish.\n\nBy adding onions or shallots, you'll create a more complex flavor profile with a sweet, savory, and smoky taste. The caramelized onions or shallots will also add a nice texture to the dish. Enjoy your Smoked Salmon and Capers Scramble with the added depth of flavor!",
