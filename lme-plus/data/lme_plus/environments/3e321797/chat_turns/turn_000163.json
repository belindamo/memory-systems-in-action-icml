Here are some tips to help you keep track of your reading and stay on top of your list:\n\n**Digital Tools:**\n\n1. **Pocket**: A fantastic app that allows you to save articles and videos to read/watch later, even offline. You can tag and organize your saved content, and it's available on desktop and mobile.\n2. **Instapaper**: Similar to Pocket, Instapaper lets you save articles to read later, with features like text-to-speech, highlighting, and organization by tags and folders.\n3. **Bookmarks**: Use your browser's bookmarking feature to save articles and websites you want to read. You can organize them into folders and tags for easy access.\n4. **Trello or Notion**: If you're familiar with project management tools, you can create a board or page to track your reading list. Add cards or notes for each article or book, and move them across columns as you progress (e.g., \"To-Read,\" \"Reading,\" \"Finished\").\n\n**Analog Methods:**\n\n1. **Reading Journal**: Keep a dedicated notebook or journal to record the articles and books you've read, along with notes, summaries, and ratings.\n2. **Index Cards**: Write down the title, author, and a brief summary of each article or book on an index card.
