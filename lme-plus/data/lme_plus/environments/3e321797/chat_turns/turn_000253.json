  "content": "Give me 7 demigods that will make up the questing party I mentioned before. All 7 will be original characters that are women. Since Camp Half Blood and Camp Jupiter are both involved, Make sure that the questing party is a good mix of both Roman and Greek demigods. I want there to be a demigod daughter of Neptune, Zeus, and Pluto and then 4 other daughters of other Olympian gods. One should be a child of Athena and another should be a Hunter of Artemis since those Goddesses will have a big grudge against Aphrodite. These 7 demigods are above the age of 18 and are considered some of the most powerful demigods alive. All of them have abilities that are very rare for even very powerful demigods.",
