Choosing the right luggage can make a big difference in your travel experience. Here are some tips to help you select the perfect luggage for your next trip:\n\n1. **Consider the length of your trip**: If you're only going for a short weekend getaway, a carry-on bag (around 20-22 inches) should suffice. For longer trips, you may need a larger checked bag (24-28 inches).\n2. **Think about your travel style**: If you're a light packer, a compact carry-on might be ideal.
