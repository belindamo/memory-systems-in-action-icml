  "content": "I imagine many of the Olympian gods and goddesses will be very against Aphrodite's growing power, but Athena and Artemis might request Apollo order a quest in order to take down Alexander. Given Alexander's advanced age, Camp Jupiter and Camp Half-Blood will need to create a questing party of 7 demigods all above the age of 18. All of these demigods would be very powerful given they have lived to see adulthood. Both Roman and Greek demigods will be needed on this quest, and I imagine 1 of the members of the quest will be one of Artemis' Huntresses. Can you describe the 7 members that will be sent to stop Alexander?",
