  "content": "The Smoked Salmon and Capers Scramble is a fantastic breakfast option. It's a unique and flavorful twist on traditional scrambled eggs. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Smoked Salmon and Capers Scramble Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 eggs\n* 1/4 cup diced smoked salmon (look for high-quality, flaked smoked salmon)\n* 1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained\n* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives or parsley\n* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* 1 tablespoon cream or milk (optional)\n\nTips and Considerations:\n\n1. **Smoked Salmon:** Look for high-quality, flaked smoked salmon that's not too salty. You can find it in most gourmet or specialty stores. If you can't find flaked smoked salmon, you can use sliced smoked salmon and chop it into small pieces.\n2. **Capers:** Rinse the capers under cold water to remove excess salt. You can also soak them in water or white wine for 30 minutes to reduce their saltiness.\n3. **Chives or Parsley:** Fresh herbs add a bright, fresh flavor to the dish. You can use either chives or parsley, or a combination of both.\n4. **Butter:** Use high-quality, unsalted butter to add richness and flavor to the dish.\n5. **Cream or Milk:** If you want a creamier scramble, add 1 tablespoon of heavy cream or milk. This will also help to balance the saltiness of the smoked salmon.\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them lightly. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.\n2. Heat the butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once melted, add the diced smoked salmon and cook for about 1 minute, until it starts to break down.\n3. Add the capers and cook for another minute, until they're lightly toasted and fragrant.\n4. Pour the whisked eggs over the smoked salmon and capers. Cook until the eggs start to set, about 2-3 minutes.\n5. Use a spatula to gently scramble the eggs, breaking them up into small curds. Don't overmix!\n6. Stir in the chopped chives or parsley.\n7. If using cream or milk, add it to the eggs and stir gently to combine.\n8. Cook for another minute, until the eggs are cooked to your desired doneness.\n9. Serve immediately and enjoy!\n\n**Tips for Serving:**\n\n* Serve with toasted whole grain bread or a bagel to mop up the creamy eggs and smoked salmon.\n* Add some sliced red onion or thinly sliced avocado on top for extra flavor and texture.\n* If you want to make it a more substantial breakfast, add some saut\u00e9ed spinach or roasted asparagus on the side.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe! The smoked salmon and capers add a rich, savory flavor to the scrambled eggs. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any variations on this recipe.",
