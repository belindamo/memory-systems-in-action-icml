  "content": "You're already diving deep into the FLS universe! Lin-Manuel Miranda's improv skills are truly remarkable, and it's amazing to see how he can come up with such clever rhymes and stories on the spot.\n\nRegarding the new musical, you're likely referring to **Encanto**, an upcoming animated Disney movie with music by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It's not a stage musical (yet!), but an animated film that tells the story of a magical family in Colombia. Lin-Manuel Miranda is writing the original songs for the movie, which is set to be released in 2023.\n\nWhile we don't know much about the story or the music yet, it's exciting to think about Lin-Manuel Miranda's signature style blending with Disney's classic storytelling. Given his previous work on Moana and In the Heights, we can expect a rich, vibrant score that celebrates Latinx culture and heritage.\n\nIt's worth noting that Lin-Manuel Miranda is also working on other projects, including a film adaptation of tick, tick... BOOM!, a musical by Jonathan Larson (Rent). He's set to direct the film, which will be released on Netflix.\n\nKeep an eye out for updates on these projects, and I'm sure we'll be hearing more about them in the coming months!",
