  "content": "The best way to store potatoes is to keep them in a cool, dry, and dark place with good ventilation. Avoid storing them in plastic bags or containers, as this can trap moisture and promote rotting. Instead, store them in a paper bag or cardboard box to absorb any excess moisture. Additionally, it's important to remove any potatoes that have started to sprout, as this can cause the others to spoil faster.",
