      "content": "The Simple Greens Salad is a light and refreshing side dish that will cut the richness of the Lentil and Veggie Wrap nicely.\n\nFor the vinaigrette dressing, I highly recommend making your own! It's incredibly easy and only takes a few minutes. Homemade vinaigrette allows you to control the ingredients, flavor, and amount of dressing, making it a healthier and more cost-effective option. Plus, it's a great way to add a personal touch to your meal.\n\nHere's a simple recipe for a classic vinaigrette:\n\n**Homemade Vinaigrette Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar\n* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n* 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup (optional)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, vinegar, Dijon mustard, and honey or maple syrup (if using) until well combined.\n2. Taste the vinaigrette and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more vinegar, oil, mustard, or honey to taste.\n3. Store the vinaigrette in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\n**Variations:**\n\n* **Balsamic Vinaigrette**: Replace the apple cider vinegar with balsamic vinegar for a sweeter and more intense flavor.\n* **Herby Vinaigrette**: Add 1-2 tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs like parsley, basil, or dill to the vinaigrette for a bright and refreshing flavor.\n* **Lemon Vinaigrette**: Replace the vinegar with freshly squeezed lemon juice for a lighter and citrusy flavor.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different combinations of ingredients to create your perfect vinaigrette!\n\nIf you're short on time, a store-bought vinaigrette is still a good option. Just be mindful of the ingredients and nutrition label, as some commercial vinaigrettes can be high in added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats.\n\nEnjoy your delicious and healthy Lentil and Veggie Wrap with Simple Greens Salad and homemade vinaigrette!"
