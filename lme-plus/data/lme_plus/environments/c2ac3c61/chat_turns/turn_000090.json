  "content": "Yes, there are a few additional options that international graduate students can consider to help offset the high cost of attendance at Stanford University. \n\n1. Research and teaching assistantships: Some graduate programs offer research and teaching assistantships that provide students with stipends, tuition waivers, and sometimes health insurance. These assistantships can help cover some of the cost of attendance.\n\n2. External fellowships and grants: International graduate students can look for external fellowships and grants from private organizations, foundations, or their home countries that provide funding for graduate study. They can check with their embassy, government, or private organizations in their home countries for opportunities.\n\n3. Part-time employment: Some international graduate students are eligible to work on-campus for up to 20 hours per week during the academic year and up to 40 hours per week during breaks. Students can look into various on-campus jobs, such as teaching assistants or research assistants, to help offset the cost of attendance.\n\n4. Student loans: International graduate students may be eligible for private student loans from banks in the United States or their home countries to help cover the cost of attendance. However, it is important to note that these loans often come with high-interest rates, and students should carefully consider the terms and repayment options before taking out a loan.",
