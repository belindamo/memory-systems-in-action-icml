  "content": "The assignments and final project in the **Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification** course are designed to help you practice and apply the concepts learned in the course to real-world text classification tasks. Here's an overview of what you can expect:\n\n**Assignments:**\n\nThere are 4-5 assignments in the course, each focusing on a specific aspect of CNNs for text classification. The assignments are designed to help you:\n\n1. **Implement CNN architectures**: You'll implement different CNN architectures for text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling.\n2. **Experiment with hyperparameters**: You'll experiment with different hyperparameters, such as filter sizes, number of filters, and dropout rates, to optimize the performance of your CNN models.\n3. **Work with different text representations**: You'll work with different text representations, including word embeddings, character-level models, and sentence-level models, to understand their impact on CNN performance.\n4. **Analyze and visualize results**: You'll analyze and visualize the results of your experiments to gain insights into the performance of your CNN models.\n\n**Assignment Tasks:**\n\nSome example assignment tasks might include:\n\n* Implementing a simple CNN for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset\n* Comparing the performance of different CNN architectures on a topic modeling task\n* Experimenting with different hyperparameters to improve the performance of a CNN on a text classification task\n* Visualizing the feature importance of a CNN model for a sentiment analysis task\n\n**Final Project:**\n\nThe final project is an opportunity to apply the concepts learned in the course to a text classification task of your choice. You'll work on a project that interests you, and submit a report detailing your approach, results, and insights.\n\n**Final Project Guidelines:**\n\nSome guidelines for the final project might include:\n\n* Choose a text classification task, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, or topic modeling\n* Implement a CNN architecture for the task, and experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize performance\n* Analyze and visualize the results of your experiments\n* Submit a report detailing your approach, results, and insights\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nAssignments and the final project will be evaluated based on:\n\n* **Correctness**: Does the implementation correct? Does it produce the expected results?\n* **Design and implementation**: Is the implementation well-designed and well-implemented? Are the hyperparameters well-chosen?\n* **Analysis and visualization**: Are the results well-analyzed and well-visualized? Are the insights gained from the analysis meaningful?\n* **Report quality**: Is the report well-written and well-organized? Are the results clearly presented and discussed?\n\n**Tips and Resources:**\n\n* The course provides a lot of resources to help you with the assignments and final project, including code templates, datasets, and documentation.\n* The instructors and TAs are available to answer questions and provide feedback on your work.\n* You're encouraged to work in teams and collaborate with your peers to learn from each other and get feedback on your work.\n\nOverall, the assignments and final project in the **Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification** course are designed to help you gain hands-on experience with CNNs for text classification tasks, and to develop your skills in implementing, analyzing, and visualizing CNN models.",
