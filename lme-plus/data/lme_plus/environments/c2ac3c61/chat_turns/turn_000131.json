  "content": "Wolves do not have a favorite type of prey as their diet is based on availability. In the wild, wolves generally hunt herbivorous animals such as elk, deer, bison, moose, and caribou, but they can also prey on smaller animals such as rabbits, rodents, and birds if larger prey is scarce. The type of prey that wolves target usually depends on factors such as the size of the wolf pack, the availability of food, and the season. For example, during the winter months, when large herbivores are harder to find, wolves may shift their diet to smaller prey such as hares or voles.",
