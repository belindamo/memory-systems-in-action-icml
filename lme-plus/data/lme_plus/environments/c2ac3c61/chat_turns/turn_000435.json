  "content": "I am a Mexican / American, and have a podcast i recently launched called The Big Mod Cast. We have local Kansas City guests, and discuss various topics, and make some jokes along the way. My next guest is, Levi Mootz. We used to work together at Universal Engraving in Overland Park, KS. He now works a few blocks away after being abroad for 15 years. He's done things like: owned a real estate office in brooklyn, ny, worked as a sternman on a lobster boat, moved to Ireland for a few years, and along the way taught himself to be a software developer and linux system administrator. Write an outline for an hour long conversation that is in-depth and engaging, yet has comedic overtones for an adult audience.",
