However, there are various government organizations, NGOs, and local communities working together to protect and preserve the river's ecosystem. The Clyde River Foundation is one such organization that has been working since 2002 to conserve and enhance the River Clyde's natural heritage. Their work includes habitat management, scientific research, and education programs, among other initiatives. Additionally, the Scottish government has been working on a River Basin Management Plan for the Clyde with the objective of improving river water quality, preserving wildlife and aquatic habitats, and managing flood and erosion risks. There are also many community-based projects focused on protecting and enhancing the local environment and fostering a sense of ownership of the natural resources present in the surrounding areas.",
