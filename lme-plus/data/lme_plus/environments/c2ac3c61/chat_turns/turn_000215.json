But for someone who is just starting their fitness journey, I would recommend something that is user-friendly, with basic fitness tracking features, and affordable. The Fitbit Inspire 2 or the Garmin Vivosport are great options for beginners as they provide basic fitness tracking features such as step counting, heart rate monitoring, and sleep tracking, and they are both reasonably priced. They also have user-friendly interfaces and are easy to use. These devices are a great starting point for someone who wants to get into fitness tracking but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.",
