I'd be delighted to help you plan a fun-filled day around seeing The Book of Mormon. Here are some activity suggestions to consider:\n\n**Before the Show:**\n\n1. **Brunch or Lunch**: Gather your friends for a meal at a nearby restaurant or caf\u00e9. You could even make it a themed brunch with musical-inspired dishes or drinks.\n2. **Musical Trivia**: Host a quick trivia session to test your friends' knowledge of musicals. You can create questions about The Book of Mormon, Hadestown, or other popular shows.\n3. **Costume Encouragement**: Encourage your friends to dress up in their favorite musical-inspired outfits or costumes. This could add to the excitement and make for some fun photos.\n\n**After the Show:**\n\n1. **Discussion and Debate**: Grab coffee or drinks and discuss the show with your friends. You could debate the themes, characters, and music, or share your favorite moments from the performance.\n2. **Karaoke Night**: Book a private room at a karaoke bar and have a sing-along session featuring musical theater songs. This would be a great way to keep the energy and excitement going.\n3. **Musical-themed Games**: Host a game night with musical-themed games, such as \"Guess the Show Tune\" or \"Musical Charades.\" You could also play board games or card games with a musical twist.\n\n**Other Ideas:**\n\n1. **Musical Museum or Exhibit**: If there's a local museum or exhibit featuring musical theater history, costumes, or memorabilia, consider visiting it before or after the show.\n2. **Behind-the-Scenes Tour**: If possible, look into behind-the-scenes tours or workshops related to The Book of Mormon or other musicals. This could give you a deeper appreciation for the production.\n3. **Cast Meet-and-Greet**: Check if there's a post-show talkback or meet-and-greet with the cast. This could be a unique opportunity to ask questions and take photos with the performers.\n\nRemember to plan according to your group's interests and preferences, and make sure to leave some flexibility in your schedule for spontaneity and relaxation.
