Haiti earthquake (2010): In response to the devastating earthquake in Haiti, the Royal Engineers provided essential support, including engineering assessments, structurally verifying key buildings to ensure they were safe to use, and clearing away rubble.\n\n2. Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines (2013): The Royal Engineers were deployed to the Philippines to help restore vital infrastructure, such as bridges and roads, which had been damaged or destroyed by the typhoon. They also worked with local communities on boat-building projects and provided essential water and sanitation facilities.\n\n3. Sierra Leone Ebola outbreak (2014-2016): During the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, the Royal Engineers built and maintained specialist Ebola treatment centers, constructed a medical waste incinerator, and improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities.\n\n4. Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean (2017): Following Hurricane Irma, the Royal Engineers were deployed to help clear debris, restore infrastructure, and provide water and sanitation facilities to affected communities in the Caribbean.\n\nIn all these examples, the Royal Engineers were an essential part of a wider humanitarian response effort, working alongside other military and civilian organizations to provide necessary support and aid to those in need.",
