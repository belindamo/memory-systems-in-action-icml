  "content": "There are several reasons why the cost of attendance for international students at Stanford University is higher compared to domestic students:\n\n1. Non-resident tuition: International students are not eligible for in-state or residency-based tuition, so they have to pay a higher non-resident tuition rate.\n\n2. Additional fees: International students may have to pay additional fees for visa processing, travel, and insurance.\n\n3. Living expenses: Living expenses, such as housing and food, may be higher for international students who may not have access to in-state or family support.\n\nStanford University does provide support and assistance to international students. The university has an Office of International Affairs which offers a range of services, including immigration advising, cultural adjustment, and academic support. Additionally, there are several programs and resources available specifically for international students, such as English language classes, international student organizations, and cultural events. Despite the high cost of attendance, international students at Stanford have access to a variety of resources and opportunities that can enhance their educational experience.",
