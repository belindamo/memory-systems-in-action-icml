  "content": "That's awesome that you discovered a new artist through a local open mic night! I'm glad you're supporting local talent.\n\nAs for Emily, I'm not familiar with a specific singer-songwriter by that name, but I'd love to help you discover more artists with similar sounds. Can you tell me a bit more about Emily's music? What genre would you classify her as? Is it folk, indie-pop, or something else? Does she have a distinctive voice or style that sets her apart?\n\nBased on your interest in Lucy Dacus and Lo-Fi hip-hop, I'm going to take a wild guess and suggest some artists that might resonate with you:\n\n**Similar Artists:**\n\n1. **Snail Mail** (Lindsey Jordan): A singer-songwriter known for her introspective and relatable lyrics, often accompanied by a lo-fi indie-rock sound.\n2. **Clairo**: A bedroom pop artist who creates introspective and emotive music with a lo-fi, DIY aesthetic.\n3. **Soccer Mommy** (Sophie Allison): As I mentioned earlier, Sophie's music often deals with introspection, relationships, and self-discovery, with a lo-fi indie-folk sound.\n4. **Vagabon** (Laetitia Tamko): A singer-songwriter who blends indie-rock, electronic, and R&B elements to create a unique sound that's both introspective and uplifting.\n5. **Beabadoobee**: A Filipino-British singer-songwriter who creates introspective and emotive music with a lo-fi, bedroom pop sound.\n\nThese artists share some similarities with Lucy Dacus and might appeal to you if you enjoy introspective, emotive, and lo-fi sounds. Let me know if you'd like more recommendations or if you have any specific preferences (e.g., genre, mood, etc.)!",
