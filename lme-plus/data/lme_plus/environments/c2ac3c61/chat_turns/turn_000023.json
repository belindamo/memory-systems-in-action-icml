  "content": "With your preferences, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Arm & Hammer Super Scoop Cat Litter**: As I mentioned earlier, this is a popular choice for odor control. It's a clumping litter that forms tight clumps, making it easy to scoop and clean. It's also relatively low dust and has a moderate price point.\n2. **Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter**: This litter is a bit more premium, but it's highly effective at controlling odors and forming tight clumps. It's also 99.9% dust-free, which is great for you and Lola. It's a bit more expensive than Super Scoop, but it's worth it for the performance.\n3. **Tidy Cats 24/7 Performance Clumping Cat Litter**: This litter is designed for high-performance odor control and is known for its strong clumping ability. It's also low dust and has a moderate price point.\n4. **Purina Pro Plan Cat Litter**: This litter is a bit more premium, but it's designed for advanced odor control and has a unique formula that helps to neutralize odors. It's also low dust and forms tight clumps.\n\nAll of these options are clumping litters, which make it easy to scoop and clean the litter box. They're also all relatively low dust, which is great for you and Lola.\n\nIf you're open to trying a silica gel litter, I'd recommend:\n\n1. ** Pretty Litter**: This litter is made from 100% silica gel and is highly effective at controlling odors. It's also low dust and forms clumps easily. The silica gel is gentle on Lola's paws and is 99.9% dust-free.\n\nSilica gel litters are great at controlling odors, but they can be a bit more expensive than traditional clumping litters.\n\nI hope these recommendations help! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more information on any of these options.",
