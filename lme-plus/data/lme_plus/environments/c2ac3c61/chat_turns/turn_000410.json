They have an impressive collection of plays and musicals, including Hadestown.\n3. **Digital Theatre**: A UK-based platform that offers a variety of filmed productions, including musicals like The Last Five Years and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n4. **Met Opera on Demand**: While primarily focused on opera, the Metropolitan Opera also offers a selection of musical theater productions, including Sondheim's Company and Rodgers and Hammerstein's Carousel.\n5. **Amazon Prime Video**: Amazon's streaming service occasionally features exclusive Broadway productions, such as the 2020 production of Hamilton and the 2022 production of Anything Goes.\n6. **Apple TV+**: Apple's streaming service has partnered with the Roundabout Theatre Company to produce exclusive filmed productions, including The Lehman Trilogy and The Skin of Our Teeth.\n7. **YouTube Theater**: YouTube's live theater platform features a range of productions, including musicals like The Book of Mormon and plays like The Play That Goes Wrong.\n8. **Stellar**: A relatively new streaming service that offers a curated selection of live theater productions, including musicals like Spring Awakening and plays like The Glass Menagerie.\n\nKeep in mind that availability may vary depending on your region and the platforms available in your area.
