  "content": "Most essential oils are not made through acid-base extraction. This method is more commonly used to extract compounds other than essential oils, such as alkaloids or organic acids.\n\nEssential oils are typically extracted using methods such as steam distillation, solvent extraction, or cold-pressing. These methods involve the use of water, solvents, or pressure to extract the essential oil from the plant material, without the need for acid-base reactions.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions. For example, certain essential oils can be extracted using acid hydrolysis, which involves breaking down the plant material with acid to release the essential oil. This method is commonly used to extract essential oils from citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons.\n\nOverall, while acid-base extraction may be used in some cases to extract essential oils, it is not a common method and is not typically used in the commercial production of essential oils.",
