  "content": "This design is an implementation of a speed-controlled treadmill motor using a Teensy microcontroller and an H-bridge circuit. The motor is a 2 horsepower DC motor that requires 120 volts DC to operate. The AC input from New Zealand is converted to DC using a KBPC5010 bridge rectifier and a 4700uF capacitor. The resulting DC voltage is then fed to an H-bridge circuit that uses four IRF540N MOSFETs to control the direction and speed of the motor. The H-bridge circuit is controlled by a DRV8412 motor driver, which is in turn controlled by a Teensy 3.6 microcontroller.\n\nThe motor is monitored by a hall effect sensor, which allows for both speed and direction feedback to the microcontroller. The speed of the motor is controlled by varying the PWM signal generated by the Teensy, which controls the speed of the motor by changing the duty cycle of the signal. The ramp up and ramp down of the motor speed is controlled by a software algorithm implemented in the Teensy code.\n\nThe overall design is enclosed in a protective case and includes a power switch, a speed control knob, and an LCD display that shows the current speed of the motor. The design also includes various safety features, such as over-current protection and over-temperature protection, to ensure the safe operation of the motor.",
