  "content": "The acid that is typically used to release essential oil from citrus fruits is citric acid. Citric acid is a weak organic acid that is naturally present in citrus fruits and is commonly used as a food preservative and flavoring agent.\n\nIn the process of extracting essential oil from citrus fruits, citric acid is used to break down the cell walls of the fruit and release the essential oil contained in the fruit peel. The process involves soaking the fruit peel in a mixture of water and citric acid for a period of time, after which the essential oil is separated from the liquid using a centrifuge or other separation method.\n\nCitric acid is preferred for this process because it is non-toxic and non-reactive with the essential oil, making it a safe and effective method for extracting essential oils from citrus fruits.",
