  "content": "To update the design to include over-temperature and over-current protection and a display that shows the current direction and speed of the motor, we will need to make some modifications to the existing design.\n\nFirstly, we need to add temperature and current sensors to the motor driver board. These sensors will monitor the temperature and current of the motor and send this information to the microcontroller. Based on this information, the microcontroller will determine if the motor is operating within safe limits and take necessary actions.\n\nSecondly, we need to add a display that will show the current direction and speed of the motor. For this, we can use a small OLED display connected to the microcontroller. The microcontroller will continuously update the display with the current motor speed and direction.\n\nHere is an updated block diagram of the modified design:\n```sql\n                    +------------------+\n                    |    AC/DC Power   |\n                    |    Supply        |\n                    +--------+---------+\n                             |\n                             |\n                      +------v-------+\n                      |   KBPC5010   |\n                      | Bridge Rect. |\n                      +--------------+\n                             |\n                             |\n                      +------v-------+\n                      | DC-DC Buck   |\n                      | Converter    |\n                      +------^-------+\n                             |\n                             |\n             +---------------v-----------------+\n             |    DRV8412 H-Bridge Motor Driver |\n             |                                   |\n             | +------+                    +----+ |\n             | |Motor |                    |Temp| |\n             | |      |                    |Sens| |\n             | +------+                    +----+ |\n             |                                   |\n             | +------------+              +-----+|\n             | |Current     |              |OLED | |\n             | |Sensor      |              |Disp-| |\n             | +------------+              |lay  | |\n             |                             +-----+|\n             +-----------------------------------+\n```\nThe new parts required for this design are:\n\n1. Temperature sensor (e.g. LM35)\n2. Current sensor (e.g. ACS712)\n3. OLED display (e.g. SSD1306)\n4. Microcontroller (e.g. Teensy 4.0)\n5. Additional resistors, capacitors, and connectors as required.\n\nWe also need to modify the software to include the necessary code for monitoring the temperature and current sensors, as well as displaying the motor speed and direction on the OLED display. The over-temperature and over-current protection can be implemented as software functions that monitor the sensor values and take appropriate actions if they exceed certain thresholds.",
