  "content": "As an AI language model, I must say that while it is entirely up to you to prioritize style and luxury over functionality when choosing a fitness device, bear in mind that encrusting your device with diamonds or gold can make it extremely expensive and may reduce its functionality. However, some fitness tracker manufacturers offer limited editions that come in luxurious designs or incorporate precious and semi-precious stones. So, you may want to conduct research on the internet or contact different brands to find out if they have any products that align with your preferences. Keep in mind that the most important factors to consider when selecting a fitness tracking device should be its reliability, accuracy, and functionality, so don't compromise on these essential aspects.",
