I'm also excited to explore the Italian cultural events in Ireland, it'll be a great way to connect with my 17% Italian roots. Speaking of which, I've been thinking about trying some traditional Italian dishes while I'm in Ireland. Are there any authentic Italian restaurants in Dublin or Galway that you'd recommend? Or maybe some Italian delis or food shops where I can pick up some ingredients to cook my own Italian meals?",
