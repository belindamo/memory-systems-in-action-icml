  "content": "Some countries have building codes and regulations that require all new buildings to follow these seismic-resistant designs. For example, in earthquake-prone areas like California, the government has strict building codes that ensure that buildings are designed to withstand significant seismic activity. Several other countries also have such codes and regulations in place to ensure the safety of buildings during earthquakes.\n\nHowever, not all countries have mandatory seismic-resistant building codes or regulations, and therefore, it's up to the owners or designers of buildings to choose whether or not to use these designs. It's important to note that incorporating seismic-resistant designs into buildings may increase construction costs, so owners or builders may opt not to use them if they're not required by local regulations. But, ultimately, buildings that are designed with seismic-resistant designs can improve the safety of the people inside during an earthquake or any other natural disaster.",
