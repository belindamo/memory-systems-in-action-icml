  "content": "It's great that you're enthusiastic and determined to make this project happen! The number of people you can speak to in a day really depends on the approach you take and how much time and effort you're willing to dedicate to spreading the word.\n\nIf you want to maximize your outreach, you could consider hosting an event or presentation to share your project with a larger audience. This could be at a local community center, university, or other public space. You could also create posters, flyers, and social media posts to advertise your project and encourage people to contribute.\n\nIn terms of how many people you can speak to in a day, it really depends on how you structure your outreach efforts. If you're doing presentations or events, you could potentially reach dozens or even hundreds of people in a single day. If you're doing more one-on-one outreach or just spreading the word through social media and other online channels, you may not be able to reach as many people, but you can still make a meaningful impact.\n\nUltimately, the key is to be creative, persistent, and enthusiastic about your project, and to explore different approaches and strategies to get the word out and engage as many people as possible. And who knows, maybe you'll find some generous donors who will contribute more than 2 liters of sand!",
