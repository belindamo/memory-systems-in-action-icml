  "content": "Japan's post-WWII reconstruction was heavily influenced by Western culture, particularly American culture. This included adopting new technologies and entertainment such as movies, music, and television shows. As Japan's economy grew and its standard of living increased, so did its interest in leisure and entertainment. This led to the emergence of contemporary pop culture in Japan, which is a fusion of traditional Japanese culture and Western culture. This pop culture includes anime, manga, video games, and other forms of entertainment that have become popular around the world.
