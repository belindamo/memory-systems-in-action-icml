  "content": "If you're in an area with low seismic activity, the risk of an earthquake hitting the area might be relatively low. However, it's still advisable to incorporate seismic-resistant designs into your building's construction. The reason is that earthquakes can strike unexpectedly and in areas that were previously considered low risk. Additionally, seismic-resistant designs not only increase a building's resilience to earthquakes but also to other natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados.\n\nMoreover, seismic-resistant designs have been shown to be effective in reducing damage to buildings and minimizing injury even in areas with low seismic activity. Investing in these designs can also increase the resale value of the building and give occupants peace of mind. Therefore, it is always best to consult with a qualified engineer to determine whether implementing seismic-resistant designs is necessary for your building, regardless of your location.",
