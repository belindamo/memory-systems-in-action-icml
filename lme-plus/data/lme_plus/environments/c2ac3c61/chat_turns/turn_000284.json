Here's a simple recipe for homemade crackers that pairs well with peanut butter:\n\n**Simple Homemade Crackers Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/4 cup whole wheat flour\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon sugar\n* 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n* 1/4 cup water\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.\n2. In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, and sugar.\n3. Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.\n4. Gradually add the water to the mixture, stirring with a fork until the dough comes together in a ball.\n5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times until it becomes smooth and pliable.\n6. Roll the dough out to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3 mm). You can use a rolling pin or your hands to shape the dough into a rectangle.\n7. Cut the dough into desired shapes using a cookie cutter, knife, or simply cutting into squares or strips.\n8. Place the crackers on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each cracker.\n9. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crackers are lightly golden brown and crispy.\n10. Remove the crackers from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nTips:\n\n* To get a crisper cracker, bake for an additional 5-10 minutes. Keep an eye on them to avoid overcooking.\n* You can flavor the crackers with herbs, spices, or seasonings of your choice. Some options include sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried herbs, or grated cheese.\n* Store the crackers in an airtight container for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months and bake them fresh when needed.\n\nThese homemade crackers are perfect for pairing with peanut butter, and you can customize the recipe to your taste preferences. Enjoy!",
