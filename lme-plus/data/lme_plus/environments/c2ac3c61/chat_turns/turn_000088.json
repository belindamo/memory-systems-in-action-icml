  "content": "Yes, international students can apply for financial aid and scholarships at Stanford University. However, it is important to note that the availability of financial assistance for international students is limited. \n\nStanford University offers need-based financial aid for undergraduate international students but the university does not offer merit scholarships or need-based aid for international graduate students.\n\nTo apply for financial aid, international undergraduate students must complete the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE form and the Stanford Financial Aid Application, and submit the required documents. The financial aid application deadline is the same as the regular admission application deadline.\n\nFor graduate students, some schools and departments may offer financial assistance such as fellowships, grants or scholarships. It is recommended that graduate students contact their respective departments or schools directly for more information about their financial aid options.\n\nInternational students can also look for external scholarships or grants that are available from private organizations, foundations, or their home countries. They should check with their embassy, government or private organizations in their home countries to explore any opportunities.",
