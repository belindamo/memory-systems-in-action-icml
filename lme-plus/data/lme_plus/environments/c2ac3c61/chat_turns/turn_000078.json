  "content": "Sure, here's an example step-by-step normalization of the ERD:\n\nStep 1: Identify the functional dependencies between attributes in each table.\n\nIn the given ERD, it is assumed that there are no functional dependencies other than the primary keys.\n\nStep 2: Create separate tables for each set of related data and assign primary keys.\n\nBased on the relationships in the ERD, we can create the following tables:\n\n* Customer (customer\\_id PK, name, address, contact\\_details, kyc\\_details)\n* Account (account\\_number PK, account\\_type, account\\_balance, account\\_status, customer\\_id FK)\n* Transaction (transaction\\_id PK, transaction\\_type, transaction\\_date, transaction\\_amount, transaction\\_status, account\\_number FK)\n* Loan (loan\\_id PK, loan\\_type, loan\\_amount, interest\\_rate, repayment\\_schedule, customer\\_id FK)\n* Credit (credit\\_limit, credit\\_utilization, credit\\_score, credit\\_status, customer\\_id PK)\n* Risk (risk\\_id PK, risk\\_type, risk\\_level, risk\\_status, customer\\_id FK)\n* Compliance (compliance\\_id PK, compliance\\_type, compliance\\_status, compliance\\_deadline, customer\\_id FK)\n* Treasury (treasury\\_id PK, investment\\_portfolio, cash\\_reserves, forex\\_transactions, customer\\_id FK)\n* Business Intelligence (business\\_intelligence\\_id PK, revenue, profitability, market\\_share, kpi, customer\\_id FK)\n* Integration/API (integration\\_id PK, api\\_endpoints, api\\_keys, integration\\_status, customer\\_id FK)\n\nNote that in each table, we have assigned a primary key (PK) and a foreign key (FK) to link the tables together.\n\nStep 3: Remove any redundant data and dependencies.\n\nSince we created separate tables for each set of related data, there should be no redundant data. However, we should still check for any transitive dependencies.\n\nFor example, in the Loan table, we have loan\\_type, loan\\_amount, and interest\\_rate, which are all dependent on the loan\\_id. However, loan\\_type and interest\\_rate are also dependent on the loan\\_amount, which means we have a transitive dependency. To remove this, we can create a separate table for loan\\_type and interest\\_rate and link it to the Loan table using a foreign key.\n\n* Loan (loan\\_id PK, loan\\_amount, repayment\\_schedule, customer\\_id FK)\n* Loan\\_Type (loan\\_type\\_id PK, loan\\_id FK, loan\\_type)\n* Interest\\_Rate (interest\\_rate\\_id PK, loan\\_id FK, interest\\_rate)\n\nStep 4: Verify the normalization level of the tables.\n\nWe have now separated the data into individual tables, and all dependencies have been removed. Therefore, the tables are in third normal form (3NF), which means they are free of transitive dependencies and redundant data.\n\nOverall, the normalization process helps to ensure data consistency, reduce data redundancy, and improve data integrity. By following the steps outlined above, we can create a well-structured and organized database schema.",
