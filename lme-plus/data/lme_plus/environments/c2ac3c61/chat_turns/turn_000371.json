  "content": "I'm glad to hear that you've had positive experiences attending author readings and book events!\n\nAs for book fairs and charity events, I can suggest a few ways to find out what's happening in your area:\n\n1. **Local library or bookstore newsletters:** Many libraries and bookstores have newsletters or email lists that announce upcoming events, including book fairs and charity events. Make sure you're subscribed to stay informed.\n2. **Social media:** Follow your local library, bookstore, or literary organizations on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. They often post about upcoming events and share information about book fairs and charity events.\n3. **Online event calendars:** Websites like Eventbrite, Meetup, or Lanyrd allow you to search for events in your area. You can filter by category (e.g., books, literature, charity) and location to find relevant events.\n4. **Local newspapers and community newsletters:** Check the entertainment or community sections of your local newspapers or newsletters for announcements about book fairs and charity events.\n5. **Literary organizations:** Look for local literary organizations, writing groups, or book clubs that might be hosting or participating in book fairs and charity events.\n\nRegarding specific events, I couldn't find any information about a book fair or charity event featuring Rachel Smith, the author of \"The Whispering Walls\", as she doesn't seem to be a real author. It's possible that you might have misremembered the author's name or the event details.\n\nIf you're interested in attending book fairs or charity events, I recommend keeping an eye on the resources mentioned above and reaching out to your local literary community. You can also consider volunteering at events or participating in book clubs to meet like-minded readers and stay informed about upcoming events.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any more questions or need help with anything else!",
