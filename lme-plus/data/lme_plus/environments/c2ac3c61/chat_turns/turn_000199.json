  "content": "You're welcome! I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to try out the recipe and experiment with cake flour. Sponge cake is a great choice for showcasing the delicate texture of cake flour, and I'm sure you'll have a blast making it.\n\nRemember to be gentle when folding the egg whites into the batter, as you want to maintain the airiness of the eggs. And don't overmix the batter, as this can deflate the eggs and result in a dense cake.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'm always here to help. And if you'd like more recipe ideas or tips, I'd be happy to share them with you.\n\nGood luck with your sponge cake, and I hope it turns out light, fluffy, and utterly delicious!",
