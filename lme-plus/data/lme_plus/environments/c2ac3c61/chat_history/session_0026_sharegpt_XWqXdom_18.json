The hood extended the wear time during the fall, making it just warm enough to last well into November (we live in a fairly mild climate). Since I ordered a size up for her it was large enough to likely get a second wear out of it next year. The only drawback to this jacket was that the sleeves were too long for my daughter\u2019s arms and we had to roll up the cuff in order for her to be comfortable. Other than this, the jacket was a big hit!\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Heavy Duty\nVINE VOICE\n5.0 out of 5 stars Fits as expected\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on March 11, 2023\nVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )\nFits as expected.

What matters is, my daughter really likes it! She says it's a pretty sweatshirt, and she likes the hoodie. She thinks it's soft and warm. It appears to be made well, and it came through the laundry without any loss in color.

It\u2019s a bit larger than I had hoped for.. the good thing is she will be able to keep it for a while as she grows. Hoping it doesn\u2019t swallow her.
