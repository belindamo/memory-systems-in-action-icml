      "content": "Title: Last Two Standing\n\nPremise: A hapless Englishman, David, and his best friend, Raj, escape Earth seconds before it is blown up by aliens. The two find themselves stranded in space with limited supplies and no clear destination. As they navigate the dangers of the galaxy, they discover new worlds and meet interesting characters along the way. But with their resources dwindling and the threat of the aliens still looming, they must find a way to survive and ensure that humanity lives on.\n\nCharacters:\n\n1. David (Lead): An average, middle-aged man with no real aspirations. He's a bit of a pessimist and never thought he'd leave Earth, let alone be one of the last two humans alive. He's not a natural leader, but he's resourceful and has a dry sense of humor that he uses to keep Raj's spirits up.\n2. Raj (Supporting): David's best friend and the complete opposite of him. He's an optimist who sees the adventure in their situation and tries to make the best of it. He's more physically capable than David and takes charge when necessary.\n3. Zara (Antagonist): The leader of the alien race that destroyed Earth. She's cold and calculated, with no regard for human life. She sees the humans as nothing more than pests and wants to exterminate them all.\n4. Nova (Love Interest): A human woman that David and Raj meet on one of their journeys. She's strong and independent, but also kind and compassionate. She's the polar opposite of Zara, and David finds himself falling for her.\n\nSetting:\n\nThe film takes place in space, on various planets and spacecraft. The visuals are awe-inspiring, with beautiful landscapes and alien architecture. The film also explores the desolate nature of space, with its harsh conditions and endless emptiness.\n\nDialogue:\n\nDavid: \"I always thought I'd die in my sleep or something, not be one of the last two people alive.\"\n\nRaj: \"Hey, look on the bright side. We're exploring the galaxy! How many people can say that?\"\n\nDavid: \"Exploring the galaxy with limited supplies and no clear destination. Yeah, I'm living the dream.\"\n\nZara: \"You humans are so predictable. You'll fight to survive until the bitter end, but it won't matter. We will win in the end.\"\n\nNova: \"I'm not going to lie, I'm scared too. But I believe that we can find a way to make it through this. Together.\"\n\nNarrative:\n\nThe film opens with David and Raj frantically trying to get onto a spacecraft, seconds before Earth is destroyed by the alien race. They manage to make it on board and escape, but find themselves stranded in space with no clear direction. They use their resources to try and make contact with other humans, but to no avail.\n\nAs they journey through space, they encounter different worlds and meet a variety of characters. They face challenges such as running low on supplies, encountering dangerous creatures, and avoiding the aliens who destroyed Earth. Along the way, David starts to develop feelings for Nova, a woman they meet on one of the planets.\n\nAs they continue their journey, they discover that the aliens have a weakness - a rare mineral that can be used to destroy their ships. They set out to find the mineral, with Zara and her forces hot on their heels. After a tense battle, they manage to acquire the mineral and use it to destroy the alien ships.\n\nThe film ends with David and Nova standing on a new planet, looking out at the stars. They've found a new home, but their journey is far from over. They vow to keep exploring the galaxy and keep humanity alive, no matter what challenges come their way."
