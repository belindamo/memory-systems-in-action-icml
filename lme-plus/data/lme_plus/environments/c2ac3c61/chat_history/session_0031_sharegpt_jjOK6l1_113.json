For example, within the native desktop application architecture type, there could be subtypes like single-page applications, event-driven applications, or multithreaded applications. Similarly, within the cross-platform desktop application architecture type, there could be subtypes like containerization, virtualization, or cloud-native applications. The same applies to web-based desktop and hybrid desktop application architectures, with subtypes that can include progressive web applications (PWA), single-page applications (SPA), or responsive web design (RWD) among others. The choice of sub-architecture type will depend on the specific requirements of the project and the development team's expertise."
