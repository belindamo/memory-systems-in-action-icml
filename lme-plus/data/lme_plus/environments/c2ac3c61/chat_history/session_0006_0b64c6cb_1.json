Check online marketplaces: Websites like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart often have sales and discounts on TVs, especially during holiday weekends or special events like the Super Bowl.\n2. Look for bundle deals: Some retailers offer bundle discounts when you purchase a TV with other electronics, like a soundbar or gaming console.\n3. Consider last year's models: Last year's TV models can be significantly cheaper than the latest releases, but still offer great picture quality.\n4. Check for discounts on certified refurbished or open-box TVs: These can be a cost-effective option, but make sure to check the warranty and return policies.\n\n**Soundbar Deals:**\n\n1. Check for bundle deals: Similar to TVs, look for bundles that include a soundbar with a TV or other electronics.\n2. Discounted models: Look for previous-generation soundbars or entry-level models, which can be cheaper but still offer good sound quality.\n3. Check for sales on soundbar systems: Some retailers offer discounts on soundbar systems that include a subwoofer and satellite speakers.\n4. Consider a soundbar with a TV purchase: Some retailers offer a discount on a soundbar when you buy it with a TV.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Research and compare prices: Check prices across different retailers to find the best deal.\n2. Check for price matching policies: Some retailers offer price matching, so if you find a lower price elsewhere, they'll match it.\n3. Read reviews and check the warranty: Make sure you're getting a good product with a decent warranty.\n4. Consider shopping during off-peak seasons: Prices might be lower during off-peak seasons, like during the summer or after the Super Bowl.\n\nKeep in mind that deals and availability may vary depending on your location and the retailers in your area. I recommend checking online reviews, comparing prices, and reading customer reviews before making a purchase.\n\nEnjoy your game-day gathering, and I hope you score a great deal on a new TV and soundbar!"
