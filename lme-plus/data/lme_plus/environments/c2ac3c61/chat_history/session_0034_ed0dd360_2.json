It's a story of courage, friendship, and redemption.\n3. **The Red Tent** by Anita Diamant: This book retells the story of Dinah, a biblical figure, and her experiences in ancient Mesopotamia. It's a beautiful and moving exploration of women's lives in a patriarchal society.\n4. **The Song of Achilles** by Madeline Miller: This novel is a stunning retelling of the Trojan War from the perspective of Achilles' lover, Patroclus. It's a sweeping epic that explores love, war, and humanity.\n5. **The Historian** by Elizabeth Kostova: This book is a literary thriller that spans centuries, from the 15th century to the present day.
