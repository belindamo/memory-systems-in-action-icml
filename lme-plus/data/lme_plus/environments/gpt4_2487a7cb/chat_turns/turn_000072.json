  "content": "Compliance monitoring is an important component of tax administration. It involves the systematic review and analysis of taxpayers' compliance with tax laws and regulations, as well as the identification of areas where compliance can be improved. In Sub-Saharan Africa, compliance monitoring is often hindered by inadequate resources, lack of access to information, and limited capacity to effectively target high-risk taxpayers (Bird & Zolt, 2019). This leads to low levels of tax compliance, which in turn affects revenue generation and the provision of public goods and services.\n\nOne approach to addressing these challenges is through the use of technology, particularly digitalization of tax administration. Digitalization can help improve compliance monitoring by enabling tax authorities to better track taxpayer activities, identify noncompliance, and deploy resources more effectively (OECD, 2019). However, digitalization also poses its own challenges, including the need for strong data protection and privacy regulations, the need for robust IT infrastructure, and the risk of excluding vulnerable populations who lack access to digital technologies (Kariuki & Kihoro, 2020).\n\nIn summary, the problem of low tax compliance in Sub-Saharan Africa is closely linked to the challenges of compliance monitoring, which can be addressed through the use of technology, but also poses its own challenges. These issues require further research and practical solutions to effectively promote tax compliance in the region.\n\nReferences:\n\nBird, R., & Zolt, E. M. (2019).
