It's a bit on the lighter side, but it's still a great option for most yogis. ($40)\n2. **Alo Yoga Warrior Mat**: This mat is a bit thicker than the Manduka, offering extra cushioning for your joints. It also has a non-slip surface and a soft, comfortable feel. ($50)\n3. **Gaiam Print Yoga Mat**: This mat has a fun, stylish design and a good balance of grip and cushioning. It's a bit thicker than the Manduka, but not as thick as the Alo Yoga mat. ($40)\n4. **Hugger Mugger Para Rubber Yoga Mat**: This mat is made from natural rubber and has a textured surface for excellent grip. It's also eco-friendly and has a comfortable, cushioned feel. ($45)\n5. **YogaAccessories Deluxe Yoga Mat**: This mat has a thick, cushioned surface and a non-slip bottom for excellent grip. It's also easy to clean and maintain. ($50)\n\nAll of these options should provide good grip and cushioning, and they're within your budget. However, if you want to prioritize eco-friendliness, I'd recommend the Manduka eKO SuperLite or the Hugger Mugger Para Rubber Yoga Mat.\n\nDo any of these options stand out to you, or would you like me to provide more information about each one?",
