  "content": "I apologize for any confusion. Here is a more structured summary of the statement of problem for this study:\n\nThis study examines the challenges facing tax administration in sub-Saharan Africa with a focus on the digitization of tax collection. The problem of inadequate tax collection in the region is compounded by several factors, including ineffective cadastre registration of assets, weak self-assessment mechanisms, inadequate compliance enforcement through audit and investigation, and limited access to tax appeal tribunal judgments. The study will investigate how the digitalization of tax administration exacerbates or mitigates these challenges, with the aim of providing policy recommendations for enhancing tax collection in the region.",
