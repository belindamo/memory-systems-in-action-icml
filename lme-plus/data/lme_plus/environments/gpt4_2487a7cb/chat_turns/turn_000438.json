Weekly magazines can be overwhelming, especially if you're not used to reading that frequently. Here are some tips to help you stay on top of weekly magazines like The New Yorker:\n\n1. **Set a realistic goal**: Instead of feeling obligated to read the entire issue cover to cover, set a goal to read a certain number of articles or sections each week. This will help you stay engaged without feeling overwhelmed.\n2. **Prioritize content**: Identify the sections or types of articles that interest you the most (e.g., politics, culture, fiction, or humor). Focus on those first, and then move on to other sections if you have time.\n3. **Skim and scan**: Don't feel obligated to read every article word-for-word. Skim headlines, summaries, and intros to get a sense of the content. If an article catches your attention, dive deeper.\n4. **Create a reading schedule**: Allocate a specific time each week to read The New Yorker. This could be during your daily commute, lunch break, or before bed. Consistency is key to staying on top of weekly magazines.\n5. **Consider digital access**: If you're feeling overwhelmed by the physical magazine, consider switching to a digital subscription. You can access The New Yorker's digital edition on their website or through their app, which might make it easier to manage your reading.\n6. **Let go of guilt**: Remember that it's okay to not read every issue from cover to cover. If you miss an issue or two, don't stress about it. You can always catch up or move on to the next issue.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can enjoy The New Yorker without feeling overwhelmed. If you find that you're still struggling to keep up, it might be worth reassessing whether the subscription is right for you.\n\nNow, go ahead and sort through your other magazines, including Juxtapoz, which sounds like a great find!",
