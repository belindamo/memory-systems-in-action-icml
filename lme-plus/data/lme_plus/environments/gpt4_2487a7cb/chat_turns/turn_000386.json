  "content": "To help you with the math, let's first clarify that you want to compress the largest face of the LiFePO4 battery cell, which is the face with dimensions 205mm (height) x 174mm (width).\n\nLet's assume you want to compress the cell by a certain percentage, say x%. The new dimensions of the cell after compression will be (205mm \\* (1 - x/100)) x (174mm \\* (1 - x/100)).\n\nIf you want to find the x% of compression needed to meet specific dimensions, you'll need to provide the target dimensions of the compressed cell.\n\nOnce you have the target dimensions, you can set up an equation for both the height and width, then solve for x.",
