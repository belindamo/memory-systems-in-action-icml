Attend volunteer fairs: Many communities host volunteer fairs to connect individuals with organizations that need volunteers. Attend these fairs to explore your options and learn more about different organizations.\n\n4. Consider virtual opportunities: In this era of COVID-19, many organizations have shifted their volunteering activities online. You can check out virtual volunteer opportunities such as joining a virtual tutoring program or assisting a nonprofit\u2019s social media campaign.\n\n5.
