Here are some tips to help you do it effectively:\n\n**Combining Sales, Coupons, and Cashback Apps:**\n\n1. **Plan ahead**: Check the weekly ads for your local stores and plan your shopping trip around the items that are on sale. Make a list of the items you need and the prices.\n2. **Match sales with coupons**: Look for coupons that match the items on your list and are valid during the sale period. You can use the sources I mentioned earlier to find coupons.\n3. **Check cashback apps**: Open your cashback apps, like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, or Checkout 51, and see if they offer rebates on the items you're planning to buy. Some apps may offer rebates on specific brands, while others may offer rebates on entire categories (e.g., \"any brand of laundry detergent\").\n4. **Stack your savings**: Combine the sale price with the coupon discount and the cashback rebate. This will give you the maximum savings.\n5. **Calculate your savings**: Before you head to the store, calculate the total cost of the items on your list, including the sale price, coupon discount, and cashback rebate. This will help you ensure you're getting the best deal.\n6. **Shop smart**: When you're at the store, make sure to buy the items on your list and follow the instructions for the cashback app (e.g., take a photo of your receipt).\n7. **Submit your rebate**: After you've purchased your items, submit your rebate through the cashback app. Make sure to follow the app's instructions for submitting receipts and claiming your rebate.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Digital coupons**: Some stores offer digital coupons that can be loaded onto your loyalty card or mobile app. These can be combined with cashback apps for even more savings.\n* **Store loyalty programs**: If you have a loyalty program card or app, be sure to use it when you shop. You may earn points or rewards that can be redeemed for future purchases.\n* **Price match policies**: Some stores offer price match policies, where they'll match a lower price offered by a competitor. If you find a lower price, be sure to ask the store to match it.\n* **Clearance sections**: Keep an eye out for clearance sections in stores, where you can often find deep discounts on items. Combine these with coupons and cashback apps for even more savings.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nLet's say you need to buy laundry detergent, and it's on sale for $3.99 at your local store. You have a coupon for $1 off, and Ibotta is offering a $0.50 rebate on laundry detergent. If you buy the detergent during the sale period, you'll pay $2.99 ($3.99 - $1 coupon). Then, you'll earn a $0.50 rebate from Ibotta, making your final cost $2.49.\n\nBy combining sales, coupons, and cashback apps, you can maximize your savings and stretch your budget further. Happy shopping!",
