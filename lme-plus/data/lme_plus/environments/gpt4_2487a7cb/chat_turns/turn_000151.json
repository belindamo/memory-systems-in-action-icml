Do you prefer books with a more scientific or research-based approach, or ones that are more spiritual or inspirational?\n3. Are you interested in books that offer practical, actionable advice, or ones that focus more on mindset shifts and personal growth?\n4. Are there any specific authors or books that you've enjoyed in the past and would like to find similar recommendations?\n5.
