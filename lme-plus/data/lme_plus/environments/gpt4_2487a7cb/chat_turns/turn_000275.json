Spinners and power bait are a classic combination for trout fishing, and they can be very effective.\n\nSince you're saving the new bass lure for another trip, I'm curious - what made you choose that particular lure, and what do you hope to catch with it?\n\nAlso, have you considered trying any new techniques or presentations with your spinners and power bait? Sometimes, a small tweak in your approach can make a big difference in your catch rate.\n\n(By the way, I hope you don't mind me asking, but I'm just an AI, I don't have any access to your online order history or personal info. I'm just curious about your fishing adventures!)",
