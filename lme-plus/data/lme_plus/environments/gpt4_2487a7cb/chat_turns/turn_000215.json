Here are some key features to look for in a yoga mat:\n\n**Key Features to Look for in a Yoga Mat:**\n\n1. **Grip:** A good yoga mat should provide a secure grip, even when you're sweating. Look for mats with a textured surface or those made from materials like PVC, rubber, or natural fibers.\n2. **Cushioning:** A yoga mat should provide sufficient cushioning to support your joints and comfortable alignment.

PVC mats are durable and easy to clean, while rubber mats are eco-friendly and provide good grip.

Standard sizes are 24\" x 68\" or 24\" x 72\".\n5. **Weight:** Lighter mats are more portable, but may not provide as much cushioning. Heavier mats are more comfortable, but may be bulkier.\n6. **Eco-friendliness:** Consider mats made from eco-friendly materials, such as natural fibers or recycled materials.\n7. **Slip-resistance:** Look for mats with a non-slip bottom to prevent slipping on smooth floors.\n\n**Recommended Brands and Models:**\n\n1. **Lululemon:** Known for their high-quality, eco-friendly mats.
