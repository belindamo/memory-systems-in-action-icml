Regular auditing: City officials conduct regular audits to ensure that microfilm records are accurate and up-to-date. During these audits, they may compare the microfilm records with other documents to ensure consistency and identify any discrepancies.\n\n2. Access control: Access to microfilm records is typically restricted to authorized personnel only. This helps to prevent unauthorized changes or tampering of records.\n\n3. Backup systems: Cities often have backup systems in place to safeguard microfilm records in case of data loss or damage. These backup systems may include physical copies, digital backups, or both.\n\n4. Encryption: To further protect the security of microfilm records, cities may use encryption and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.\n\nIn summary, while there is no foolproof way to prevent tampering or ensure absolute accuracy, cities have various measures in place to safeguard the accuracy and security of microfilm records used in property transactions.",
