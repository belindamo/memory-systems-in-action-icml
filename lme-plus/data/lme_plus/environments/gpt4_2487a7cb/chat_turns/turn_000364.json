For example:\n\t* Food and Beverages often have many coupons for various products\n\t* Household and Personal Care items tend to have frequent coupon releases\n3. **High-value coupons**: Identify categories with high-value coupons (e.g., $1 off or more) or those with a high percentage discount (e.g., 20% off). These can make a significant impact on your savings.\n4. **Personal needs and preferences**: Consider categories that align with your dietary requirements, allergies, or personal preferences, such as:\n\t* Gluten-free or specialty food products\n\t* Organic or natural personal care items\n\t* Baby or pet products (if applicable)\n5. **Sales cycles**: Be aware of categories with predictable sales cycles, like:\n\t* Back-to-school supplies (July-September)\n\t* Holiday-themed items (e.g., Halloween costumes, Christmas decorations)\n\t* Seasonal products (e.g., winter clothing, summer toys)\n\n**Tips for categorization:**\n\n1. **Start with broad categories**: Begin with general categories like Food, Household, and Personal Care, and then break them down into sub-categories as needed.\n2. **Create a 'Hot List'**: Identify your top 5-10 most frequently used categories and prioritize those first. This will help you focus on the areas where you can save the most money.\n3. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your coupon collection and adjust your categorization system as needed.
