  "content": "It is true that corrupt city officials could potentially manipulate microfilm records for their own gain. However, there are measures in place to help prevent this from happening and to ensure that any attempts at tampering are caught and dealt with appropriately.\n\nFirstly, there is typically a system of checks and balances in place governing the microfilm record-keeping process. This means that multiple individuals or departments are involved in record-keeping, which helps to prevent any single person from making unauthorized changes or deletions.\n\nSecondly, there are often strict protocols and procedures in place for creating and maintaining microfilm records. This helps to ensure that records are created accurately and securely, and that any changes can be easily tracked and traced if necessary.\n\nThirdly, many cities have established regulatory bodies or oversight committees to monitor the actions of city officials and prevent corruption or unethical behavior. These bodies may have the authority to investigate complaints related to microfilm records and take corrective action if necessary.\n\nOverall, while no system is completely immune to corruption, cities have put in place multiple measures to safeguard the integrity of microfilm records used in property transactions, and to ensure that any attempted tampering is detected and dealt with quickly.",
