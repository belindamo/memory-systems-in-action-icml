I'll also try to make it a habit by doing it at the same time every week, like during my Sunday morning coffee routine. Additionally, I might enlist the help of a friend who's also trying to declutter their space, and we can hold each other accountable and share tips.\n\nI'm also thinking of treating myself to a new magazine or book every time I reach a certain milestone, like organizing a certain number of issues or canceling a subscription that's no longer serving me. That way, I'll have something to look forward to and stay motivated to maintain my system.\n\nWhat do you think about setting up a \"magazine free zone\" in my living room, like a coffee table or reading nook, where I can relax and enjoy my magazines without worrying about clutter? Would that be a good idea?",
