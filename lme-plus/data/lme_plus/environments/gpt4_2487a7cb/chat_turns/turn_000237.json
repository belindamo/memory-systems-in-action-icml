As a friendly AI, I have to break it to you that fly fishing and spinnerbaits don't quite mix.\n\nFly fishing is a specific type of fishing that involves using a specialized rod and line to cast a lightweight lure, called a fly, which imitates the natural insects or baitfish that fish feed on. Fly rods are designed to cast a very light line and a small, delicate fly, and are typically used to target species such as trout, salmon, and panfish.\n\nSpinnerbaits, on the other hand, are a type of lure that is typically used with spinning or baitcasting gear, and are designed to imitate a injured baitfish or other prey. They are often used to target species such as bass, pike, and muskie.\n\nUsing a chartreuse spinnerbait on a fly rod would not be effective, and might even damage the rod or line. Fly rods are not designed to handle the weight and momentum of a spinnerbait, and the line is not strong enough to handle the force of a fish fighting against a spinnerbait.\n\nIf you're planning to try out your new fly rod, I'd be happy to help you choose a suitable fly and provide some tips on how to use it effectively. Could you tell me a bit more about the type of fishing you're planning to do and the species you're targeting?",
