  "content": "Based on our discussion, the statement of problem can be summarized as follows:\n\nTax collection in sub-Saharan African countries has been facing various challenges such as limited resources, poor infrastructure, high levels of corruption, and low levels of tax compliance. These challenges have resulted in low tax revenue collection, which in turn has affected government budgets and the provision of public services. The implementation of digitalization in tax administration has been slow, with challenges such as lack of awareness, limited access to technology, and insufficient technical skills. Other challenges include inadequate cadastre registration of assets, poor self-assessment practices, weak enforcement through audits and investigations, and low compliance monitoring. These challenges have hindered the effectiveness of tax administration and collection in sub-Saharan African countries, leading to a need for policy interventions and reform measures.",
