  "content": "Both the Manduka eKO SuperLite and the Hugger Mugger Para Rubber Yoga Mat are known for their excellent grip, even when you're sweating a lot. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Manduka eKO SuperLite:**\n\n* The eKO SuperLite has a textured surface with a subtle ridged pattern that provides excellent grip, even when you're sweating.\n* The natural rubber compound used in the mat is also slightly tacky, which helps to prevent slipping and sliding.\n* Many yogis have reported that the eKO SuperLite performs well in hot yoga sessions, with minimal slipping or bunching up.\n* However, some users have mentioned that the grip can be slightly compromised when the mat is brand new, but it tends to improve over time as the mat breaks in.\n\n**Hugger Mugger Para Rubber Yoga Mat:**\n\n* The Para Rubber Yoga Mat has a textured surface with a more pronounced ridged pattern than the eKO SuperLite, which provides extra grip and traction.\n* The natural rubber used in the mat is also very tacky, making it ideal for hot yoga sessions where you're sweating a lot.\n* Many users have reported that the Para Rubber Yoga Mat provides excellent grip, even in the most challenging poses, and that it stays sticky and grippy even when wet.\n* Some users have mentioned that the mat can be a bit slippery when it's brand new, but it tends to develop a better grip over time as it's used and broken in.\n\nBoth mats are designed to provide excellent grip, but the Hugger Mugger Para Rubber Yoga Mat might have a slight edge in this department due to its more pronounced texture and tackier surface. However, the Manduka eKO SuperLite is still a great choice for hot yoga sessions, and its grip is more than sufficient for most yogis.\n\nIt's worth noting that both mats are open-cell construction, which means they can absorb sweat and provide better grip. However, this also means they may require more maintenance and cleaning than closed-cell mats.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these mats, or are you ready to make a decision?",
