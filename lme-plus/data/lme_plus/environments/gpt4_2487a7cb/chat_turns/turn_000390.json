  "content": "I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Since the compression is being applied to two faces of the cell, the force distribution should be factored in accordingly.\n\nThe compression is applied by the steel plates on both the largest faces of the cell, which means the force exerted by the rods will be evenly distributed across both faces. The total force applied to the cell is still 300 kgf, and there are four rods. However, since there are two faces, we need to divide the force per rod by 2.\n\nForce per rod (in kgf) = (300 kgf / 4) / 2\nForce per rod (in kgf) = 75 kgf / 2\nForce per rod (in kgf) = 37.5 kgf\n\nNow, convert the force per rod to Newtons:\n\nForce per rod (in Newtons) = 37.5 kgf \\* 9.81 N/kgf\nForce per rod (in Newtons) = 367.875 N\n\nSince there are four rods, the total force applied to the cell is:\n\nTotal force (in Newtons) = 4 \\* 367.875 N\nTotal force (in Newtons) = 1,471.5 N\n\nThe area of the largest face of the cell remains the same:\n\nArea = 205mm \\* 174mm\nArea = 35,670 mm\u00b2\n\nConvert the area to square meters for pressure calculation:\n\nArea (in m\u00b2) = 35,670 mm\u00b2 \\* (1 m\u00b2 / 1,000,000 mm\u00b2)\nArea (in m\u00b2) = 0.03567 m\u00b2\n\nNow, calculate the pressure applied to each face of the cell:\n\nPressure = Total force (in Newtons) / Area (in m\u00b2)\nPressure = 1,471.5 N / 0.03567 m\u00b2\nPressure \u2248 41,234.5 Pa (Pascals)\n\nSo, the pressure applied to each face of the cell is approximately 41,234.5 Pa. This accounts for the compression being applied to the two largest faces of the LiFePO4 battery cell.",
