Reading 2-3 articles per issue is a manageable and achievable target, and it'll help you stay engaged with the content without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nRegarding digital access, that's a great idea! If you're already comfortable reading The New York Times online, you might find it convenient to access The New Yorker digitally as well. Many magazines offer digital subscriptions or apps that allow you to access current and past issues, which can help declutter your physical space.\n\nNow, about organizing your magazines by category \u2013 that's an excellent idea! Categorizing your magazines can help you see what types of content you're interested in and make it easier to decide which ones to keep or cancel. Here are some potential categories you could use:\n\n* Art and Culture (e.g., Juxtapoz, Art in America)\n* News and Politics (e.g., The New Yorker, The Economist)\n* Entertainment (e.g., Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone)\n* Lifestyle and Wellness (e.g., Self, Bon App\u00e9tit)\n* Hobbies and Interests (e.g., gardening, cooking, or sports magazines)\n\nOrganizing your magazines by category can also help you identify patterns or areas where you might be over-subscribed. For instance, if you have multiple magazines in the same category, you might consider consolidating or canceling some to simplify your collection.\n\nRemember, the key is to create a system that works for you and your reading habits. Experiment with different categories and see what makes the most sense for your magazine collection.\n\nHow do you think you'll organize your magazines? Will you use a bookshelf, baskets, or something else to store them?",
