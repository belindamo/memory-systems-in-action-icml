Here are some tips to help you communicate insights from data visualization to non-technical stakeholders:\n\n**1. Know your audience:** Understand who your stakeholders are, what they care about, and what they want to achieve. Tailor your communication to their needs and interests.\n\n**2. Focus on the story:** Instead of just presenting data, focus on the story the data tells. Identify the key insights, and structure your communication around them.\n\n**3. Keep it simple:** Avoid using technical jargon or complex statistical terms. Use simple, clear language that non-technical stakeholders can understand.\n\n**4. Use visual hierarchy:** Organize your visualization to guide the viewer's attention. Use colors, sizes, and positions to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n\n**5. Provide context:** Give your stakeholders context about the data, such as what it represents, how it was collected, and any limitations.\n\n**6. Highlight key insights:** Use annotations, labels, or other visual cues to draw attention to the most important insights or trends.\n\n**7. Avoid information overload:** Don't overwhelm your stakeholders with too much data or too many visualizations. Focus on the most important insights and present them clearly.\n\n**8. Use interactive visualizations:** Interactive visualizations can help stakeholders explore the data in more detail, but make sure they're not too complex or overwhelming.\n\n**9. Provide recommendations:** Instead of just presenting insights, provide actionable recommendations based on your analysis. This will help stakeholders understand what they can do with the insights.\n\n**10. Practice your communication:** Rehearse your presentation to ensure you can effectively communicate your insights within a reasonable time frame.\n\n**11. Use a clear and concise title:** Use a clear and concise title that summarizes the main insight or finding. This will help stakeholders quickly understand the purpose of the visualization.\n\n**12. Use a narrative structure:** Use a narrative structure to present your insights, such as setting up a problem, presenting the analysis, and concluding with recommendations.\n\nSome additional resources to help you improve your data visualization communication skills:\n\n* **Data Visualization Checklist**: A comprehensive checklist by FlowingData to ensure your visualizations are effective.\n* **Presenting Data Effectively**: A book by Stephanie Evergreen that provides guidance on presenting data to non-technical stakeholders.\n* **Data Story: Explain Data and Inspire Action Through Story**: A book by Nancy Duarte that focuses on using storytelling principles to communicate data insights.\n\nBy following these tips and resources, you'll be well on your way to effectively communicating insights from data visualization to non-technical stakeholders. Good luck!",
