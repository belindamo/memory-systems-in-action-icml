      "content": "Compliance monitoring is an important component of tax administration. It involves the systematic review and analysis of taxpayers' compliance with tax laws and regulations, as well as the identification of areas where compliance can be improved. In Sub-Saharan Africa, compliance monitoring is often hindered by inadequate resources, lack of access to information, and limited capacity to effectively target high-risk taxpayers (Bird & Zolt, 2019). This leads to low levels of tax compliance, which in turn affects revenue generation and the provision of public goods and services.\n\nOne approach to addressing these challenges is through the use of technology, particularly digitalization of tax administration. Digitalization can help improve compliance monitoring by enabling tax authorities to better track taxpayer activities, identify noncompliance, and deploy resources more effectively (OECD, 2019). However, digitalization also poses its own challenges, including the need for strong data protection and privacy regulations, the need for robust IT infrastructure, and the risk of excluding vulnerable populations who lack access to digital technologies (Kariuki & Kihoro, 2020).\n\nIn summary, the problem of low tax compliance in Sub-Saharan Africa is closely linked to the challenges of compliance monitoring, which can be addressed through the use of technology, but also poses its own challenges. These issues require further research and practical solutions to effectively promote tax compliance in the region.\n\nReferences:\n\nBird, R., & Zolt, E. M. (2019).

      "content": "Based on our discussion, the statement of problem can be summarized as follows:\n\nTax collection in sub-Saharan African countries has been facing various challenges such as limited resources, poor infrastructure, high levels of corruption, and low levels of tax compliance. These challenges have resulted in low tax revenue collection, which in turn has affected government budgets and the provision of public services. The implementation of digitalization in tax administration has been slow, with challenges such as lack of awareness, limited access to technology, and insufficient technical skills. Other challenges include inadequate cadastre registration of assets, poor self-assessment practices, weak enforcement through audits and investigations, and low compliance monitoring. These challenges have hindered the effectiveness of tax administration and collection in sub-Saharan African countries, leading to a need for policy interventions and reform measures."

      "content": "I apologize for any confusion. Here is a more structured summary of the statement of problem for this study:\n\nThis study examines the challenges facing tax administration in sub-Saharan Africa with a focus on the digitization of tax collection. The problem of inadequate tax collection in the region is compounded by several factors, including ineffective cadastre registration of assets, weak self-assessment mechanisms, inadequate compliance enforcement through audit and investigation, and limited access to tax appeal tribunal judgments. The study will investigate how the digitalization of tax administration exacerbates or mitigates these challenges, with the aim of providing policy recommendations for enhancing tax collection in the region."
