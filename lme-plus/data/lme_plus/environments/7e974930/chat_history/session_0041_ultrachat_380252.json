      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or feelings, but I can share that one of Michael Phelps' most iconic races was in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where he won the 100-meter butterfly by just 0.01 seconds, upsetting his rival Milorad \u010cavi\u0107 of Serbia. This race was particularly memorable because Phelps' goggles started to fill with water during the race, which could have cost him the gold medal, but he managed to persevere and win by the smallest of margins. The race was a testament to Phelps' incredible talent, determination, and composure under pressure."
