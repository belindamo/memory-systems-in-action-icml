She has cashed in her contract twice, once in 2018 to win the SmackDown Women's Championship and once in 2020 to win the 24/7 Championship. Other wrestlers who have cashed in their contracts more than once include Edge, CM Punk, and Seth Rollins, who have all had successful cash-ins twice."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, it definitely was a huge moment for Carmella, as well as for the history of Money in the Bank cash-ins. She became the first woman to successfully cash in the contract, and it was a significant moment for women's wrestling in WWE."

      "content": "I also remember when Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract during the main event of WrestleMania 31. It was a surprise move, and he went on to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship!"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, that was a memorable moment for sure! Seth Rollins' cash-in was one of the most dramatic and surprising cash-ins in Money in the Bank history. After the main event match between Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns, Rollins' music hit and he ran down to the ring with his Money in the Bank briefcase. He cashed it in mid-match, turning the singles match into a triple threat match, and eventually won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, making it his first world championship reign in WWE."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, that WrestleMania moment was insane! I never saw it coming, and it really solidified Seth's place as a top superstar in WWE."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Definitely, Seth Rollins' cash-in at WrestleMania 31 was a game-changing moment for his career and really helped establish him as a top superstar in the company. It was a perfect example of how the Money in the Bank contract can be a game-changer for a wrestler's career and can make a huge impact on the outcome of a match or even an entire pay-per-view event."
