Some manufacturers may suggest replacing the air filter every 15,000 to 30,000 miles.\n3. **Visual inspection**:\n\t* Take a look at your air filter every 10,000 to 15,000 miles. If it's dirty, clogged, or shows signs of wear, it's time to replace it.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, most car manufacturers recommend replacing the air filter every 15,000 to 20,000 miles. However, it's always best to consult your owner's manual or speak with a trusted mechanic for personalized advice.\n\nRemember, a dirty air filter can decrease your car's performance, fuel efficiency, and overall health.
