  "content": "Yes, medieval knights often had multiple sets of armor for different types of battles or situations. They might have armor that was lighter and more mobile for cavalry charges or for movement in rough terrain, or heavier armor for pitched battles on foot. Additionally, knights would often have armor with different levels of protection depending on the type of enemy they were facing. \n\nFor example, if a knight was facing enemies armed with swords or other bladed weapons, he might choose to wear armor with a reinforced breastplate or thicker gauntlets to provide greater protection. Similarly, knights facing enemies armed with crossbows or other ranged weapons might wear armor with more extensive coverage to protect vulnerable areas such as the neck or armpits. \n\nFinally, knights might also have specialized armor for specific types of battles, such as siege warfare or jousting tournaments. Jousting armor, for example, was designed to be heavy and thick to protect the knight during the fast-paced and high-impact contests, while siege armor was designed to be more mobile and allow the knight to move and fight in cramped spaces.",
