  "content": "I'm actually a big fan of indie-rock and alternative music. I recently attended a music festival at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland, which featured a lineup of amazing indie-rock bands. Specifically, I went to see The 1975 perform live, and their set was absolutely mind-blowing. I was a bit worried about the weather, since it was forecasted to rain, but luckily, the rain held off until the very end of the festival.",
