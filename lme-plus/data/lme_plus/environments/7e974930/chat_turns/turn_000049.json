This will allow your fly to move naturally along the rock face, rather than bouncing off.\n2. **Use a Streamer**: Streamers are great for targeting rocks, as they can be retrieved quickly and aggressively to imitate a baitfish fleeing from the structure.\n3. **Vary Your Retrieve**: Vary your retrieve to match the rock structure.
