Close reading: This method involves a detailed analysis of the language, imagery, and other literary techniques used in a particular text to explore its representation of the natural world and the relationship between humans and the environment.\n2. Historical and cultural context analysis: Ecocritics often place literary texts within the historical and cultural context in which they were written in order to understand the ways in which the work reflects and shapes societal attitudes towards the environment.\n3. Environmental science and ecology analysis: This method draws on the knowledge of environmental science and ecology to understand the representation of the natural world in literature.\n4. Comparative analysis: Ecocritics often compare texts written in different historical periods or cultural contexts to explore the ways in which the representation of nature and the human-environment relationship has changed over time.\n5. Ethnographic and fieldwork: This method involves studying the relationship between people and the environment by observing people in the field and conducting interviews with them.\n6. Discourse analysis: This method involves analyzing the language and discourse used in literary texts and other cultural productions in order to understand the ways in which they construct and reinforce certain views of the environment.\n\nAll these research methods are used to understand the representation of the natural world in literature and the ways in which these representations shape and reflect societal attitudes towards the environment.",
