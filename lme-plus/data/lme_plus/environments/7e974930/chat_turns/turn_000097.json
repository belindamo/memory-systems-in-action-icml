  "content": "The length of stay for the crew may vary based on the nature of the mission, the route, and the destination. If the mission involves long distances or an extended period at sea, the crew may stay on board for several weeks, months or even many years. \n\nOn-board the Fram ship, expeditions in the Arctic usually last from a few weeks to several months. In rare cases, crews may stay on board for up to a year. During these expeditions, the crew may have to work long hours, taking turns with regular breaks to manage the ship, cargo handling, and scientific research.\n\nThe crew's physical and mental well-being are essential, and they need to be fit enough to carry out their responsibilities effectively. To ensure their health and safety, the crew usually receives specific training in survival skills, coping with isolation, and adapting to extreme weather and environment conditions.\n\nThe duration of stay on the ship and work schedules would depend largely on the specific mission and operating requirements.",
