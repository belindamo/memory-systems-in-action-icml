  "content": "The Fujifilm X-T30 II is a fantastic camera, and its autofocus system is one of its standout features.\n\nThe X-T30 II features Fujifilm's advanced autofocus system, which is based on a hybrid architecture that combines phase-detection and contrast-detection methods. This system is called the \"Intelligent Hybrid AF\" system.\n\nHere are some key benefits of the X-T30 II's autofocus system:\n\n1. **Fast and accurate**: The X-T30 II's autofocus is incredibly fast, with a response time of just 0.02 seconds. It's also highly accurate, with a success rate of around 99% according to Fujifilm's tests.\n2. **425 phase-detection points**: The camera features a massive 425 phase-detection points, which cover almost 100% of the frame. This allows for fast and accurate tracking of subjects, even when they're moving quickly.\n3. **Advanced subject tracking**: The X-T30 II has an advanced subject tracking algorithm that uses artificial intelligence to predict and track subjects. This allows the camera to maintain focus on your subject, even when they're moving erratically or partially obscured.\n4. **Face and eye detection**: The camera features advanced face and eye detection capabilities, which can detect and track faces and eyes in real-time. This is particularly useful for portrait photography.\n5. **Low-light performance**: The X-T30 II's autofocus system performs exceptionally well in low light, with a minimum working range of -3EV. This means you can focus accurately in conditions as low as -3 stops below 0EV.\n6. **Customizable autofocus**: You can customize the autofocus system to suit your shooting style, with options like zone focusing, wide/tracking, and single-point AF.\n\nIn practice, the X-T30 II's autofocus system is incredibly reliable and fast. It's capable of tracking fast-moving subjects like birds in flight, and it's also excellent for portrait photography, where accurate eye detection is crucial.\n\nOverall, the Fujifilm X-T30 II's autofocus system is one of the best in its class, and it's a major advantage for photographers who need to capture sharp images quickly and accurately.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the X-T30 II's autofocus system, or would you like to know more about its other features?",
