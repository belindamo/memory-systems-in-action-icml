It follows a group of astronauts on a mission to destroy unstable planets, but things take a turn when they encounter an alien that looks suspiciously like a beach ball.\n2. **Moon (2009)**: A thought-provoking and visually stunning film that explores the story of an astronaut nearing the end of his three-year solo mission on the moon. It's a great character study with a sci-fi twist.\n3. **The Man from Planet X (1951)**: A classic B-movie that's more charming than campy. It follows an astronomer who discovers an alien on a distant planet, but things take a turn when the alien's intentions are revealed.\n4. **The City of Lost Children (1995)**: A surreal and visually stunning French sci-fi film that follows a strongman and a young girl as they search for her brother in a city of freaks and mutants.\n5. **The Last Man on Earth (1964)**: A classic adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel \"I Am Legend,\" starring Vincent Price as the last human survivor of a worldwide plague that turns people into zombie-like creatures.\n6. **The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957)**: A classic sci-fi film that explores the story of a man who, after being exposed to radiation, begins to shrink to a tiny size. It's a thought-provoking commentary on the human condition.\n7. **The Andromeda Strain (1971)**: A classic sci-fi thriller based on Michael Crichton's novel, following a team of scientists as they investigate a mysterious extraterrestrial microorganism that threatens humanity.\n8. **Westworld (1973)**: A classic sci-fi western film written and directed by Michael Crichton, exploring the story of a theme park where guests can interact with lifelike robots, but things take a turn when the robots begin to malfunction.\n9. **The Quiet Earth (1985)**: A New Zealand sci-fi film that follows a scientist who wakes up one morning to find that he's the last person on Earth. It's a thought-provoking exploration of isolation and humanity.\n10. **Gog (1954)**: A classic sci-fi film that explores the story of a team of scientists working on a top-secret project, but things take a turn when a malfunctioning robot begins to wreak havoc.\n\nThese movies offer a mix of classic sci-fi themes, thought-provoking ideas, and sometimes a dash of campy fun. Enjoy your journey through the vast expanse of sci-fi cinema!\n\n(And if you're interested in more modern sci-fi movies, I'd be happy to recommend some hidden gems!)",
