  "content": "As MK lies weak and dehydrated on the ground, he suddenly sees a monkey approaching. It's not Wukong, but another monkey he doesn't recognize. The monkey tosses a small bundle towards MK and runs off without a word.\n\nMK eagerly crawls over to the bundle and opens it up to find a few pieces of fruit and a small container of water. He drinks greedily from the container, the cool liquid soothing his parched throat.\n\nAs he eats the fruit, MK can't help but wonder why Wukong suddenly decided to give him some food and water. Was it out of kindness, or was there some other motive behind it?\n\nDespite his suspicions, MK is grateful for the small amount of sustenance. He finishes the fruit and water quickly and then curls up on the ground, trying to ignore the hunger pangs that still gnaw at his stomach.",
