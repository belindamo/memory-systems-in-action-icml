  "content": "MK could hear the sounds of monkeys chattering and giggling, plates clinking and food being devoured. The sound of their party only made his hunger pangs even worse.\n\nDesperate for food, he tried to break the barrier again. But it was no use. The magic was too strong, and he was too weak. He fell back against the wall, panting and sweating.\n\nSuddenly, the noise outside grew louder. It sounded like they were getting closer to his prison. MK scrambled to his feet, heart racing with hope. Maybe this was his chance to escape.\n\nHe pressed his ear to the wall, trying to listen for any clues. But all he could hear was the sound of music and laughter. It was no use.\n\nDefeated, he slumped back down to the ground. The hunger pains were unbearable now. He clutched his stomach and closed his eyes, willing the pain to go away.\n\nHours passed, and the noise outside eventually died down. MK was left alone again, hungry, thirsty, and trapped.",
