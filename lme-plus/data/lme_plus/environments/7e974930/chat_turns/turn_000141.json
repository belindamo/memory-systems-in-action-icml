  "content": "Yes, there are several things on a scale of around 10^-18 meters. For example:\n\n* The size of a typical atomic nucleus is around 10^-15 meters to 10^-14 meters in diameter.\n* The size of a typical electron is around 10^-18 meters to 10^-17 meters in radius.\n* The size of a typical proton is around 10^-18 meters in diameter.\n\nThese sizes are all much, much smaller than the equivalent size of the Earth in the universe-as-a-soccer-stadium analogy, and highlight the incredibly small scale at which subatomic particles exist.",
