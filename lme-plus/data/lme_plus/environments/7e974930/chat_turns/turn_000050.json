  "content": "MK looks up at Wukong, feeling the weight of the monkey king's glare as it bore into him. He shivered, wondering what the monkey king had in store for him next.\n\n\"Why do you want the diamond snare?\" MK asked, hoping to distract Wukong from his current predicament.\n\nWukong's lips twisted into a sneer. \"That's none of your concern,\" he said. \"What matters is that I need it, and you're going to tell me where to find it.\"\n\nMK shook his head. \"I don't know where it is,\" he said. \"I only know the old stories.\"\n\nWukong's expression darkened. \"You're lying,\" he said, advancing on MK. \"You humans are always lying. But I have ways of making you tell the truth.\"\n\nHe raised a hand, and a bolt of lightning shot from his fingertips, striking the barrier and sending sparks flying.\n\nMK recoiled, pressing himself against the barrier, as Wukong continued to advance.\n\n\"Please,\" MK said, desperation in his voice. \"I don't know where it is. I swear.\"\n\nWukong chuckled. \"You humans are so pathetic,\" he said. \"You can't even defend yourselves.\"\n\nWith that, he launched himself at MK, his fists slamming into the barrier with a force that shook the ground.\n\nMK struggled to fight back, punching and kicking with all his might, but Wukong was too strong. He easily evaded MK's attacks, landing blow after blow.\n\nAs Wukong pummeled him, MK felt his energy begin to drain away. He knew he couldn't keep this up much longer.\n\n\"Stop!\" he cried out. \"Please!\"\n\nWukong stepped back, laughing.\n\n\"You're no match for me,\" he said. \"And you'll never escape this barrier, so you might as well cooperate.\"\n\nMK slumped against the barrier, gasping for breath.\n\n\"I don't know where it is,\" he said. \"Please believe me.\"\n\nWukong's eyes narrowed.\n\n\"I'll give you one more chance,\" he said. \"Tell me where the diamond snare is, or I'll make you regret it.\"",
