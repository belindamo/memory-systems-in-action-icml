They might have had a good experience with a particular shop.\n3. **Dealership Referral**: Reach out to your car's dealership and ask for a recommendation. They might have a preferred auto body shop or a list of trusted vendors.\n4. **Industry Certifications**: Look for shops with certifications from organizations like the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) or the Inter-Industry Conference on Auto Collision Repair (I-CAR).\n5. **Insurer-Approved Shops**: Check with your insurance provider to see if they have a list of approved auto body shops in your network.\n\nRemember to get quotes from multiple shops, ask about their experience with your car's make and model, and check their warranty and guarantee policies before making a decision.\n\nNow, back to your roof rack decision...
