The null hypothesis is that the means of the three populations are equal, and the alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the means is different.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sample means and standard deviations for each group:\n\nBrand A: Mean = (16+17+13+18)/4 = 16, Standard deviation = sqrt(((16-16)^2 + (17-16)^2 + (13-16)^2 + (18-16)^2)/3) = 2.08\nBrand B: Mean = (15+15+17+14)/4 = 15.25, Standard deviation = sqrt(((15-15.25)^2 + (15-15.25)^2 + (17-15.25)^2 + (14-15.25)^2)/3) = 1.50\nBrand C: Mean = (15+14+13+13)/4 = 13.75, Standard deviation = sqrt(((15-13.75)^2 + (14-13.75)^2 + (13-13.75)^2 + (13-13.75)^2)/3) = 0.96\n\nWe can now calculate the ANOVA test statistic:\n\nF = MS\\_between / MS\\_within\n\nwhere MS\\_between is the mean square between groups and MS\\_within is the mean square within groups.\n\nThe formula for MS\\_between is:\n\nMS\\_between = SS\\_between / (k-1)\n\nwhere SS\\_between is the sum of squares between groups and k is the number of groups.\n\nThe formula for MS\\_within is:\n\nMS\\_within = SS\\_within / (n-k)\n\nwhere SS\\_within is the sum of squares within groups and n is the total sample size.\n\nThe total sample size is 12, and the number of groups is 3. Therefore, the degrees of freedom for the ANOVA test are df\\_between = k-1 = 2 and df\\_within = n-k = 9.\n\nWe can calculate the sum of squares between groups as:\n\nSS\\_between = (4\\*(16-15.33)^2 + 4\\*(15.25-15.33)^2 + 4\\*(13.75-15.33)^2) = 18.92\n\nWe can calculate the sum of squares within groups as:\n\nSS\\_within = ((16-16)^2 + (17-16)^2 + (13-16)^2 + (18-16)^2 + (15-15.25)^2 + (15-15.25)^2 + (17-15.25)^2 + (14-15.25)^2 + (15-13.75)^2 + (14-13.75)^2 + (13-13.75)^2 + (13-13.75)^2) = 26.50\n\nWe can now calculate the mean square between and mean square within:\n\nMS\\_between = SS\\_between / (k-1) = 18.92 / 2 = 9.46\nMS\\_within = SS\\_within / (n-k) = 26.50 / 9 = 2.94\n\nFinally, we can calculate the F statistic:\n\nF = MS\\_between / MS\\_within = 9.46 / 2.94 = 3.22\n\nUsing an F distribution table with df\\_between = 2 and df\\_within = 9 at a significance level of 0.05, the critical value is 3.10.\n\nSince the calculated F value (3.22) is greater than the critical value (3.10), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in mean",
