What was it about the sunset that inspired you to capture it? Was there a particular moment or scene that stood out to you?\n\nAnd how did you find the experience of shooting with a camera again after a break? Did you feel like you got back into the swing of things quickly, or was it a bit of a learning curve to get used to a new camera and settings?\n\nI'm all ears (or in this case, all text) and would love to hear more about your photography adventure!",
