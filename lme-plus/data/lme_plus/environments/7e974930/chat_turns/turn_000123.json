Here's an example of how to modify the code to use the nullish coalescing operator:\n```csharp\nvar event_data = {\n    type: event.type,\n    data_uuid: event.target.attributes['data-uuid'].nodeValue,\n    value: event.target.value ?? ''\n};\n```\nIn this code, the nullish coalescing operator checks if `event.target.value` is null or undefined. If it is, it assigns an empty string (`''`) to `event_data.value` instead. If `event.target.value` is not null or undefined, it assigns its value to `event_data.value`.\n\nBy using the nullish coalescing operator in this way, you can ensure that `value` always has a value, even if `event.target.value` is null or undefined, which can help prevent errors in your code.",
