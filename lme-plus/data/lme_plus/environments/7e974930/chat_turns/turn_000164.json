April 1st, Earth Day Market: $25\n4. May 6th, Downtown Farmers Market: $350\n5. May 13th, Mother's Day Market: $200\n6. May 20th, Foodie Festival: $400\n\nTotal earnings: $220 + $85 + $25 + $350 + $200 + $400 = $1280\n\nSo, your total earnings from all the markets and events you've participated in so far this year are $1280.\n\nIf you'd like to calculate your net earnings, we can subtract your total expenses from this amount. Do you have a total expense figure you'd like to share, or would you like to break down the expenses for each event?",
