  "content": "That's correct, the `value` property is not an IDL attribute, even though it is related to the `value` attribute. The `value` property is a JavaScript property of the input element object, which can be accessed and modified through JavaScript code.\n\nOn the other hand, IDL attributes are part of the interface definition language for HTML elements and are used to define their properties and behaviors. IDL attributes are defined in the HTML specification and are typically used to set the initial values of HTML element properties when the element is loaded in the browser.\n\nSo while the `value` attribute is an IDL attribute that is used to set the initial value of an input element, the `value` property is a separate property of the input element object that can be accessed and modified through JavaScript code after the page has loaded.",
