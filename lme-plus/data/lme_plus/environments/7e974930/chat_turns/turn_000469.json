However, I have to say that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or attend events like the Foodie Festival, but I'm glad to hear that you had a great time and were able to clear out some old stock!\n\nNow, let's get down to business. Managing inventory can be a challenging task, especially when you have big orders coming in. Here are some tips to help you ensure you have enough stock:\n\n1. **Conduct a thorough inventory count**: Before you start receiving new stock, take stock of what you already have in your warehouse or storage area. This will give you an accurate picture of your current inventory levels.\n2. **Review your sales data**: Analyze your sales data from previous events or similar periods to get an idea of how much stock you typically sell. This will help you estimate how much stock you'll need for the upcoming events.\n3. **Forecast demand**: Based on your sales data and any other relevant factors (e.g., seasonal trends, promotions, or changes in demand), forecast how much stock you'll need for each event.\n4. **Create a stock replenishment plan**: Identify the stock levels that need to be replenished and prioritize them based on demand and lead time. Make sure to include a buffer stock to account for any unexpected demand or stockouts.\n5. **Communicate with suppliers**: Reach out to your suppliers to confirm lead times, pricing, and availability of stock. This will ensure that you receive your stock on time and in the quantities you need.\n6. **Use inventory management software**: Consider using inventory management software to help you track your stock levels, automate stock replenishment, and receive alerts when stock levels reach a certain threshold.\n7. **Monitor and adjust**: Continuously monitor your inventory levels and sales data during the events, and adjust your stock replenishment plan as needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well-prepared to manage your inventory and ensure you have enough stock for your upcoming events.\n\nDo you have any specific questions or concerns about managing your inventory?",
