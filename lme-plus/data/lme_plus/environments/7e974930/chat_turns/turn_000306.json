  "content": "Greenhouses regulate the pH levels of their soil by testing the pH levels of the soil regularly using a pH meter or a pH test kit. Based on the results of the test, the greenhouse staff can add or subtract certain elements to the soil to adjust the pH level to an optimal range for the specific plants or vegetables they are growing.\n\nFor example, if the pH level is too acidic, greenhouse staff may add lime to the soil to raise the pH level. If the pH level is too alkaline, they may add sulfur or peat moss to the soil to lower the pH level.\n\nGreenhouses may also use controlled-release fertilizers that are specifically formulated to slowly release nutrients into the soil over time, gradually adjusting pH levels as needed. Additionally, some greenhouses may use hydroponic systems, where plants are grown in a nutrient-rich water solution instead of soil. In these systems, pH levels can be regulated by adjusting the nutrients in the solution.",
