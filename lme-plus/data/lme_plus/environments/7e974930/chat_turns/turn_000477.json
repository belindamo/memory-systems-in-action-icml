  "content": "A points-based system with tiers is a great way to incentivize repeat business and reward loyal customers.\n\nOffering a sign-up bonus is an excellent idea to encourage people to join your program. It's a common practice to provide an initial incentive to get customers to sign up and start earning points. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Welcome points**: Award a set number of points to new members, which they can redeem immediately or use towards future purchases.\n2. **Discount on first purchase**: Offer a percentage off the customer's first purchase after joining the program.\n3. **Free product or service**: Provide a complimentary item or service to new members, such as a free candle or soap with their first purchase.\n4. **Exclusive access**: Give new members early access to sales, new products, or limited-time offers.\n\nThe sign-up bonus should be attractive enough to encourage people to join, but not so generous that it becomes costly for your business. You can also consider offering a limited-time promotion to create a sense of urgency and encourage people to join sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen designing your tiers, consider the following:\n\n1. **Tier levels**: Decide on the number of tiers and the requirements to reach each level (e.g., number of purchases, points earned, or amount spent).\n2. **Rewards and benefits**: Determine the exclusive rewards and benefits for each tier, such as increased point earning rates, free shipping, or early access to new products.\n3. **Tier names and branding**: Give each tier a unique name and branding to create a sense of progression and achievement.\n\nSome popular tier structures include:\n\n1. **Bronze, Silver, Gold**: A classic tier structure with increasing benefits at each level.\n2. **VIP, Premium, Elite**: A more exclusive structure with higher rewards and benefits at each level.\n3. **Level 1, Level 2, Level 3**: A simple, numbered structure with clear progression and benefits.\n\nRemember to communicate the benefits and requirements of each tier clearly to your customers, so they understand how to progress and what they can expect.\n\nHow do you plan to promote your loyalty program and encourage customers to join?",
