Wilson, an American literary critic and one of the leading figures in ecocriticism.\n\nThese quotes provide a glimpse of the main ideas and concerns of ecocriticism and how literature reflects, shapes, and challenges our perceptions of the natural world, and the ways in which our relationship to the environment is represented in literature.",
