I'll starve to death.\"\n\nWukong let out a deep sigh. \"You humans are always so weak. Can't go a few days without food, can you?\"\n\n\"I'm not asking for much,\" MK said, trying to keep his voice steady. \"Just a little bit of water and maybe some bread.\"\n\nWukong narrowed his eyes at him. \"Fine. But don't think this means I'm going to release you anytime soon.\"\n\nMK's heart leapt with relief as he watched Wukong snap his fingers. A few seconds later, a small bowl of water and a piece of stale bread appeared in front of him.\n\nMK eagerly reached for the bread, but Wukong grabbed his wrist and pulled it back. \"You eat too fast, you'll choke. Slow down.\"\n\nMK bit his lip and nodded, tearing off a small piece of the bread and chewing it slowly. It was dry and tasteless, but it was better than nothing.\n\n\"Can I have a little more?\" he asked after finishing the bread.\n\nWukong snorted. \"You're lucky you got that much. Don't push your luck.\"\n\nMK nodded, trying to keep his disappointment at bay. He knew he had to conserve the food and water, who knows when Wukong would decide to give him more.",
