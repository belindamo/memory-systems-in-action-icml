Why should I keep you alive?\"\n\nMK tried to think of a convincing argument. \"You said you needed insurance, right? I can be your insurance. If you let me go, I promise not to tell anyone what you're looking for or what you've done. And if you ever need me again, you can come find me.\"\n\nWukong raised an eyebrow. \"And why would I trust you?\"\n\nMK swallowed hard. \"Because... because I admire you. You're a legend. And I promise I won't let you down.\"\n\nWukong considered this for a moment, then sighed. \"Fine. I'll let you live. For now. But don't try to run away again or I'll kill you myself.\"\n\nMK let out a small sigh of relief as Wukong turned to leave. \"Thank you,\" he whispered to himself. He knew he still had a long way to go before he could escape, but at least he was alive for now.",
