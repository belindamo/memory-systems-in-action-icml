  "content": "To test for independence between the classification of welds based on X-ray inspection and appearance, we can perform a chi-squared test. The null hypothesis is that the two classifications are independent, and the alternative hypothesis is that they are dependent.\n\nThe test statistic for a chi-squared test of independence is:\n\nchi-squared = sum((O - E)^2 / E)\n\nwhere O is the observed frequency, E is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis, and the sum is taken over all categories.\n\nWe can calculate the expected frequencies assuming independence as:\n\nExpected frequency = (row total \\* column total) / grand total\n\nUsing the data provided, we can construct the following table:\n\n| X-ray | Appearance | Bad | Normal | Good | Row total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bad | Appearance | 20 | 7 | 3 | 30 |\n| Normal | Appearance | 13 | 51 | 16 | 80 |\n\n| Good | Appearance | 7 | 12 | 21 | 40 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Column | total | 40 | 70 | 40 | 150 |\n\nThe grand total is 150, which is the sum of all observed frequencies. To calculate the expected frequencies, we use the formula:\n\nExpected frequency = (row total \\* column total) / grand total\n\nFor example, the expected frequency for the first cell in the table is:\n\nExpected frequency = (30 \\* 40) / 150 = 8\n\nWe can calculate the expected frequencies for all cells in the table and obtain:\n\n| X-ray | Appearance | Bad | Normal | Good | Row total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bad | Appearance | 8 | 14 | 8 | 30 |\n| Normal | Appearance | 16 | 28 | 16 | 60 |\n\n| Good | Appearance | 8 | 14 | 8 | 30 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Column | total | 32 | 56 | 32 | 120 |\n\nWe can now calculate the test statistic:\n\nchi-squared = sum((O - E)^2 / E) = ((20-8)^2/8) + ((7-14)^2/14) + ... + ((21-8)^2/8) = 36.78\n\nThe degrees of freedom for the chi-squared test of independence are (number of rows - 1) \\* (number of columns - 1) = 2 \\* 2 = 4.\n\nUsing a chi-squared distribution table with 4 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.05, the critical value is 9.488.\n\nSince the test statistic (chi-squared = 36.78) is greater than the critical value (9.488), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant relationship between the classification of welds based on X-ray inspection and appearance.",
