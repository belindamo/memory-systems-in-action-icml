  "content": "Sure, here is a simple upper body workout that you can try:\n\n1. Push-ups: Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your feet hip-width apart. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the ground, then push back up to the starting position.\n2. Dumbbell rows: Hold a dumbbell in each hand and bend your knees slightly. Lean forward at the hips and let your arms hang straight down from your shoulders. Without moving your upper body, lift the dumbbells to your sides until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle. Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n3. Bicep curls: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward. Keeping your upper arms still, bend your elbows and curl the dumbbells up toward your shoulders. Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n4. Tricep dips: Sit on the edge of a bench or chair and place your hands on the edge next to your hips. Extend your legs out in front of you and slide your butt off the edge of the bench. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the ground. Push back up to the starting position.\n5. Shoulder press: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height. Press the dumbbells straight up over your head until your arms are fully extended. Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n\nRemember to start slow and gradually increase the difficulty of the workout as you become more comfortable with the exercises. It's also important to warm up before your workout and cool down after.",
