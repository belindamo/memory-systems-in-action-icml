  "content": "I think what drew me to natural dyeing is the idea of creating something unique and sustainable. I love the idea of using plants and natural materials to create art, and I think it adds an extra layer of meaning to the piece. Plus, I'm just really interested in the process of experimentation and discovery that comes with natural dyeing. I've heard it can be a bit unpredictable, but that's part of the fun, right?\n\nAs for projects, I'm not entirely sure yet. I think I'd like to start with some simple scarves or fabric pieces, just to get a feel for the process and see what kinds of colors and patterns I can create. From there, I might try incorporating naturally dyed fabrics into my mixed media pieces, or even creating some textile art pieces that showcase the natural dyes.\n\nI've also been thinking about trying to create some natural dye extracts or paints that I can use in my art. I've heard you can make all sorts of interesting colors",
