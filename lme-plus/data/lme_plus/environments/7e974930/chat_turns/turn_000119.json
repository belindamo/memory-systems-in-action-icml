  "content": "You're right that \"JavaScript property\" is a broad term that doesn't specifically capture the relationship between the property and the DOM.\n\nA more specific term for properties like `value` that are part of the DOM API would be \"DOM property\" or \"DOM element property\". These terms specifically refer to properties of HTML elements that are exposed through the DOM API and can be accessed and modified using JavaScript.\n\nBy using these terms, you can be more precise in your language and convey more accurately that the property is part of the HTML document's tree structure as represented by the DOM, and not just a generic JavaScript property.",
