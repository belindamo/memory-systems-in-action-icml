Using the sparkly shoes and t-shirt as part of the treasure hunt clues or prizes is a fantastic way to incorporate them into the game and make it even more special and meaningful for your niece.\n\nHere are a few ways you could use the sparkly shoes and t-shirt in the treasure hunt:\n\n* Hide the sparkly shoes as a clue, and attach a note that says something like, \"Follow the sparkles to the next clue!\"\n* Use the sparkly t-shirt as a treasure chest, and fill it with small prizes or treats for the kids to find.\n* Create a riddle that leads the kids to the sparkly shoes, and once they find them, they have to solve another riddle to figure out what to do next.\n* Make the sparkly shoes or t-shirt the final treasure, and have the kids work together to solve a series of clues to earn them.\n\nRemember to be creative and have fun with it! The more thought and effort you put into the treasure hunt, the more excited and engaged the kids will be.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your niece and her friends will have an absolute blast playing the Sparkly Treasure Hunt game!",
