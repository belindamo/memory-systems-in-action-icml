I went with my best friend, Rachel, and we had a blast singing along to every song. We even got a chance to meet Billie at the meet-and-greet session before the concert, and she was so down-to-earth and sweet. Anyway, back to food - I'm in the mood for some good seafood, do you have any recommendations near FedExField that serve fresh seafood?",
