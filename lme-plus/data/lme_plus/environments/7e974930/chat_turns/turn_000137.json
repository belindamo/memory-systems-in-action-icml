  "content": "The size of a soccer stadium can vary greatly depending on the specific stadium and its location. However, many professional soccer stadiums have a playing field that is approximately 100 yards (90 meters) long and about 50-70 yards (45-64 meters) wide. This would give a total playing area of around 7,000-10,000 square yards (5,000-7,000 square meters).\n\nIn addition to the playing field, a typical soccer stadium includes seating areas for spectators, concessions, restrooms, and other facilities. The total size of a stadium, including the seating area and other structures, can range from a few hundred thousand square feet to over 1 million square feet (tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of square meters).",
