Here are some tips to help you prepare the casserole in advance:\n\n**Refrigeration:**\n\n* Prepare the casserole up to the point where you're about to bake it (i.e., assemble the casserole, but don't bake it).\n* Cover the casserole tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours.\n* When you're ready to bake, remove the casserole from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking.\n* Bake the casserole at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is hot and bubbly.\n\n**Freezing:**\n\n* Prepare the casserole up to the point where you're about to bake it (i.e., assemble the casserole, but don't bake it).\n* Cover the casserole tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place it in a freezer-safe bag. Label the bag with the date and contents.\n* Freeze the casserole for up to 3 months.\n* When you're ready to bake, remove the casserole from the freezer and let it thaw overnight in the refrigerator.\n* Once thawed, bake the casserole at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is hot and bubbly.\n\nSome notes to keep in mind:\n\n* If you're freezing the casserole, you may need to adjust the baking time slightly, as the casserole will be cold when it goes into the oven. Just keep an eye on it and add a few extra minutes to the baking time if needed.\n* If you're refrigerating the casserole, make sure to let it come to room temperature before baking to ensure even cooking.\n* You can also prepare individual portions of the casserole in smaller ramekins or containers and refrigerate or freeze them for up to 3 months. This way, you can bake them as needed for a quick and easy meal.\n\nBy preparing the casserole ahead of time, you'll save yourself a lot of time and stress on the day of your family gathering. Just thaw or refrigerate the casserole according to your schedule, and bake it when you're ready to serve. Enjoy!",
