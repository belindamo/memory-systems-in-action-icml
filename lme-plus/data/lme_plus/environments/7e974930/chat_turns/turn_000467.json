  "content": "It's possible that the coolant was low due to a leaking or faulty creantimeal cap, or it could have sprayed out from the bleev-valve. It's difficult to say without a proper inspection of the klargen. I would recommend checking the creantimeal cap to make sure it's installed correctly and securely, and also inspecting the bleev-valve for any signs of damage or leakage. If you're not comfortable doing these inspections yourself, it's best to take your klargen to a qualified technician who can properly diagnose and repair the issue.",
