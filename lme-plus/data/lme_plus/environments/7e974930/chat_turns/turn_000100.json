  "content": "I'm actually more into landscape and nature photography. I don't have any lenses yet, so I'm open to investing in a kit lens or additional lenses later on. My budget is around $1,500 for the camera body and a lens. I'm not too particular about sensor size, as long as the image quality is good. Weather sealing would be a nice feature, but it's not a must-have. Size and weight aren't a big concern for me either, as I'm used to carrying my old DSLR around.",
