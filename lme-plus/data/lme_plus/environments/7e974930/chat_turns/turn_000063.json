It explores the ways in which literature reflects, shapes, and challenges our perceptions of the natural world, and the ways in which our relationship to the environment is represented in literature. Ecocriticism also considers the environmental impact of literary production and consumption. It draws on a wide range of disciplines, including literary theory, environmental science, cultural studies, and philosophy.",
