  "content": "Interdisciplinary scholarship involves bringing together different disciplines in order to study a particular topic or problem. It often involves synthesizing insights and methods from multiple fields in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the topic being studied. For example, an interdisciplinary study of climate change might draw on insights from atmospheric science, economics, sociology, and political science.\n\nTransdisciplinary scholarship, on the other hand, goes beyond interdisciplinarity by actively involving stakeholders and practitioners from various fields in the research process. It is a collaborative approach that involves multiple disciplines working together to co-create knowledge and solve real-world problems. Transdisciplinary scholarship aims to bridge the gap between academic research and practical application, and the goal is to achieve a deeper understanding of the problem and to generate solutions that can be implemented in the real world.\n\nIn simple terms, interdisciplinary scholarship is about combining different disciplines to study a problem, while transdisciplinary scholarship is about combining different disciplines to solve a problem.\n\nEcocriticism is an interdisciplinary field of study that involves literary studies, environmental studies, cultural studies, and other fields, which can also be seen as a transdisciplinary approach if it aims to generate solutions and engage stakeholders to address environmental issues.",
