  "content": "Here's a high-level example of how you could use a CNN to extract information from images of properties and a DNN to estimate their value:\n\n1. Data collection: Gather a dataset of images of properties and the corresponding property values.\n2. Image pre-processing: Pre-process the images to resize them to a uniform size, normalize their brightness and contrast, and convert them to grayscale or RGB.\n3. Feature extraction: Use a CNN to extract relevant features from the images, such as edges, textures, and shapes. The output of the CNN will be a high-dimensional feature vector for each image.\n4. Model training: Train a DNN on the feature vectors and property values to learn the relationship between the features and the property values. This can be done using regression algorithms, such as linear regression or decision trees, or more advanced techniques, such as neural networks.\n5. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the DNN on a separate dataset to determine its accuracy and make any necessary adjustments.\n6. Deployment: Integrate the CNN and DNN into your real estate app, allowing users to input images of properties and receive an estimated property value.\n\nThis is just a high-level example and there may be other steps involved in the process, depending on the specific requirements of your real estate app. The actual implementation will also depend on the programming language and libraries you choose to use.",
