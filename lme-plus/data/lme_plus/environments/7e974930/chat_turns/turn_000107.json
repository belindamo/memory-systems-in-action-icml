Fujifilm calls it \"moisture-resistant\" rather than fully weather-sealed. This means that the camera is designed to withstand some exposure to moisture and dust, but it's not as robust as some of the higher-end Fujifilm cameras like the X-T3 or X-H1.\n\nThat being said, the X-T30 II's moisture-resistant design should still provide some protection against light rain or mist, and it's definitely more resistant to the elements than a non-weather-sealed camera. However, it's still important to exercise caution when shooting in harsh weather conditions, and to clean the camera regularly to prevent any damage.\n\nNow, I'd love to hear more about your beach trip and the amazing shots you got! Sunsets are always a great subject, and I'm sure your new camera will help you capture even more stunning images. What was your favorite part about the trip, and what inspired you to pick up photography again?",
