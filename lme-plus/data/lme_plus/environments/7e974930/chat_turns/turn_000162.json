  "content": "I'd be happy to help you calculate your total earnings. To get started, can you please provide me with some information about the markets and events you've participated in so far this year? Please provide the following details for each market or event:\n\n1. Date of the event\n2. Total sales revenue (gross income) earned at the event\n3. Any expenses related to the event (e.g. booth rental, travel, materials, etc.)\n\nYou can share this information in a format that's easiest for you, such as a list, a table, or even just a paragraph describing each event. The more details you can provide, the more accurate I can be in calculating your total earnings.\n\nAdditionally, let me know if you'd like to calculate your net earnings (total sales minus total expenses) or just your gross earnings (total sales only).",
