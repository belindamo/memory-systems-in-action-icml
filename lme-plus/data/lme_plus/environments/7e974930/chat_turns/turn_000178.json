  "content": "To calculate the regression equations, we first need to calculate the deviations from the actual means of X and Y. We can use the following formulas:\n\nFor X deviations:\n\ndx = X - mean(X)\n\nFor Y deviations:\n\ndy = Y - mean(Y)\n\nUsing the given data, we can calculate the means of X and Y as follows:\n\nmean(X) = (10+12+13+12+16+15)/6 = 12.0\nmean(Y) = (40+38+43+45+37+43)/6 = 41.5\n\nWe can then calculate the deviations from the means for each pair of values:\n\nX Y dx dy dx\\*dy dx^2 dy^2\n10 40 -2.0 -1.5 3.0 4.0 2.25\n12 38 -0.0 -3.5 0.0 0.0 12.25\n13 43 1.0 1.5 1.5 1.0 2.25\n12 45 -0.0 3.5 0.0 0.0 12.25\n16 37 4.0 -4.5 -18.0 16.0 20.25\n15 43 3.0 1.5 4.5 9.0 2.25\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the slope and intercept for the regression equations as follows:\n\nFor the regression of Y on X:\n\nslope = \u03a3(dx\\*dy) / \u03a3(dx^2) = -3.0 / 21.0 = -0.143\nintercept = mean(Y) - slope \\* mean(X) = 41.5 - (-0.143) \\* 12.0 = 43.9\n\nSo the regression equation for Y on X is:\n\nY = 43.9 - 0.143X\n\nFor the regression of X on Y:\n\nslope = \u03a3(dx\\*dy) / \u03a3(dy^2) = -3.0 / 58.5 = -0.051\nintercept = mean(X) - slope \\* mean(Y) = 12.0 - (-0.051) \\* 41.5 = 14.1\n\nSo the regression equation for X on Y is:\n\nX = 14.1 - 0.051Y\n\nTo estimate the likely demand when the price is Rs.20, we can use the regression equation for Y on X:\n\nY = 43.9 - 0.143X\n\nSubstituting X = 20, we get:\n\nY = 43.9 - 0.143(20) = 41.4\n\nSo the estimated demand when the price is Rs.20 is 41.4.",
