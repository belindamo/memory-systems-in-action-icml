  "content": "While some serial killer documentaries can be graphic and disturbing, there are many that focus more on the psychology and investigation aspects, which can be just as fascinating and informative without being gratuitous. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Psychology-Focused Documentaries:**\n\n1. **The Ted Bundy Tapes** (Netflix): This documentary series explores the psychology of Ted Bundy, featuring interviews with experts and those who knew him. It's more focused on understanding his motivations and behavior rather than the gruesome details of his crimes.\n2. **The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst** (HBO): While this documentary series does cover some disturbing crimes, it's more focused on the psychology of Robert Durst, a real estate heir accused of multiple murders. It's a fascinating exploration of his psyche and the investigations that surrounded him.\n3. **The Confession Tapes** (Netflix): This documentary series examines real-life confessions and the psychology behind them. It's more focused on understanding why people confess to crimes rather than the crimes themselves.\n\n**Investigation-Focused Documentaries:**\n\n1. **The Staircase** (Netflix): This documentary series follows the trial of Michael Peterson, accused of murdering his wife. It's a detailed and fascinating look at the investigation and the legal process.\n2. **The Keepers** (Netflix): This documentary series explores the unsolved murder of a nun, Sister Cathy Cesnik, and the cover-up that followed.

It's a detailed look at the investigations and the people involved.\n\n**Other Recommendations:**\n\n1. **The FBI Files** (YouTube): This documentary series is a collection of FBI training videos that explore famous cases and the investigations that solved them. It's a great resource for those interested in the investigative process.\n2. **Criminal Minds** (YouTube): This documentary series is based on the popular TV show and explores real-life crimes and the investigations that solved them. It's more focused on the psychology and investigation aspects rather than the gruesome details.\n3. **Snapped** (Oxygen): This documentary series explores the stories of women who have committed crimes, often featuring interviews with the women themselves.
