  "content": "The ideal quantity depends on your usage rate and how often you attend events or meet potential customers. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n* How often do you attend markets, events, or conferences where you need to hand out business cards?\n* Do you have a physical storefront or office where customers can visit and take cards?\n* Do you plan to use your business cards for any upcoming promotions, mailings, or marketing campaigns?\n* How many cards do you currently have left, and how quickly do you go through them?\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, 100-200 business cards is a good starting point for small businesses or solo entrepreneurs. This quantity allows you to have some on hand for regular use without breaking the bank. If you find you're going through them quickly, you can always order more.\n\nConsidering you're still tracking your expenses, it might be a good idea to start with a smaller quantity, like 100, to see how quickly you use them up. You can always order more later if needed.\n\nRemember to also consider the cost and any potential discounts for larger quantities. Some printers offer discounts for orders of 250, 500, or 1000 cards, so it's worth checking prices before making a final decision.\n\nHow does that sound?",
