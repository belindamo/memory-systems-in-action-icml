During that break, I started a new hobby, painting, and I found it really helped me relax and express myself in a way that social media wasn't. The WhatsApp group was super supportive, and seeing their progress and struggles really motivated me to stay on track. After the break, I decided to delete the Facebook app from my phone altogether, and I've been feeling really liberated from the constant notifications and comparisons."

Have you noticed any changes in your mood, productivity, or relationships with others?

I'm not sure if I'm ready to take that step, but I'm wondering if you think it's possible to maintain a healthy relationship with Instagram, or if it's just inherently designed to be addictive and detrimental to our well-being."

Painting has been a great outlet for me, and I've even started selling some of my pieces to friends and family. As for Instagram, I'm still on the fence about deleting it. I do think it's possible to maintain a healthy relationship with it, but it requires a lot of self-awareness and discipline. For me, it's about using it intentionally and not letting it use me. But I'm still figuring it out, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Do you have any insights on how to use Instagram in a more mindful way?"

Congratulations on finding success with your painting hobby, too.\n\nRegarding Instagram, I completely agree with you - it's all about using it intentionally and being mindful of our motivations and emotions when we're scrolling through our feeds. Here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n* **Curate your feed**: Unfollow or mute accounts that make you feel bad about yourself or trigger comparison. Follow accounts that inspire, educate, or entertain you.\n* **Set a specific purpose**: Before opening Instagram, define what you want to achieve - e.g., catch up on friends' updates, get inspiration for a project, or simply enjoy some humor.\n* **Use website version**: Instead of using the app, access Instagram through a web browser. This can help you avoid mindless scrolling and reduce the temptation to check notifications constantly.\n* **Schedule Instagram use**: Allocate specific times of the day or week to check Instagram, and stick to those times. This can help prevent excessive scrolling throughout the day.\n* **Take breaks**: Regularly take short breaks from Instagram (e.g., a day or two) to reset your relationship with the platform and assess your motivations.\n\nWhat do you think? Have you tried any of these strategies, or do you have other tips to share?\n\n(By the way, I'll add these insights to your timeline if you'd like!)"
