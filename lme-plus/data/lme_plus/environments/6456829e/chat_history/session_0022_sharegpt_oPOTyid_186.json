Khaled,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI am writing to express my appreciation for the efforts that your team has made to address the issues with the app. Since my last email, I have noticed that most of the issues have been resolved, and the app is functioning more smoothly than before.\n\nI would also like to address your statement about starting the support period before delivering the app, code, and documentation. While we appreciate your commitment to supporting us, we believe that the support period should begin after the full delivery of the app, code, and documentation. This is to ensure that we have received everything that we have paid for, and that there are no outstanding issues or missing components that would require support.\n\nThat being said, I am grateful for your team's responsiveness and willingness to take immediate action in addressing the issues we have encountered. Your hard work and dedication have been instrumental in resolving these issues and ensuring that our users have a positive experience with the app.\n\nAnd after testing the Android App on many devices, we found these issues so please ask the team to fix it and send us updated version.\n\n1- The App still get the products that is not available in the stock and it\u2019s not right so please check it again (we have reported on that issue before ) for Example:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1qsKih1HuF94i0ZAIz6-eL1XjFJZl5nrG/view?usp=share\\_link \nPlease check this product in website and in app you will found it hidden automatically in website because it\u2019s out of stock and still appear in app\n2- Search and filter is working in the main page but it\u2019s not working in the categories pages\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1r66mtmVFPOSZ1GhcWd2KoNKr8j6v-w3R/view?usp=share\\_link\n\n3- Banners in main page is working and I can change them now but the links I can\u2019t change it from the backend (the team make the links work in static way maybe they write the link as fixed link in the app code )\nso please fix it (Backend App image section)\n4- When any client not login try to add any product to the cart the cart give us gray page (please fix it)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1rCsHTjfGmeqxHdQMyCLYxU9-DzvuIpKB/view?usp=share\\_link\n5- Please change (\u0623\u0633\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644 ) to be.

The code then verifies the token with Apple's API, creates a new user account if necessary, and logs the user in using WordPress's built-in functions. Note that you'll need to replace `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`, `APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `APPLE_REDIRECT_URI` with your own values."
