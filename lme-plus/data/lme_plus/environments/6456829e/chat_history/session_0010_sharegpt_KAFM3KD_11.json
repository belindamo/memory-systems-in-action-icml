Our survey paper |\n| explores these approaches in-depth. |\n|  |\n| Motivation for studying web-search privacy in |\n| Web 3.0 includes the potential risks and benefits |\n| for users and businesses. For users, there is a |\n| need to protect sensitive information and |\n| maintain anonymity. For businesses, there is an |\n| opportunity to build trust and gain a competitive |\n| edge by implementing more secure and transparent |\n| search algorithms. |\n|  |\n| However, web-search privacy in Web 3.0 comes |\n| with its own set of challenges. For instance, |\n| there is a delicate balance between privacy and |\n| usability, and search algorithms need to be more |\n| secure and transparent to ensure that users can |\n\n| trust them. |\n| --- |"
