Let's add that to your timeline:\n\n**Mid-January**\n\n* Took a 1-week social media break from Instagram and Facebook due to feeling like you were wasting too much time on them\n* Started journaling and reading more during the break\n* After the break:\n\t+ Set a daily time limit on Instagram\n\t+ Unfollowed accounts that made you feel bad about yourself\n\n**Early February**\n\n* Attended a digital detox workshop\n* Met like-minded people and joined a WhatsApp group to hold each other accountable for their digital habits\n\nThat's a great step! Having a support system can make a big difference in maintaining healthy habits.\n\nWhat happened next? Did you take another break or make any further changes to your social media habits?
