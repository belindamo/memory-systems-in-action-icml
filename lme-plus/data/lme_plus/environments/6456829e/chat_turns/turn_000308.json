  "content": "I completely agree with you about the show's portrayal of Diana's struggles! The writers did an excellent job of capturing the nuances of her experiences and the pressures she faced as a member of the royal family.\n\nAnd I couldn't agree more about the parallels with other women. Diana's story is a powerful reminder that mental health struggles can affect anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. It's heartbreaking to think that someone with Diana's platform and resources still felt silenced and trapped.\n\nNow, about that musical theatre soundtrack... \"Wait for It\" from Hamilton is an amazing song! I can see why it resonates with you. The lyrics are so poignant and thought-provoking. The song is all about patience, perseverance, and the importance of waiting for the right moment to take action.\n\nAaron Burr's character sings about how he's waiting for the perfect moment to strike, to make his move, and to take control of his life. But the song is also about the struggle to balance patience with the desire for action, and the fear of missing out.\n\nDo you find that the song resonates with you on a personal level, or is it more about the themes and emotions it evokes?",
