Limited space: Brig ships had limited space for passengers and crew. The cabins were often small and cramped, making it uncomfortable for long journeys.\n\n2. Rough sea conditions: Brig ships were susceptible to rough sea conditions, which could make the journey uncomfortable and potentially dangerous.\n\n3. Lack of amenities: Brig ships were not equipped with many of the modern amenities that are available on ships today. The lack of basic amenities such as toilets or fresh water was a common drawback for both passengers and crew.\n\n4. Limited food supply: Depending on the length of the journey, brig ships often had limited food supplies, which meant that passengers and crew members had to rely on preserved and non-perishable food items.\n\n5. Lack of privacy: Due to the limited space on brig ships, privacy was often a luxury that was not available to passengers and crew members.\n\n6.
