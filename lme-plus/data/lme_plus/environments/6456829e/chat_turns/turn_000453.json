During that break, I started a new hobby, painting, and I found it really helped me relax and express myself in a way that social media wasn't. The WhatsApp group was super supportive, and seeing their progress and struggles really motivated me to stay on track. After the break, I decided to delete the Facebook app from my phone altogether, and I've been feeling really liberated from the constant notifications and comparisons.",
