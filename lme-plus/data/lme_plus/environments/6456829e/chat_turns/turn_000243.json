Here are a few examples of countries that no longer exist and some information about their 1950s postage stamps:\n\n1. **South Vietnam**: South Vietnam was a country that existed from 1955 to 1975, before being reunified with North Vietnam. During the 1950s, South Vietnam issued several postage stamp series featuring various themes, including scenic views, animals, and cultural icons. One notable series is the 1955 \"National Symbols\" set, which features the country's coat of arms, the dragon, and the national flower, the hibiscus.\n2. **North Vietnam**: North Vietnam, officially known as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, existed from 1945 to 1976, before reunifying with South Vietnam.
