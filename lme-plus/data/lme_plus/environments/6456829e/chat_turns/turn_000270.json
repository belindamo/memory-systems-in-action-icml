  "content": "Imagine you and your friend are playing a game of catch. When your friend throws the ball to you, you need to catch it. Sometimes, your friend may throw the ball too far away, and you can't catch it. That is a \"miss.\" But sometimes, you may think your friend is throwing the ball to you, and you try to catch it, but it turns out your friend wasn't throwing the ball to you after all. That is a \"false positive.\" In data science, when we talk about a \"false positive rate,\" we mean the number of times a computer program makes a similar mistake - when it thinks something is true, but it's actually false.",
