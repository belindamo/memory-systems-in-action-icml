The scare zones and live shows can be just as enjoyable as the mazes, and they add a lot to the overall atmosphere of the event. By slowing down and taking in the atmosphere, you were able to appreciate the event in a different way, which is awesome.\n\nAnd, of course, splurging on the Express Pass was a great idea for your third visit! It can make a huge difference in terms of getting through the mazes quickly and minimizing wait times. It's always nice to have options and be able to customize your experience based on your preferences.\n\nIt's also great that you were able to appreciate the different aspects of the event and enjoy it in different ways. Halloween Horror Nights is an event that can be experienced and enjoyed in many different ways, and it's awesome that you were able to find what worked best for you and your friends.\n\nDid you find that the Express Pass changed the way you experienced the event, or did it just make it more convenient?",
