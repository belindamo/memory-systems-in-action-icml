  "content": "In my modeling methodology, I reserved 20% of the dataset for the testing phase. Initially, I used six parameters as inputs to create an ML model that simulates the Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI). Then, based on the results of the Mutual Information (MI) method, I reduced the number of input parameters to three. Cross-validation with cv=RepeatedKFold(n\\_splits=10, n\\_repeats=3, random\\_state=1) was used to ensure the robustness and generalization of the model. Additionally, I employed GridSearch as a hyperparameter tuning method to optimize the model's performance by searching for the best hyperparameters. The target variable represented the classes of IWQI, and the final model was evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.",
