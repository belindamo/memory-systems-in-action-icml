  "content": "Excellent choice on considering other pepper varieties! Bell peppers are a classic choice, but adding some heat or unique flavor profiles can elevate your fajitas to the next level. Here are some pepper pairing recommendations that would work well with chicken and onions:\n\n1. **Jalape\u00f1o and Anaheim**: This combo will add a moderate level of heat and a sweet, slightly smoky flavor. Jalape\u00f1os will bring the heat, while Anaheim peppers will add a bit of sweetness and crunch.\n2. **Poblano and Habanero**: For a more complex flavor profile, try pairing poblano peppers with habaneros. Poblanos have a rich, earthy flavor, while habaneros will add an intense, fruity heat.\n3. **Guajillo and Fresno**: If you want to add a bit of smokiness and a pop of color, try pairing guajillo peppers with Fresnos. Guajillos have a mild, slightly sweet flavor, while Fresnos will add a bright, crunchy heat.\n4. **Cubanelle and Banana**: For a milder option, pair cubanelle peppers with banana peppers. Cubanelles have a sweet, slightly smoky flavor, while banana peppers will add a tangy, slightly sweet flavor.\n\nWhen working with hotter peppers, remember to handle them carefully, as the oils in the peppers can cause skin irritation. You can always adjust the level of heat to your liking by using more or fewer peppers, or by seeding and chopping them to release more or less of their heat.\n\nOnions are a great addition to fajitas, and they pair well with most pepper varieties. You can saut\u00e9 them with the peppers and chicken for added flavor. Consider using a combination of yellow and red onions for a sweet and savory flavor.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different pepper pairings to find your perfect combination. Don't be afraid to try new peppers and flavor profiles \u2013 it's all about finding what you enjoy the most!\n\nHow do you plan on incorporating these peppers into your recipe? Will you be adjusting the cooking time or method to accommodate the different pepper varieties?",
