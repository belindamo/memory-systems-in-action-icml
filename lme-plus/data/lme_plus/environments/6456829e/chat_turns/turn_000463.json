  "content": "You're right, not every scene can benefit from the use of parallel editing. Filmmakers typically decide which scenes to use parallel editing for based on their goals for the scene and the tone they want to convey.\n\nIn general, parallel editing is best suited to scenes in which two or more events are happening simultaneously, particularly if they are related in some way. For example, a chase scene or a standoff between two characters could benefit from the use of parallel editing.\n\nAlso, filmmakers may use parallel editing to create a sense of urgency, tension, or suspense. Because parallel editing allows the viewer to see multiple events happening at the same time, it can be an effective way to build suspense and create anticipation.\n\nHowever, not every scene needs to use parallel editing. Overuse of this technique can make the film feel choppy or disjointed, so it's important to use it carefully and selectively. In some cases, a single shot of a character's face or a slow zoom can be more effective at conveying emotion and tension than a fast-paced edit on multiple scenes.",
