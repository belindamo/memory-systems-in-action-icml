  "content": "Ramakrishna's personal spiritual experiences are most prominently featured in \"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna\" by Swami Nikhilananda. This book is a comprehensive account of Ramakrishna's life and teachings, as recorded by his disciple, Mahendranath Gupta. It includes detailed descriptions of Ramakrishna's states of ecstasy and his personal relationship with the divine. The book also provides insights into Ramakrishna's teachings on various spiritual practices, such as the importance of devotion, the role of guru, and the nature of reality. Therefore, I would recommend \"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna\" as the best resource to gain insight into Ramakrishna's personal spiritual experiences.",
