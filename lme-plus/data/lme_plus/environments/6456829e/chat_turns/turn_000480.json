  "content": "The Express Pass definitely made the event more convenient, but it also changed the way I experienced it. With the Express Pass, I was able to get through the mazes quickly and focus on experiencing the attractions I hadn't gotten to yet. It was a huge time-saver, and I was able to fit in a lot more than I would have otherwise. But, at the same time, I didn't have to worry as much about planning my night or stressing about wait times, which made the overall experience more relaxed and enjoyable. I was able to take in more of the atmosphere and enjoy the event without feeling rushed.",
