I found a few options that look great: [Tea Spot 1], [Tea Spot 2], or [Tea Spot 3]. But I have to admit, I've been dying to try [New Tea Shop Downtown] that just opened up. I've heard amazing things about it! We meet at 10 am on Thursdays, so it would be a great opportunity to catch up over a cup of tea. Would you be up for trying any of these out?\"",
