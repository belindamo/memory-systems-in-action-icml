The scare zones and live shows are a huge part of the Halloween Horror Nights experience, and it's great that you focused on those aspects of the event.\n\nThe Jabbawockeez performance is always a crowd-pleaser, and their high-energy dance routines are a great way to get pumped up for the rest of the night. And, of course, the roaming scare actors are always a highlight of the event. They add to the overall atmosphere and can provide some great photo ops, as you mentioned.\n\nThe scare zones, in particular, are a great way to experience the event without having to wait in long lines for the mazes. They're often themed around specific horror franchises or original concepts, and the scareactors do a great job of creating an immersive and terrifying environment.\n\nIt's great that you have different experiences to compare between your visits. Did you find that you enjoyed the scare zones and live shows more than the mazes, or was it a different kind of fun?",
