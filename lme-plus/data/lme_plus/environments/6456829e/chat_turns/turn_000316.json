  "content": "It's always a good idea to give your friend some options, especially when it comes to trying a new spot. Here's why:\n\n1. **Personal preferences**: Your friend might have specific tastes or dietary restrictions that would make one tea shop more appealing than another.\n2. **Flexibility**: Offering options shows that you're considerate of her schedule and preferences, making it more likely that she'll be able to make it work.\n3. **Buy-in**: When you give her a choice, she's more invested in the decision and more likely to be excited about trying the new spot.\n\nI'd suggest giving her 2-3 options to choose from. This allows her to consider different factors like location, menu, and ambiance without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nHere's an example message you could send:\n\n\"Hey! I was thinking it would be fun to try a new tea spot near your office instead of our usual coffee break. I found a few options that look great. Would you be up for trying one of these: [Tea Spot 1], [Tea Spot 2], or [Tea Spot 3]? Let me know which one you're in the mood for, and we can make a plan!\"\n\nBy giving her options, you're showing that you're considerate of her preferences and willing to adapt to her needs. It's a win-win!",
