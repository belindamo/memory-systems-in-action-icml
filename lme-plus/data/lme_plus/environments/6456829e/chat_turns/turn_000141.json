It's a heartwarming and hilarious show that's sure to bring a smile to your face.\n\nAs for your travel arrangements, I'd be happy to help you with a reminder. However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to send you reminders or notifications. But I can suggest a few options to help you remember:\n\n1. Set a reminder on your phone or calendar: You can set a reminder on your phone or calendar to book your travel arrangements on a specific date and time.\n2. Ask a virtual assistant: If you have a virtual assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, you can ask them to remind you to book your travel arrangements.\n3. Write it down: Write down a note to yourself to book your travel arrangements and put it in a place where you'll see it often, such as on your fridge or next to your computer.\n4. Ask a friend: You could also ask one of your friends from brunch to remind you to book your travel arrangements. That way, you can hold each other accountable!\n\nI hope these suggestions help! Let me know if you need any more recommendations or assistance.",
