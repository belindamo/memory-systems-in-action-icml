  "content": "When balancing classes, both F1-score and accuracy can be useful metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. However, F1-score is often preferred over accuracy because it takes into account both precision and recall, which are important in cases of imbalanced data. Accuracy alone can be misleading when classes are imbalanced, as a high accuracy can still be achieved even when the model is performing poorly on the minority class. F1-score provides a more balanced evaluation of the model's performance on both the majority and minority classes. Therefore, it is recommended to use F1-score along with accuracy when dealing with imbalanced classes.",
