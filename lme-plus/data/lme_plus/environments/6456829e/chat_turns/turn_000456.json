Painting has been a great outlet for me, and I've even started selling some of my pieces to friends and family. As for Instagram, I'm still on the fence about deleting it. I do think it's possible to maintain a healthy relationship with it, but it requires a lot of self-awareness and discipline. For me, it's about using it intentionally and not letting it use me. But I'm still figuring it out, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Do you have any insights on how to use Instagram in a more mindful way?",
