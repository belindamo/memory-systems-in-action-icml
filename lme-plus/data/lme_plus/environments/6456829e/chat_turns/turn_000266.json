  "content": "In this study, the modeling methodology employed included the use of 20% of the dataset for the testing phase. The initial model created for simulating the Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI) utilized 6 parameters as inputs, which represented the IWQI parameters. However, based on the results of the mutual information (MI), the number of inputs was reduced to 3 parameters. Cross-validation was carried out using cv=RepeatedKFold(n\\_splits=10, n\\_repeats=3, random\\_state=1). The target variable in the model represented the classes of the IWQI. This methodology aimed to create an accurate and efficient model for predicting the IWQI classes based on a reduced number of inputs.",
