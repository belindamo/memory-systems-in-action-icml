  "content": "Advertising and sponsorships played a significant role in the quiz show scandal. Advertising agencies and sponsors saw quiz shows as an excellent opportunity to promote their products and services. As a result, they sought to place their ads on popular quiz shows.\n\nIn turn, quiz show producers and sponsors colluded to manipulate the outcome of the shows, ensuring that winners were predetermined. This allowed them to generate higher ratings and attract more advertisers, ultimately leading to more profits.\n\nWhen the scandal broke out, the public became outraged and called for accountability. As a result, sponsors who were associated with the scandal faced public backlash and boycotts. Some companies, such as Geritol, received harsh criticism for their involvement in the scandal.\n\nHowever, there were no legal repercussions against the companies involved. In the end, the Quiz Show Scandal led to the creation of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the establishment of strict regulations for television programming. These new regulations required quiz shows to be legitimate and free of manipulation.",
