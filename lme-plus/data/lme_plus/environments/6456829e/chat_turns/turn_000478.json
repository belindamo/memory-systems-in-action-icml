  "content": "I think I enjoyed the scare zones and live shows in a different way. On my first visit, I was all about getting through as many mazes as possible, but on my second visit, I was able to slow down and take in the atmosphere of the event more. The scare zones and live shows added a lot to the overall experience and made it feel more immersive. Plus, it was great to have some downtime and not have to worry about waiting in lines for hours. On my third visit, I actually splurged on the Express Pass, which was a game-changer for getting through the mazes quickly.",
