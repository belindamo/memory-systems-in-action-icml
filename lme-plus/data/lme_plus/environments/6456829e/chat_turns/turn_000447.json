Please provide me with the information you have so far, and I'll help you organize it into a simple list of dates and events.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me:\n\n* When did you take your first social media break?\n* How long did each break last?\n* What triggered each break (e.g., feeling overwhelmed, comparison, etc.)?\n* What changes did you make to your social media habits during or after each break?\n* Are there any specific dates or events that stand out to you as significant in your journey?\n\nShare as much or as little information as you have, and I'll help you create a timeline that makes sense.",
