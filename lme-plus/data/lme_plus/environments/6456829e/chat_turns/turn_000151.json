Here's a possible design:\n```lua\n            +----------------+\n            |YouTube Viewers |\n            +----------------+\n                     |\n                     |\n                     v\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n|Seeing the music therapy songs for anxiety,    |\n|depression, and anger management               |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n                     |\n                     |\n                     v\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n|Buy NFT token to support cancer patients        |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n```\nThis diagram shows the three steps in your workflow, with arrows indicating the flow of activity from one step to the next. The first step is YouTube viewers, who are presumably searching for videos related to music therapy for anxiety, depression, and anger management. The second step shows viewers engaging with the videos and potentially being interested in purchasing NFT tokens to support cancer patients. The third step is the purchase of NFT tokens, which is the ultimate goal of your workflow.\n\nLet me know if you have any feedback or if you'd like me to make any changes to the design.",
