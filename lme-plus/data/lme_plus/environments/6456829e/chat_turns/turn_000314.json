I'd be happy to help you find a tea shop that offers a variety of herbal teas.\n\nHere are a few tips to help you find the perfect spot:\n\n1. **Check online reviews**: Look up tea shops in your area on review platforms like Yelp or Google Reviews. Pay attention to comments about their herbal tea selection and customer service.\n2. **Look for specialty tea shops**: Tea-focused shops are more likely to have a wide variety of herbal teas. Avoid coffee shops that only offer a few tea options.\n3. **Check their menu online**: Many tea shops post their menus online. Look for shops that have a dedicated herbal tea section or a \"tea menu\" that lists their options.\n4. **Ask for recommendations**: Reach out to friends, coworkers, or social media groups for recommendations. Tea enthusiasts often have strong opinions about their favorite tea spots!\n\nSome popular tea shop chains that offer a variety of herbal teas include:\n\n1. **Teavana** (owned by Starbucks): Known for their vast tea selection, including herbal options.\n2. **The Tea Spot**: A tea-focused chain with a wide variety of herbal teas and a knowledgeable staff.\n3. **Artea**: A modern tea shop with a rotating selection of seasonal herbal teas.\n4. **David's Tea**: A Canadian tea company with a wide variety of herbal teas and a fun, modern atmosphere.\n\nWhen you find a tea shop that interests you, suggest it to your friend and make a plan to meet there instead of your usual coffee spot.
