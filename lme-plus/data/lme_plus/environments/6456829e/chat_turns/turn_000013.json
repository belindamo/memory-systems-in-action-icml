  "content": "You're absolutely on the right track! Adding diced jalape\u00f1os to the marinade is a great way to infuse the chicken with a spicy kick. The acidity in the lime juice and the heat from the jalape\u00f1os will help break down the proteins in the chicken, making it tender and juicy.\n\nSaut\u00e9ing the onions and peppers together is a fantastic idea. This will help caramelize the onions and bring out the natural sweetness in the peppers. By cooking them together, you'll create a rich, depth of flavor that will complement the chicken perfectly.\n\nRoasting the peppers in the oven is an excellent technique to bring out their natural sweetness. This process is called \"charring\" and it adds a smoky, slightly sweet flavor to the peppers. Simply place the peppers on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and roast at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for about 30-40 minutes, or until the skin is blistered and charred. Then, peel off the skin, remove the seeds, and chop them up. This will add an incredible depth of flavor to your dish.\n\nHere's a suggestion: Why not take it a step further and add some aromatics like garlic, cumin, and coriander to the marinade? These flavors will complement the jalape\u00f1os and peppers beautifully, and add a nice warmth to the dish.\n\nAlso, consider serving your fajitas with some fresh cilantro, lime wedges, and warm flour or corn tortillas. This will allow everyone to assemble their own fajitas to their liking, and add a burst of freshness to the dish.\n\nYou're doing great, and I'm excited to see how your dish turns out!",
