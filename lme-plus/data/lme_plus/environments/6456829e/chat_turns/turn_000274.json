  "content": "The correlation matrix plot is a visualization of the correlation coefficients between different variables in your dataset. It can be useful for identifying which variables are highly correlated and can help in the feature selection process.\n\nThe correlation matrix plot can be added to either the exploratory data analysis (EDA) section or the feature selection section of your report. In the EDA section, it can be used to provide a general overview of the relationships between variables. In the feature selection section, it can be used to identify highly correlated variables that may be removed to reduce multicollinearity in the model.",
