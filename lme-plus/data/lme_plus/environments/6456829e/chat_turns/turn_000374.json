  "content": "That's awesome! Music festivals are the best! I'd love to help you keep the vibe going!\n\nTo give you some personalized recommendations, could you tell me a bit more about the festival you attended? For example:\n\n1. What was the genre(s) of music played at the festival? (e.g., rock, indie, electronic, hip-hop, pop, etc.)\n2. Were there any specific artists or bands that you particularly enjoyed?\n3. What was the overall atmosphere and energy of the festival? (e.g., laid-back, high-energy, dance-oriented, etc.)\n4. Are you open to exploring new genres or do you want to stick with what you know and love?\n\nWith this information, I can give you some tailored recommendations for artists, bands, and genres that might scratch that festival itch!\n\n(If you're feeling adventurous, I can also suggest some playlists or radio stations on music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, or Tidal that might fit the vibe you're looking for.)",
