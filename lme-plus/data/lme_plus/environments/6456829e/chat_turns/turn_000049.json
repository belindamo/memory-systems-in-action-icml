  "content": "I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I can't provide live information on wait times or queue lengths of food trucks in Austin. However, popular food trucks like Veracruz All Natural and Franklin Barbecue can have long lines, and some food trucks with limited hours or weekend-only service often attract long lines. Checking local social media accounts, websites or review sites can give you an idea about wait times, or you may choose to visit during off-peak hours or plan to arrive early to avoid the crowds.",
