  "content": "It is difficult to imagine how the athletes from South Africa must have felt being treated unfairly at the Melbourne Games. Discrimination can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, sadness, and helplessness. It is important to remember that racism and discrimination have real-world consequences and can have a lifelong impact on individuals and their communities. That is why it is crucial to continue to fight against it, not just in the world of sports but in every sphere of society. Only by working together can we create a world that is more inclusive and just for all.",
