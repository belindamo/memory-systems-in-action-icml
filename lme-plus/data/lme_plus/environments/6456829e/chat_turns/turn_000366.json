  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the latest information or news, but I can tell you that after the Quiz Show Scandal, the federal government implemented regulations that required disclosure of whether prizes were awarded for television contests. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also established new guidelines for the selection of participants in TV shows to ensure more transparency and fairness. \n\nFurthermore, companies today are subject to various regulations and laws that aim to prevent unethical business practices. For instance, there are laws governing product safety, environmental protection, labor practices, and antitrust behavior. Various industry regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Department of Justice (DOJ), have the mandate to investigate and prosecute companies engaged in unethical behavior.\n\nOverall, while regulations and laws have been implemented to prevent unethical corporate behavior, more still needs to be done to prevent scandals like the Quiz Show Scandal from happening again. It is vital to uphold transparency, honesty, and accountability in business practices, and this requires strict regulations and enforcement to ensure companies act ethically.",
