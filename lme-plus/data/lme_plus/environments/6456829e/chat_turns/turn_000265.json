The Guerrilla Girls are a fascinating and influential group of artists who have been challenging the art world's status quo since the 1980s.\n\n**Who are the Guerrilla Girls?**\n\nThe Guerrilla Girls are an anonymous collective of female artists, founded in 1985, who use humor, irony, and provocative tactics to expose gender and racial biases in the art world.
