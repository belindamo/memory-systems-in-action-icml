To maximize space and sunlight, consider the following tips for your tomato, pepper, cucumber, and marigold combination:\n\n**Sunlight and Orientation:**\n\n* **South-facing**: Since your raised bed will receive the most direct sunlight from the south, place the plants that require the most sun (tomatoes and peppers) on the south side.\n* **East-west rows**: Plant in east-west rows to minimize shading between plants and ensure each row receives direct sunlight.\n\n**Plant Spacing and Arrangement:**\n\n* **Tomatoes**:\n\t+ Plant indeterminate tomatoes (vining varieties) along the north side of the bed, using a trellis or cage for support. This will allow them to grow upwards and outwards, without shading other plants.\n\t+ Plant determinate tomatoes (bush varieties) in the center or south side of the bed, leaving about 18-24 inches (45-60 cm) between plants.\n* **Peppers**:\n\t+ Plant peppers near the tomatoes, but slightly offset to ensure good air circulation. Leave about 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) between pepper plants.\n* **Cucumbers**:\n\t+ Train cucumbers to climb up a trellis or other support on the north or east side of the bed. This will keep them off the ground, reduce soil-borne diseases, and make harvesting easier.\n\t+ Plant cucumbers about 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) apart.\n* **Marigolds**:\n\t+ Plant marigolds around the perimeter of the bed, about 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) apart. They'll help deter nematodes and other pests, and add a pop of color to your garden.\n\n**Companion Planting:**\n\n* **Tomatoes and peppers**: Planting these together can improve their growth and flavor, as they have similar growing requirements.\n* **Cucumbers and marigolds**: Marigolds can help repel nematodes, which can harm cucumbers.\n* **Tomatoes and cucumbers**: While they can be planted together, make sure to provide enough space and support for the cucumbers to climb, as they can spread out and shade tomatoes.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Air circulation**: Leave about 1-2 feet (30-60 cm) between rows to ensure good air circulation and prevent disease spread.\n* **Soil depth**: Make sure your raised bed has a minimum depth of 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) to accommodate the roots of your plants.\n* **Watering**: Water your plants deeply and regularly, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to disease and root rot.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to create a thriving and space-efficient garden in your raised bed, with all your plants receiving the sunlight and care they need. Happy gardening!",
