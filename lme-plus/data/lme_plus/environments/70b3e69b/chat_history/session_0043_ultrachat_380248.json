      "content": "Classic horror authors such as Poe and Lovecraft often relied on supernatural elements to create fear and horror in their readers. They used gothic settings, mysterious creatures, and otherworldly beings to build tension and terror. Their writing focused on the unknown and the fear that comes with encountering the unknown.\n\nOn the other hand, contemporary horror writers such as Shirley Jackson and Stephen Graham Jones tend to focus more on psychological horror. Instead of relying on supernatural elements, they delve into the human psyche, exploring what drives people to do evil things. They are grounded in reality, exploring the types of fears that people might encounter in their daily lives like fear of death, fear of the unknown, fear of losing control, etc.\n\nDespite these differences, both classic and contemporary horror writers aim to create a sense of unease and fear in their readers. They both use different techniques to do this, but the ultimate goal is the same: to keep their readers on the edge of their seats, unable to look away."
