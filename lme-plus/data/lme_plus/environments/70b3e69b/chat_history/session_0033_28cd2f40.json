Do you know if there's a way to export my LinkedIn connections to a spreadsheet or CSV file? I'd like to keep track of my connections and the workshops we've attended together."

      "content": "LinkedIn does allow you to export your connections to a CSV file. Here's how:\n\n1. Log in to your LinkedIn account and go to your **Connections** page.\n2. Click on **Manage synced and imported contacts** on the top right corner.\n3. Click on **Export contacts**.\n4. Select the connections you want to export (e.g., all connections or specific lists).\n5. Choose the file format: CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a good choice.\n6. Select the fields you want to export (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Email, Headline, etc.).\n7. Click **Request archive**.\n\nLinkedIn will send you an email with a link to download your connections as a CSV file. This file can be opened in any spreadsheet software, such as Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or LibreOffice Calc.\n\nYou can then use this file to track your connections, the workshops you've attended together, and other relevant information. You can also use this data to create custom lists, filters, or tags to organize your connections.\n\nNote that LinkedIn has some limitations on exporting connections, such as:\n\n* You can only export connections you've established within the last 24 hours.\n* You can only export a maximum of 10,000 connections at a time.\n* LinkedIn may limit the number of exports you can perform within a certain time frame.\n\nMake sure to check LinkedIn's terms of service and export limitations before exporting your connections."
