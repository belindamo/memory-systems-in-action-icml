In 2018, for example, some critics accused UMNO of neglecting the needs of the poor, despite the party's commitment to social welfare policies. Some critics argued that UMNO's policies had failed to address rising poverty rates and inequality in Malaysia.\n\nMoreover, there have been some criticisms of UMNO's handling of healthcare issues. For example, critics have questioned the party's ability to provide quality healthcare services in rural areas, which are often underserved or lacking in resources.\n\nOverall, while UMNO has maintained a focus on healthcare and social welfare policies, there have been some controversies around their effectiveness and implementation. Some critics have argued that more needs to be done to address poverty and inequality in Malaysia, and to ensure that all Malaysians have access to high-quality healthcare services."
