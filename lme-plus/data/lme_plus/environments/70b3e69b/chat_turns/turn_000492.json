This backup copy is independent of your original files on your computer or other devices.\n\nHere are some key benefits of this approach:\n\n* **Data protection:** Your files are safely stored in the cloud, protected from hardware failure, software corruption, or other disasters that might affect your local devices.\n* **Versioning:** Depending on the cloud storage service, you might have the option to keep multiple versions of your files, allowing you to restore previous versions if needed.\n* **Restoration:** If something goes wrong with your original files, you can restore them from the backup copy in the cloud.\n\nThe backup process typically works in the following way:\n\n1. You set up the cloud storage service to automatically backup your files at a specified interval (e.g., daily, weekly).\n2. The cloud storage service creates a copy of your files in the cloud, storing them in a separate location from your original files.\n3. If you need to restore your files, you can access the backup copy in the cloud and download the files to your device.\n\nThe original files on your computer or other devices remain unchanged, and the backup process doesn't affect them in any way. This means you can continue working with your files as usual, knowing that you have a safety net in place in case something goes wrong.\n\nBy the way, it's a good idea to verify that your cloud storage service offers versioning and restoration capabilities, as well as a clear process for recovering your files in case of data loss.",
