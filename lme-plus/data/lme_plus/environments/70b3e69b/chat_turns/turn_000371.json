To reach your goal, you should focus on developing a balanced strength across multiple muscle groups. Here's a breakdown of the primary muscles involved in push-ups:\n\n1. **Chest muscles (Pectoralis major):** These muscles are responsible for extending your arm and moving your body upwards during the push-up.\n2. **Anterior deltoids:** These muscles assist in arm extension and help control the movement of your arms.\n3. **Triceps:** As you've noticed, triceps are crucial for extending your arm and locking out your elbow.\n4. **Serratus anterior:** These muscles help to rotate your scapula and assist in upward movement.\n5. **Core muscles (Abdominals and Obliques):** A strong core is essential for maintaining a stable position and generating power during push-ups.\n6. **Shoulder stabilizers (Rotator cuff muscles):** These muscles help to maintain proper shoulder alignment and prevent injury.\n\nTo reach your goal of 50 push-ups, focus on developing strength and endurance across these muscle groups. Here are some tips:\n\n**1. Continue to build tricep strength:** Continue to work on exercises that target your triceps, such as tricep dips, overhead extensions, and skull crushers. However, don't overdo it, as overdeveloping your triceps can lead to imbalances.\n\n**2. Incorporate chest exercises:** Include exercises like dumbbell presses, bench presses, or push-up variations that target your chest muscles. This will help improve your overall pushing strength.\n\n**3. Engage your core and shoulder stabilizers:** Incorporate exercises that target your core and shoulder stabilizers, such as planks, side planks, and shoulder rotations. This will help improve your overall stability and endurance.\n\n**4. Increase your push-up volume and frequency:** Gradually increase the number of push-ups you do each day or week. You can also try doing multiple sets of push-ups with shorter rest periods to build endurance.\n\n**5. Focus on proper form and technique:** Make sure to maintain proper form and technique throughout each push-up. This will help prevent injury and ensure that you're targeting the correct muscle groups.\n\n**6. Mix up your push-up variations:** Try different push-up variations, such as diamond push-ups, decline push-ups, or push-up rotations, to challenge yourself and prevent plateaus.\n\nBy following these tips and focusing on building strength and endurance across multiple muscle groups, you'll be well on your way to reaching your goal of 50 push-ups without stopping!",
