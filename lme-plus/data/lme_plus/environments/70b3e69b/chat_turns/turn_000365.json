That's awesome progress!\n\nI'd be happy to help you mix up your leg exercises on Fridays to avoid plateaus and keep your progress going. Here are some tips and exercise variations to consider:\n\n1. **Change your stance:** Try changing your stance or foot positioning to target different muscle groups. For example:\n\t* Sumo squats: Widen your stance to target your adductors and glutes.\n\t* Narrow stance squats: Bring your feet closer together to focus on your quads.\n\t* Offset squats: Place one foot in front of the other to engage your core and challenge your balance.\n2. **Switch up the depth:** Vary the depth of your squats to target different muscle groups:\n\t* Deep squats: Go lower to target your glutes and hamstrings.\n\t* Partial squats: Focus on the top half of the squat to target your quads.\n3. **Try different types of squats:** Mix up the type of squat you're doing:\n\t* Front squats: Hold the weight in front of your body to target your quads and glutes.\n\t* Back squats: Hold the weight behind your body to target your glutes and hamstrings.\n\t* Pistol squats: Single-leg squats to target each leg individually.\n4. **Add pauses or pulses:** Introduce pauses or pulses to increase time under tension and challenge your muscles:\n\t* Pause squats: Hold the bottom of the squat for 1-2 seconds before standing up.\n\t* Pulse squats: Perform quick, small movements at the bottom of the squat.\n5. **Incorporate lunges:** Lunges are a great way to target your legs from a different angle:\n\t* Stationary lunges: Alternate legs to target each leg individually.\n\t* Walking lunges: Perform lunges while walking to add a dynamic element.\n6. **Add some plyometrics:** Incorporate explosive movements to challenge your legs:\n\t* Box jumps: Jump onto a box or bench to target your legs and glutes.\n\t* Depth jumps: Jump down from a box or bench to target your legs and glutes.\n7. **Try different weights or resistance:** Mix up the weight or resistance you're using:\n\t* Dumbbells: Use dumbbells instead of a barbell to target each leg individually.\n\t* Resistance bands: Use resistance bands to add an extra challenge to your squats.\n\nHere's an example workout routine for Friday:\n\nWarm-up: 5-10 minutes of cardio and dynamic stretching\n\n* Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (use a weight that allows you to complete the given number of reps with good form)\n* Pause squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (pause for 1-2 seconds at the bottom of each squat)\n* Stationary lunges: 3 sets of 12-15 reps per leg\n* Box jumps: 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n\nCool-down: 5-10 minutes of stretching\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust the weights, reps, and exercises based on how you're feeling. It's also important to focus on proper form and technique throughout each exercise.\n\nKeep up the great work, and I hope these tips help you continue to make progress and avoid plateaus!",
