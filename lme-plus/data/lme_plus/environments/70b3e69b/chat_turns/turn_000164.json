  "content": "1) Browser Requirements\nReference: \"Tabla 4. Requisitos minimos de la Aplicacion, Sistema Operativo\"\n\nThe stated list of browsers that should be supported is extremely outdated, some versions are over 15 years old (for example, Opera 9 was released in June 2006, one year before the introduction of iPhone). We note that the requirement says \"accessible\", and while our software would certainly be accessible with reasonably older versions of browsers, we still highly advise against supporting very old versions of browsers. Importantly, outdated versions of browsers do not protect against current security vulnerabilities and do not support modern web security protocols (like TLS 1.2). Also, we use modern web technologies to give users, in particular bidders, a dynamic and responsive user experience to make sure they have all relevant information presented to them clearly, quickly and reliably. The use of modern web technology requires a modern web browser. Usually, in other spectrum auction projects, we only support the latest version of common browsers (where support means that we can guarantee that all functionalities of the software work reliably on the given browser). If needed, we can extend our support to allow recent versions previous to the latest one. \n\nThe table below gives an overview of the listed browsers and their respective latest stable versions. Note that because release cycles for browser versions are very short, we suggest to change the requirement to simply say: \"Support current versions of Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome and Safari.\"",
