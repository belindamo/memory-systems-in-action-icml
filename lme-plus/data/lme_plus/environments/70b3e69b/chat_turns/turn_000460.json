Stress relief yoga is not about pushing yourself, but about releasing tension.\n3. **Use gentle, flowing movements**: Synchronize your breath with gentle, flowing movements to calm your mind and body.\n4. **Incorporate restorative yoga**: Use props like bolsters, blankets, and blocks to support your body in relaxing postures.\n5. **Practice regularly**: Consistency is key to reducing stress.
