  "content": "Hotel Tonight is a fantastic app for last-minute bookings, and it's great that you've had positive experiences with it in the past.\n\nA Marriott in downtown Chicago, eh? That's a great location! Chicago is an amazing city, and downtown has so much to offer, from Millennium Park to Navy Pier. Did you get a chance to explore the city during your stay?\n\nUsing Hotel Tonight, you must have gotten a great deal on the room, right? They often have exclusive discounts on same-day bookings, which can be a lifesaver when you need a room at the last minute.\n\nWhat was your experience like at the Marriott? Was it a comfortable stay? Did you have a favorite amenity or feature of the hotel?\n\nAlso, have you considered using Hotel Tonight's \"Geo-Rate\" feature, which allows you to book a room at a mystery hotel in a specific neighborhood? It can be a fun way to discover new hotels and neighborhoods, and you can often get an even better deal than booking a specific hotel.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about Hotel Tonight or your upcoming trip to Austin!",
