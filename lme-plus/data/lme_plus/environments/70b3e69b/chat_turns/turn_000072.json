  "content": "I'm planning to send a follow-up email to Dr. Smith and the other connections I made at the event, just to thank them again for their time and reiterate my interest in exploring potential collaborations. I'll also make sure to personalize the emails and mention something specific we discussed during our conversation, so they remember me and our meeting.\n\nFor Dr. Smith, I'm going to ask him to introduce me to the potential partners in the industry as soon as possible, and I'll also ask if he'd be willing to meet up for coffee to discuss further how we can work together.\n\nAs for the lawyer who offered to review my contracts, I'll make sure to send over the contracts and ask for their feedback and suggestions. I'll also ask them if they know of any other resources or connections that could be helpful to my startup.\n\nOverall, my goal is to stay top of mind with these new connections and keep the conversation going, so we can explore potential opportunities and collaborations in the future.",
