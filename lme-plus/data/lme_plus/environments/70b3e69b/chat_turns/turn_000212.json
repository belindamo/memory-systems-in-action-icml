  "content": "Terracotta clay and a clear glaze will give your mini planters a warm, earthy feel that will complement your vintage posters perfectly. Adding underglaze decoration will add an extra layer of character to your pieces.\n\nTo achieve a distressed or worn look on your planters, try these techniques:\n\n**1. Texture and Pattern:** Create texture and pattern on the clay surface using various tools, such as:\n\t* Stamps or texture mats with organic patterns like leaves, branches, or flowers.\n\t* A wire loop tool or a metal rib to create scratches, swirls, or lines.\n\t* A wooden modeling tool or a skewer to add small, random marks.\n**2. Slip Trailing:** Use a slip trailer or a piping bag with a small round tip to create thin, irregular lines or patterns on the clay surface. This will give your planters a sense of movement and age.\n**3. Wax Resist:** Apply wax resist to specific areas of the planter to create a resist pattern. Then, apply a thin layer of underglaze or slip over the entire surface. The wax will resist the underglaze, creating a subtle, muted design.\n**4. Dry Brushing:** Use a dry brush to apply a small amount of underglaze or slip to the planter's surface. This will create a soft, muted effect with a hint of texture.\n**5. Faux Patina:** Mix a small amount of underglaze or slip with water to create a thin, watery consistency. Brush this mixture onto the planter's surface, allowing it to pool and run in certain areas. This will create a sense of age and wear.\n**6. Post-Firing Techniques:** After firing, you can use various techniques to enhance the distressed look:\n\t* Apply a small amount of water to specific areas and let it dry, creating subtle water spots.\n\t* Use a soft brush to apply a thin layer of matte varnish or wax to certain areas, giving them a soft sheen.\n\t* Use a gentle abrasive, like a soft-bristled toothbrush or a fine-grit sandpaper, to gently distress the surface.\n\nRemember to experiment and play with these techniques to achieve the desired level of distress and wear. You can always adjust the amount of distressing to your taste.\n\nWhen it comes to underglaze decoration, you can use ceramic pencils, underglaze pens, or ceramic decals to add designs, patterns, or illustrations that match your vintage poster theme. Keep it simple and subtle to avoid overwhelming the piece.\n\nHow do you plan to incorporate underglaze decoration into your design? Will you focus on simple patterns or add more intricate designs?",
