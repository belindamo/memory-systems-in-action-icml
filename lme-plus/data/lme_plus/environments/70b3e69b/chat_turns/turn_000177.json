While they're primarily known for their Premier League and English football coverage, they do have TVs showing other sports, including the NBA.\n\nThey have a total of 20 TVs, with multiple screens dedicated to different sports channels, including:\n\n1. **NBC Sports**: For Premier League and other English football matches.\n2. **FS1 and FS2**: For UEFA Champions League, Europa League, and other international football competitions.\n3. **ESPN and ESPN2**: For NBA, NFL, MLB, and college sports.\n4. **Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket**: For local sports, including Lakers, Clippers, Dodgers, and Angels games.\n\nThey usually have a few TVs reserved for NBA games, so you should be able to catch a Lakers game while you're there. However, it's always a good idea to call ahead and confirm that they'll be showing the specific game you're interested in.\n\nAdditionally, The Britannia Pub has a flexible TV setup, which means they can accommodate special requests for specific games or events. If you're planning to visit with a group, you can even reserve a private area with a dedicated TV for your preferred game.\n\nSo, you can enjoy the best of both worlds: catch a Manchester City game with fellow Blues fans and grab a glimpse of the Lakers in action during their next game.",
