  "content": "I'm interested in exploring AI applications in healthcare, particularly in medical imaging and diagnostics. I had a strong academic background in computer science, graduating from UCLA in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, where I had a GPA of 3.6 out of 4.0. I was also part of the Dean's list for three consecutive semesters. Can you recommend some resources for me to learn more about AI in medical imaging and diagnostics?",
