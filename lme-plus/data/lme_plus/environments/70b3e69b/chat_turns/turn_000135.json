  "content": "The UNHCR prioritizes refugees for resettlement based on their level of vulnerability and the urgency of their needs. The agency uses a system of eligibility criteria to identify refugees who are most in need of resettlement. These criteria include factors such as:\n\n1) Survivors of torture or violence: refugees who have experienced physical or psychological trauma as a result of persecution in their home country.\n\n2) Medical conditions: refugees with medical conditions that cannot be treated in their country of asylum.\n\n3) Women and girls at risk: refugees who are survivors of sexual and gender-based violence or who are at risk of such violence.\n\n4) Children at risk: unaccompanied minors or children who have suffered family separation, exploitation, or abuse.\n\n5) Legal and physical protection needs: refugees who face persecution or serious harm if they return to their home country, or who cannot access legal protection in their country of asylum.\n\n6) Family reunification: refugees who have close family members in other countries who can provide support and protection.\n\nThe UNHCR works with governments and other partners to prioritize the resettlement of refugees who meet these criteria and ensure that their needs are met in a timely and effective manner.",
