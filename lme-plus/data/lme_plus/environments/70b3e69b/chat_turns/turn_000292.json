  "content": "There has been some progress in increasing the representation of Latinos in Hollywood since Jennifer Lopez first started out, but there is still a long way to go. According to a recent study by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, Latinos only made up 4.5% of speaking roles in top grossing films from 2017-2019. This underrepresentation is even more striking given that Latinos make up nearly 20% of the US population.\n\nHowever, there have been some positive developments, such as the success of films like Coco and In the Heights, and the increased recognition of Latino actors and filmmakers at major awards shows. There are also more Latino producers, directors, and writers working in the industry, which is helping to create more diverse stories and characters.\n\nAdditionally, Jennifer Lopez and other influential Latinos in Hollywood continue to push for more representation and change in the industry. By speaking out and using their platforms to support Latino talent in the industry, they are helping to break down barriers and create a more inclusive Hollywood.",
