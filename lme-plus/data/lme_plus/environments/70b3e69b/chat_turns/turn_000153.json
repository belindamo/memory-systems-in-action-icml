They offer some amazing deals on same-day bookings, and it's not uncommon to find discounts of 30-50% off the regular rate.\n\nThe W Hotel in Boston is a great example of the kind of high-end properties that Hotel Tonight often features. They partner with a wide range of hotels, from boutique boutiques to luxury chains, to offer exclusive same-day deals.\n\nIn Austin, Hotel Tonight often has a good selection of hotels, including some of the mid-range options I mentioned earlier. You might find deals on hotels like the Hyatt Place, La Quinta Inn & Suites, or even some of the boutique hotels on South Congress.\n\nKeep in mind that Hotel Tonight's inventory is limited to same-day bookings, so you'll need to be flexible with your travel plans.

Good luck, and I hope you find an amazing deal!",
