I'm sure you'll find that it can have a positive impact on your overall fitness and well-being.\n\nRemember to approach yoga with an open mind and don't be too hard on yourself if you're not flexible or don't know the poses at first. Yoga is a journey, and it's okay to start slow and learn as you go.\n\nBy combining yoga with your weightlifting and cardio exercises, you'll likely notice improvements in your flexibility, recovery, and overall performance. Yoga can help increase your range of motion, reduce muscle tension, and improve your balance and coordination, all of which can benefit your weightlifting and cardio exercises.\n\nAdditionally, yoga can help you develop greater body awareness, which can translate to better form and technique in your weightlifting and cardio exercises. This can reduce your risk of injury and help you get more out of your workouts.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and take rest days as needed. It's important to balance your yoga practice with your other workouts and not overdo it. With consistent practice and patience, you'll start to notice the benefits of yoga and how it can enhance your overall fitness routine.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you enjoy your yoga classes on Mondays!",
