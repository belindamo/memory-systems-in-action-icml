  "content": "I'm thinking of using some illustrations of ferns and wildflowers, as they're both delicate and earthy. For the quotes, I'm drawn to some lyrics from a favorite song that speak to the idea of growth and renewal. The song is all about embracing change and finding beauty in the everyday, which feels really fitting for a planter that will hold a small, growing thing.\n\nI'm also thinking of adding a small, hand-drawn border around the rim of the planter, just to give it a bit of extra visual interest. Maybe something simple, like a repeating pattern of leaves or a wavy line that echoes the shape of the planter.\n\nWhat do you think? Would a border like that work, or would it be too much?",
