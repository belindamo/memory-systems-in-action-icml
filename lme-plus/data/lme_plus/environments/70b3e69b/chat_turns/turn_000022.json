  "content": "Wario's final scream echoed through the Mushroom Kingdom, as the citizens devour his clone. His soul is trapped inside the clone, and he is forced to watch as his own flesh is consumed by the ravenous masses.\n\nThe scene is a gruesome one, a testament to the horrors of addiction and the dangers of exploiting the fears and weaknesses of others for one's own gain. Wario's fate serves as a warning, reminding us of the importance of doing what is right and avoiding the path of greed.\n\nAs the citizens continue their feast, Wario's scream fades into the distance, lost to the ages. But his legacy remains, a reminder of the consequences of our actions and the importance of morality. The end.",
