  "content": "The lifespan of a giant panda is typically around 20-30 years in the wild and up to 35 years in captivity.\n\nIn the wild, giant pandas typically eat bamboo. They are herbivores and their diet consists of almost exclusively bamboo shoots, leaves, and stems. However, they have been known to eat small animals and fish on occasion. Adult giant pandas can consume up to 40 pounds of bamboo per day, as they have a short digestive tract which cannot efficiently absorb nutrients from plants.",
