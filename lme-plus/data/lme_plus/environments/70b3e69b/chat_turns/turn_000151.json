  "content": "The number of points required for a free night can vary greatly depending on the hotel chain, location, and time of year. However, I can give you a general idea of what to expect.\n\nFor mid-range hotels, 20,000 points might be enough for a free night, but it depends on the specific hotel and its points redemption policy. Here's a rough estimate of what you might expect:\n\n* **Hyatt Place**: 15,000-20,000 points per night (Category 1-2 hotels)\n* **La Quinta Inn & Suites**: 15,000-25,000 points per night (depending on the location and season)\n* **Residence Inn**: 20,000-30,000 points per night (Category 1-2 hotels)\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual points required might be higher or lower. I'd recommend checking the hotel's website or contacting their loyalty program directly to get a more accurate estimate.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following factors that might affect the points required:\n\n* **Peak season**: If you're traveling during peak season (October to April in Austin), you might need more points for a free night.\n* **Weekend stays**: Friday and Saturday nights might require more points than weekday stays.\n* **Room type**: If you're looking for a suite or a room with a specific amenity, you might need more points.\n\nBefore booking, make sure to check the hotel's points redemption policy and calculate the points required for your desired stay. You can also consider using a points calculator tool or a travel rewards credit card's travel portal to get a more accurate estimate.\n\nIf you find that 20,000 points aren't enough for a free night, you could consider:\n\n* **Transferring points**: If you have points with a credit card that can be transferred to multiple hotel loyalty programs, you might be able to transfer points to a program that offers better redemption rates.\n* **Booking a lower-category hotel**: If you're flexible with your accommodations, you might be able to find a lower-category hotel that requires fewer points.\n* **Using cash and points**: Some hotels offer the option to book a room using a combination of cash and points. This might be a good option if you're short on points.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy travels!",
