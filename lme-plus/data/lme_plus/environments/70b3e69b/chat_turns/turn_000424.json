Here are some general tips to help keep Luna's litter box clean and odor-free:\n\n1. **Scoop regularly**: Remove solid waste daily, and change the litter completely every 7-10 days. This will prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.\n2. **Use the right litter**: Choose a litter that's designed to control odor, moisture, and dust. Clumping litter like Arm & Hammer can make scooping easier and help reduce odors.\n3. **Clean the litter box thoroughly**: When changing the litter, wash the litter box with mild detergent and warm water. Rinse thoroughly to remove any residue.\n4. **Disinfect regularly**: Use a pet-safe disinfectant to kill bacteria and viruses. You can also add a litter box deodorizer or odor eliminator to help keep the area fresh.\n5. **Provide enough litter boxes**: Make sure you have one litter box per cat, plus one extra. This will reduce competition and stress, which can lead to accidents outside of the litter box.\n6. **Keep the litter box in a well-ventilated area**: This will help reduce moisture and prevent the buildup of ammonia, which can contribute to odors.\n7. **Monitor Luna's health**: If you notice any changes in Luna's litter box behavior, such as accidents outside of the box or avoidance, consult with your veterinarian to rule out any underlying health issues.\n\nRemember to always follow the instructions on the litter packaging and take necessary precautions when handling cat waste to avoid the risk of toxoplasmosis.\n\nI hope these tips help you keep Luna's litter box clean and odor-free!",
