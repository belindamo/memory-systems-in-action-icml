  "content": "Zebra danios are an excellent choice for a community tank!\n\nZebra danios (Danio rerio) are a popular freshwater fish species that are easy to care for, hardy, and very active. They're a great addition to a community tank, especially if you're looking for a schooling fish that can help distract fin nippers. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Care and requirements:**\n\n* Temperature: 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C), but they can tolerate a wide range of temperatures.\n* pH: 6.5 to 8.5, but they prefer slightly acidic to neutral water.\n* Water hardness: They can adapt to soft or hard water.\n* Diet: Omnivores; they eat commercial flake or pellet food, and they love live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, or daphnia.\n* Size: They grow up to 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) in length.\n* Lifespan: 5-7 years in captivity.\n\n**Compatibility:**\n\n* Zebra danios are very peaceful and school in groups, making them a great addition to a community tank.\n* They're active swimmers and can be kept with other active, peaceful fish like platies, neon tetras, and harlequin rasboras.\n* Avoid keeping them with fin nippers or aggressive fish, as they might be stressed or harassed.\n* They're not a good match for very small fish, like white clouds or celestial pearl danios, as they might see them as food.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Very active and entertaining to watch.\n* Hardy and easy to care for.\n* Can thrive in a well-maintained tank with proper water changes.\n* School in groups, which can help distract fin nippers.\n* Relatively inexpensive.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* They can be skittish and might take some time to settle in a new tank.\n* They're prolific breeders, so you might end up with a school of them if you're not careful.\n\n**Tips for keeping zebra danios:**\n\n* Keep them in a school of at least 6-10 individuals to reduce stress and promote schooling behavior.\n* Provide plenty of open swimming space and some hiding places, like plants or rocks.\n* Avoid keeping them in a tank with very strong water currents, as they prefer gentle flow.\n* Feed them a varied diet that includes live or frozen foods to keep them active and healthy.\n\nOverall, zebra danios are an excellent choice for a community tank, and they're compatible with your existing fish. They're easy to care for, and their active swimming behavior can help distract fin nippers. Just make sure to provide them with a suitable environment and plenty of space to thrive!",
