The lyrics you mentioned sound perfect for this project, as they speak to the themes of growth and renewal, which are so fitting for a planter.\n\nA hand-drawn border around the rim of the planter is a great idea! A simple, repeating pattern of leaves or a wavy line can add a nice touch of visual interest without overwhelming the design. It's a great way to tie together the different elements of the design and create a sense of cohesion.\n\nTo make the border work, consider the following tips:\n\n* Keep the border simple and subtle, so it doesn't compete with the illustrations and text. A thin line or a small, repeating pattern will be enough to add visual interest without overwhelming the design.\n* Choose a border that complements the shape of the planter. A wavy line that echoes the curves of the planter can create a sense of movement and flow, while a repeating pattern of leaves can add a touch of organic charm.\n* Consider the color of the border. You can use a contrasting color to make the border stand out, or a similar color to blend it in with the rest of the design.\n* Don't overdo it! A small, delicate border is all you need to add visual interest. Too much can make the design feel cluttered and overwhelming.\n\nSome other ideas for borders you might consider:\n\n* A small, hand-drawn vine or tendril that wraps around the rim of the planter\n* A series of small, interconnected circles or dots that create a sense of movement\n* A simple, hand-drawn pattern of lines or shapes that echoes the texture of the terracotta clay\n\nRemember, the key is to keep it simple and subtle, so the focus remains on the illustrations, text, and the natural beauty of the clay and the plants.\n\nWhat do you think about adding a small, personal message or signature to the bottom of the planter? It could be a nice way to make the piece feel more special and unique.",
