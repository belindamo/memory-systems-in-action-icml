Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Step 1: Open your antivirus software**\n\nLocate the antivirus software on your computer and open it. The icon is usually found in the system tray (bottom right corner of the screen) or in the Start menu. Common antivirus software includes Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky, and Windows Defender.\n\n**Step 2: Update your antivirus software**\n\nClick on the \"Update\" or \"Live Update\" button to ensure you have the latest virus definitions. This may take a few minutes, depending on the speed of your internet connection (congrats on the upgrade to 500 Mbps, by the way!).\n\n**Step 3: Run a full system scan**\n\nLook for the \"Scan\" or \"Full Scan\" option and select it. This will scan your entire computer for malware, including viruses, Trojans, and other types of malicious software. Depending on the size of your hard drive and the speed of your computer, this process may take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours.\n\n**Step 4: Review the scan results**\n\nOnce the scan is complete, review the results to see if any threats were detected. If your antivirus software finds any malware, it will usually prompt you to quarantine or remove the threats.\n\n**Step 5: Remove detected threats**\n\nIf threats are detected, follow the prompts to remove or quarantine them. Make sure to restart your computer after removing any malware to ensure the removal process is complete.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure your antivirus software is set to update automatically to ensure you have the latest protection.\n* Consider running a scan in Safe Mode to detect and remove any malware that might be hiding in your system.\n* Keep your operating system and software up-to-date, as newer versions often include security patches and improvements.\n* Be cautious when clicking on links or opening attachments from unknown sources to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nAs for your new internet plan, the increased speed should definitely improve your overall online experience. You might notice improvements in:\n\n* Faster downloads and uploads\n* Smoother video streaming\n* Quicker online gaming performance\n* Improved overall browsing experience\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues with your computer's performance after running the full system scan and updating your antivirus software, there might be other factors at play.
