  "content": "Harlequin rasboras are a wonderful addition to a community tank! They're peaceful, active, and very entertaining to watch. Platies and harlequin rasboras can be kept together, but there are some things to consider:\n\n**Compatibility:**\n\n* Harlequin rasboras are generally peaceful and can be kept with peaceful community fish like platies.\n* However, platies can be fin-nippers, and harlequin rasboras have long, flowing fins. Keep an eye on your platies' behavior, and if you notice any fin nipping, separate them.\n* Harlequin rasboras are a shoaling species and prefer to be in groups of 6-10 or more. Platies, on the other hand, can be kept in small schools or singly.\n\n**Water Requirements:**\n\n* Harlequin rasboras are native to Southeast Asia and prefer soft, slightly acidic water.\n* Ideal water parameters for harlequin rasboras:\n\t+ pH: 6.5-7.5\n\t+ Water Hardness (dGH): 5-10\n\t+ Temperature: 72\u00b0F-82\u00b0F (22\u00b0C-28\u00b0C)\n* Platies are more adaptable to water conditions, but they also prefer soft to moderately hard water.\n\n**Tank Requirements:**\n\n* Harlequin rasboras are active swimmers and need plenty of swimming space. A minimum tank size of 10-15 gallons is recommended.\n* They prefer a well-planted tank with plenty of hiding places and open swimming areas.\n* Platies, on the other hand, can thrive in smaller tanks (5-10 gallons) with plenty of hiding places and open swimming areas.\n\n**Tips for Keeping Harlequin Rasboras with Platies:**\n\n* Introduce the harlequin rasboras to the tank first, allowing them to establish themselves before adding the platies.\n* Monitor the behavior of both species, and separate them if you notice any signs of aggression or fin nipping.\n* Provide plenty of hiding places and visual barriers to reduce stress and territorial behavior.\n* Maintain good water quality and perform regular water changes to ensure the health and well-being of both species.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a harmonious and thriving community tank with harlequin rasboras and platies. Enjoy!",
