Now, the question is whether to prune again to encourage more blooms or wait until the blooming season is over.\n\nHere are some general guidelines to consider:\n\n1. **Deadheading:** If you notice any dead or wilted flowers, you can remove them (deadhead) at any time to encourage the plant to focus its energy on producing new blooms. This is a gentle pruning technique that won't harm the plant.\n2. **Shaping and promoting blooms:** If you want to encourage more blooms, you can do some light pruning to shape the bush and promote air circulation. Remove any weak or spindly growth, and cut back any stems that are crossing or rubbing against each other. This will help the plant direct its energy towards producing more flowers.\n3. **Wait until the blooming season is over:** If you want to do a more extensive pruning to rejuvenate the plant or control its size, it's generally recommended to wait until the blooming season is over. This will give the plant a chance to complete its flowering cycle and store energy for the next growing season.\n\nConsidering your rose bush is already producing new buds, it's likely that it's still in the blooming season. You can try doing some light pruning to shape the bush and promote air circulation, as mentioned earlier. However, if you want to do a more extensive pruning, it's best to wait until the blooming season is over.\n\nHere are some additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Prune at the right time:** For most rose varieties, the best time to prune is during the dormant season (winter or early spring), when the plant is not actively growing. Pruning during this time helps promote healthy growth and encourages new blooms.\n* **Prune with care:** When pruning, make clean cuts at a 45-degree angle, and remove any weak or diseased wood. This will help prevent the spread of disease and encourage healthy growth.\n* **Monitor your plant:** Keep an eye on your rose bush's response to pruning. If you notice any signs of stress or disease, adjust your pruning strategy accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps! If you're still unsure, feel free to provide more information about your rose bush, such as its variety, age, and growing conditions, and I'll do my best to provide more tailored advice.",
