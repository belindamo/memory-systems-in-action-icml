Make sure to take advantage of their expertise and ask questions to clarify any points you're unsure about.\n\nRemember to also ask the lawyer to explain the reasoning behind their suggestions or changes. This will help you understand the legal implications and make informed decisions about your contracts.\n\nAdditionally, consider asking the lawyer about any specific concerns or potential risks they've identified in your contracts. This will help you address potential issues before they become major problems.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you need any further guidance or have more questions. And kudos to you for taking proactive steps to ensure your startup's contracts are solid!\n\nBy the way, how was the speed networking event?
