  "content": "3) Software Dev Timeline\nReference: \"3.3 Fechas de eventos relevantes y entrega de la prestaci\u00f3n de los Servicios, Modulo II\"\nThe time required for this phase of the project depends on the auction design chosen. While the time allowed for the development of use cases/traceability matrix (20 working days) and delivery of the application in a QA environment (20 working days) is feasible for the implementation of most standard spectrum auction formats, additional time may be required in case a bespoke auction design or a very complex auction process is chosen. \nWe suggest to allow for flexibility in this regard and to explicitly allow for an extension of the development timeline at a later point in the project, for example at Milestone: \"Selecci\u00f3n de mecanismo de asignaci\u00f3n por parte del Instituto\". Comments regarding the implications of choosing a given auction design recommendation for the development timeline can be given in the report delivered in Modulo I.",
