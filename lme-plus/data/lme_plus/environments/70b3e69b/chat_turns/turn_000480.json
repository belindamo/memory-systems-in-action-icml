Here are a few points to help you weigh the costs:\n\n**Cost of Film:**\n\n* A roll of 35mm film can cost anywhere from $5 to $15, depending on the brand and type.\n* You'll get around 24-36 exposures per roll, so that's approximately $0.20 to $0.60 per shot.\n\n**Cost of Development:**\n\n* Developing a roll of film can cost anywhere from $5 to $20, depending on the lab and services.\n* Some labs offer discounts for bulk development or loyalty programs, which can help reduce costs.\n\n**Cost of Digital Photography:**\n\n* A digital camera can cost anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.\n* While you won't have to pay for film or development, you'll still need to consider the cost of memory cards, batteries, and potential repairs.\n\n**Benefits of Shooting with Film:**\n\n* Unique aesthetic: Film has a distinct look and feel that many photographers love.\n* Tactile experience: Shooting with film provides a hands-on, tactile experience that many photographers enjoy.\n* Slowing down: Film encourages you to slow down and be more intentional with your shots, which can lead to better composition and storytelling.\n* Artisanal process: Developing your own film can be a fun and rewarding process that connects you to the artistic side of photography.\n\n**Digital Photography Benefits:**\n\n* Cost-effective: Once you've invested in a digital camera, you can take as many shots as you want without additional costs.\n* Instant feedback: You can review and adjust your shots immediately, which can help you improve your technique faster.\n* Convenience: Digital cameras are often more compact and lightweight, making them easier to carry around.\n\nUltimately, whether to shoot with film or digital depends on your personal preferences, goals, and budget. If you're looking for a unique aesthetic and a more tactile experience, film might be worth the expense. However, if you're on a tight budget or prioritize convenience, digital photography might be a better fit.\n\nConsider starting with a few rolls of film to see if you enjoy the process and results. You can always switch to digital later or continue to shoot with film as a hobby.",
