However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or direct product recommendations. But I can provide you with some general guidance on what to look for in an orthopedic bed for Luna:\n\n1. **Orthopedic support**: Look for beds with thick, supportive foam that will provide adequate cushioning and pressure relief for Luna's joints.\n2. **Material**: Consider beds made from high-quality, breathable materials like memory foam, latex, or gel-infused foam. These materials can help regulate Luna's body temperature and provide comfort.\n3. **Size**: Measure Luna's favorite sleeping spot to ensure the new bed fits comfortably in that area. You should also consider her size and breed to choose a bed that's suitable for her.\n4. **Cover**: A removable, washable cover is a must-have for easy cleaning and maintenance. Look for beds with durable, comfortable covers made from materials like cotton, fleece, or polyester.\n5. **Brand reputation**: Research reputable brands that specialize in orthopedic pet beds, such as Big Barker, K&H Pet Products, or Orthopedic Dog Bed. Read reviews from other pet owners to get an idea of the bed's quality and performance.\n6. **Warranty**: Check if the manufacturer offers a warranty or guarantee on their products. This can give you peace of mind and protect your investment.\n7. **Price**: Orthopedic beds can range from affordable to very expensive. Set a budget and look for beds that meet your needs within that range.\n\nSome popular online retailers for pet beds include:\n\n* Chewy.com\n* Petco.com\n* Amazon.com\n* 1800PetMeds.com\n\nYou can also consult with your veterinarian for recommendations on orthopedic beds or visit a local pet store to get a better feel for the products.\n\nRemember to introduce the new bed gradually to Luna, allowing her to get accustomed to the new texture, smell, and feel. Good luck, and I hope Luna loves her new bed!",
