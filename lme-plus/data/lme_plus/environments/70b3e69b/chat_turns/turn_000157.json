Here are some popular areas to consider:\n\n1. **South Congress (SoCo)**: As you mentioned, SoCo is a fantastic area to stay in. It's known for its eclectic shops, restaurants, and music venues. You'll find plenty of boutiques, art galleries, and food trucks along the iconic South Congress Avenue. It's a vibrant and lively area, but still relatively quiet at night.\n2. **Downtown**: Staying downtown puts you in the heart of the action, with many restaurants, bars, and live music venues within walking distance. You'll be close to the Texas State Capitol, 6th Street, and the Red River Cultural District.\n3. **Rainey Street**: This historic neighborhood is just southeast of downtown and features a mix of old and new Austin charm. You'll find converted houses turned into bars, restaurants, and music venues, along with some great food trucks.\n4. **East Austin**: This up-and-coming neighborhood is just east of downtown and is known for its artsy vibe, eclectic shops, and a growing food scene. It's a great area to stay if you want to experience the \"real\" Austin.\n5. **Clarksville**: This charming neighborhood is just west of downtown and features a small-town feel. You'll find plenty of boutiques, restaurants, and coffee shops along West Lynn Street.\n\nAll of these neighborhoods offer a unique Austin experience, and each has its pros and cons. SoCo is a great choice if you want to be in the heart of the action, while Downtown is ideal if you want to be close to the Texas State Capitol and 6th Street. Rainey Street and East Austin offer a more laid-back, artsy vibe, while Clarksville provides a charming, small-town feel.\n\nWhen choosing a neighborhood, consider what you want to do during your trip and what kind of atmosphere you prefer. If you have any specific interests or preferences, I can give you more tailored recommendations!",
