This is because the CSV file only provides the details of each card, including the list it belongs to, but it doesn't provide a snapshot of the current state of the board.\n\nTo see the current cards in the \"Projects\" list, you would need to access the Trello board directly. If you have access to the board, you can navigate to it and view the \"Projects\" list to see the current cards on it.",
