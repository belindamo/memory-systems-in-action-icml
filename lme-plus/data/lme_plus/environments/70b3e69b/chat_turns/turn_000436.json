And, of course, scoring a 20% discount on your light blue denim jacket from the outlet store is a great deal!\n\nAs for pairing the 501 Original Fit with your light blue denim jacket, I think it could work really well. Here's why:\n\n1. **Contrasting washes**: The 501 Original Fit typically comes in a darker wash, which would provide a nice contrast to the light blue jacket. This contrast will create visual interest and make your outfit more engaging.\n2. **Similar denim styles**: Both the 501 Original Fit and your light blue jacket are denim, which means they share a similar texture and style. This similarity will create a sense of cohesion in your outfit.\n3. **Balancing the look**: The 501 Original Fit has a more relaxed fit, which will balance out the slightly more fitted silhouette of the light blue jacket. This balance will create a more harmonious look.\n\nTo make the outfit work, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Add a neutral top**: Choose a neutral-colored top, like a white or light-gray tee, to break up the denim-on-denim look.\n2. **Add some contrast**: Add some contrast with accessories, like a belt, shoes, or a hat, to create visual interest.\n3. **Play with textures**: Mix and match different textures, like the smooth denim jacket with the slightly rougher 501 Original Fit jeans.\n\nRemember, fashion is all about experimentation and having fun. Try pairing the 501 Original Fit with your light blue denim jacket and see how you feel about the look. You might be surprised at how great it turns out!",
