  "content": "Ok, we would like your help to write this response to the comments we received: It is difficult to say whether it would be appropriate for us to consider a revised paper without knowing whether you can address the further experiments that the reviewers require. If you are interested in pursuing further consideration of this work at iScience, you would need to first submit a point-by-point response that indicates how you intend to address the reviewer concerns and outlines how any corresponding results and/or edits would be incorporated into a revised manuscript. Once I receive this document I would assess the plan for revision, perhaps in consultation with the reviewers. Based on these considerations, we would either reactivate the manuscript file to enable resubmission or recommend submission elsewhere.",
