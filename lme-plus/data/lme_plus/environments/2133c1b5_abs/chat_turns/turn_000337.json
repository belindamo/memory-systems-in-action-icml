It's wonderful that you're experimenting with different fertilizers to find what works best for your plants.\n\nSince you got your snake plant last Saturday, it's likely still in the process of adjusting to its new environment. Snake plants can take a few weeks to settle in and start thriving, so it's great that you're seeing positive signs already.\n\nFertilizing your snake plant can help provide it with the necessary nutrients to support healthy growth and development. Snake plants are native to tropical regions, so they tend to thrive in environments with high humidity and bright, indirect light.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when caring for your snake plant:\n\n* **Lighting**: Snake plants prefer bright, indirect light, but they can tolerate low light conditions. Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to become scorched, so it's best to provide filtered or dappled light.\n* **Watering**: Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's better to err on the side of caution.\n* **Humidity**: Snake plants prefer high humidity, but they can adapt to average humidity levels. To keep your snake plant happy, you can place it on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier nearby.\n* **Temperature**: Snake plants prefer temperatures between 65-75\u00b0F (18-24\u00b0C), which is typical for most indoor spaces.\n\nBy providing your snake plant with the right care and nutrients, you should see it continue to thrive. Remember to monitor its progress and adjust your care routine as needed.\n\nDo you have any other questions about snake plant care or fertilization?",
