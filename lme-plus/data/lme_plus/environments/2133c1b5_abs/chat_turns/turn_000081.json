Here are some suggestions for introducing the theme and getting the kids started on their project:\n\n**Introducing the Theme:**\n\n1. **Visual Inspiration:** Show the kids images or examples of the theme, such as pictures of cities or forests. This can help spark their imagination and give them a sense of what the theme is about.\n2. **Storytelling:** Tell a brief story related to the theme, such as a tale about a city's history or a magical forest. This can help the kids connect emotionally with the theme and get their creative juices flowing.\n3. **Brainstorming:** Ask the kids to brainstorm words or ideas associated with the theme. For example, if the theme is a cityscape, they might come up with words like \"skyscrapers,\" \"cars,\" \"people,\" or \"buildings.\" This can help them generate ideas and get excited about the project.\n\n**Getting Started:**\n\n1. **Group Discussion:** Have each group discuss their ideas and brainstorm together. Encourage them to share their thoughts, listen to each other, and build upon each other's ideas.\n2. **Sketching:** Have the groups create a quick sketch or rough outline of their idea. This can help them visualize their concept and get a sense of the composition.\n3. **Material Exploration:** Introduce the materials and let the groups explore and experiment with different textures, colors, and techniques. This can help them get a sense of what they can create and how they can bring their idea to life.\n4. **Collaborative Goal-Setting:** Have each group set a collaborative goal for their project. For example, they might decide to create a cityscape with a specific number of buildings, or a forest with a certain number of trees. This can help them stay focused and work together towards a common goal.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Provide Examples:** Consider providing examples of mixed media collages that fit the theme, to give the kids an idea of what's possible.\n* **Encourage Imagination:** Emphasize the importance of imagination and creativity, and encourage the kids to think outside the box and try new things.\n* **Add Constraints:** Consider adding some constraints to the project, such as a specific color palette or a limited number of materials, to encourage creativity and problem-solving.\n* **Make it Interactive:** Consider making the project more interactive, such as by adding 3D elements or creating a diorama.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help the kids get started on their project and set them up for success. Remember to circulate around the groups, offer guidance and feedback, and encourage them to have fun and be creative!",
