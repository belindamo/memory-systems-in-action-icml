  "content": "It's great to hear that you and your sister have talked things through and are in a better place now. However, it's understandable that the experience still lingers and has had a significant impact on your anxiety levels.\n\nIt's amazing that you're acknowledging the physical symptoms you experienced during that time. The tightness in your chest and sense of dread are classic signs of anxiety, and it's no wonder you felt like you were walking on eggshells. It's as if your body was constantly on high alert, waiting for the next potential threat.\n\nLet's explore this further. When you think back to that period, what do you think triggered the anxiety the most? Was it the uncertainty of the situation, the fear of confrontation, or something else entirely?\n\nAlso, have you noticed any lingering effects from that experience? Do you still feel anxious when you think about the disagreement or interact with your sister, or has that anxiety started to dissipate now that you've talked things through?\n\nLastly, are there any coping mechanisms or strategies that you used during that time to manage your anxiety, or was it more of a \"just get through it\" kind of situation?",
