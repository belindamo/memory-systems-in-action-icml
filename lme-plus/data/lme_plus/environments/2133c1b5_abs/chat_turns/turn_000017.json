  "content": "I did explore the potential of AI-powered adaptive learning systems to promote equity and inclusion in my research. I found that these systems have the potential to help reduce achievement gaps and provide more personalized support to students who may be struggling. However, I also identified some concerns around the potential for bias in the algorithms used to drive these systems, which could exacerbate existing inequities if not addressed.\n\nRegarding feedback, I presented my research at a conference over the summer and received a lot of positive feedback from educators and policymakers. Many of them appreciated the nuanced approach I took to exploring the challenges and opportunities of AI-powered adaptive learning systems. Some developers also reached out to me afterwards, interested in learning more about my findings and how they could apply them to their own work.\n\nOne area of disagreement I encountered was around the role of teachers in AI-powered adaptive learning systems. Some educators were concerned that these systems would replace teachers, while others saw them as a valuable tool to support teaching and learning.",
