  "content": "Reviewer #2: Suen et al., aimed to investigate the chromatin landscape of murine gonadal cells from XY and XX during the process of sex determination. To that aim they performed scATAC-Seq on gonads from E11.5, E12.5, E13.5 and E14.5 and analysed the data to get clusters of cells with similar epigenetic profiles. They then used published datasets of RNA-sew to assign identity to the various clusters and tried to make biological meaning of the data.\nWhile the main question of understanding the chromatin landscape is very needed, the current work, in the way conducted and presented does not contribute much to what is known. For this comment, we don't agree with reviewer's accessment",
