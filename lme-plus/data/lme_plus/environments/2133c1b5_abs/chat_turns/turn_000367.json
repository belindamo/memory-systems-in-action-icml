It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're recognizing the potential triggers for your anxiety. Acknowledging the sources of your stress is a huge step towards addressing them. Let's break down each of these factors and see if we can identify some ways to tackle them:\n\n1. **The move**: It's normal for a big change like a move to cause stress. The process of packing, unpacking, and settling into a new space can be exhausting, both physically and mentally. Have you taken some time to relax and enjoy your new space? Perhaps create a cozy corner or do something that makes you feel at home?\n2. **New job**: Starting a new job can be daunting, and it's natural to feel anxious about adjusting to a new routine, colleagues, and responsibilities. Are there any specific aspects of the job that are causing you the most stress? Maybe we can brainstorm some strategies to help you cope with those challenges.\n3. **Disagreement with your sister**: It's tough when conflicts with loved ones trigger anxiety. Have you talked to your sister about the issue since the disagreement, or is there still some unresolved tension? We can discuss ways to approach the situation and work on communication strategies to help you feel more comfortable.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's great that you're reaching out for support. What would you like to focus on first? Would you like to explore some stress-reducing techniques, or tackle one of these specific areas together?",
