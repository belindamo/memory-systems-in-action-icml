The good news is that weight gain can be managed with lifestyle changes. Here are some tips to help you avoid gaining weight after quitting smoking:\n\n1. Exercise regularly: Exercise can help you lose and maintain weight. Start with moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, and gradually increase the intensity and duration.\n\n2. Eat a healthy diet: Focus on eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid high-calorie, processed foods, and limit your alcohol consumption.\n\n3.
