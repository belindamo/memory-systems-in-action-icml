  "content": "We respectfully disagree with the reviewer's assessment that our work does not contribute much to current knowledge. Our study provides a valuable resource for understanding the single-cell chromatin landscape in mouse embryonic gonads during the process of sex determination. Through the use of scATAC-Seq and analysis of the data, we were able to identify clusters of cells with similar epigenetic profiles and assign identity to these clusters using published RNA-seq datasets. This information contributes to our overall understanding of the chromatin landscape in this important biological process.",
