It's about 30 minutes from Matsumoto City by bus or taxi.\n2. **Utsukushigahara Onsen** (): A scenic hot spring resort area with stunning views of the Japanese Alps. It's about 45 minutes from Matsumoto City by bus or taxi.\n3. **Hirata Onsen** (): A historic onsen facility with a traditional atmosphere, offering both indoor and outdoor baths. It's about 20 minutes from Matsumoto City by bus or taxi.\n4. **Matsumoto Onsen Hotel** (): A hotel with a public onsen facility, offering a relaxing atmosphere and scenic views of the surrounding mountains. It's located in the heart of Matsumoto City.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Many onsen facilities have specific rules and customs, such as washing your body before entering the hot spring, not tattooed individuals are not allowed, and some onsen may not accept foreigners.\n* Some onsen may offer private baths for rent, which can be a good option if you're not comfortable with public bathing.\n* Be sure to check the onsen's website or contact them in advance to confirm their hours, prices, and any specific rules or requirements.\n\nIn addition to these onsen, Matsumoto City has many public baths (sent\u014d) that offer a more local and affordable experience. These public baths are a great way to mingle with locals and experience daily Japanese life.\n\nRemember to also explore Matsumoto's historic castle, traditional architecture, and local cuisine during your stay.
