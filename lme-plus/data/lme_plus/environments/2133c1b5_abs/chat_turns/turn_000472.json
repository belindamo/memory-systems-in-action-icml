Studying SBM, the system has been broken down into 3 core aspects:\n\n5.1.1 Mind\nA mage whose mind is not in synergy with their magic, is no mage. Of the three cardinal rules to magic in Miseishun, the largest similarity between SBM and TMF is utilizing the \u2018mind,\u2019 as in, creative intuition. Master Roterun casters will often send disciples on missions to bond with their powers; avoiding specific procedures in pursuit of open-mindedness, and awareness for what their abilities mean, and can achieve. This is in contrast to TOR studies which break down the components of what make spells, to achieve very specific and particular effects.\n\n5.1.2 Body\nRoterun monks and mages practice in giving up important parts of their lifestyle to further their bond to magic. This can include fasting, a year of silence, daily visits and prayers to a certain location, etc. Essentially anything that proves a mage worthy of using the arts through sacrifice works, though it has to be meaningful. Actual benefits of this practice are vague, as TMF practitioners argue this simply diminishes an individual\u2019s ability to study, confer and train. On the other hand there are definite examples of individuals who have undergone this ritual and demonstrated heightened magical capabilities, showing this practice may not be impractical. Whether this is circumstantial is unknown, but a popular theory regarding these effects is that these allow for a clearer headspace, thus affecting the cardinal aspect, mind.\n\n5.1.3 Spirit\nMost Roterun mages meditate to further their spiritual connection to magic. This means uninterrupted hours of silence and deep thought. Meditating at particularly magical or paranormal areas will also strengthen the potency of the meditation, making Seishan mountain a popular rite of passage for learning mages. This actually aligns with TMF findings, as locations that have seen significant loss of life or magical use, can create \u2018Manaworld Deviations\u2019 (MD). This is due to either residual mana particles leftover from an incident, or a concavity in the Manaworld leading to natural accumulation of energy.\n\n5.1.4 Benefits and Drawbacks\nThe Magic Arts faculty has discovered the main differences between TMF scholars and SBM practitioners are \u2018reflexual\u2019. TMF users view magic as compounds, or formulas. This paves way for a more efficient spell creation system, where given the time, a practiced mage can hone every minor aspect of a cast. Furthermore, TMF scholars heavily specialize in specific areas, doing one thing very well. This is in direct contrast with SBM practitioners, observed to be able to do a wide variety of less sophisticated things. \n\nBody enhancement spells have been a long-time difficulty for TMF scholars, where every variation seemingly uses a large amount of mana and incessant levels of focus to maintain. However, SBM users seem to do this almost naturally. Roterun mages have been witnessed to maintain medium-level body augmentation spells for incredibly long durations, during combat. Furthermore, average casting time between the two systems is roughly halved for SBM users, demonstrating the \u2018reflexual\u2019 theory from before. Roterun mages generally have a higher affinity for a wider variety of magic types as well, and can sometimes even mesh \u2018polar magics\u2019 (e.g, fire-water). \n\n5.1.5 Summary\nIt should be stressed that TOR does not believe SBM is neither \u2018worse\u2019 nor \u2018better\u2019 than TMF, rather, it is just unstudied and experimental, which may remain the case due to the inherent nature of the system. TOR cannot offer as many resources to practitioners of SBM compared to TMF, as TMF is still the primary system used by the organization. However, the Magical Arts faculty is always willing to participate in studies of the system to gain a better understanding of its various components. \"",
