I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't retain any information from previous conversations.\n\nNow, regarding the documents required for your green card application, it's essential to note that the specific documents needed may vary depending on your individual circumstances and the type of green card you're applying for. However, here are some common documents that are typically required:\n\n1. **Passport-style photos**: You'll need to provide recent, identical passport-style photos that meet the Department of State's requirements.\n2. **Birth certificate**: A copy of your birth certificate, along with a certified translation if it's not in English.\n3. **Passport**: A copy of your valid passport, including all pages with visas, stamps, and entry/exit dates.\n4. **Visa approval notice**: If you're applying for a green card through a family-based or employment-based visa, you'll need a copy of your approved visa petition (Form I-797).\n5. **Divorce or death certificate**: If you're applying for a green card as a spouse or widow(er) of a U.S. citizen, you may need to provide a divorce or death certificate.\n6. **Marriage certificate**: If you're applying for a green card as a spouse of a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you'll need a marriage certificate, along with proof of a valid marriage (e.g., joint bank statements, leases, or birth certificates of children).\n7. **Police certificates**: You may need police certificates from your home country, as well as from any countries where you've lived for the past five years.\n8. **Medical examination**: You'll need to undergo a medical examination by a designated civil surgeon to ensure you don't have any health issues that would make you inadmissible to the United States.\n9. **Proof of financial support**: You may need to provide proof of financial support, such as tax returns, pay stubs, or proof of income, to demonstrate that you won't become a public charge.\n10. **Completed forms**: You'll need to complete and sign various forms, such as Form I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) and Form I-864 (Affidavit of Support).\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list, and you should check the official U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website or consult with an immigration attorney to ensure you have all the required documents for your specific situation.\n\nRemember to carefully review the instructions and requirements for each document to avoid any issues with your application. Good luck with your green card application!",
