No one has seen this individual up close, but they've reported strange lights and eerie sounds emanating from the area where this figure was last seen. It's possible that we're dealing with a rogue wizard or a magical cult, as you suggested.\"\n\nHe pauses, collecting his thoughts. \"There's also an ancient ruin within the Whispering Woods, known as the Moonstone Spire. It's said to house a powerful artifact that can bend the forces of nature to one's will. We've always avoided the place, believing it to be cursed, but it's possible that someone or something has disturbed the artifact, causing this imbalance in the forest.\"\n\nWith this new information, do you:\n\n1. Offer to investigate the mysterious figure in the forest.\n2. Suggest heading to the Moonstone Spire to search for answers.\n3. Request the help of the villagers in dealing with the problem.\n4. Suggest that Eadric consult with other druids in the region for advice.",
