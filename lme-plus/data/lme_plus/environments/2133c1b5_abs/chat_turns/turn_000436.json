I'm also thinking of organizing my clothes by type, so all my dresses are together, all my tops are together, and so on. I want to make it easy to find what I need and make the most of my closet space. Plus, I just got some new storage bins from IKEA last weekend, so I'm excited to use them to keep my closet organized!",
