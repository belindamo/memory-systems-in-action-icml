What are some of the things that make this a city?\"\n* Write down their responses on a whiteboard or chart paper, such as \"buildings,\" \"cars,\" \"people,\" \"streets,\" etc.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n* Ask the kids: \"What kind of city would you like to create? Would it be a futuristic city, a historical city, or a city from your imagination?\"\n* Ask them to think about what makes a city unique, such as \"What kind of buildings would you like to see in your city? Would it have tall skyscrapers or small shops?\"\n* Ask them to consider the sounds and smells of a city, such as \"What kind of noises would you hear in your city? Would it smell like food from restaurants or exhaust from cars?\"\n\n**Sketching:**\n\n* Give each group a large piece of paper and some markers or colored pencils.\n* Ask them to sketch out their idea of a cityscape, considering the brainstorming questions from earlier.\n* Encourage them to think about the composition of their city, such as \"Where would you put the buildings? Would you have a main street or a park?\"\n\n**Forest:**\n\n**Introduction:**\n\n* Show the kids a picture of a forest, such as a photograph or an illustration.\n* Ask them: \"What do you see in this picture?

Would it be a dense jungle, a magical forest, or a forest from your backyard?\"\n* Ask them to think about what makes a forest special, such as \"What kind of animals would you like to see in your forest? Would it have a river or a waterfall?\"\n* Ask them to consider the senses of a forest, such as \"What kind of sounds would you hear in your forest? Would it smell like flowers or damp earth?\"\n\n**Sketching:**\n\n* Give each group a large piece of paper and some markers or colored pencils.\n* Ask them to sketch out their idea of a forest, considering the brainstorming questions from earlier.\n* Encourage them to think about the layers of a forest, such as \"Where would you put the trees? Would you have a canopy or a forest floor?\"\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n* Encourage the kids to use their imagination and think creatively.\n* Ask open-ended questions to encourage brainstorming and discussion.\n* Circulate around the groups to offer guidance and feedback, and to help facilitate their brainstorming and sketching process.\n* Remind them that this is a collaborative project, and that everyone's ideas are important and valued.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help the kids get started on their project and set them up for success.
