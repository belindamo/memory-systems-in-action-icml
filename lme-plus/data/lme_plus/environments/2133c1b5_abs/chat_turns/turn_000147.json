The Immortalists and The Family Upstairs are both excellent character-driven novels.\n\nRegarding non-fiction, I've got some fascinating recommendations that might interest you:\n\n1. **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind** by Yuval Noah Harari: A sweeping narrative that covers the entire history of humankind, from the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa to the present day. It's engaging, thought-provoking, and surprisingly easy to read.\n2. **The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History** by Elizabeth Kolbert: A compelling exploration of the current mass extinction event caused by human activity. Kolbert's writing is accessible, and her storytelling is top-notch, making this book hard to put down.\n3. **The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer** by Siddhartha Mukherjee: A comprehensive and captivating history of cancer, from its first recorded cases to the latest treatments. Mukherjee's writing is lyrical, and his narrative is both informative and engaging.\n4. **The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America's Shining Women** by Kate Moore: A haunting and well-researched account of the women who worked in radium-dial factories during WWI and their struggles with radiation poisoning.

Since you're coming from a novel about old Hollywood, you might enjoy the more narrative-driven approach of these books.\n\nIf you're interested in something a bit more lighthearted, I can also recommend:\n\n1. **Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike** by Phil Knight: A fascinating memoir about the early days of Nike and the entrepreneurial spirit of its founder.\n2. **Yes Please** by Amy Poehler: A humorous and relatable memoir about the actress's life, career, and personal growth.\n3. **Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood** by Trevor Noah: A hilarious and poignant memoir about the comedian's childhood in South Africa during the apartheid era.\n\nLet me know if any of these catch your eye!",
