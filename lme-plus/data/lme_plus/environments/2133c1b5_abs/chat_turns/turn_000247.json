Here are some healthy oils that are perfect for stir-fries and saut\u00e9ing:\n\n**Top Picks**\n\n1. **Avocado Oil**: Mild, buttery flavor and a high smoke point (520\u00b0F/271\u00b0C) make avocado oil ideal for high-heat cooking. It's rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and antioxidants.\n2. **Ghee (Clarified Butter)**: Ghee has a nutty flavor and a high smoke point (485\u00b0F/252\u00b0C). It's lactose-free, rich in fat-soluble vitamins, and has anti-inflammatory properties.\n3. **Coconut Oil**: With a high smoke point (350\u00b0F/177\u00b0C), coconut oil is suitable for medium-high heat cooking. It's rich in saturated fats, which are stable at high temperatures, and has antimicrobial properties.\n\n**Other Healthy Options**\n\n1. **Peanut Oil**: Mild, nutty flavor and a high smoke point (450\u00b0F/232\u00b0C) make peanut oil a great choice for stir-fries. It's rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.\n2. **Sesame Oil**: Strong, nutty flavor and a medium smoke point (410\u00b0F/215\u00b0C) make sesame oil perfect for low-heat cooking or as a finishing oil. It's rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds.\n3. **Olive Oil**: While not ideal for high-heat cooking, olive oil is great for low-heat saut\u00e9ing and adding flavor to dishes. Look for a high-quality, extra-virgin olive oil for the best flavor and nutritional benefits.\n4. **Rice Bran Oil**: Light, nutty flavor and a high smoke point (490\u00b0F/254\u00b0C) make rice bran oil suitable for high-heat cooking. It's rich in heart-healthy unsaturated fats and antioxidants.\n\n**What to Avoid**\n\n1. **Partially Hydrogenated Oils**: These oils, like partially hydrogenated soybean oil, contain unhealthy trans fats that can increase heart disease risk.\n2. **Vegetable Oils**: While marketed as healthy, many vegetable oils (e.g., canola, corn, and soybean oil) are often highly processed and contain unhealthy omega-6 fatty acids.\n\nWhen choosing an oil, consider the flavor profile you want, the cooking temperature, and the nutritional benefits. Always opt for high-quality, expeller-pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you're getting the best flavor and nutrition. Happy cooking!",
