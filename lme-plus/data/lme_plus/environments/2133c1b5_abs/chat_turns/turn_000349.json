And using a white noise machine is a great idea to block out any external noise.\n\nAdding calming scents and plants to your bedroom can definitely help create a more relaxing atmosphere. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n* **Calming scents**: In addition to lavender, vanilla, and chamomile, you could also try scents like bergamot, ylang-ylang, or sandalwood. You can use essential oils in a diffuser or apply them to your pillowcase.\n* **Plants**: Some plants are known to promote relaxation and improve air quality. Consider adding plants like lavender, snake plants, or peace lilies to your bedroom. They're low-maintenance and can thrive in low-light conditions.\n* **Soft lighting**: Consider adding some soft, warm lighting to your bedroom. Table lamps or string lights can create a cozy atmosphere and help you wind down before bed.\n* **Comforting textiles**: Add some comforting textiles like a plush throw blanket, a soft area rug, or a cozy pillow to make your bedroom feel more inviting.\n* **Minimize technology**: Try to keep technology out of your bedroom as much as possible. Avoid having a TV or computer in your bedroom, and consider charging your phone in another room.\n\nRemember, it's all about creating a sleep sanctuary that helps you relax and unwind. Experiment with different elements and see what works best for you.\n\nAlso, don't forget to maintain your consistent sleep schedule and bedtime routine. With a relaxing sleep environment and a consistent routine, you'll be well on your way to improving your sleep quality.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these suggestions? Do you have any other ideas for creating a more relaxing bedroom environment?",
