I'll also invest in a good yoga mat and props to make the practice more comfortable. I'm excited to get started and see how yoga can benefit my mental and physical well-being.\n\nSpeaking of which, I've been thinking about my job and how it contributes to my anxiety. I feel like I've been trying to seek validation from my colleagues and supervisors, which can be really stressful. Do you have any advice on how to shift my focus from seeking external validation to focusing on my own needs and desires?",
