I'm happy to help you with DIY fertilizers and spider plant propagation.\n\n**DIY Fertilizers:**\n\nBefore we dive into spider plant propagation, let's explore more DIY fertilizer ideas:\n\n1. **Vegetable scraps**: Bury vegetable scraps like carrot tops, onion peels, or celery leaves in the soil to create a nutrient-rich fertilizer.\n2. **Fish tank water**: Use the water from your fish tank to fertilize your plants. It's rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n3. **Wood ash**: Wood ash from your fireplace or wood stove can add potassium and calcium to your soil.\n4. **Alfalfa meal**: This nitrogen-rich fertilizer is made from the dried and ground leaves of the alfalfa plant.\n5. **Bokashi**: Bokashi is a fermentation process that breaks down organic matter into a nutrient-rich fertilizer.\n\nRemember to always use these DIY fertilizers in moderation and in combination with other fertilizers as needed.\n\n**Spider Plant Propagation:**\n\nNow, let's talk about propagating those adorable spider plant babies!\n\n1. **Choose healthy babies**: Select spider plant babies with a few leaves and a small root system. Avoid taking babies that are too small or weak.\n2. **Cut the baby from the mother plant**: Gently twist or cut the baby from the mother plant, making sure to leave a small piece of stem attached to the baby.\n3. **Prepare the pot**: Fill a small pot with a well-draining potting mix, and water it gently.\n4. **Plant the baby**: Plant the spider plant baby in the pot, burying it up to the base of the leaves. Firm the soil gently around the roots.\n5. **Water and provide humidity**: Water the soil gently but thoroughly, and provide high humidity to help the baby establish itself. You can cover the pot with a clear plastic bag or a cloche to maintain humidity.\n6. **Place in bright, indirect light**: Position the pot in a spot with bright, indirect light, and maintain temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C).\n7. **Monitor and care**: Keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Fertilize sparingly until the baby is established.\n\nSome additional tips:\n\n* Spider plants can be propagated in water or soil. If you choose to propagate in water, make sure to change the water regularly to prevent bacterial growth.\n* Spider plant babies can be propagated at any time of the year, but spring and summer are the best seasons for propagation.\n* Be patient, as it may take a few weeks for the baby to establish itself and start growing new leaves.\n\nI hope these tips help you successfully propagate your spider plant babies!
