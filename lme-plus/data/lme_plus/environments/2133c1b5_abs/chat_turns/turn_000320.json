  "content": "Let's look at the points one by one: Reviewer #1: In the manuscript entitled \u201cThe single-cell chromatin landscape in gonadal cell lineage specification and sex fate determination\u201d, LIAO and colleagues provide single-cell chromatin accessibility landscape for mouse embryonic gonads (E11.5, E12.5, E13.5 and E14.5 for both XX and XY). They revealed major gonadal cell types, including somatic cells and germ cells, as similar as reported by already published papers. They identified peaks and the corresponding enriched TFs across cell types. They also analyzed the dynamics of chromatin accessibility during gonad development. Besides, they identified CREs and inferred cis-regulatory networks by integrating published transcriptome datasets. Overall, this study represents a resource for mouse embryonic gonads. However, some points remain to be addressed to fit for iScience. For this point, we would like to thank the reviewer",
