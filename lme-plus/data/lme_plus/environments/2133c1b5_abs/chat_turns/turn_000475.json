  "content": "It seems that in this fictional universe, there are multiple types of magic and magical abilities that people can possess and use. Some of these abilities are more theoretical and require specific visualization techniques, while others are more spiritual and require a strong connection to the user's mind and body. There is also a type of magic called Duinn that is not fully understood and is not classified as magic, but seems to have its own unique components and abilities. It's also mentioned that there is another force called Abyssal that is used by a group called the Chaos cult and appears to have some sort of counteracting effect on Duinn.",
