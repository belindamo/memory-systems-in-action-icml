  "content": "I think I'll add Castello di Brolio and Cantina Fratelli Pardi to my itinerary, as they both seem like great options for wine tastings and tours. I'm also interested in visiting some local olive oil producers to learn more about the production process and taste some of the region's best olive oils. Can you recommend any olive oil producers or farms in Tuscany and Umbria that I should visit?",
