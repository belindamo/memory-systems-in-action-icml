Introduction (Word Count: 150)\n\nBuilding or renovating a home is an exciting time for homeowners, but it can also be a stressful and costly process, especially when unexpected issues arise. One such issue that homeowners may encounter is latent conditions. These are conditions that are not readily apparent or visible during the construction process and may only become apparent after construction has begun. Common examples of latent conditions include asbestos in the soil, structural damage, and termite infestations.\n\nAs a solicitor and construction lawyer with over a decade of experience, I have seen firsthand the challenges that homeowners face when dealing with latent conditions. In this article, I aim to provide a comprehensive guide for homeowners on understanding latent conditions in the context of construction, focusing on the unique challenges that may arise in new builds and renovations. Whether you are building your dream home or renovating an existing property, it is crucial to understand latent conditions and how they can impact your construction project. By being informed and prepared, homeowners can protect their legal rights and avoid costly and time-consuming disputes with builders.\n\nIn the following sections, we will explore common latent conditions found in new builds and renovations, legal rights of homeowners, and best practices for dealing with latent conditions.",
