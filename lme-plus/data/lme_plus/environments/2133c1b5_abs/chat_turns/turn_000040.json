  "content": "The maritime border dispute between Indonesia and the Philippines involves a small area in the Mindanao Sea, which each country claims as part of their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Here are some of the steps taken by both governments to resolve this dispute:\n\n1. Bilateral and multilateral negotiations: Indonesia and the Philippines have engaged in several rounds of bilateral negotiations to resolve the maritime border dispute. These negotiations have been facilitated by the Joint Technical Working Group (JTWG) on Maritime and Ocean Concerns, which was established in 2015. The JTWG has held several meetings to discuss the issue and has also recommended the formation of a joint boundary committee to settle the dispute.\n\n2. Joint patrols: In 2017, both countries agreed to conduct joint patrols in the disputed area as a confidence-building measure. These joint patrols were aimed at preventing illegal fishing and other maritime crimes in the area.\n\n3. Submission of claims to the United Nations: Both countries have submitted their claims to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) to settle their maritime border dispute. The CLCS is an expert body established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and is responsible for determining the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.\n\n4. Arbitration: In 2018, Indonesia and the Philippines agreed to settle their maritime border dispute through arbitration. The arbitration process is being held under the auspices of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague.\n\nOverall, the governments of Indonesia and the Philippines are committed to resolving their maritime border dispute through peaceful means and continue to engage in dialogue and negotiations to find a mutually acceptable solution.",
