  "content": "It seems that the \"Looped Filter Theory\" is a theory about the nature of the universe and its dimensions, as described in this passage. It suggests that there are various dimensions that exist and that they are layered like a ring of filters, each having an impact on the one beneath it. It also mentions that these dimensions cannot be flipped, and that doing so would be catastrophic. The \"Door, Lock, Key and Room\" theory is another theory that describes the three dimensions as being like a lock, a key, and a room. The Corporworld is described as the body of the lock, the Manaworld as the key to the door, and the Duinnworld as the space behind the door. Each of these dimensions is described in terms of its impact on the other dimensions, with the Corporworld being the least impactful but most important, the Manaworld being the second least impactful but most observed, and the Duinnworld being the most impactful.",
