It's a cozy place where travelers and locals alike come to share stories and enjoy a warm meal. You should be able to find villagers who have witnessed the strange occurrences in the forest or have encountered the mysterious figure.\"\n\nHe smiles and adds, \"Tell Innkeeper Alaric that I sent you, and he will provide you with a room for the night. I'll remain here, coordinating efforts to protect the village from any further attacks. Once you've learned what you can, return to me, and we will discuss our next course of action.\"\n\nYou thank Eadric and make your way to the Silver Stag Inn. As you enter, the warmth from the hearth and the murmur of conversation envelop you. You approach the bar and find Alaric, a stout man with a bushy beard, who greets you with a welcoming smile.\n\nDo you:\n\n1. Introduce yourself and mention Eadric's name, asking for a room.\n2. Order a drink and strike up a conversation with the patrons to gather information about the forest.\n3. Look for any village hunters or woodsmen who might have more knowledge about the recent disturbances in the forest.\n4. Sit at a corner table, observing and listening to the conversations around you before engaging with the locals.",
