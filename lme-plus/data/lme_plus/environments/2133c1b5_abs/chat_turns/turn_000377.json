It's exciting to explore and find a practice that resonates with you.\n\nRegarding your job and seeking validation, it's a common phenomenon many people face. It's natural to want to feel valued and recognized for our efforts, but when it becomes an overwhelming drive, it can lead to anxiety and burnout. Here are some tips to help you shift your focus from seeking external validation to prioritizing your own needs and desires:\n\n1. **Identify your why**: Reflect on what motivates you and what you want to achieve in your job. Is it solely for external validation, or are there other reasons that drive you? Perhaps you want to make a meaningful impact, learn new skills, or contribute to a specific cause. When you connect with your purpose, you'll be more fulfilled and less dependent on others' opinions.\n2. **Set internal goals and standards**: Instead of seeking validation from others, set your own goals and standards for performance and achievement. This will help you focus on your own growth and development, rather than relying on external validation.\n3. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience. Acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can. Be gentle with yourself, just as you would with a close friend.\n4. **Celebrate your accomplishments**: Recognize and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. This will help you focus on your own successes and progress, rather than relying on others' praise.\n5. **Reframe criticism and feedback**: When receiving feedback or criticism, try to see it as an opportunity for growth and improvement, rather than a personal attack. Focus on the specific actions or behaviors that need adjustment, rather than taking it as a reflection of your worth.\n6. **Develop a growth mindset**: Embrace challenges and view them as opportunities to learn and grow. This mindset will help you focus on your own development and progress, rather than seeking external validation.\n7. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul. This will help you feel more fulfilled and confident, reducing your reliance on external validation.\n8. **Seek support from within**: Instead of seeking validation from colleagues or supervisors, seek support from mentors, coaches, or peers who can provide guidance and encouragement. This will help you build a stronger sense of self and reduce your dependence on external validation.\n\nRemember, it's a journey to shift your focus from seeking external validation to prioritizing your own needs and desires. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you work through these steps.\n\nHow do these suggestions resonate with you?
