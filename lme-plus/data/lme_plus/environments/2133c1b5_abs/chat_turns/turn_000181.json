Store them in a paper bag: Oyster mushrooms need to breathe, so avoid storing them in plastic bags, as this can cause them to become slimy. Instead, store them in a paper bag, which will allow air to circulate. 2. Keep them dry: Moisture can cause oyster mushrooms to spoil quickly, so it's important to keep them as dry as possible. You can also wrap them in a paper towel to absorb any excess moisture. 3. Store them in the fridge: Oyster mushrooms should be stored in the fridge, where they will last for up to a week. Make sure they are in a cool, dry spot, away from any moisture. 4. Clean them just before use: Oyster mushrooms should be cleaned just before use. Do not wash them, but instead, use a damp paper towel to wipe away any dirt or debris. 5. Freeze them: Oyster mushrooms can also be frozen for later use. Clean them and slice them before freezing, and they will last for up to 6 months. By following these tips, your oyster mushrooms should stay fresh for longer and be ready to use whenever you need them.",
