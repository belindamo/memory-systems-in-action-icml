It sounds like you've already incorporated some great habits into your bedtime routine, including listening to calming music or nature sounds while reading before bed. That can really help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep.\n\nIt's also fantastic that you've made a conscious effort to start winding down earlier and establish a consistent bedtime routine. That can make a huge difference in the quality of your sleep and how you feel in the morning.\n\nBy getting to bed earlier and establishing a relaxing pre-sleep routine, you're giving your body and mind the opportunity to wind down and prepare for a restful night's sleep. It's great that you've noticed improvements in your sleep quality and how you feel in the morning.\n\nRemember to keep up the good work and don't be too hard on yourself if you have the occasional setback. It's all about making progress and creating habits that promote healthy sleep.\n\nNow that you've made some positive changes to your bedtime routine, you might want to consider exploring other areas that could be impacting your sleep. For example, you could think about your diet and exercise habits, as well as any stressors or anxiety triggers in your life. But for now, it sounds like you're on the right track!\n\nDo you have any other questions about sleep or any other topics you'd like to discuss? I'm here to help!",
