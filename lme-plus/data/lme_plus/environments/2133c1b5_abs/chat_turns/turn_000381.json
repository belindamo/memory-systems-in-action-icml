  "content": "Sure! A CA (Certificate Authority) is a trusted third-party organization that issues digital certificates that verify the identity of entities (such as websites, servers, or individuals) in a computer network. These digital certificates contain information about the identity of the entity and the public key used to encrypt communication with that entity.\n\nIn the context of TLS (Transport Layer Security) communication, a CA certificate is a digital certificate issued by a trusted CA that is used to verify the identity of a server or client in a network. When a client connects to a server, the server presents its digital certificate, which includes the server's public key. The client can then use the CA certificate to verify the authenticity of the server's certificate and establish a secure TLS connection.\n\nBy default, most operating systems come with a set of trusted CA certificates installed in a system-wide certificate store, which is typically located at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`. However, in some cases, an administrator may want to use a different set of CA certificates or add additional trusted CA certificates. In this case, the `tls_ca` and `tls_status_ca` configuration parameters can be used to specify the file path to the custom CA certificate file.",
