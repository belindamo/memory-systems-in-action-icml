The soft glow of a few lanterns illuminates the wooden floor, and the sounds of laughter and conversation from downstairs drift up to greet you. It seems that the inn's patrons are preoccupied with their own discussions and activities, leaving the hallway empty for the moment.\n\nWith your belongings safely stored in your room, you can now choose how to proceed:\n\n1. Head back downstairs to order a drink and strike up a conversation with the patrons to gather information about the forest.\n2. Look for any village hunters or woodsmen who might have more knowledge about the recent disturbances in the forest.\n3. Sit at a corner table, observing and listening to the conversations around you before engaging with the locals.",
