  "content": "Dear Reviewer #1,\n\nWe would like to thank you for taking the time to review our manuscript \"The single-cell chromatin landscape in gonadal cell lineage specification and sex fate determination.\" We appreciate your positive comments on the study and the resources it provides for the field of mouse embryonic gonads.\n\nWe are glad that you found our analysis of major gonadal cell types and the dynamics of chromatin accessibility during gonad development to be in line with previously published papers. We are also glad that you found our identification of CREs and inference of cis-regulatory networks to be a valuable contribution to the field.\n\nWe understand that some points need to be addressed in order to fit for iScience, and we would be happy to address them in a revision of the manuscript. Could you please specify the points that need to be addressed so that we can work on addressing them in a revised version of the manuscript?\n\nThank you again for your review and constructive comments. We look forward to working with you to improve the manuscript.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Names]",
