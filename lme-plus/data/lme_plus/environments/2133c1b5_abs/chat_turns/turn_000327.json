  "content": "Dear Reviewer #2,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review our manuscript \"The single-cell chromatin landscape in gonadal cell lineage specification and sex fate determination.\" We appreciate your feedback and acknowledge that you have raised some concerns regarding the contribution of our study.\n\nHowever, we respectfully disagree with your assessment that our study does not contribute much to what is already known. Our study represents one of the first to comprehensively analyze the single-cell chromatin accessibility landscape of mouse embryonic gonads during the process of sex determination. Our scATAC-Seq data allowed us to identify the major cell types present in the gonads, including somatic cells and germ cells, as well as the dynamics of chromatin accessibility during gonad development. Additionally, we inferred cis-regulatory networks by integrating published transcriptome datasets, which adds a new dimension to our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in gonadal cell lineage specification and sex fate determination.\n\nWe believe that our study represents a valuable resource for the research community and contributes to the overall understanding of the chromatin landscape of mouse embryonic gonads during the process of sex determination.\n\nThank you again for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your names]",
