  "content": "The uncertainty and fear of confrontation can be incredibly draining and anxiety-provoking. It's like being in a state of hypervigilance, always on the lookout for potential threats or conflicts. That sense of constant readiness can be exhausting, both mentally and physically.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling like you were always \"on.\" This is a common experience for many people who have anxiety. It's as if your body's \"fight or flight\" response is constantly activated, making it difficult to relax and feel at ease.\n\nNow that you've had some time to reflect on that experience, are there any things that you wish you had done differently during that time? For example, are there any coping mechanisms or strategies that you wish you had employed to manage your anxiety?\n\nAlso, have you noticed any patterns or triggers that might contribute to your anxiety in general? For instance, do you tend to worry more when you're feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about a situation?\n\nLastly, are there any self-care practices or activities that you've found helpful in managing your anxiety or reducing stress? This could be anything from exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature to reading, listening to music, or engaging in a hobby.",
