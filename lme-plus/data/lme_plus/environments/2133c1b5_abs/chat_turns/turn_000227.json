  "content": "Costa Rica is a wonderful destination for a birthday celebration! I'd be happy to help you find a travel agency that specializes in Costa Rica tours.\n\nRegarding your experience with Travelocity, I'm not surprised. Travelocity is primarily an online travel agency (OTA) that focuses on booking flights, hotels, and packages. While they may have some Costa Rica options, they might not have the same level of expertise as a specialized agency.\n\nHere are a few travel agencies that specialize in Costa Rica tours and might be able to assist you:\n\n1. **Costa Rica Expeditions**: A US-based agency with over 25 years of experience in Costa Rica. They offer customized tours, adventure packages, and eco-lodges that fit various budgets.\n2. **Holbrook Travel**: A US-based agency that specializes in Costa Rica and Panama tours. They offer a range of options, from nature-focused tours to cultural experiences, and can help with accommodations, transportation, and activities.\n3. **Tortuga Lodge & Gardens**: A Costa Rica-based agency that offers customized tours, including adventure packages, wildlife exploration, and relaxation at their eco-lodge.\n4. **Pura Vida! eh?**: A Canadian agency that specializes in Costa Rica tours, focusing on sustainable tourism and community-based projects. They offer a range of options, from adventure to relaxation.\n5. **Costa Rica Nature Escape**: A US-based agency that offers customized tours, including nature-focused experiences, wildlife exploration, and adventure activities like surfing and ziplining.\n\nThese agencies have extensive knowledge of Costa Rica and can help you find a resort that meets your budget and preferences. They may also be able to offer exclusive deals, discounts, or packages that aren't available through OTAs like Travelocity.\n\nBefore reaching out to these agencies, it might be helpful to have a clear idea of what you're looking for in a Costa Rica tour. Consider the following:\n\n* What type of activities would you and your sister like to do (e.g., adventure, relaxation, wildlife exploration, cultural experiences)?\n* What is your budget for the trip?\n* Are there any specific regions or areas in Costa Rica you're interested in visiting?\n* What type of accommodations are you looking for (e.g., eco-lodge, resort, boutique hotel)?\n\nHaving a clear idea of your preferences will help the agencies provide you with more tailored options and quotes.\n\nWould you like me to explore more options or provide more information on these agencies?",
