  "content": "\"6.0 Duinn\nThis section was written in coalition with TOR Combined Holy Clergy (TORCHC).\nDespite the focus of this document being Arcanum, a necessary distinction to make in this report is that Duinn is not classified as magic. The capabilities of Duinn have been observed to be directly relative to its user, and furthermore, the ability has shown indications of low-level-sentience, through picking its users. Juxtaposed to Duinn, is Abyssal, used by the Chaos cult and main threat of TOR. Both abilities appear to keep one another at bay, being much more effective against the opposing compared to normal magic.\n\nThere are four main components that play into the control of Duinn.\n6.1 Linkage\nSimilar to stage 1 in spellcasting, this is a user\u2019s reception to the Duinnworld. While ordinary magic cannot affect an individual\u2019s connection, there have been cases of Abyssal-Disruption-Fields, which somehow prevent linkage. It should also be clarified that it is unknown if an individual requires an essence to use Duinn or Abyssal, as both are unobservable using mana-vision.\n6.2 Immanency\nAn individual\u2019s innate ability to use Duinn, determined by heritage, birthplace. Without optimal immanency, a user cannot establish an uplink to the Duinnworld. This can be supplemented through the use of a \u2018blessed vessel,\u2019 which assists the user in establishing linkage, however, these can only be created by Duinn users with very high levels of immanency. Furthermore, creatures can be turned into blessed vessels, but this must be done early in conception or growth. Case studies suggest there may be ways of increasing an individual\u2019s immanency, as rarely, individuals with little-to-no capabilities for the ability have spontaneously awakened it. \n6.3 Understanding\nSimilar to how magic functions, a caster\u2019s ability to visualize and psychically connect to their powers. This comes with frequent practice, open mindedness and meditation. Having a high level of immanency does not make this component any less important. Casters with better understanding often provide more use in practical scenarios than those with high immanency.\n6.4 Manifestation\nThe manifestation of Duinn is specific to its user. This defines what shape it will take when in use, and is quite literally, unlimited. There have been observed cases of swords of white flame, or lassos and whips of white light. There are also variations of duinn-users that function similar to enchanters, which can provide amplifications to other casters, or items. Sometimes it can take a caster a long time to develop their manifestation.\n6.5 Summary\nDuinn is yet another force that is not well understood by TOR practitioners, and sought after for research.
