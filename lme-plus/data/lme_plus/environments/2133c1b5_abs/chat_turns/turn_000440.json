I've been enjoying the discussions on \"Book Lovers Unite\" about character development, and I think that's what drew me to fantasy in the first place. Some of these recommendations sound really appealing, especially the Kingkiller Chronicle and the First Law Trilogy. Can you tell me a bit more about the world-building in those series?",
