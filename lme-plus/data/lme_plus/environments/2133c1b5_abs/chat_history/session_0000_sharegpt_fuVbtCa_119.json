The weight and coldness of the chains in your hands give you a sense of the dehumanization and cruelty suffered by those who were enslaved.\n\nAs you near the end of the museum, you come to a section that celebrates the legacy of Harriet Tubman and her fellow abolitionists. Here, you can see photographs and artifacts that commemorate the achievements of these brave men and women, who risked everything to fight for justice and equality.\n\nThroughout the museum, the exhibits are designed to engage all of your senses. You can touch authentic artifacts, hear the voices of enslaved people and abolitionists, and even smell the earthy scent of the Underground Railroad tunnels. By the time you leave, you feel like you have lived through a small part of the history of slavery and the fight for freedom."
