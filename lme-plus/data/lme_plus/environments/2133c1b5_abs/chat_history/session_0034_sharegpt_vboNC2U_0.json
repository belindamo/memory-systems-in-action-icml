The editor's comments is below: It is difficult to say whether it would be appropriate for us to consider a revised paper without knowing whether you can address the further experiments that the reviewers require. If you are interested in pursuing further consideration of this work at iScience, you would need to first submit a point-by-point response that indicates how you intend to address the reviewer concerns and outlines how any corresponding results and/or edits would be incorporated into a revised manuscript. Once I receive this document I would assess the plan for revision, perhaps in consultation with the reviewers. Based on these considerations, we would either reactivate the manuscript file to enable resubmission or recommend submission elsewhere."

      "content": "Let's look at the points one by one: Reviewer #1: In the manuscript entitled \u201cThe single-cell chromatin landscape in gonadal cell lineage specification and sex fate determination\u201d, LIAO and colleagues provide single-cell chromatin accessibility landscape for mouse embryonic gonads (E11.5, E12.5, E13.5 and E14.5 for both XX and XY). They revealed major gonadal cell types, including somatic cells and germ cells, as similar as reported by already published papers. They identified peaks and the corresponding enriched TFs across cell types. They also analyzed the dynamics of chromatin accessibility during gonad development. Besides, they identified CREs and inferred cis-regulatory networks by integrating published transcriptome datasets. Overall, this study represents a resource for mouse embryonic gonads. However, some points remain to be addressed to fit for iScience. For this point, we would like to thank the reviewer"

The reviewer has appreciated the study for providing single-cell chromatin accessibility landscape for mouse embryonic gonads and identifying major gonadal cell types, peaks, enriched TFs, dynamics of chromatin accessibility, and cis-regulatory networks. However, they have identified some points that need to be addressed to make the study suitable for publication in iScience."

We are also glad that you found our identification of CREs and inference of cis-regulatory networks to be a valuable contribution to the field.\n\nWe understand that some points need to be addressed in order to fit for iScience, and we would be happy to address them in a revision of the manuscript. Could you please specify the points that need to be addressed so that we can work on addressing them in a revised version of the manuscript?\n\nThank you again for your review and constructive comments. We look forward to working with you to improve the manuscript.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Names]"

      "content": "Reviewer #2: Suen et al., aimed to investigate the chromatin landscape of murine gonadal cells from XY and XX during the process of sex determination. To that aim they performed scATAC-Seq on gonads from E11.5, E12.5, E13.5 and E14.5 and analysed the data to get clusters of cells with similar epigenetic profiles. They then used published datasets of RNA-sew to assign identity to the various clusters and tried to make biological meaning of the data.\nWhile the main question of understanding the chromatin landscape is very needed, the current work, in the way conducted and presented does not contribute much to what is known. For this comment, we don't agree with reviewer's accessment"

Our study represents one of the first to comprehensively analyze the single-cell chromatin accessibility landscape of mouse embryonic gonads during the process of sex determination. Our scATAC-Seq data allowed us to identify the major cell types present in the gonads, including somatic cells and germ cells, as well as the dynamics of chromatin accessibility during gonad development. Additionally, we inferred cis-regulatory networks by integrating published transcriptome datasets, which adds a new dimension to our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in gonadal cell lineage specification and sex fate determination.\n\nWe believe that our study represents a valuable resource for the research community and contributes to the overall understanding of the chromatin landscape of mouse embryonic gonads during the process of sex determination.\n\nThank you again for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your names]"
