      "content": "\"5.0 Varying Magical Theories\n5.1 Miseishun Theory; Spiritual Belief Method\nThe Miseishun hubworld has a comparatively spiritual take on arcanum, known as the Spiritual Belief Method (SBM), opposed to the theoretical views practiced in TOR, Theoretical Magical Formulae (TMF). Studying SBM, the system has been broken down into 3 core aspects:\n\n5.1.1 Mind\nA mage whose mind is not in synergy with their magic, is no mage. Of the three cardinal rules to magic in Miseishun, the largest similarity between SBM and TMF is utilizing the \u2018mind,\u2019 as in, creative intuition. Master Roterun casters will often send disciples on missions to bond with their powers; avoiding specific procedures in pursuit of open-mindedness, and awareness for what their abilities mean, and can achieve. This is in contrast to TOR studies which break down the components of what make spells, to achieve very specific and particular effects.\n\n5.1.2 Body\nRoterun monks and mages practice in giving up important parts of their lifestyle to further their bond to magic. This can include fasting, a year of silence, daily visits and prayers to a certain location, etc. Essentially anything that proves a mage worthy of using the arts through sacrifice works, though it has to be meaningful. Actual benefits of this practice are vague, as TMF practitioners argue this simply diminishes an individual\u2019s ability to study, confer and train. On the other hand there are definite examples of individuals who have undergone this ritual and demonstrated heightened magical capabilities, showing this practice may not be impractical. Whether this is circumstantial is unknown, but a popular theory regarding these effects is that these allow for a clearer headspace, thus affecting the cardinal aspect, mind.\n\n5.1.3 Spirit\nMost Roterun mages meditate to further their spiritual connection to magic. This means uninterrupted hours of silence and deep thought. Meditating at particularly magical or paranormal areas will also strengthen the potency of the meditation, making Seishan mountain a popular rite of passage for learning mages. This actually aligns with TMF findings, as locations that have seen significant loss of life or magical use, can create \u2018Manaworld Deviations\u2019 (MD). This is due to either residual mana particles leftover from an incident, or a concavity in the Manaworld leading to natural accumulation of energy.\n\n5.1.4 Benefits and Drawbacks\nThe Magic Arts faculty has discovered the main differences between TMF scholars and SBM practitioners are \u2018reflexual\u2019. TMF users view magic as compounds, or formulas. This paves way for a more efficient spell creation system, where given the time, a practiced mage can hone every minor aspect of a cast. Furthermore, TMF scholars heavily specialize in specific areas, doing one thing very well. This is in direct contrast with SBM practitioners, observed to be able to do a wide variety of less sophisticated things. \n\nBody enhancement spells have been a long-time difficulty for TMF scholars, where every variation seemingly uses a large amount of mana and incessant levels of focus to maintain. However, SBM users seem to do this almost naturally. Roterun mages have been witnessed to maintain medium-level body augmentation spells for incredibly long durations, during combat. Furthermore, average casting time between the two systems is roughly halved for SBM users, demonstrating the \u2018reflexual\u2019 theory from before. Roterun mages generally have a higher affinity for a wider variety of magic types as well, and can sometimes even mesh \u2018polar magics\u2019 (e.g, fire-water). \n\n5.1.5 Summary\nIt should be stressed that TOR does not believe SBM is neither \u2018worse\u2019 nor \u2018better\u2019 than TMF, rather, it is just unstudied and experimental, which may remain the case due to the inherent nature of the system. TOR cannot offer as many resources to practitioners of SBM compared to TMF, as TMF is still the primary system used by the organization. However, the Magical Arts faculty is always willing to participate in studies of the system to gain a better understanding of its various components. \""

      "content": "It seems that the \"Looped Filter Theory\" is a theory about the nature of the universe and its dimensions, as described in this passage. It suggests that there are various dimensions that exist and that they are layered like a ring of filters, each having an impact on the one beneath it. It also mentions that these dimensions cannot be flipped, and that doing so would be catastrophic. The \"Door, Lock, Key and Room\" theory is another theory that describes the three dimensions as being like a lock, a key, and a room. The Corporworld is described as the body of the lock, the Manaworld as the key to the door, and the Duinnworld as the space behind the door. Each of these dimensions is described in terms of its impact on the other dimensions, with the Corporworld being the least impactful but most important, the Manaworld being the second least impactful but most observed, and the Duinnworld being the most impactful."

      "content": "\"6.0 Duinn\nThis section was written in coalition with TOR Combined Holy Clergy (TORCHC).\nDespite the focus of this document being Arcanum, a necessary distinction to make in this report is that Duinn is not classified as magic. The capabilities of Duinn have been observed to be directly relative to its user, and furthermore, the ability has shown indications of low-level-sentience, through picking its users. Juxtaposed to Duinn, is Abyssal, used by the Chaos cult and main threat of TOR. Both abilities appear to keep one another at bay, being much more effective against the opposing compared to normal magic.\n\nThere are four main components that play into the control of Duinn.\n6.1 Linkage\nSimilar to stage 1 in spellcasting, this is a user\u2019s reception to the Duinnworld. While ordinary magic cannot affect an individual\u2019s connection, there have been cases of Abyssal-Disruption-Fields, which somehow prevent linkage. It should also be clarified that it is unknown if an individual requires an essence to use Duinn or Abyssal, as both are unobservable using mana-vision.\n6.2 Immanency\nAn individual\u2019s innate ability to use Duinn, determined by heritage, birthplace. Without optimal immanency, a user cannot establish an uplink to the Duinnworld. This can be supplemented through the use of a \u2018blessed vessel,\u2019 which assists the user in establishing linkage, however, these can only be created by Duinn users with very high levels of immanency. Furthermore, creatures can be turned into blessed vessels, but this must be done early in conception or growth. Case studies suggest there may be ways of increasing an individual\u2019s immanency, as rarely, individuals with little-to-no capabilities for the ability have spontaneously awakened it. \n6.3 Understanding\nSimilar to how magic functions, a caster\u2019s ability to visualize and psychically connect to their powers. This comes with frequent practice, open mindedness and meditation. Having a high level of immanency does not make this component any less important. Casters with better understanding often provide more use in practical scenarios than those with high immanency.\n6.4 Manifestation\nThe manifestation of Duinn is specific to its user. This defines what shape it will take when in use, and is quite literally, unlimited. There have been observed cases of swords of white flame, or lassos and whips of white light. There are also variations of duinn-users that function similar to enchanters, which can provide amplifications to other casters, or items. Sometimes it can take a caster a long time to develop their manifestation.\n6.5 Summary\nDuinn is yet another force that is not well understood by TOR practitioners, and sought after for research. For further information, refer to TORCHC.\""

      "content": "It seems that in this fictional universe, there are multiple types of magic and magical abilities that people can possess and use. Some of these abilities are more theoretical and require specific visualization techniques, while others are more spiritual and require a strong connection to the user's mind and body. There is also a type of magic called Duinn that is not fully understood and is not classified as magic, but seems to have its own unique components and abilities. It's also mentioned that there is another force called Abyssal that is used by a group called the Chaos cult and appears to have some sort of counteracting effect on Duinn."
