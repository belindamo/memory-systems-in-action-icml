      "content": "Before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the city was divided into East and West Berlin, with vastly different ideological and aesthetic approaches to art and architecture. In the East, the government imposed a strict socialist realism style in art and functionalist architecture that prioritized function over form. In the West, modernist and post-modernist styles prevailed, emphasizing individuality and cultural diversity.\n\nThe presence of the Wall itself became a symbol and subject of artistic expression, with graffiti, murals, and installations popping up on both sides. In the West, artists used the wall as a canvas for political and social commentary, while in the East, artists challenged the state-imposed style through underground movements and alternative exhibition spaces.\n\nAfter the Wall's fall, a new era of creative experimentation and cultural exchange began. Huge efforts were made to reunite the two halves of the city, resulting in a mix of architectural styles that combined both the unique features of East and West. Artistic expression also evolved to reflect this new reality, with a boom in public art, galleries, and performance spaces.\n\nToday, Berlin is seen as a hub for contemporary art and architecture, drawing international artists and architects to its dynamic and ever-changing landscape. The city's divided past continues to inform its artistic and architectural identity, serving as a powerful reminder of the importance of creative expression in times of political and social unrest."

The Reichstag Building is the seat of the German parliament and was reconstructed after the fall of the Berlin Wall with a modern glass dome on top. The Berlin Wall Memorial is a highly symbolic site commemorating the division of Berlin during the Cold War, while the Berlin Cathedral is a stunning Baroque-style building that dominates the city's skyline.
