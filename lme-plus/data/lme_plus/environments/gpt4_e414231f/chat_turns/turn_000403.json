It's too high up. How are we going to get to it?\n\\*warlock, elf: Let me try something. (whispers a spell)\n\\*warlock, keeper: The flower is within reach now. But be careful, it's guarded by a powerful enchantment.\n\n5\n\n\\*keeper, dwarf: This is it. The mystical flower that can save our home.\n\\*dwarf, elf: But how are we going to use it against the loggers?\n\\*warlock, bear: We'll need to create a potion. It won't be easy, but it's the only way.\n\\*elf, keeper: I know of an alchemist who might be able to help us. He lives in the neighboring town.\n\n6\n\n\\*keeper, elf: Are you sure this is the right place? It looks abandoned.\nelf, \\*keeper: Positive. This is where the alchemist lives.\n\\*warlock, dwarf: Let me try something. (whispers a spell)\n\\*warlock, elf: The door is enchanted. It will only open for those who seek knowledge, not power.\n\n7\n\n\\*alchemist, keeper: Ah, I've been expecting you. What brings you here?\nkeeper, \\*alchemist: Our forest is in danger. We need your help to create a potion that can stop the loggers.\n\\*dwarf, alchemist: We have the mystical flower that can stop them, but we don't know how to use it.\n\\*alchemist, warlock: I know of a recipe that might work. But the ingredients are rare and hard to find.\n\n8\n\n\\*elf, alchemist: We found some of the ingredients you need. But we're still missing a few.\nalchemist, \\*elf: Yes, we're missing the most important one. The scale of a dragon.\n\\*dwarf, warlock: A dragon? That's impossible to find.\n\\*alchemist, bear: Not impossible, just difficult. There's a dragon that lives deep in the forest, but he's not exactly friendly.\n\nWhat do you think?",
