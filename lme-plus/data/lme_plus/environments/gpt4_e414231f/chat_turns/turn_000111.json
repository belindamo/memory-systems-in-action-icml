  "content": "The walnut-chia seed combination is a great choice! Preparing the walnuts and chia seeds can enhance their flavor and texture, making them a perfect addition to your oatmeal. Here are some suggestions:\n\n**Walnuts:**\n\n1. **Toasting**: Toasting walnuts brings out their natural oils and enhances their flavor. Simply spread 1-2 tablespoons of chopped walnuts on a baking sheet and toast in a 350\u00b0F oven for 5-7 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned.\n2. **Chopping**: Chop the walnuts into small pieces to release their oils and flavor. You can use a food processor or a knife to chop them into small pieces.\n3. **Soaking**: Soaking walnuts can make them easier to digest and increase their nutritional value. Soak 1-2 tablespoons of chopped walnuts in water or a plant-based milk for 2-4 hours, then drain and rinse before adding to your oatmeal.\n\n**Chia Seeds:**\n\n1. **Soaking**: Soaking chia seeds can help them gel and absorb more liquid, making them easier to digest. Mix 1-2 tablespoons of chia seeds with 2-3 tablespoons of water or a plant-based milk and let sit for 10-15 minutes, or until they form a gel-like texture.\n2. **Grinding**: Grinding chia seeds can increase their surface area and make them easier to digest. Use a coffee grinder or a spice grinder to grind 1-2 tablespoons of chia seeds into a fine powder.\n3. **Mixing with liquid**: Mixing chia seeds with a liquid can help them absorb and gel evenly. Mix 1-2 tablespoons of chia seeds with 2-3 tablespoons of water or a plant-based milk and stir well before adding to your oatmeal.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use fresh and high-quality walnuts and chia seeds for the best flavor and texture.\n* Store toasted or soaked walnuts and chia seeds in an airtight container to maintain freshness.\n* Experiment with different toasting times and temperatures to find your perfect level of toastiness.\n\nNow, simply add your prepared walnuts and chia seeds to your oatmeal and enjoy with your coffee!",
