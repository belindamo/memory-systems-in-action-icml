  "content": "These recipes look great! For the energy balls, I think I'll try the peanut butter banana recipe first. I love bananas and peanut butter, and it sounds like a tasty combination. For the trail mix, I'll try the classic recipe and see how it turns out. I'm excited to prep these snacks on Sunday and take them with me to work during the week. Do you have any suggestions on how I can store them to keep them fresh for a longer period?",
