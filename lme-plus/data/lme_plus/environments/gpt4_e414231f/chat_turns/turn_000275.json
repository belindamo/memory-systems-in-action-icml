  "content": "The Milwaukee Harbor area can be a fantastic spot for bass fishing. Both crankbaits and jigs can be effective in that area, but I'd recommend a jig as a better starting point for several reasons:\n\n1. **Structure:** Milwaukee Harbor has a mix of rocky shorelines, weed beds, and sunken structures. A jig can be more versatile in these areas, allowing you to fish both vertically and horizontally.\n2. **Water Clarity:** The harbor's water clarity can vary, but it's often relatively clear. A jig's subtle presentation can be more effective in clearer water, whereas a crankbait's loud, flashy action might spook bass in these conditions.\n3. **Bass Behavior:** In the Milwaukee Harbor area, bass tend to be more structure-oriented, and a jig can be used to fish these structures more effectively. Crankbaits are often better suited for open water or covering large areas.\n4. **Seasonal Patterns:** Since you mentioned you caught bass with Tom and Alex last month, I'm assuming it's still summer or early fall. During this time, bass in the harbor are likely to be holding near structure, making a jig a better choice.\n\nFor a jig, I'd recommend the following:\n\n* **Jighead:** Use a 1/8 to 1/4 oz. jighead, depending on the water conditions and the size of the bass you're targeting.\n* **Trailers:** Try a curly tail grub (white, chartreuse, or yellow) or a swim bait (white, silver, or shad-patterned). These can imitate the baitfish and crayfish found in the harbor.\n* **Retrieve:** Use a slow, gentle retrieve, often referred to as a \"dragging\" or \"hopping\" retrieve. This can help you feel the bottom and detect subtle bites.\n\nIf you do want to try a crankbait, consider the following:\n\n* **Shallow-diving crankbait:** A shallow-diving crankbait (1-3 ft.) can be effective in the harbor's rocky areas or weed beds.\n* **Retrieve:** Use a medium to fast retrieve, and try to deflect the crankbait off structures to trigger reaction bites.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to experiment with different lures and presentations to see what the bass are responding to on a given day. Good luck, and I hope you catch some more nice bass in the Milwaukee Harbor area!",
