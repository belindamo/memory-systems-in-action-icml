A spongy brake feel can be a safety concern, so it's essential to address it ASAP. Here's a checklist to help you prepare your bike for a maintenance check:\n\n**Before taking your bike to the shop:**\n\n1. **Clean the bike**: Give your bike a thorough cleaning to remove dirt, grime, and any debris that might interfere with the mechanic's inspection. Pay attention to the chain, derailleurs, and brake calipers.\n2. **Check tire pressure**: Ensure the tires are inflated to the recommended pressure, as specified on the sidewall or in your owner's manual. Proper pressure can affect the bike's overall performance and safety.\n3. **Identify issues**: Make a list of any concerns or issues you've noticed, such as:\n\t* Spongy brakes (as you mentioned)\n\t* Shifting problems (e.g., gears skipping or not engaging properly)\n\t* Unusual noises or vibrations\n\t* Loose or worn-out components (e.g., stem, handlebars, or saddle)\n4. **Gather maintenance records**: Collect any records of previous maintenance, including dates and details of work done. This will help the mechanic understand your bike's history and identify potential patterns.\n\n**When you take your bike to the shop:**\n\n1. **Be prepared to describe the issues**: Clearly explain the problems you've experienced, including when they started and any circumstances that might be related (e.g., weather, terrain, or recent rides).\n2. **Ask about their process**: Inquire about the shop's maintenance process, what they'll check, and what kind of report or documentation you can expect.\n3. **Discuss any upgrades or repairs**: If you're considering upgrades or repairs, now's the time to discuss options with the mechanic.\n\n**Some common maintenance tasks:**\n\n* Brake pad replacement or adjustment\n* Chain cleaning and lubrication\n* Gear adjustment or replacement\n* Tire inspection and rotation\n* Bolt and quick-release checks\n* Cable adjustments (e.g., brake and gear cables)\n\nRemember to ask your local bike shop about their specific maintenance check process and what's included in their standard service. They may have a package deal or \u00e0 la carte options to suit your needs.\n\nBy following this checklist, you'll be well-prepared for your bike's maintenance check, and the mechanic can focus on getting your road bike running smoothly and safely.",
