I appreciate the modified exercises and alternatives you provided, as they make me feel more comfortable and confident about getting started.\n\nI do have one question, though: How often should I aim to do strength training, and how many days a week should I dedicate to it? I want to make sure I'm not overdoing it, especially since I'm just starting out.\n\nAlso, are there any specific warm-up and cool-down exercises you would recommend for strength training, or can I use the same ones I do for running?",
