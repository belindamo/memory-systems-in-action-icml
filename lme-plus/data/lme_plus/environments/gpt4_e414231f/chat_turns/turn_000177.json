Just bring in the competitor's ad or show us the price on your mobile device, and we'll match it at the register.\"\n\nHere are some key details to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Competitor's ad**: The competitor's ad must be a current, local ad from a store that is within a reasonable distance from the ShopRite store you're shopping at.\n2. **Identical item**: The item must be identical, including size, brand, and quantity.\n3. **Price match limit**: There may be limits on the number of items that can be price-matched per customer.\n4. **Exclusions**: Some items may be excluded from the price match policy, such as online prices, closeout sales, and prices from membership-based stores.\n\nTo request a price match at ShopRite, simply:\n\n1. Bring the competitor's ad or show the price on your mobile device to the cashier.\n2. Let them know you'd like to price match the item.\n3. The cashier will verify the price and apply the lower price to your purchase.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check with your local ShopRite store for any specific details or restrictions on their price matching policy.\n\nBy taking advantage of ShopRite's price matching policy, you can feel confident that you're getting the best deal on your household essentials, even if you find a lower price elsewhere.\n\nHappy shopping, and I hope you score some great deals on your bulk purchases!",
