  "content": "You find yourself in a dimly lit room with stone walls and a low ceiling. The air is musty and damp, and you can hear the sound of dripping water somewhere in the distance. A faint glow emanates from a torch on the wall, casting flickering shadows around the room. There is a wooden door in front of you, and a small table with a candle and a piece of parchment on it to your right. To your left, there is a bookshelf filled with dusty tomes. The room seems deserted and silent, with no obvious exits or signs of life.",
