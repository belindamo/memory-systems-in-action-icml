I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations.\n\nSince you've recently rearranged your furniture, it's great that you're considering the new layout when choosing pillows. Before I dive into brand and style suggestions, can you tell me a bit more about your modern living room? For example:\n\n1. What's the dominant color scheme or palette in the room?\n2. What type of furniture do you have (e.g., sleek and low-profile, minimalist, or statement pieces)?\n3. Are there any specific textures or materials you prefer (e.g., velvet, linen, cotton)?\n4. Do you have a preferred pillow size or shape in mind (e.g., square, rectangular, lumbar)?\n5. Are you looking for pillows with a bold pattern or statement design, or something more subtle and neutral?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your space, I can suggest some brands and styles that would complement your modern living room.\n\nIn general, some popular brands for modern throw pillows include:\n\n* CB2: Known for their affordable, on-trend designs and a wide range of styles.\n* West Elm: Offers a variety of modern, sophisticated designs with a focus on quality materials.\n* Crate & Barrel: Features a curated selection of stylish, high-end throw pillows from various designers.\n* AllModern: A great resource for modern, affordable pillows with a focus on clean lines and minimalism.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements, and I can provide more tailored recommendations!",
