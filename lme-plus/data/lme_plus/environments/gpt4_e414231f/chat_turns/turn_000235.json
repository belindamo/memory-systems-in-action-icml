This approach is often referred to as \"concurrent training,\" where you combine cardio and strength training in the same session.\n\nIncorporating strength training after your morning soccer training on Monday and Friday can still be beneficial for your soccer performance. Here's why:\n\n1. **Improved power and speed**: Even a short strength training session can help improve your power and speed on the field.\n2. **Enhanced muscle activation**: Strength training can help activate your muscles, which can improve your overall performance during soccer training.\n3. **Increased endurance**: Adding strength training to your routine can also improve your endurance and ability to sustain a high intensity over a longer period.\n4. **Injury prevention**: Strengthening your muscles, especially in your core and legs, can help prevent injuries common in soccer, such as hamstring strains and groin pulls.\n\nHere's an example of what your morning strength training session could look like:\n\n**Monday (after soccer training)**\n\n* 15-20 minutes of strength training:\n\t+ 3 sets of 10-12 reps of squats\n\t+ 3 sets of 10-12 reps of lunges (per leg)\n\t+ 3 sets of 12-15 reps of calf raises\n\t+ 3 sets of 10-12 reps of planks (30-60 seconds)\n\n**Friday (after soccer training)**\n\n* 15-20 minutes of strength training:\n\t+ 3 sets of 10-12 reps of deadlifts\n\t+ 3 sets of 10-12 reps of step-ups (per leg)\n\t+ 3 sets of 12-15 reps of Russian twists\n\t+ 3 sets of 10-12 reps of leg raises\n\nRemember to keep the weights light to moderate, and focus on proper form and technique. You can always adjust the exercises, sets, and reps based on your fitness level and goals.\n\nBy incorporating strength training into your morning routine, you'll be able to improve your overall fitness and soccer performance without dedicating an entire evening to it.",
