Building strength in your legs, glutes, and core can help improve your running efficiency, endurance, and speed. Squats and lunges are excellent exercises for targeting your legs, and I'd be happy to provide you with tips on how to do them correctly.\n\n**Squats:**\n\n1. **Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart**, toes pointing forward or slightly outward.\n2. **Engage your core** by drawing your belly button towards your spine and keeping your pelvis in a neutral position.\n3. **Slowly lower your body down** into a squat, keeping your weight in your heels, not your toes.\n4. **Keep your back straight**, avoiding arching or rounding your back.\n5. **Lower down to a depth** where your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.\n6. **Pause for a brief moment** at the bottom of the squat, then **slowly stand up** to the starting position.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Keep your knees in line with your toes, avoiding letting them extend past your toes.\n* Use a weight or resistance band to make the exercise more challenging.\n* Focus on slow and controlled movements, avoiding jerky or bouncy movements.\n* Practice squats with different foot positions, such as narrow or wide stances, to target different muscle groups.\n\n**Lunges:**\n\n1. **Stand with your feet together**, take a large step forward with one foot, and lower your body down into a lunge.\n2. **Keep your front knee** at a 90-degree angle, with your thigh parallel to the ground.\n3. **Keep your back knee** almost touching the ground, with your weight in your front heel.\n4. **Push through your front heel** to return to the starting position.\n5. **Alternate legs** with each rep, completing a full lunge on one leg before switching to the other.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Keep your front knee in line with your toes, avoiding letting it extend past your toes.\n* Engage your core and maintain a straight back throughout the exercise.\n* Focus on slow and controlled movements, avoiding jerky or bouncy movements.\n* Practice lunges with different foot positions, such as narrow or wide stances, to target different muscle groups.\n\n**Additional Leg Exercises:**\n\n1. **Deadlifts**: Targets glutes, hamstrings, and quads. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend down and grab a weight or barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart, and lift up to hip level.\n2. **Calf raises**: Targets calf muscles. Stand on a step or platform, raise up onto your tiptoes, and then lower back down.\n3. **Leg press**: Targets quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Sit in a leg press machine, push the platform away from you with your feet, and then lower it back down.\n\nRemember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the intensity as you build strength and endurance. It's also essential to warm up before strength training and stretch afterwards to prevent injury.\n\nHow do you feel about incorporating strength training into your routine? Have you tried any of these exercises before, or do you have any questions about how to modify them for your fitness level?",
