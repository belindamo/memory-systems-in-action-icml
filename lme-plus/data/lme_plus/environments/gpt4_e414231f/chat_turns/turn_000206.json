  "content": "I decided to try out YouTube Live for the first time two weeks ago, and it was a huge success! I got over 50 viewers tuning in, and we had a great discussion about the latest TV show I'd been binge-watching. One of my viewers even asked me for some book recommendations, and we ended up chatting about our shared love of fantasy novels. Since then, I've been trying to do at least one live stream a week, whether it's on Instagram, YouTube, or Facebook.",
