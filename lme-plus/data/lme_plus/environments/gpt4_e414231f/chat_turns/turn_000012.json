  "content": "The peanut butter banana energy balls are a delicious and classic combination. And the classic trail mix is a great starting point - you can always customize it later to your taste preferences.\n\n**Storing Energy Balls:**\n\nTo keep energy balls fresh for a longer period, follow these storage tips:\n\n1. **Air-tight containers:** Store energy balls in air-tight containers, such as glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. This will prevent air from entering the container and making the energy balls dry or stale.\n2. **Refrigerate:** Store energy balls in the refrigerator to keep them fresh for up to 5-7 days. This will slow down the oxidation process and prevent the formation of bacteria or mold.\n3. **Freeze:** If you want to store energy balls for a longer period, consider freezing them. Simply place the energy balls in a single layer on a baking sheet, and then transfer them to an airtight container or freezer bag. Frozen energy balls can be stored for up to 2-3 months. When you're ready to eat them, simply thaw them at room temperature or in the refrigerator.\n4. **Portion control:** Divide the energy balls into individual portions (e.g., 2-3 energy balls per portion) and store them in small containers or ziplock bags. This will make it easy to grab a snack on-the-go and prevent the energy balls from getting crushed or damaged.\n\n**Storing Trail Mix:**\n\nTo keep trail mix fresh for a longer period, follow these storage tips:\n\n1. **Air-tight containers:** Store trail mix in air-tight containers, such as glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. This will prevent air from entering the container and making the trail mix stale.\n2. **Cool, dry place:** Store trail mix in a cool, dry place, such as a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing trail mix near a heat source, oven, or direct sunlight, as this can cause the ingredients to become rancid or stale.\n3. **Ziplock bags:** Divide the trail mix into individual portions (e.g., 1/4 cup per portion) and store them in ziplock bags. This will make it easy to grab a snack on-the-go and prevent the trail mix from getting crushed or damaged.\n4. **Use within 2 weeks:** Trail mix is best consumed within 2 weeks of preparation. If you notice any signs of staleness, such as rancid nuts or chocolate, it's time to make a fresh batch.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you'll be able to enjoy your energy balls and trail mix for a longer period and keep them fresh and delicious. Happy snacking!",
