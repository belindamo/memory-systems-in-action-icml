Daringbadi is a hill station located in Kandhamal district of Odisha, it's often referred as \"Kashmir of Odisha\" due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. Daringbadi is known for its picturesque valleys, waterfalls, and lush green forests. It is perfect for adventure enthusiasts and nature lovers, who can enjoy activities like trekking, rock climbing, and paragliding. It's also a great place to visit during the summer months when the temperature in Bhubaneswar is quite high.\n\nThank you for bringing it to my attention, I apologize for the oversight and I hope this information will be helpful for your future travel plans.",
