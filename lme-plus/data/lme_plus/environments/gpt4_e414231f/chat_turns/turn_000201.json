Upgrading your camera can make a significant difference in your stream's overall quality.\n\nThe Logitech C920 is a great upgrade from a built-in laptop camera, and here's why:\n\n1. **Better image quality**: The C920 offers a higher resolution (1080p) and a wider field of view (78\u00b0) compared to most built-in laptop cameras. This means you'll get a sharper, more detailed image with a more immersive feel.\n2. **Improved low-light performance**: The C920 is designed to handle low-light conditions better than built-in laptop cameras. This is especially important if you're streaming in a room with limited natural light or using a ring light.\n3. **Wider dynamic range**: The C920 can capture a wider range of brightness levels, which means it can handle both bright and dark areas in your scene more effectively. This results in a more natural-looking image with better contrast.\n4. **Reduced noise and grain**: The C920's sensor is designed to reduce noise and grain, resulting in a cleaner, more professional-looking image.\n5. **More flexibility**: As a separate camera, you can position the C920 in a way that's more flattering and comfortable for you, rather than being limited to the built-in camera's fixed position.\n\nConsidering you've been doing well with your built-in laptop camera, the C920 will likely provide a noticeable improvement in image quality. However, keep in mind that the difference might not be drastic, especially if you're already using a ring light and have a well-lit environment.\n\nTo get the most out of the C920, make sure to:\n\n* **Position the camera correctly**: Experiment with different angles and positions to find the most flattering and comfortable setup for your streams.\n* **Adjust the camera settings**: Familiarize yourself with the C920's settings, such as exposure, contrast, and saturation, to optimize the image quality for your specific environment.\n* **Use the camera's autofocus**: The C920 has a fast and accurate autofocus system, which will help keep you in focus even if you move around during your streams.\n\nOverall, the Logitech C920 is a great upgrade from a built-in laptop camera, and it's a popular choice among streamers and YouTubers. With your existing microphone and ring light, you'll be well on your way to creating high-quality streams that engage and entertain your audience.",
