I'd be happy to help you with some external camera recommendations that are compatible with YouTube Live.\n\nHere are some popular options to consider:\n\n1. **Logitech C920**: A popular and affordable USB webcam that offers 1080p resolution at 30fps. It's a great starting point for beginners, and its wide-angle lens captures a lot of scene.\n2. **Razer Kiyo**: A high-end webcam designed specifically for streaming, offering 720p at 60fps and a built-in ring light. It's a great option if you want high-quality video and a professional look.\n3. **Elgato Cam Link 4K**: Not a traditional camera, but a USB capture card that can connect to your existing camera (e.g., a DSLR or mirrorless camera). It supports 4K resolution at 30fps and is a great option if you already have a good camera.\n4. **Canon EOS Rebel T7i**: A DSLR camera that can be used as a webcam with the Canon EOS Webcam Utility software. It offers excellent image quality, and you can use the camera's autofocus and aperture controls for more creative control.\n5. **Sony Alpha a6400**: A mirrorless camera that can be used as a webcam with the Sony Imaging Edge Webcam software. It offers excellent autofocus, great low-light performance, and can shoot 4K at 30fps.\n6. **PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) Cameras**: If you want a more professional setup, consider a PTZ camera like the **Logitech PTZ Pro 2** or **HuddleCamHD-3X**. These cameras offer remote control, zoom, and pan/tilt functionality, making them ideal for more complex productions.\n\nWhen choosing a camera, consider the following factors:\n\n* Resolution: 1080p (Full HD) or 4K (if you want a more future-proof setup)\n* Frame rate: 30fps or 60fps for smoother video\n* Field of view: Wide-angle lenses (around 80\u00b0) are great for capturing more of your scene\n* Low-light performance: If you plan to stream in a dimly lit environment, look for cameras with good low-light sensitivity\n* Connectivity: Make sure the camera has a USB connection (or can be connected via a capture card) and is compatible with your computer and YouTube Live\n* Budget: Set a budget and stick to it; cameras can range from under $100 to over $1,000\n\nRemember to check the camera's compatibility with YouTube Live and your computer's operating system before making a purchase.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect camera for your live streaming setup!",
