  "content": "While jigs can be effective for walleye, they might not be the best choice for walleye in the Milwaukee Harbor area. Walleye in this region tend to be more finicky and often require a more subtle, finesse presentation. Here's why I'd recommend a different approach for walleye:\n\n1. **Walleye behavior:** Walleye in the Milwaukee Harbor area often suspend in deeper water (10-20 ft.) or hold near structural elements like rocks, weed beds, or sunken logs. They can be more particular about their surroundings and require a more precise presentation.\n2. **Water conditions:** The harbor's water can be murky, especially after heavy rainfall or strong winds. In these conditions, walleye might be more difficult to target with a jig, which can be loud and flashy.\n\nFor walleye in the Milwaukee Harbor area, I'd recommend trying the following:\n\n* **Live bait:** Live bait like nightcrawlers, minnows, or leeches on a live bait rig or a slip bobber can be extremely effective for walleye. This presentation is often more subtle and can be more appealing to finicky walleye.\n* **Slow-moving lures:** Lures like a slow-moving spinnerbait, a small crankbait, or a soft-plastic swim bait on a jighead can also be effective for walleye. These lures can be worked slowly and deliberately to imitate a injured baitfish or a crawdad.\n* **Trolling or casting:** Try trolling or casting near structural elements like rocks, weed beds, or sunken logs. This can help you present your lure or bait in a more precise manner and increase your chances of catching walleye.\n\nIf you do want to try a jig for walleye, consider the following:\n\n* **Smaller jig:** Use a smaller jighead (1/16 to 1/8 oz.) and a more subtle trailer like a small curly tail or a soft-plastic worm.\n* **Slower retrieve:** Work the jig very slowly, almost dragging it along the bottom, to imitate a crawdad or a slow-moving baitfish.\n\nRemember, walleye can be more challenging to catch than bass, so be prepared to experiment and adapt your presentation accordingly. Good luck, and I hope you catch some nice walleye in the Milwaukee Harbor area!",
