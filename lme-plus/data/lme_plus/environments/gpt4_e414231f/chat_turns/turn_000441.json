Focusing on exercises that target your core and legs will help you build a strong foundation for marathon training. Here are some essential exercises to incorporate into your strength training routine:\n\n**Core Exercises:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise targets your abs, obliques, and lower back.\n2. **Russian twists**: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Twist your torso to left and right, touching your hands to the ground each time. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n3. **Leg raises**: Lie on your back with arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. **Side plank (each side)**: Hold a side plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat on the other side. This exercise targets your obliques and glutes.\n\n**Leg Exercises:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hands by your sides. Lower your body down into a squat, keeping your back straight and knees behind your toes. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n2. **Lunges**: Stand with feet together and take a large step forward with one foot. Lower your body down into a lunge, keeping your front knee behind your toes and back knee almost touching the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each leg.\n3. **Deadlifts**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hold dumbbells or a barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lift the weight up to hip level, squeezing your glutes and pushing your hips back. Lower the weight back down to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. **Calf raises**: Stand on a step or platform with heels hanging off the edge. Raise up onto your tiptoes and then lower back down. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Start with lighter weights and progress gradually**: It's better to start with lighter weights and increase the load as you build strength. This will help prevent injuries and allow you to focus on proper form.\n2. **Focus on proper form and technique**: Make sure to engage your core and use proper form for each exercise. This will help you target the correct muscles and reduce the risk of injury.\n3. **Incorporate exercises that target your glutes**: Your glutes are essential for running, so make sure to include exercises that target them, such as squats, lunges, and deadlifts.\n4. **Aim for 2-3 strength training sessions per week**: Incorporate strength training into your routine 2-3 times per week, allowing for at least one day of rest in between.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust your strength training routine as needed. It's also essential to incorporate rest and recovery days to allow your muscles to repair and rebuild.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more guidance.",
