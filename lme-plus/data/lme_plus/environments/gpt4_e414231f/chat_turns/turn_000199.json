You can fit more of your background, props, or even a guest into the frame.\n2. **Flexibility**: The C920 is a USB webcam, so you can easily move it around, place it on a tripod, or attach it to a laptop or monitor. This flexibility makes it easy to experiment with different camera angles and positions.\n3. **Affordability**: At its price point, the C920 is a low-risk investment, allowing you to experiment with different setups without breaking the bank. If you decide you need a different camera or want to upgrade, you won't be out a lot of money.\n4. **Good image quality**: The C920 produces a high-quality 1080p video at 30fps, which is more than sufficient for most live streaming applications.
