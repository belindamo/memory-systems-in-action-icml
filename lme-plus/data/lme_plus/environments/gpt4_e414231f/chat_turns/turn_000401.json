The loggers have arrived, and they're planning to cut down the trees in our forest. If we don't stop them, our home will be destroyed forever.\n\nkeeper, \\*dwarf: What can we do to help?\n\n\\*keeper, dwarf: There's a legend about a mystical flower that can stop anyone who wishes to harm the forest. It's said to be hidden on the highest branch of the Tree of Life. We need to find it before it's too late.\n\n2\n\n\\*dwarf, keeper: We've dealt with the Tree of Life before. How hard can it be?\n\ndwarf, \\*keeper: We need to find the first branch that holds the mystical flower. We'll need to climb up there, so yeah, it might not be that easy.\n\n3\n\n\\*worker, bear: This path is treacherous. Watch your step.\n\nworker, \\*bear: Don't worry, I'll keep an eye out for everyone.\n\n\\*elf, bear: Look at all these beautiful flowers. I've never seen anything like them before.\n\n\\*elf, dwarf: Stay focused, everyone. We can admire the scenery once we find that flower.\n\n\\*warlock, dwarf: Agreed. We don't know what dangers lie ahead.",
