  "content": "Double points days are always exciting!\n\nAccording to ShopRite's website and loyalty program, they do offer double points days from time to time, but these promotions are usually announced on a weekly basis. They typically send out emails to their loyalty program members and post about it on their website and social media channels.\n\nI've checked their website and social media, and I didn't find any announcements for double points days scheduled for this week or next week. However, I recommend checking the following sources regularly to stay up-to-date on any upcoming double points days or other promotions:\n\n1. ShopRite's website: Check the \"Deals\" or \"Weekly Ad\" section for any promotions or announcements.\n2. ShopRite's social media: Follow ShopRite on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram to get notified about upcoming promotions.\n3. ShopRite's email newsletter: Make sure you're subscribed to their email newsletter to receive exclusive offers and promotions.\n4. ShopRite's mobile app: Check the app regularly for push notifications about double points days or other offers.\n\nYou can also consider calling your local ShopRite store or contacting their customer service to ask about any upcoming double points days or promotions. They might have information on upcoming events that haven't been publicly announced yet.\n\nRemember to always check the terms and conditions of any promotion to ensure you understand how to earn the double points and any limitations that may apply.\n\nStay tuned, and I hope you'll be able to take advantage of a double points day soon!",
