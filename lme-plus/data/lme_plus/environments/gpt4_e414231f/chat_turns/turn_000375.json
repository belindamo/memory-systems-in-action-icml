Remember to focus on proper form and start slow, gradually increasing the intensity as you build strength and confidence. It's also essential to warm up before exercising and stretch afterwards to prevent injury.\n\nBefore we move on, I just wanted to check in and see how you're feeling about incorporating strength training into your routine. Do you have any concerns or questions about getting started, or are you feeling motivated and ready to begin?",
