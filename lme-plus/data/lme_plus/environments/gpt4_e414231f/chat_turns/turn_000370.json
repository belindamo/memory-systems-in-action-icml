Exhale during the most challenging part of the exercise, and inhale during the easier part.\n\n**Proper Form for Glute Exercises:**\n\n1. **Squeeze Your Glutes**: Engage your glutes by squeezing them together and feeling the contraction in your buttocks.\n2. **Keep Your Hips Stable**: Avoid letting your hips lift or sag during exercises like glute bridges or side lying leg lifts.\n3. **Use Your Glutes, Not Your Back**: Focus on using your glutes to lift your hips or legs, rather than relying on your lower back.\n4. **Keep Your Knees in Line**: Keep your knees in line with your toes during exercises like squats or lunges to avoid putting unnecessary stress on your joints.\n\n**Proper Form for Core Exercises:**\n\n1. **Maintain a Neutral Spine**: Keep your spine in a neutral position, avoiding arching or rounding your back.\n2. **Engage Your Core**: Engage your core muscles by drawing your belly button towards your spine and maintaining a stable pelvis.\n3. **Avoid Letting Your Hips Sag**: Keep your hips stable and avoid letting them sag or lift during exercises like planks or Russian twists.\n4. **Use Your Core, Not Your Arms or Legs**: Focus on using your core muscles to lift or rotate, rather than relying on your arms or legs.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Start Slow**: Begin with lighter weights or fewer reps and gradually increase the intensity as you build strength and endurance.\n2. **Focus on Controlled Movements**: Move slowly and control the movement throughout the exercise to avoid jerky or bouncy movements.\n3. **Listen to Your Body**: If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop the exercise immediately and modify it or consult with a healthcare professional.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to engage your core correctly and maintain proper form while doing glute and core exercises, reducing your risk of injury and getting the most out of your workout.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these tips or any other exercise-related topics?",
