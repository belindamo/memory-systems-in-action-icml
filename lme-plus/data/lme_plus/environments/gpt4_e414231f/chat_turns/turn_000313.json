  "content": "Yes, a statue was erected in memory of Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse in Liverpool in 1919, two years after his death. The statue is located in the gardens of the Liverpool Anglican Cathedral, and was designed by the sculptor Francis Derwent Wood.\n\nThe statue depicts Chavasse in his army uniform, and shows him holding a medical bag in one hand while he gestures with the other. The statue is a realistic likeness of Chavasse, and captures his heroic spirit and dedication to his patients.\n\nThe statue is a popular destination for visitors to Liverpool, and has become an important symbol of the city's pride in one of its most famous sons. It is also a powerful reminder of the sacrifices made by those who served in the First World War, and the lasting impact of their heroism and selflessness.",
