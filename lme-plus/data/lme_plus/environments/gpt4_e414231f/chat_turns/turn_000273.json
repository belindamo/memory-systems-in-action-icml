Here are some effective lures for bass and walleye in Lake Michigan:\n\n**Bass Lures:**\n\n1. **Soft Plastics:** Curly tail grubs (white, chartreuse, or yellow) and plastic worms (green pumpkin, watermelon, or junebug) are excellent for smallmouth bass. Try using a 1/8 to 1/4 oz. jighead or a dropshot rig.\n2. **Crankbaits:** Use shallow-diving crankbaits (1-3 ft.) in shad-shaped patterns (silver, gold, or perch-colored) to target smallmouth bass in rocky areas or weed beds.\n3. **Jigs:** A 1/8 to 1/4 oz. swim bait (white, chartreuse, or yellow) or a jigging spoon (silver or gold) can be effective for smallmouth bass in deeper water (10-20 ft.).\n4. **Topwater:** Frogs, poppers, or spoons can be exciting for smallmouth bass in warmer weather, especially in the early morning or late evening.\n\n**Walleye Lures:**\n\n1. **Jigs:** A 1/4 to 1/2 oz. jig (chartreuse, white, or silver) with a curly tail or a swim bait can be deadly for walleye. Try using a slow, gentle retrieve.\n2. **Crankbaits:** Deeper-diving crankbaits (5-10 ft.) in shad-shaped patterns (silver, gold, or perch-colored) can target walleye in deeper water.\n3. **Spinners:** A spinnerbait with a slow, steady retrieve can be effective for walleye, especially in rocky areas or weed beds.\n4. **Live Bait:** Nightcrawlers, minnows, or leeches on a live bait rig or a slip bobber can be very effective for walleye.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Pay attention to water conditions and adjust your lure choice accordingly. For example, in murky water, use a lure with more vibration or a brighter color.\n* Experiment with different retrieval speeds and actions to trigger bites.\n* Consider using a lure with a slow, steady retrieve for walleye, as they can be finicky.\n* For bass, try to mimic the natural baitfish or crayfish in the area.\n* Don't be afraid to try different lures and presentations to see what works best for your specific fishing spot and time of year.\n\nIn your case, the silver spinnerbait has been successful, which is a great starting point. You might consider adding some of the above lures to your arsenal to expand your options and adapt to changing fishing conditions.\n\nRemember to always check local fishing regulations and obtain any necessary permits before your trip. Good luck on your next fishing adventure!",
