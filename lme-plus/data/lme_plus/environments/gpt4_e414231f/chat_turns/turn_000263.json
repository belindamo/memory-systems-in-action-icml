Here are some effective strength training exercises for your lower body and core:\n\n**Lower Body:**\n\n1. **Squats**: 3 sets of 8-12 reps\n\t* Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then bend your knees and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground.\n2. **Lunges**: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (per leg)\n\t* Stand with your feet together, take a large step forward with one foot, and lower your body until your back knee almost touches the ground. Alternate legs.\n3. **Calf Raises**: 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n\t* Stand on a step or platform, raise up onto your toes, and then lower back down.\n4. **Deadlifts**: 3 sets of 8-12 reps\n\t* Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend down and grab a weight or barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart, and lift up to hip level.\n5. **Step-Ups**: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (per leg)\n\t* Stand in front of a step or platform, raise one foot up onto the step, and then bring the other foot up to meet it. Alternate legs.\n\n**Core:**\n\n1. **Plank**: 3 sets of 30-60 seconds\n\t* Start in a push-up position, with your hands shoulder-width apart, and engage your core muscles to support your body.\n2. **Russian Twists**: 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n\t* Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat, lean back slightly, and twist your torso from side to side, touching your hands to the ground each time.\n3. **Leg Raises**: 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n\t* Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead, raise one leg towards the ceiling, and then lower it back down. Alternate legs.\n4. **Side Plank**: 3 sets of 30-60 seconds (per side)\n\t* Lie on your side with your feet stacked, lift your hips off the ground, and engage your core muscles to support your body.\n\n**Frequency and Guidelines:**\n\n* Aim to do strength training exercises 1-2 times per week, with at least one day of rest in between.\n* Start with lighter weights and higher reps (12-15) to focus on endurance and running-specific strength. As you get stronger, you can gradually increase the weight and lower the reps (8-10).\n* Warm up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio (jogging, jumping jacks, etc.) and stretching before strength training.\n* Focus on proper form and technique over the number of reps or weight lifted.\n* As you get closer to your 5K race, you can reduce the frequency and intensity of strength training to allow for more rest and recovery.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust the exercises, frequency, and intensity based on how you feel. It's also essential to incorporate proper warm-ups, cool-downs, and recovery techniques to avoid injuries and optimize your performance.",
