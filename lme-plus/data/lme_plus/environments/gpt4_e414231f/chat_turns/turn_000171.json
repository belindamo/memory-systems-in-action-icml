  "content": "According to ShopRite's coupon policy, digital coupons and manufacturer coupons can be combined on the same item, as long as the terms of the coupons allow it.\n\nHere's how it typically works:\n\n1. **Digital coupons**: These are loaded onto your ShopRite loyalty card and are usually offered by ShopRite itself. They're automatically applied at checkout when you buy the qualifying item.\n2. **Manufacturer coupons**: These are coupons offered by the product manufacturer, and they can be found on product packaging, online, or in newspapers. You need to present the physical coupon at checkout.\n\nWhen you combine both, the digital coupon will be applied first, and then the manufacturer coupon will be applied on top of that. This is known as \"stacking.\"\n\nFor example, let's say you have a digital coupon for $1 off a specific brand of pasta, and you also have a manufacturer coupon for $0.50 off the same brand of pasta. If you buy the pasta, the digital coupon will be applied first, taking $1 off the price. Then, the manufacturer coupon will be applied, taking an additional $0.50 off. You'll get a total discount of $1.50 off the original price.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions and limitations to be aware of:\n\n* Some digital coupons may have terms that exclude combining them with manufacturer coupons.\n* Some manufacturer coupons may have terms that exclude combining them with digital coupons or other offers.\n* There may be limits on the number of coupons you can combine on a single item.\n\nAlways check the terms and conditions of each coupon before you shop to make sure you can combine them. ShopRite's coupon policy may also change over time, so it's always a good idea to review it before you shop.\n\nI hope that helps!",
