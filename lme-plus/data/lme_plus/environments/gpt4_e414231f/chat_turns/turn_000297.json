  "content": "Turbinado sugar is a great choice, and you can definitely substitute it for granulated sugar in this recipe. Turbinado sugar, also known as raw cane sugar, has a slightly coarser texture and a more caramel-like flavor compared to granulated sugar.\n\nHere's how using turbinado sugar might affect the flavor and texture of your lavender shortbread cookies:\n\n**Flavor:**\n\n* Turbinado sugar has a slightly more robust, caramel-like flavor than granulated sugar, which might complement the floral flavor of lavender nicely.\n* The flavor difference will be subtle, but you might notice a slightly deeper, more complex sweetness in the cookies.\n\n**Texture:**\n\n* Turbinado sugar is slightly coarser than granulated sugar, which might affect the texture of the cookies.\n* The cookies might be slightly more tender and crumbly, as the turbinado sugar won't dissolve as easily as granulated sugar. This could be a nice textural contrast to the richness of the butter and the delicacy of the lavender.\n\n** Tips:**\n\n* If you're using turbinado sugar, you might want to cream the butter and sugar together for a slightly longer time to ensure the sugar is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.\n* Keep in mind that turbinado sugar can make baked goods slightly more prone to browning, so keep an eye on the cookies while they're baking to ensure they don't overcook.\n\nOverall, using turbinado sugar will give your lavender shortbread cookies a slightly different character, but they'll still be delicious and flavorful. Go for it, and enjoy the subtle changes it brings to the recipe!",
