      "content": "To write a script node in Engati bot, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to your Engati account and go to the bot builder dashboard.\n2. Click on the \"Add Node\" button to create a new node.\n3. Select \"Script\" as the node type from the list of available options.\n4. In the script editor window that appears, you can write your Node.js code to perform the desired actions.\n5. You can use Engati's built-in libraries and modules to interact with various APIs, databases, and other external services. For example, you can use the \"request\" module to make HTTP requests or the \"mongodb\" module to access a MongoDB database.\n6. Once you have written the script code, click on the \"Save\" button to save the node.\n7. You can connect the script node to other nodes in the conversation flow to create a complete chatbot experience.\n\nNote: Engati supports Node.js version 10.x and higher. Also, you need to ensure that your code is asynchronous and doesn't block the main event loop, as this can cause performance issues with your bot.\n\nIn summary, writing a script node in Engati is a straightforward process. You can use Node.js code to perform complex actions and interact with various services to create a powerful and dynamic chatbot."

      "content": "Sure, here is an example of a script node in Engati bot builder:\n\nSuppose you want to build a script node that sends a message to a user's email address. You can use the following Node.js code to accomplish this:\n```javascript\nconst nodemailer = require('nodemailer');\n\nconst transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({\n  service: 'gmail',\n  auth: {\n    user: 'youremail@gmail.com',\n    pass: 'yourpassword'\n  }\n});\n\nconst mailOptions = {\n  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',\n  to: '{{context.userProfile.email}}',\n  subject: 'Test email from Engati bot',\n  text: 'This is a test email sent from Engati bot'\n};\n\ntransporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info){\n  if (error) {\n    console.log(error);\n  } else {\n    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);\n  }\n});\n```\nIn this code, we are using the `nodemailer` module to send an email to the user's email address. We create a transporter object by providing our Gmail credentials, and then we define the email message using the `mailOptions` object. Finally, we use the `sendMail()` method to send the email and log the result.\n\nTo use this code in Engati, you can create a script node and paste this code into the script editor window. You can then connect this node to other nodes in the conversation flow to trigger the email sending action.\n\nNote that in the `mailOptions` object, we are using Engati's context variable `{{context.userProfile.email}}` to dynamically populate the user's email address. This is because Engati stores the user's email address in the `userProfile` context variable, which we can access using the double curly braces syntax."

      "content": "Yes, you can integrate Shopify with Engati using Engati's webhook feature. Here's a general overview of how to do it:\n\n1. Log in to your Engati account and go to the bot builder dashboard.\n2. Create a new node that triggers when a user places an order or performs an action in Shopify. You can do this by using Shopify's webhook feature to send a notification to a webhook URL that you provide.\n3. In the Shopify webhook settings, specify the webhook URL as the Engati webhook URL. This URL is provided in the Engati dashboard under the \"Integrations\" section.\n4. In the Engati webhook node, you can write Node.js code to handle the incoming webhook data and trigger a response in your bot. You can use Engati's built-in libraries and modules to interact with the Shopify API and perform various actions, such as sending a confirmation message to the user or updating the user's order status.\n5. Test the webhook integration by performing an action in Shopify that triggers the webhook, such as placing an order or updating a customer record.\n6. Once you have tested the webhook integration, you can deploy it to your live Shopify store and start using it to automate various tasks and interactions with your customers.\n\nNote that the specific steps and code required for the webhook integration may vary depending on your specific use case and requirements. However, Engati provides a flexible and powerful webhook feature that allows you to easily integrate with Shopify and other external services."
