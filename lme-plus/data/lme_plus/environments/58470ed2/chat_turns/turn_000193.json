  "content": "Area: Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production\n\nProblem: One major problem in this area is the excessive generation of waste from the production and consumption of goods. According to the UN, the world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually, with at least 33% not managed in an environmentally safe manner.\n\nSolution: My idea for an original solution to address the problem of waste generation is a mobile app called \"Wasteless\". The app would work as a platform to connect users with local businesses and organizations that are committed to reducing waste.\n\nHow it works: The app would be designed to provide users with information on how to reduce waste in their daily lives. This would include tips on reducing food waste, using reusable bags and containers, and buying products with minimal packaging. The app would also allow users to track their waste reduction progress and set goals for themselves.\n\nThe Wasteless app would also include a directory of local businesses and organizations that prioritize sustainability and waste reduction. Users could use the app to search for businesses that offer package-free products, or restaurants that use compostable or reusable utensils and containers. The app would also encourage businesses to offer discounts or incentives for customers who bring their reusable containers or bags.\n\nImpact: Wasteless has the potential to have a significant impact on the reduction of waste generation by promoting responsible consumption and production. The app can help individuals make more sustainable choices in their daily lives and promote the adoption of environmentally friendly practices in the business community. With increased awareness and action on waste reduction, Wasteless can contribute to achieving SDG 12 by promoting responsible consumption and production patterns.",
