Consistent practice is key to improving your skills, and it's great that you're taking the initiative to work on your technique.\n\n Ah, the cross-body lead, that's a great move! It's wonderful that you enjoyed learning it in week 3 of your class. The cross-body lead is a fundamental move in salsa dancing, and it's fantastic that you found it challenging but fun. It's always rewarding to master a new move, isn't it?\n\nRemember to keep practicing, and don't be afraid to try new moves and techniques. The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with the rhythm and the moves. And don't forget to have fun! Salsa dancing is all about enjoying the music, the movement, and the energy of the dance.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need any tips, feel free to ask. I'm always here to help. Keep dancing, and I hope to hear about your progress soon!",
