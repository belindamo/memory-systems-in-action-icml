  "content": "Yes, the main difference in how fleece and flannel are made is the material they are made of.\nFleece is made from synthetic fibers such as polyester or nylon, while flannel is made from natural fibers such as cotton, wool, or a blend of these fibers.\nBoth are made by carding process, which aligns the fibers in the same direction, and then weaving or knitting them together to create the final fabric. However, the carding process for flannel raises the nap on the surface of the fabric, giving it its characteristic soft, warm and fuzzy texture. Fleece is carded as well but it doesn't raise the nap, it stays smooth and uniform.\n\nAdditionally, the way fleece and flannel are finished and treated also affect the final product. Fleece is often treated with a process called \"polishing\" to give it a smooth surface, while flannel is often brushed to give it a soft, fuzzy texture.\n\nOverall, while both fleece and flannel are made by carding process, the difference in the materials and the finishing process used on those materials result in very different fabrics.",
