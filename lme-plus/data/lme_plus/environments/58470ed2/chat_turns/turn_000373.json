You can also modify the endpoint to retrieve only specific products or product categories in stock by adding the relevant query parameters. For example, to retrieve all products in the \"clothing\" category that are in stock, you can use the following endpoint:\n```bash\n/wp-json/wc/v3/products?category=clothing&stock_status=instock\n```\nMake sure to include the necessary authentication credentials in your API requests to ensure that only authorized users can access the product data.",
