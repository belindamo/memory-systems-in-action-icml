  "content": "IKEA is a great choice for affordable and energy-efficient LED bulbs! Their bulbs are often a popular option for many homeowners.\n\nThe IKEA LED bulbs you've used in the past might work for under-cabinet lighting, but it depends on the specific type and characteristics of the bulb. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Lumen output**: Under-cabinet lighting typically requires a lower lumen output than a bedside lamp. If the IKEA bulbs you've used in the past are too bright, they might be overwhelming for under-cabinet use. Look for bulbs with a lower lumen output (around 200-400 lumens) for a more subtle light.\n2. **Color temperature**: IKEA bulbs often have a neutral white or cool white color temperature (around 4000K-5000K), which might not be ideal for under-cabinet lighting. Warm white bulbs (2700K-3000K) can create a cozier ambiance, but it ultimately depends on your personal preference.\n3. **Beam angle**: Under-cabinet lighting often requires a more focused beam angle to direct the light downwards and minimize glare. If the IKEA bulbs have a wide beam angle, they might not be the best choice for under-cabinet use.\n4. **Certifications and ratings**: Make sure the IKEA bulbs you choose are rated for use in under-cabinet applications and meet safety certifications like UL or ETL.\n\nIf you're unsure, you can always check the packaging or IKEA's website for specifications on the bulb you're considering. You might also want to visit an IKEA store to see the bulbs in person and get a better feel for their output and color temperature.\n\nThat being said, if you're happy with the performance and quality of IKEA bulbs, you can definitely consider using them for under-cabinet lighting. Just be sure to choose the right type and characteristics for your specific needs.",
