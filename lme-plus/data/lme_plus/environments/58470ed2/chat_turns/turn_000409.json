  "content": "It's difficult to say with certainty whether these initiatives will be enough to fully recover the tourism industry in Sri Lanka. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global travel industry, and it may take some time for tourism to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the situation in Sri Lanka is still uncertain due to the sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the government's initiatives are a step in the right direction. They have helped to provide some support to businesses and individuals who are struggling due to the decline in tourism. In the long term, it's essential to continue supporting the tourism industry through promoting the country as a safe travel destination, investing in infrastructure, and focusing on sustainable tourism. By taking these steps, Sri Lanka can work towards a sustainable recovery and grow its tourism industry in a way that benefits both locals and visitors.",
