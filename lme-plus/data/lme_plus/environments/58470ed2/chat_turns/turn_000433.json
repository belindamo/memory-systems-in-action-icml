Here are some tips to help you build on that momentum and develop a consistent morning routine:\n\n1. **Set a consistent wake-up time**: Since you're already waking up at 6:45 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, try to set the same wake-up time for the other days of the week. Consistency will help regulate your body's internal clock.\n2. **Gradually adjust your wake-up time**: If you're not used to waking up early, don't try to wake up at 6:45 AM every day immediately. Start by setting your alarm 15-30 minutes earlier each day and gradually work your way up to your desired wake-up time.\n3. **Create a relaxing bedtime routine**: Wind down before bed with a calming activity like reading, meditation, or a warm bath. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep to ensure you're well-rested in the morning.\n4. **Use a smart alarm**: Consider using an alarm clock that can monitor your sleep patterns and wake you up during a light sleep phase. This can help you feel more refreshed and energized in the morning.\n5. **Get some morning sunlight**: Exposure to natural light in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythms, making it easier to wake up. Open your curtains or take a short walk outside in the morning.\n6. **Make a plan for the morning**: Give yourself a reason to get out of bed by setting a goal for the morning, such as exercising, meditating, or enjoying a cup of coffee. Having a purpose will make it easier to get up and start your day.\n7. **Use a wake-up light**: A wake-up light is a device that simulates a sunrise by gradually increasing the light in your room, helping to wake you up more naturally.\n8. **Avoid snoozing**: Snoozing can make it harder to wake up and feel rested. Try to resist the temptation to hit the snooze button and get out of bed as soon as your alarm goes off.\n9. **Make mornings enjoyable**: Play uplifting music, enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, or read something inspiring to start your day on a positive note.\n10. **Be consistent on weekends**: Try to maintain your wake-up time on weekends as well. This will help regulate your body's internal clock and make it easier to wake up on weekdays.\n\nBy incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you'll be more likely to establish a consistent wake-up time and start your day feeling refreshed and energized. Good luck!",
