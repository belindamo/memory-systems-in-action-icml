I'm happy to have been able to offer tips, even if you didn't need them in the end.\n\nIt's great that you've found a beautiful way to display your souvenir from Paris. Having a lovely piece of art in your personal space can really elevate the ambiance and make it feel more special.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what kind of frame did you choose for your print? Was it a classic white or gold frame, or something more modern and sleek?\n\n(And, by the way, I'm thrilled to have been able to chat with you about art, local artists, and framing tips. If you have any more questions or topics you'd like to discuss, feel free to ask me anytime!)",
