Be prepared to lift, bend, and move around. Wear comfortable clothing and shoes that are suitable for physical activity.\n2. **Arrive on time and be flexible**: Plan to arrive 10-15 minutes before your scheduled volunteer time to get orientated with the facility and the tasks.

Take initiative to help with tasks that need attention, but always ensure you're following proper procedures.\n8. **Be patient and understanding**: Working in a food bank can be fast-paced and demanding. Be patient with clients, staff, and fellow volunteers, and remember that everyone is there to make a positive impact.\n9. **Learn about food insecurity and the community**: Use this opportunity to learn about food insecurity in your community, the challenges faced by clients, and the role of the food bank in addressing these issues.\n10. **Follow up and provide feedback**: After your volunteering experience, consider providing feedback to the food bank staff on your experience, suggesting improvements, and expressing your appreciation for the opportunity to serve.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll not only make a positive impact but also gain a valuable and rewarding experience.
