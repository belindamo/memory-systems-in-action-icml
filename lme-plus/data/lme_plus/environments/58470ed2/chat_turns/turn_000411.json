Virtual tourism: Even though it may not be possible to travel in person, people can still explore Sri Lanka through virtual tours and experiences. This can help to promote the country as a travel destination and support businesses that offer virtual tourism experiences.\n\n2. Donations: Donating to local charities and organizations that support communities affected by the decline in tourism can make a significant impact. These donations can help to provide basic necessities such as food and shelter to those who need it most.\n\n3. Purchase products: People can support Sri Lankan businesses by purchasing local products, such as tea, spices, and textiles, through online retailers.
