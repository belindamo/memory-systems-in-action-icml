It's a hearty, savory meal that can be enjoyed at any time of day, and the best part is that you can customize it to your liking. In this article, we'll take a closer look at how to make the best Shakshuka recipe you'll ever try.\n\nBefore we begin, here are the tools you'll need to make Shakshuka:\n\n* Large pan (stainless or cast iron)\n* Sharp knife\n* Cutting board\n* Can opener\n* Measuring spoons\n* Wooden spoon\n* Garlic press (optional)\n\nNow that we have our tools ready, let's dive into the recipe.\n\nPreparing the Ingredients\n\nTo start, we'll need to chop one large onion or one and a half small ones. Remove the skin and dice it into small pieces. We'll also need four cloves of garlic, which we'll smash and then mince to release their oils and add extra flavor.\n\nNext, we'll prepare the bell pepper. Remove the ribs and seeds, and then cut it into small pieces. If you prefer your Shakshuka spicy, you can add in jalapeno or any other pepper of your choice.\n\nCooking the Ingredients\n\nHeat up three tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add in the onions and bell peppers. Stir occasionally and let cook for 10 to 12 minutes or until the onions are translucent and starting to take on some color.\n\nWhile the onions and peppers are cooking, open up a can of whole peeled tomatoes. Drain off some of the liquid to achieve the desired consistency for the Shakshuka. Add the tomatoes and minced garlic to the pan, and then stir everything together.\n\nLet the mixture cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes have broken down and the flavors have combined. Use a wooden spoon to create a small well in the mixture, and then crack an egg into the well. Repeat this step for as many eggs as you'd like to add to the Shakshuka.\n\nCover the pan with a lid and let the eggs cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. This should take about 5-7 minutes.\n\nServing the Shakshuka\n\nOnce the eggs are cooked to your liking, it's time to serve the Shakshuka. Garnish it with some fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro, and serve with some crusty bread or pita to soak up all the tomatoey goodness.\n\nTips and Variations\n\n* To add more spice to your Shakshuka, you can add in jalapenos or other hot peppers.\n* If you want to make your Shakshuka even heartier, you can add in some cooked sausage or bacon.\n* You can also add in other vegetables like mushrooms or zucchini for added flavor and nutrition.\n* If you're a fan of cheese, sprinkle some feta or Parmesan on top of the Shakshuka before serving.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: What is the origin of Shakshuka?\n\nA: Shakshuka originated in North Africa and has since spread to different parts of the world.
