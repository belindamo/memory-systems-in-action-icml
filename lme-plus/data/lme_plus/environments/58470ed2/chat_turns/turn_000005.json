In Tokyo, the world's largest vertical farm was built by the company Spread, which produces 10,000 heads of lettuce per day in a 25,000 square foot facility. Similarly, in Singapore, a company called Sky Greens has created a 9-meter tall vertical farm that produces 1 ton of vegetables per day.\n\nIn the US, New York City-based company Bowery Farming has created a 50,000 square foot vertical farm that uses LED lights and hydroponic technology to produce leafy greens and herbs year-round. The company also claims to use 95% less water than traditional farming methods.\n\nOther cities around the world that have implemented vertical farming on a large scale include Amsterdam, South Korea, and London. In addition, many smaller scale vertical farms have been set up in restaurants, grocery stores, and homes, making this technology accessible to more people.\n\nOverall, vertical farming has gained popularity as a promising solution to food insecurity and sustainability challenges in urban areas.",
