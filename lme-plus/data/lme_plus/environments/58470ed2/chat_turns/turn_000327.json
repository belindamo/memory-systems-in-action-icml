  "content": "Tubbataha Reef is a protected marine sanctuary located in the middle of the Sulu Sea, around 150 kilometers southeast of Puerto Princesa City in Palawan. It is only accessible by boat, and visitors need to join a liveaboard diving cruise to reach the reef. The liveaboard boats usually depart from Puerto Princesa or the nearby municipality of Dumaran. The Tubbataha Management Office regulates the number of visitors to the area to protect its delicate ecosystem, so it is recommended to plan and book ahead of time. The best time to visit Tubbataha Reef is from March to June, when the seas are calmer and the visibility is better for diving and snorkeling.",
