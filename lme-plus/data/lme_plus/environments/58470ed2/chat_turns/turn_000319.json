Learn to say no:**\nBe mindful of your commitments and learn to say no to non-essential tasks that may interfere with your priorities.\n\n**7. Take breaks and practice self-care:**\nMake time for relaxation, exercise, and self-care to avoid burnout. Schedule breaks and leisure activities to recharge.\n\n**8. Communicate with your support network:**\n Inform your family, friends, and colleagues about your MBA studies and volunteer work. They can offer support, understanding, and help when needed.\n\n**9.
