I think I'll create a 15-second teaser video showcasing a key step, like the eyeshadow application, with a caption like you suggested. I'll also make sure to include a clear CTA to drive traffic to my Twitter account. And, I might share a BTS photo or video on TikTok to give my followers a glimpse into my creative process. Thanks for the suggestions!",
