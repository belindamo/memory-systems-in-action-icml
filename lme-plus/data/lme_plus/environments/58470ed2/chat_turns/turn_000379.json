Locate the function that retrieves the products and modify it to include the new function that filters items in stock. You can use the following code as an example:\n```php\nfunction get_products_in_stock() {\n    $args = array(\n        'post_type' => 'product',\n        'meta_query' => array(\n            array(\n                'key' => '_stock_status',\n                'value' => 'instock'\n            )\n        )\n    );\n    $products = get_posts( $args );\n    return $products;\n}\n```\n3. Save the plugin file and upload it to your WordPress site.\n4. Test the plugin to ensure that it retrieves only items in stock.\n\nNote: Please make sure to backup your plugin file before making any changes to it.",
