      "content": "I'm happy to help you with that! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to Walmart's current prices or inventory. But I can help you with some suggestions.\n\nYou can try checking Walmart's website or mobile app to see if the 24-pack of toilet paper is still on sale. You can also sign up for their email newsletter or follow them on social media to stay updated on their latest deals and promotions.\n\nRegarding the original price, if it was $2 more than $15.99, that would mean the original price was $17.99. If you're looking to get a good deal again, you might want to keep an eye out for a price around $15.99 or lower.\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider checking prices at other retailers or online marketplaces like Amazon to compare prices and find the best deal.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy shopping!"
