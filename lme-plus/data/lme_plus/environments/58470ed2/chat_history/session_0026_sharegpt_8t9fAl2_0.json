      "content": "One potential case study for user-centered design in chemical engineering courses could be the design of a new chemical plant.\n\nThe user-centered design process would involve identifying the needs and goals of the stakeholders involved in the project, including operators, engineers, maintenance personnel, and safety professionals. This could involve conducting user research through interviews, surveys, and observations to understand the different perspectives and requirements of each group.\n\nOnce the needs and goals have been identified, the design team could create prototypes and conduct usability testing to ensure that the plant is designed to meet the needs of all stakeholders. This could involve testing the ease of use and accessibility of control panels, safety systems, and maintenance procedures.\n\nThe final design could then be validated through pilot testing before full-scale implementation. This would ensure that any potential issues are identified and addressed before the plant is put into operation.\n\nOverall, this case study would provide students with hands-on experience in applying user-centered design principles to a real-world project in chemical engineering, while also emphasizing the importance of collaboration and communication between different stakeholders in the design process."
