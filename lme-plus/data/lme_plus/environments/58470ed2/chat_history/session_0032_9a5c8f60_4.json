      "content": "A natural everyday makeup tutorial is a great idea!\n\nFor Twitter, I'd recommend creating a Twitter thread with step-by-step instructions, accompanied by photos or short videos showcasing each step. This format allows you to break down the tutorial into bite-sized chunks, making it easy for your followers to follow along. You can use Twitter's \"Thread\" feature to connect each tweet, creating a cohesive and easy-to-read guide.\n\nHere's a possible outline for your Twitter thread:\n\nTweet 1: Introduction to the tutorial, explaining the look you'll be creating and the products you'll be using.\n\nTweet 2-3: Prep the skin (cleansing, moisturizing, priming) with photos or short videos.\n\nTweet 4-5: Foundation and concealer application, with tips on finding the right shade and coverage.\n\nTweet 6-7: Eyeshadow and eyeliner application, with photos or videos of each step.\n\nTweet 8-9: Mascara, blush, and highlighter application, with tips on enhancing natural features.\n\nTweet 10: Final look reveal, with a photo or short video of the completed makeup look.\n\nTweet 11: Conclusion, with a call-to-action (e.g., \"Try out this look and tag me in your recreations!\").\n\nAs for the video, you could create a short, 60-second to 2-minute video showcasing the final look, with captions or voiceover explaining the products used and the techniques applied. You could share this video on Twitter, TikTok, or even Instagram Reels.\n\nRegarding your TikTok engagement, it's great that you've noticed a pattern! Sundays and Mondays might be a good time to post tutorials, as people are often looking for inspiration or motivation to start their week off right. Consider creating content that's quick, easy, and achievable for a busy Monday morning, like a \"5-minute morning skincare routine\" or a \"quick and easy everyday makeup look.\"\n\nRemember to cross-promote your Twitter thread and video on TikTok, and vice versa, to drive engagement and attract new followers across both platforms!"
