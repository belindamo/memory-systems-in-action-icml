You should definitely renew it as soon as possible to avoid any last-minute hassles. Here are some steps to help you get started:\n\n1. Check the Indian government's website for passport renewal requirements and fees.\n2.

However, weigh the benefits against the additional cost and effort required for the application process. If you're unsure, you can always apply for an OCI card at a later time.\n\nRemember to apply for your OCI card simultaneously with your passport renewal to avoid additional fees and paperwork.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!"
