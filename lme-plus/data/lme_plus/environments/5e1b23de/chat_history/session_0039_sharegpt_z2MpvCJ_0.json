Charlie is beside himself with sadness. Dennis and Dee are mad because Frank left all his money with Charlie. Charlie reminisces about all the wonderful things that Frank has done. The rest of the Gang, Mac, Dennis, and Dee, bring to light new information that recontextualizes Frank's actions to look horrific, including fraud and crimes and other repulsive behavior. Charlie, unbeknownst to the rest of the gang, donates all of Frank's money to the church (which will only be revealed later in the scene). Rickety Cricket, after having rejoined the church and becoming sober, reveals that the church is making Frank a saint. The gang goes to church for Frank's canonization.\u00a0Rickety Cricket comes to the mass high on crack and is booted from the church again for disrupting the mass and revealing that Frank is only getting sainted because Charlie donated all of his money to the church. Rickety also explains that Charlie benevolently gave him Frank's remaining crack stash and that Charlie donated all of Frank's money to the church, and that's actually why Frank was becoming a saint.\n\n Charlie only remembers Frank's actions as good because of how high on paint fumes and glue Charlie was. As it turns out, Frank is not actually dead. He faked it to see who would be sad and see who he would leave his money to. This backfires because Charlie has already donated all of the money to the church. Frank thought Charlie would be a safe person to leave his money to because he thought he would be too stupid to get his money out of the bank account."

      "content": "The scene starts with the Gang sitting in Paddy's Pub, looking somber and sad. Charlie is beside himself with sadness, tears streaming down his face as he thinks about all the wonderful things Frank has done for him. Dennis and Dee are sitting across from him, fuming about the fact that Frank left all of his money to Charlie and not them.\n\nAs they sit there, Mac enters the bar, looking worried. \"Guys, I've got some bad news,\" he says. \"I just got a call from the hospital, and Frank's dead.\"\n\nThe Gang is shocked, and Charlie starts to weep uncontrollably. \"Why would Frank leave all of his money to me?\" he says, between sobs. \"I'm just a simple janitor.\"\n\nDennis and Dee's expressions turn from sadness to anger. \"What the hell, Charlie?\" Dennis says. \"Frank left all of his money to you? That doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nSuddenly, the door to the bar opens and Rickety Cricket walks in, looking much better than the last time they saw him. \"Good news, guys,\" he says, beaming. \"I just joined the church, and I heard that Frank is going to be canonized.\"\n\nThe Gang looks at each other in disbelief, and then all look at Charlie, who is still crying. \"What do you mean Frank is going to be a saint?\" Dennis asks.\n\n\"Well, Charlie donated all of Frank's money to the church,\" Rickety explains, \"and because of that, they're making Frank a saint.\"\n\nThe Gang is stunned, and Charlie starts to look confused. \"What are you talking about, Rickety?\" he says. \"I don't remember donating any money to the church.\"\n\n\"That's because you were high on paint fumes and glue when you did it,\" Rickety says, chuckling. \"But don't worry, I'll show you guys the way to the church. We'll go see Frank become a saint.\"\n\nAs they walk to the church, Rickety's demeanor starts to change. He's acting erratic and wild, and when they arrive at the church, he starts to cause a scene. \"This is all a scam!\" he cries. \"Frank's only getting sainted because Charlie donated all of his money to the church!\"\n\nThe priest tries to quiet Rickety, but he continues to shout, revealing that Frank is actually alive and that he faked his death to see who would be sad and who he would leave his money to.\n\nThe scene ends with the Gang standing outside the church, looking stunned and bewildered as Frank walks up to them, laughing. \"Gotcha!\" he says, cackling."

      "content": "INT. Paddy's Pub - DAY\n\nDennis, Dee, and Mac are sitting at the bar, looking solemn. Charlie is pacing back and forth, his eyes red from crying.\n\nDennis: (sighing) I can't believe Frank's gone.\n\nDee: (angrily) And he left all his money to Charlie? What the hell?\n\nMac: (nodding) Yeah, I mean, what the hell is that about?\n\nCharlie stops pacing and turns to the gang, his voice breaking.\n\nCharlie: Frank was always so good to me. He taught me how to play the guitar, he let me sleep on his couch when I had nowhere to go. He was like a father to me.\n\nDennis: (rolling his eyes) Yeah, well, let's not forget about the other things he did.\n\nDee: (nodding) Like the time he defrauded the government for millions of dollars.\n\nMac: (excitedly) And what about the time he tried to sell fake cocaine to school kids?\n\nCharlie: (defensively) That was just a misunderstanding. Frank was always there for me when I needed him.\n\nDennis: (skeptically) Right, because he felt guilty for all the horrible things he did.\n\nCharlie: (tearfully) I don't care. I just want to remember the good times.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CHURCH - DAY\n\nThe gang is sitting in the pews, dressed in their Sunday best, as Rickety Cricket stands at the pulpit.\n\nRickety: (sobbing) Frank Reynolds was a saint. He helped me get sober, he gave me a place to live, he even gave me his crack stash.\n\nDennis: (whispering to Dee) I told you, he's high as a kite.\n\nDee: (whispering back) I don't care, as long as he doesn't ruin this for us.\n\nRickety: (getting louder) And he's only getting sainted because Charlie donated all of his money to the church!\n\nThe congregation starts to murmur as Rickety's behavior becomes more erratic.\n\nRickety: (screaming) And Frank's not even dead! He faked his death to see who would be sad!\n\nThe priest escorts Rickety out of the church, as the congregation stands in shock.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. Paddy's Pub - DAY\n\nFrank walks in, holding a bouquet of flowers.\n\nFrank: (laughing) Sorry I'm late, I was just running a little experiment.\n\nDennis: (outraged) You faked your own death?!\n\nFrank: (smiling) Yeah, I just wanted to see who would be sad and who I would leave my money to.\n\nCharlie: (tearfully) You left it all to me.\n\nFrank: (laughing) Yeah, I thought you'd be too stupid to get it out of the bank.\n\nCharlie: (smiling) Sorry, Frank. I already donated it all to the church.\n\nFrank's smile fades as the realization dawns on him.\n\nFrank: (deflated) What?\n\nDee: (laughing) Looks like you're not as smart as you thought you were, Frank.\n\nThe gang all starts laughing as Frank looks on in disbelief.\n\nTHE END"
