Focusing on the positive benefits of exercise, such as increased energy and improved mood, can be a powerful motivator.\n\nIt's also brilliant that you're leveraging your Monday evening yoga practice as a motivator to stay active during the day. Having a consistent routine can help create a sense of accountability and structure, which can be really helpful in maintaining a regular exercise habit.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself, too. Some days, you might not feel like doing as much, and that's okay. The goal is to make progress, not to be perfect. By incorporating small amounts of physical activity into your daily routine, you'll be more likely to stay motivated and consistent in the long run.\n\nKeep in mind that it's all about finding a balance that works for you. If you have a particularly busy day or aren't feeling well, it's okay to adjust your routine accordingly. The key is to listen to your body and make adjustments as needed.\n\nHow do you plan to incorporate your Monday evening yoga practice into your daily routine? Are there any specific exercises or stretches you're looking to focus on during the day to complement your yoga practice?",
