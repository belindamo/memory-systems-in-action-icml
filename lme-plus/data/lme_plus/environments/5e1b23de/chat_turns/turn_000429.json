I think I'll use a habit-tracking app to monitor my daily activities, including my yoga practice, stretching, and desk exercises. That way, I can see how consistent I've been and make adjustments as needed.\n\nI also like the idea of setting reminders to take deep breaths and stretch throughout the day. I'll definitely set that up on my phone to help me stay on track.\n\nThanks for the suggestions and encouragement! I feel more motivated now to make exercise and mindful movement a regular part of my daily routine.",
