  "content": "Write a scene for an episode of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia where the gang thinks that Frank has died. Be creative and add detail. Frank has left all of his money to Charlie. Charlie is beside himself with sadness. Dennis and Dee are mad because Frank left all his money with Charlie. Charlie reminisces about all the wonderful things that Frank has done. The rest of the Gang, Mac, Dennis, and Dee, bring to light new information that recontextualizes Frank's actions to look horrific, including fraud and crimes and other repulsive behavior. Charlie, unbeknownst to the rest of the gang, donates all of Frank's money to the church (which will only be revealed later in the scene). Rickety Cricket, after having rejoined the church and becoming sober, reveals that the church is making Frank a saint. The gang goes to church for Frank's canonization.\u00a0Rickety Cricket comes to the mass high on crack and is booted from the church again for disrupting the mass and revealing that Frank is only getting sainted because Charlie donated all of his money to the church. Rickety also explains that Charlie benevolently gave him Frank's remaining crack stash and that Charlie donated all of Frank's money to the church, and that's actually why Frank was becoming a saint.\n\n Charlie only remembers Frank's actions as good because of how high on paint fumes and glue Charlie was. As it turns out, Frank is not actually dead. He faked it to see who would be sad and see who he would leave his money to. This backfires because Charlie has already donated all of the money to the church. Frank thought Charlie would be a safe person to leave his money to because he thought he would be too stupid to get his money out of the bank account.",
