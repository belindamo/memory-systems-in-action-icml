It's common to feel anxious or down about these situations, but remember that you're not alone!\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for attending your friend's birthday party and putting yourself out there! That takes a lot of courage, and it's a great step towards building connections.\n\nHere are some thoughts that might help you feel better about social situations and making friends:\n\n1. **It's okay to feel awkward**: It's normal to feel a bit uncomfortable in new social situations, especially if you're not used to them. Remember that everyone else is probably feeling some level of awkwardness too!\n2. **Focus on others**: Instead of worrying about yourself, try to focus on the people around you. Ask them questions, listen to their stories, and show genuine interest. This can help take the spotlight off of you and make you feel more connected.\n3. **Start small**: Don't feel like you need to make a million friends at once. Start with small, manageable interactions, like chatting with one or two people at a party. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually build up to larger groups.\n4. **Find common ground**: Look for things you have in common with others, whether it's a shared interest, a favorite TV show, or a similar sense of humor. This can help you build connections and create a sense of belonging.\n5. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that making friends takes time, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't click with someone right away. Keep putting yourself out there, and eventually, you'll find people who resonate with you.\n6. **Practice self-care**: Take care of yourself before, during, and after social events. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and doing things that make you happy. This can help boost your confidence and energy levels.\n7. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, even if it's just striking up a conversation with a stranger or exchanging numbers with someone new. These tiny accomplishments can add up and help you build momentum.\n\nLastly, remember that everyone has their own struggles and insecurities, even if they don't show it on the surface. You're not alone in feeling awkward or unsure in social situations.\n\nKeep pushing forward, and don't give up! You got this, and with time, patience, and practice, you'll build a strong network of friends and connections.\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you or anything you'd like to add?",
