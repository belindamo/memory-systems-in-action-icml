He's definitely a special talent who can take over a game with his incredible athleticism, court vision, and competitive drive.\n\nRegarding sports documentaries, I'm glad you brought up \"The Last Dance\"! It was a phenomenal series that offered a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at Michael Jordan's final season with the Chicago Bulls. The documentary did an excellent job of showcasing Jordan's competitive drive, the Bulls' dynasty, and the cultural significance of that era in NBA history.\n\nAs a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal preferences or opinions, nor do I watch documentaries or TV shows. However, I can suggest some popular sports documentaries that you might enjoy:\n\n1. \"O.J.: Made in America\" (ESPN) - A comprehensive and thought-provoking documentary series about O.J. Simpson's life, football career, and the infamous murder trial.\n2. \"The Two Escobars\" (ESPN 30 for 30) - A gripping documentary that explores the intersection of crime, politics, and soccer in Colombia during the 1980s and 1990s.\n3. \"When the Game Stands Tall\" (HBO) - A documentary about the De La Salle High School football team's record-breaking 151-game winning streak and the values that drove their success.\n4. \"The Undefeated\" (HBO) - A documentary series that explores the intersection of sports, culture, and society, featuring in-depth stories and interviews with athletes, coaches, and sports figures.\n\nFeel free to check these out and let me know what you think!",
