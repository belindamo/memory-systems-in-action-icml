As a responsible assistant, I'm happy to guide you through the process.\n\n**What are business expenses?**\n\nBusiness expenses are costs incurred while operating a business or performing job-related duties. These expenses can be deducted from your taxable income, reducing your tax liability. Common business expenses include:\n\n* Office supplies and equipment\n* Travel expenses (e.g., transportation, lodging, meals)\n* Professional fees (e.g., consulting, legal, accounting)\n* Education and training expenses\n* Advertising and marketing costs\n* Business use of your home (e.g., home office, utilities)\n\n**How to track business expenses:**\n\n1. **Keep receipts and invoices**: Collect and store receipts, invoices, and bank statements for all business-related expenses. You can use a physical filing system or digitize them using apps like Shoeboxed, Expensify, or Neat.\n2. **Categorize expenses**: Create categories for your business expenses, such as \"Office Supplies,\" \"Travel,\" or \"Professional Fees.\" This will help you organize and total up your expenses.\n3. **Record expenses regularly**: Set aside time each week or month to record your business expenses. Use a spreadsheet, accounting software, or a dedicated app like QuickBooks or Xero.\n4. **Separate personal and business expenses**: Make sure to separate your personal expenses from business expenses. You can use a separate business credit card or bank account to help keep things organized.\n5. **Keep records for 3-7 years**: The IRS typically requires you to keep business expense records for 3-7 years in case of an audit.\n\n**Tips for tracking business expenses:**\n\n* Use a mileage tracking app like MileIQ or TripLog to record business miles driven.\n* Take photos of receipts and store them digitally.\n* Set up a system for tracking recurring expenses, like subscription services or monthly fees.\n* Consider using an accounting software or app that integrates with your bank accounts and credit cards.\n\n**What expenses can you claim on your taxes?**\n\nAs a responsible assistant, I must remind you to consult with a tax professional or the IRS to determine which expenses are eligible for tax deductions. However, some common business expenses that may be claimable on your taxes include:\n\n* Home office expenses (e.g., utilities, internet, furniture)\n* Business use of your car (e.g., mileage, parking, tolls)\n* Travel expenses (e.g., transportation, lodging, meals)\n* Education and training expenses\n* Advertising and marketing costs\n\nRemember to keep accurate and detailed records, as the IRS may request documentation to support your deductions.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with tracking your business expenses!
