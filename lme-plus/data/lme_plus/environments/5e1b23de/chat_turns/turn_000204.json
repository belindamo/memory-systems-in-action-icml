  "content": "Great to hear that you're already doing a version of hide-and-seek with treats! Healthy treats are an essential part of rewarding and motivating Max during training and play. Here are some healthy treat options that are suitable for golden retriever puppies like Max:\n\n1. **Sweet Potato Chews**: Sweet potatoes are a nutrient-rich, easily digestible treat for dogs. You can bake or dehydrate them to make crispy chews.\n2. **Carrots**: Carrots are a low-calorie, crunchy snack that's great for Max's teeth and eyesight. You can serve them raw or steamed.\n3. **Green Beans**: Like carrots, green beans are a low-calorie, nutrient-rich snack that can help support healthy digestion.\n4. **Apple Slices**: Apples are a tasty and healthy treat, but be sure to remove the seeds and core, as they can be toxic to dogs.\n5. **Pumpkin Puree**: Canned pumpkin is a fiber-rich treat that can help support healthy digestion and relieve constipation.\n6. **Frozen Berries**: Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries are all safe for dogs and packed with antioxidants. Be sure to remove any stems or leaves.\n7. **Yogurt Drops**: Plain, unflavored yogurt is a healthy treat that can support Max's digestive health. Look for yogurt drops or make your own by freezing yogurt in an ice cube tray.\n8. **Peanut Butter Filled Kongs**: Peanut butter is a tasty and healthy treat when consumed in moderation. Look for natural, xylitol-free peanut butter and fill Kong toys for a fun and engaging treat.\n9. **Homemade Dog Biscuits**: You can make your own healthy dog biscuits using ingredients like oats, peanut butter, and bananas. Just be sure to follow a recipe that's safe for dogs.\n10. **Air-Dried Liver or Chicken Strips**: These protein-rich treats are made from pure meat and are a great reward for Max.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Always introduce new treats slowly and in small amounts to ensure Max can tolerate them.\n* Choose treats appropriate for Max's age, size, and breed.\n* Avoid giving Max table scraps or high-calorie treats, as they can lead to weight gain and other health issues.\n* Keep treats to a minimum (about 10% of Max's daily calorie intake) to avoid overfeeding.\n\nConsult with your veterinarian if you have any concerns or questions about what treats are suitable for Max. They can provide personalized recommendations based on his individual needs and health status.",
