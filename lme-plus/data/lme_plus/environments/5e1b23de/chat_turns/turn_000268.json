I'm happy to report that several apps I mentioned earlier offer these features. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Plan to Eat:** You can save your own recipes, and it has a large database of recipes that you can search through. The app also allows you to organize your grocery list by aisle, making it easy to shop.\n* **Yummly:** You can save your own recipes, and it has a massive recipe database with over 2 million recipes. Yummly's grocery list feature allows you to organize by aisle, and you can also add custom aisles.\n* **Paprika Recipe Manager:** You can save your own recipes, and it has a built-in recipe database. The app also allows you to organize your grocery list by aisle, making it easy to shop.\n* **Mealime:** You can save your own recipes, and it has a large database of healthy recipes. The app's grocery list feature allows you to organize by aisle, but it's more geared towards online grocery shopping.\n\nAll of these apps offer a good balance of personalized recipe management, recipe discovery, and grocery list organization. However, if I had to recommend one that stands out in terms of recipe discovery and grocery list organization, I'd suggest **Yummly**.\n\nYummly's massive recipe database, along with its advanced filtering and search features, makes it easy to find new recipes based on your dietary preferences, cooking time, and ingredient availability. The app's grocery list feature is also highly customizable, allowing you to organize by aisle, add custom aisles, and even keep track of prices and sales.\n\nThat being said, it's essential to try out a few options to see which one resonates with you the most. You might find that Plan to Eat or Paprika Recipe Manager better suit your needs, or you might discover another app that I haven't mentioned.\n\nWould you like to try out a few of these apps, or would you like more information on Yummly's features and pricing?",
