  "content": "Caucus meetings in the Illinois House of Representatives are typically closed to the public and only open to members of the House who are a part of the respective party caucus. The purpose of these caucus meetings is to allow members to discuss pending legislation, propose strategies for advancing their party's agenda, and coordinate their votes. This kind of discussion is usually considered sensitive and confidential, as positions and strategies may be debated and kept closely guarded. However, some party caucuses may choose to invite non-member guests who can provide special perspectives or insights on particular issues.",
