  "content": "In the Illinois House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House and other leadership positions are determined through a vote among the members of the House. After each general election, a caucus of the House Democratic Party and a separate caucus of the House Republican Party are held. The caucus for each party nominates one of its members for the position of Speaker of the House for the upcoming General Assembly.\n\nThe day after the general election, the House of Representatives holds a session to vote for the Speaker of the House. The requirement is to have a majority of votes from among the entire chamber, not just from within the party. If no candidate receives a majority of votes, the voting for the speaker continues until a candidate receives the required majority.\n\nOnce the Speaker of the House is elected, they select other leaders who will serve as Majority Leader, Majority Whip, Minority Leader, and Minority Whip. These positions are also filled by a vote among the members of their respective political parties within the House.",
