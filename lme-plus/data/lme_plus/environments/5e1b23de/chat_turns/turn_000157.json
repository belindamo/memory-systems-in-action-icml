  "content": "That's really helpful, thank you!  I went to a 3-day photography workshop in a nearby city today where I learned about different techniques and styles of photography. I'm curious about dark frames and bias frames. Can you explain what they are and how they help in image stacking? Also, I've been thinking of getting a new camera lens, do you have any recommendations for a good wide-angle lens for astrophotography?",
