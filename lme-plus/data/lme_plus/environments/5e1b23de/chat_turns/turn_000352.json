  "content": "Sure, here's an example of how the code could look like for the fourth use case:\n```javascript\n// Harvesting simulation function\nfunction simulateHarvest(cropData, weatherData) {\n  // Check crop maturity and weather conditions\n  if (cropData.maturity >= 90 && weatherData.temperature <= 30) {\n    // Harvest the crop\n    cropData.harvested = true;\n    cropData.harvestDate = new Date();\n    // Calculate yield based on crop weight and size\n    cropData.yield = cropData.weight / cropData.size;\n    // Log the harvest information\n    console.log(`Crop ${cropData.id} was harvested on ${cropData.harvestDate} with a yield of ${cropData.yield} kg per square meter.`);\n  } else {\n    // Wait for optimal conditions\n    console.log(`Crop ${cropData.id} is not ready for harvest yet. Waiting for optimal conditions.`);\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this code snippet, the `simulateHarvest()` function takes in two parameters: `cropData` and `weatherData`. `cropData` contains information about the crop being harvested, such as its maturity level, weight, and size. `weatherData` contains information about current weather conditions, such as temperature.\n\nThe function checks whether the crop is ready for harvest based on its maturity level and weather conditions. If the crop is ready, it is harvested, and the yield is calculated based on its weight and size. The function then logs the harvest information to the console.\n\nThis code could be integrated into the AR experience to simulate different harvesting scenarios and help farmers determine the best time to harvest their crops for optimal yield and quality.",
