Here's more information on how it works and what kind of recipes you can expect:\n\n**Recipe Discovery:**\n\nYummly's recipe discovery feature is powered by a massive database of over 2 million recipes, which are sourced from various websites, food bloggers, and cookbooks. The app uses a sophisticated algorithm to understand your cooking preferences, dietary needs, and ingredient availability, and then suggests recipes that fit your profile.\n\nWhen you sign up for Yummly, you'll be asked to fill out a short survey about your cooking preferences, including:\n\n* Dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free)\n* Cooking skills (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced)\n* Cuisine preferences (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Indian)\n* Ingredient preferences (e.g., chicken, seafood, tofu)\n* Cooking time (e.g., quick, 30 minutes, 1 hour)\n\nBased on your input, Yummly will create a personalized recipe feed that showcases recipes tailored to your preferences. You can also search for recipes using keywords, ingredients, or cooking methods, and filter the results by factors like cooking time, difficulty, and nutritional information.\n\n**Recipe Categories:**\n\nYummly's recipe database covers a wide range of categories, including:\n\n* Course-based recipes (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert)\n* Ingredient-based recipes (e.g., chicken, beef, vegetarian, seafood)\n* Cuisine-based recipes (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Indian, Chinese)\n* Dietary-based recipes (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, low-carb)\n* Meal type-based recipes (e.g., slow cooker, one-pot, sheet pan)\n\n**Recipe Features:**\n\nYummly's recipes often include:\n\n* Step-by-step instructions with photos\n* Nutritional information (e.g., calories, macronutrients, allergen warnings)\n* Cooking time and difficulty level\n* User ratings and reviews\n* Options for saving, printing, or sharing recipes\n\n**Pro Features:**\n\nYummly offers a Pro version with additional features, including:\n\n* Offline access to recipes\n* Ad-free browsing\n* Advanced filtering and sorting options\n* Meal planning and grocery list integration\n* Nutrition analysis and macro tracking\n\nThe Pro version is available as a subscription, with options for monthly or annual payments.\n\nNow that you know more about Yummly's recipe discovery features, you might be excited to try it out!
