  "content": "There have been some proposals to establish an independent body to oversee the selection process for leadership positions within the Illinois House of Representatives, but none have been successfully implemented.\n\nIn 2017, the Illinois House passed a proposal to create a task force to study the possibility of creating an independent panel to oversee the selection process for leadership positions. However, the legislation stalled in the Senate.\n\nAnother proposal, which was brought forward by a group of reform-minded legislators in 2018, would have created an independent commission to oversee the selection process for leadership positions in the House. However, the proposal did not make it to a floor vote, and the idea was not pursued further.\n\nIt is worth noting that similar efforts to establish independent bodies to oversee legislative leadership selection have been implemented in other states. For example, in Pennsylvania, a 2018 law established an independent redistricting commission to oversee the redistricting process. Some advocates have argued that a similar model could be used to establish an independent commission to oversee the selection process for legislative leadership positions in Illinois. However, as of now, no such legislation has been enacted in Illinois.",
