  "content": "Yes, there have been some notable changes in Hollywood movies and TV shows since the #MeToo movement started. \n\nOne of the most significant changes has been a shift towards more diverse representation on screen. The movement has highlighted the need for increased representation and opportunities for marginalized groups, including women and people of color. This has led to more diverse casting choices, with more complex and nuanced characterizations.\n\nThere has also been a push for more responsible storytelling, with a focus on portraying issues related to sexual harassment and abuse in a realistic and empathetic way. Some TV shows have included plotlines or episodes that address these issues, and filmmakers have emphasized the importance of portraying these topics sensitively, without sensationalizing or trivializing them.\n\nIn addition, there have been changes in the way that movies and TV shows are produced behind the scenes. Many studios and production companies have implemented new policies and procedures to prevent and address sexual harassment and abuse on set. There is also a greater focus on ensuring that women and other underrepresented groups have leadership positions both in front of and behind the camera.",
