It's okay to stumble sometimes, and it's all part of the learning process.\n\nFocusing on others and finding common ground can really help take the pressure off of yourself and make social interactions feel more enjoyable. And don't forget to celebrate those small wins, even if it's just a tiny step out of your comfort zone.\n\nIf you ever need any more advice or just want to chat, I'm here for you. Good luck with your social adventures, and I hope you have a blast building connections with others!\n\nOne last thing: be kind to yourself and don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go exactly as planned. You're doing your best, and that's something to be proud of!",
