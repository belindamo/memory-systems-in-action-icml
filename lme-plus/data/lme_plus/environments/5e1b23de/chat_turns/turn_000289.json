Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Business purpose**: Are you teaching the cooking class as part of your job or business? If so, the knives might be a legitimate business expense.\n2. **Direct connection to your work**: Are the knives specifically needed for the cooking class, and will they be used exclusively for that purpose? If yes, that strengthens the case for a business expense.\n3. **Personal use**: Will you also use the knives for personal cooking or other non-business purposes? If so, you might need to allocate the expense between business and personal use.\n\nTo qualify as a business expense, the knives should be used primarily for business purposes, and you should be able to demonstrate a clear connection between the expense and your work.\n\nHere are some tips to help you determine if the kitchen knives are a business expense:\n\n* Keep a record of the purchase, including the date, amount, and description of the item.\n* Document the business purpose of the purchase, such as a note or email explaining why you needed the knives for the cooking class.\n* Consider keeping a log or journal of how you use the knives, including the dates and times you use them for business purposes.\n* If you're unsure, consult with a tax professional or accountant to determine the best approach for your specific situation.\n\nRemember, it's essential to keep accurate and detailed records to support your business expenses in case of an audit or tax inquiry.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have any other questions about this expense or others related to your work?",
