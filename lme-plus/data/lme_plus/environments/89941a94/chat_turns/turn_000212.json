  "content": "Roasted vegetables are a fantastic way to add some contrast in texture and flavor to the dish. Both Brussels sprouts and broccoli would work well, but I think Brussels sprouts might be a better match. Here's why:\n\n* Brussels sprouts have a slightly bitter flavor profile that will cut through the richness of the coffee-based sauce and the beef.\n* The crispy, caramelized exterior of roasted Brussels sprouts will provide a nice textural contrast to the tender beef and pasta.\n* Brussels sprouts are a natural pairing with beef, and their earthy flavor will complement the coffee and Italian seasoning in the sauce.\n\nThat being said, broccoli can also work well, especially if you're looking for a milder flavor. If you do choose broccoli, try to roast it with some garlic, lemon, and red pepper flakes to give it a bit more depth of flavor.\n\nOther vegetable options that might pair well with this dish include:\n\n* Roasted carrots: Sweet and earthy, carrots will add a pop of color and flavor to the dish.\n* Saut\u00e9ed spinach: Quickly cooked with garlic and lemon, spinach will add a burst of nutrients and flavor to the dish.\n* Roasted sweet potatoes: If you want to add some heft to the dish, roasted sweet potatoes can provide a delicious and filling side.\n\nRemember, the key is to keep the vegetable preparation simple and let the natural flavors shine through. You want the vegetables to complement the dish, not overpower it.\n\nDo you have any questions about roasting Brussels sprouts or preparing the vegetables in general?",
