Whether to stock up or buy what you need at the time depends on several factors. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros of stocking up:**\n\n1. **Save money**: If you use a particular product regularly, buying in bulk can help you save money in the long run, especially if it's a buy one get one free deal.\n2. **Avoid price increases**: If you know the product is going to be discontinued or the price is about to increase, stocking up can be a good idea.\n3. **Convenience**: Having a stash of your favorite products can be convenient, especially if you use them frequently.\n\n**Cons of stocking up:**\n\n1. **Expiration dates**: Skincare products do have expiration dates, and stockpiling can lead to expired products going to waste.\n2. **Storage space**: If you live in a small space, storing a large quantity of products can be a challenge.\n3. **Product changes**: Your skin type or concerns might change over time, making the products you stockpiled no longer suitable for your needs.\n4. **New products**: New products or formulations might be released, making the ones you stockpiled outdated.\n\n**When to stock up:**\n\n1. **If you use it regularly**: If you use a product daily or weekly, stocking up can be a good idea, especially if it's a staple product.\n2. **If it's a non-perishable product**: Products like facial cleansers, toners, or exfoliants tend to have a longer shelf life, making them good candidates for stocking up.\n3. **If you have a backup plan**: If you have a plan to use the products before they expire or can donate them to friends or family, stocking up might be a good option.\n\nIn your case, since it's a buy one get one free deal on facial moisturizers, it might be a good idea to stock up if:\n\n* You use the product regularly and know you'll need it in the near future.\n* You have enough storage space and can keep the products fresh.\n* You're confident the product won't expire soon or go bad before you can use it.\n\nHowever, if you're unsure about your skin type or concerns changing, or if you don't have enough storage space, it might be better to buy what you need at the time.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you going to stock up on the facial moisturizers or play it safe and buy what you need for now?",
