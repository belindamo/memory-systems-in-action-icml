Here are some tips to help you pair BBQ sauce with grilled vegetables:\n\n1. **Choose a BBQ sauce that complements the veggie**: Different BBQ sauces have unique flavor profiles, so choose one that complements the natural flavors of the vegetable. For example, a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce pairs well with sweet vegetables like bell peppers and zucchini, while a smoky BBQ sauce pairs well with earthy vegetables like eggplant and portobello mushrooms.\n2. **Consider the cooking method**: If you're grilling vegetables with a high water content, like zucchini or bell peppers, a thicker BBQ sauce can help them hold their shape and prevent them from becoming too soggy. If you're grilling vegetables with a lower water content, like eggplant or portobello mushrooms, a thinner BBQ sauce can help them absorb more flavor.\n3. **Brush or glaze at the right time**: Brush or glaze your grilled vegetables with BBQ sauce during the last few minutes of cooking, so the sauce can caramelize and stick to the vegetable. If you brush them too early, the sauce can burn or become too sweet.\n4. **Balance sweet and tangy**: A good BBQ sauce should balance sweet and tangy flavors. If your sauce is too sweet, it can overpower the natural flavors of the vegetable. If it's too tangy, it can be overwhelming. Look for a sauce with a balance of sweet and tangy flavors.\n5. **Experiment with different BBQ sauce styles**: There are many different styles of BBQ sauce, from Kansas City-style to Carolina-style to Alabama-style. Experiment with different styles to find the one that pairs best with your grilled vegetables.\n6. **Don't overdo it**: Remember that grilled vegetables are the star of the show. Don't overpower them with too much BBQ sauce. A light glaze or brush can add flavor without overwhelming the natural flavors of the vegetable.\n7. **Pair with other flavors**: BBQ sauce can pair well with other flavors, like smoky wood chips, herbs, and spices. Experiment with different combinations to find the perfect flavor profile for your grilled vegetables.\n\nSome popular BBQ sauce and grilled vegetable pairings include:\n\n* Sweet and tangy BBQ sauce with grilled bell peppers and zucchini\n* Smoky BBQ sauce with grilled eggplant and portobello mushrooms\n* Spicy BBQ sauce with grilled jalape\u00f1os and sweet potatoes\n* Honey-based BBQ sauce with grilled carrots and Brussels sprouts\n\nRemember, the key to pairing BBQ sauce with grilled vegetables is to find a balance of flavors and textures. Experiment with different BBQ sauces and grilled vegetables to find the perfect combination for your taste buds!",
