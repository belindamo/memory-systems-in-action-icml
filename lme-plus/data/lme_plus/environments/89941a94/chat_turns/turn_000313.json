  "content": "Anno Domini (AD) is a Latin term that means \"in the year of the Lord.\" It is used to label years in the Gregorian calendar, which is based on the traditionally recognized year of the birth of Jesus Christ. The year 1 AD is the year that Jesus was believed to have been born, and each subsequent year is counted as one year after that. The notation AD is used to indicate a year that is based on this counting system, while BC (Before Christ) is used to indicate a year before the birth of Jesus. The use of AD and BC is sometimes replaced by the more neutral notation CE (Common Era) and BCE (Before Common Era) to avoid religious connotations.",
