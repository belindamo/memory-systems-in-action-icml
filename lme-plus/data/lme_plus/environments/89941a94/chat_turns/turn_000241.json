For digital coupons, I just leave them in my email inbox or save them to my phone's notes app. I like the idea of using a binder or a digital tool to organize them better. I'll definitely consider trying out some of the methods you suggested. By the way, do you have any tips on how to maximize savings when buying pasta products? I love pasta and I have a 10% off coupon for it from my favorite grocery store.",
