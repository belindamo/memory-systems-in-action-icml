  "content": "Suntory Toki is a fantastic whiskey for a Tokyo Highball, and it will pair beautifully with the right sparkling water.\n\nWhen it comes to sparkling water, you can definitely use a regular soda water, but I would recommend using a premium or artisanal sparkling water to elevate the flavor and experience of the cocktail. Here are a few options you might consider:\n\n1. **San Pellegrino**: This is a popular and widely available sparkling water that's known for its crisp, clean flavor and fine bubbles. It's a great choice for a Tokyo Highball, and it will complement the Suntory Toki nicely.\n2. **Perrier**: This is another well-known sparkling water that's popular among bartenders and cocktail enthusiasts. It has a slightly sweeter and more delicate flavor than San Pellegrino, which can work well with the subtle flavors of the Suntory Toki.\n3. **Gerolsteiner**: This is a German sparkling water that's known for its high mineral content and crisp, refreshing flavor. It's a great choice if you want a more robust and lively sparkling water that will stand up to the whiskey.\n4. **Fiji Water**: This is a premium sparkling water that's sourced from the Fiji Islands. It has a smooth, silky texture and a subtle flavor that won't overpower the whiskey.\n5. **Voss**: This is a premium sparkling water that's known for its crisp, clean flavor and high-quality ingredients. It's a great choice if you want a premium sparkling water that will elevate the flavor and experience of the cocktail.\n\nUltimately, the choice of sparkling water will depend on your personal taste preferences and the flavor profile you're aiming for. If you want a more subtle and refreshing sparkling water, San Pellegrino or Perrier might be a good choice. If you want a more robust and lively sparkling water, Gerolsteiner or Voss might be a better option.\n\nIn terms of ratio, a good starting point for a Tokyo Highball is to use 2 oz of Suntory Toki and 4-6 oz of sparkling water. You can adjust the ratio to your taste, but this will give you a good balance of flavors and a refreshing, easy-drinking cocktail.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'd love to hear how your Tokyo Highball turns out!",
