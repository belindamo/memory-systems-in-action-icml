  "content": "Yes, I did find that some of the films challenged my expectations of the superhero genre, and it was refreshing to see fresh perspectives on these themes. I think that's one of the benefits of attending independent film festivals like Comic-Con - you get to see unique and innovative storytelling that might not be found in more mainstream superhero films.\n\nSpeaking of which, I've been thinking about attending more film festivals this year. I've heard great things about the Outfest Los Angeles LGBTQ+ Film Festival, and I'm considering volunteering there to get a behind-the-scenes look. Have you heard anything about that festival or know anyone who's attended?",
