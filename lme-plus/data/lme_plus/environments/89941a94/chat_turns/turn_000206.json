  "content": "Coffee and pasta may seem like an unusual pairing, but trust me, it can be a game-changer. Italian seasoning is a great starting point, and I've got some ideas that might just become your new favorite dishes:\n\n**Coffee-Rubbed Italian Sausage Pasta**\n\n* Use Italian sausage instead of traditional sausage and add a coffee rub made with espresso powder, Italian seasoning, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes. Serve with a light tomato sauce and your favorite pasta shape.\n\n**Coffee-Braised Beef Ragu**\n\n* Braise beef short ribs or chuck roast in a rich coffee-based sauce with onions, carrots, celery, and Italian seasoning. Serve with pappardelle or rigatoni and top with grated Parmesan cheese.\n\n**Coffee-Glazed Pork Belly Pappardelle**\n\n* Slow-cook pork belly with a mixture of coffee, Italian seasoning, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Shred the pork and toss it with pappardelle, cherry tomatoes, and a sprinkle of parsley.\n\n**Espresso-Spiced Italian Meatballs**\n\n* Add espresso powder to your meatball mixture for a depth of flavor. Serve with a tangy tomato sauce and spaghetti or bucatini.\n\n**Coffee-Roasted Vegetable Pasta**\n\n* Roast a medley of vegetables (such as Brussels sprouts, carrots, and red bell peppers) with olive oil, Italian seasoning, and a sprinkle of espresso powder. Toss with pasta, garlic, and grated Parmesan cheese.\n\nThese recipes will give you a great starting point to experiment with coffee and pasta. Remember to adjust the amount of coffee according to your taste, as it can be quite strong. Buon appetito!\n\nWhich one of these recipes resonates with you the most, or do you have any other pasta favorites you'd like to incorporate coffee into?",
