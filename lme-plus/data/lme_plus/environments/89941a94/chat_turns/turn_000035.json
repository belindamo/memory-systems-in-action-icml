  "content": "a. The NOMA (Non-Overlapping Magisteria) thesis proposes that the fields of science and religion both contribute something to humanity, but they don't overlap. According to this view, science deals with empirical facts and the natural world, while religion deals with moral and spiritual questions. Gould, who proposed this idea, believed that the two domains of knowledge were non-overlapping and therefore could not conflict with each other. He saw this as a way of reconciling the perceived conflict between science and religion, allowing each to address different questions without interfering with the other.",
