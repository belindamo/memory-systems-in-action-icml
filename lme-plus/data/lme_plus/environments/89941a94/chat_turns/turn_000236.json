However, I'd recommend focusing on getting your finances in order before making such a significant investment.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Debt:** You still have a significant amount of debt, including the credit card debt and student loan. It's essential to prioritize paying those off before taking on more debt, like a mortgage.\n2. **Emergency fund:** You mentioned building an emergency fund, but you might not have a sufficient cushion yet. Aim to save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses before investing in real estate.\n3. **Financial stability:** Make sure you have a stable income, a solid budget, and a clear understanding of your financial situation before committing to a mortgage or real estate investment.\n\nThat being said, if you're interested in real estate, you can start learning about the process, exploring different options, and preparing yourself for the future. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Research:** Learn about the real estate market, different types of properties, and the associated costs (e.g., maintenance, taxes, insurance).\n2. **Credit score:** Work on improving your credit score, as it will impact your ability to secure a good mortgage rate.\n3. **Savings:** Continue building your emergency fund and saving for a down payment.\n4. **Long-term goals:** Think about your long-term goals and what you want to achieve with real estate investing. Are you looking for rental income, appreciation, or a primary residence?\n\nIt's essential to prioritize your financial foundation before diving into real estate. Focus on paying off your debt, building an emergency fund, and improving your overall financial stability. Once you've achieved these milestones, you'll be better equipped to make informed decisions about investing in real estate.\n\nRemember, it's not about being 32 and \"officially\" in your early thirties; it's about being financially prepared for the responsibilities that come with homeownership or real estate investing.",
