  "content": "I think Italian would be a great choice. I've been to a few Italian restaurants in town recently and I've been impressed by the variety of options. Plus, I've been experimenting with Italian recipes in my own kitchen, so I feel like I have a good understanding of the cuisine. Do you have any tips on how to structure the video? Should I start with an intro, then visit each restaurant, and finally wrap up with a conclusion?",
