  "content": "Intelligentsia Coffee at 53 E Randolph St has a modern and spacious cafe with a variety of seating options. While it can get busy during peak hours, they usually have some quiet areas where you can sit and work during your break.\n\nHere's what you can expect:\n\n1. **Seating Area**: The cafe has a large seating area with a mix of tables, chairs, and benches. You can grab a seat at a table or sit at the bar if you prefer.\n2. **Quiet Corner**: There's a quieter corner area with a few tables and chairs that's a bit more secluded from the main seating area. This might be a good spot to catch up on some work or respond to emails.\n3. **Window Seating**: If you prefer natural light, you can grab a seat by the window and enjoy the views of downtown Chicago while you work.\n\nKeep in mind that Intelligentsia is a popular spot, and it can get busy during peak hours. If you're looking for a quiet spot to work, you might want to try visiting during off-peak hours (usually between 10 am and 11 am or after 2 pm).\n\nWhen you visit, feel free to ask the barista if there's a quiet area available, and they can direct you to the best spot.\n\nNow, go enjoy your coffee and break!",
