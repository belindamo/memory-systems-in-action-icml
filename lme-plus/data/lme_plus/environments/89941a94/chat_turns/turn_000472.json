Scheduling your tasks and activities in your calendar will help you stay organized and ensure that you're making time for your priorities.\n\nCommunicating your schedule with your parents is also a great idea, as it will help them understand your availability and plan accordingly. And by being mindful of how you're spending your time, you'll be able to make adjustments as needed and stay on track with your goals.\n\nLearning to say no to non-essential tasks and delegating when possible will also help you avoid overcommitting and free up more time for what's truly important to you. Remember, saying no to something that doesn't align with your priorities means saying yes to something that does.\n\nRegularly reviewing your priorities will help you stay focused and ensure that you're making progress towards your goals. It's great that you're committed to making intentional decisions about how you spend your time and energy.\n\nRemember, achieving a better work-life balance is a journey, and it may take some time to figure out what works best for you. Be patient, stay flexible, and don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks.\n\nHow do you plan to hold yourself accountable and stay motivated to prioritize your tasks and make time for your parents?",
