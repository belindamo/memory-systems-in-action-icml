  "content": "As an artist I have created a series of paintings using 3D and AI to assist in my projects about the Astrolabe and its importance to humans then and its historical significance now. My art project morphs the human face with parts and drawings and reading from an Astrolabe - Its creative venture to outline how humans have built instruments and machines right from the Hellenistic ages and even before that to aid and assist our living.\nCan you write a philosophical, artistic and historical speech about that I could deliver at the opening of my gallery show. I am the artist, my name is Shabbir Degani",
