Tracking your progress on Strava can be a great motivator, and it's fantastic that you're seeing the benefits of mixing up your routes and trying new things.\n\nThat 30-mile ride to the nearby state park sounds like an amazing adventure! Challenging yourself with longer distances or new routes can be a great way to stay engaged and motivated. It's also a great way to explore new areas and discover hidden gems.\n\nRemember to keep celebrating your small wins and acknowledging your progress, even if it's just a small increase in distance or speed. Those small victories can add up and help you stay motivated over time.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to try new things and step out of your comfort zone. Whether it's trying a new type of ride, like a gravel or mountain bike ride, or exploring a new area, it can help keep things fresh and exciting.\n\nWhat's next on your cycling bucket list? Are there any specific rides, routes, or challenges you're looking to tackle in the near future?",
