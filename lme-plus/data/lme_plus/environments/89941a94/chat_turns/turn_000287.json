  "content": "Yes, remembering to use these breathing techniques during a busy workday can be a challenge! Here are some suggestions that may help you remember to use them:\n\n1. Set Reminders: You can use your phone or computer to set reminders throughout the day to take a few minutes to practice your breathing techniques. You can also use sticky notes on your computer or desk as reminders. 2. Make It a Habit: Try to make breathing exercises a habit by setting aside specific times during the day when you'll do them, like first thing in the morning or during lunch break. The more you repeat the practice, the more automatic it will become. 3. Use Triggers: Associate your breathing exercises with a trigger like getting up from your desk or answering a phone call. Whenever the trigger occurs, take a moment to practice your breathing exercise. 4. Find a Buddy: Find a co-worker who\u2019s also interested in trying these techniques and create a reminder system for each other. Remember, it's important to take care of yourself during a busy day at work. Practicing these breathing techniques can help you stay calm and focused, and ultimately be more productive.",
