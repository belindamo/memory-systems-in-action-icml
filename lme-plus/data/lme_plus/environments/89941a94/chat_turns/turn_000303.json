  "content": "An astrolabe is an ancient astronomical instrument used for solving problems related to time and the position of the stars. It consists of a flat disk or plate with a rotating overlay, called the rete, that has pointers for the prominent stars. The user could use the astrolabe to determine the time, the altitude of the sun or stars, and solve other astronomical problems. Astrolabes were widely used in the medieval Islamic world and in Europe during the Renaissance as an all-purpose calculating device.",
