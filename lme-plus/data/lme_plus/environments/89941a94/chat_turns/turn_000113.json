I've heard that the festival often has some amazing surprise screenings or last-minute additions, so I want to stay flexible and open to new experiences.\n\nOne event that I'm particularly excited about is the festival's opening night gala, which features a screening of a highly anticipated LGBTQ+ film. I've heard great things about the film, and I'm looking forward to seeing it on the big screen with a live audience.\n\nI'm also interested in attending some of the festival's panels and workshops, which focus on topics like LGBTQ+ representation in media, queer storytelling, and the industry's role in promoting diversity and inclusion. These events often feature industry professionals and thought leaders, and I think they'll be a great way to learn and grow as a film enthusiast.\n\nOf course, I'll also make sure to explore the festival's program and see what other films, events,",
