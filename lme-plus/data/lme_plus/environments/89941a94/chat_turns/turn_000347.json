Here are some tips on how to pair smoked veggies with spicy sides like jalapeno cornbread:\n\n1. **Balance heat levels**: When pairing smoked veggies with spicy sides, make sure the heat levels are balanced. If your cornbread is very spicy, you may want to opt for milder smoked veggies like asparagus or bell peppers. If your smoked veggies are more robust, like smoky eggplant or mushrooms, you can handle a spicier side dish.\n2. **Complement flavors**: Consider the flavor profiles of both your smoked veggies and spicy sides. In your case, the sweetness of the applewood-smoked asparagus pairs nicely with the heat and savory flavor of the jalapeno cornbread. Look for complementary flavors like sweet and heat, smoky and spicy, or earthy and tangy.\n3. **Texture contrast**: Mixing textures can add interest to your dish. Crunchy, smoky veggies like Brussels sprouts or carrots can provide a nice contrast to the soft, crumbly texture of cornbread.\n4. **Cooling elements**: If your spicy side is very intense, consider adding a cooling element to the dish, like a dollop of sour cream or a sprinkle of fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley. This can help balance the heat and refresh the palate.\n5. **Experiment with spice levels**: Don't be afraid to adjust the spice level of your sides to match your smoked veggies. If you're serving a milder smoked veggie, you may want to add more heat to your side dish. If you're serving a bolder smoked veggie, you may want to tone down the spice.\n6. **Consider the type of pepper**: Different types of peppers have distinct flavor profiles and heat levels. Jalapenos are relatively mild, while habaneros or ghost peppers are much hotter. Choose a pepper that complements the flavor of your smoked veggies and the overall dish.\n\nSome other spicy side dish ideas that might pair well with smoked veggies include:\n\n* Spicy roasted sweet potatoes with harissa and cilantro\n* Jalapeno popper-inspired deviled eggs with smoked paprika\n* Chipotle-spiced black beans with crispy smoked onions\n* Cayenne-spiced corn on the cob with smoked cheddar cheese\n\nRemember, the key is to balance flavors, textures, and heat levels to create a harmonious and delicious dish. Happy experimenting!",
