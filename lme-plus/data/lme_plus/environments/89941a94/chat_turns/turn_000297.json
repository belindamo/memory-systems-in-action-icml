  "content": "The one-item minimum is a common practice in many comedy clubs and venues, including The Comedy Clubhouse. It's a way for the venue to ensure that they're making some revenue from each customer, since they're not charging a cover charge.\n\n**The Deal:**\n\n* The one-item minimum typically means you need to purchase at least one item from the menu, which can be a drink, food, or even a snack.\n* The item can be as inexpensive as a soda or a bag of chips, but it's usually around $5-$10.\n* Some venues might have a specific menu item that counts towards the minimum, while others might let you choose anything from the menu.\n\n**Is it a Hard Rule?**\n\n* While the one-item minimum is a rule, it's not always strictly enforced. If you're really broke, you can try talking to the staff or the host.\n* Be honest and explain your situation. They might be willing to work with you or offer an alternative, like buying a ticket to a future show.\n* However, don't assume you can get out of it without trying to contribute something. Venues rely on these sales to stay in business.\n\n**Tips for the Broke Comedian:**\n\n* If you're really struggling, consider carpooling or arriving early to grab a cheap item during happy hour (if they have one).\n* Look for venues that offer free or discounted items for comedians performing that night.\n* Be respectful and considerate of the venue and staff. If you can't afford the minimum, offer to help with promotion or volunteer in exchange for a waived minimum.\n\nRemember, the one-item minimum is a way for the venue to support themselves and continue hosting comedy events. If you're a regular performer, it's a small price to pay for the opportunity to hone your craft and get stage time.",
