  "content": "Pappardelle is an excellent choice! The wide, flat noodles will hold onto the rich and savory coffee-based sauce perfectly. The rough texture of pappardelle will also help to trap the flavors of the sauce, ensuring every bite is coated in that delicious coffee-infused goodness.\n\nPappardelle is a traditional Italian pasta shape that originates from Tuscany, which makes it a great match for the Italian-inspired flavors in the coffee-based sauce. The wide noodles will also allow you to enjoy the tender, fall-apart beef in big, satisfying bites.\n\nIf you want to take it up a notch, consider adding some saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, such as cremini or shiitake, to the dish. The earthy flavor of the mushrooms will complement the coffee and beef beautifully, creating a hearty and satisfying winter-inspired pasta dish.\n\nOther pasta shapes that could work well with this sauce include:\n\n* Tagliatelle: Similar to pappardelle, but a bit narrower, tagliatelle will still hold onto the sauce nicely.\n* Rigatoni: A tubular pasta shape that will trap the sauce inside, ensuring every bite is flavorful.\n* Fettuccine: A flat, wide noodle made from egg and flour, fettuccine will add a richness to the dish and pair nicely with the coffee flavors.\n\nUltimately, the choice of pasta shape is up to personal preference. But if you're looking for a traditional Italian pairing, pappardelle is an excellent choice.\n\nAre you planning on serving the dish with any additional toppings or sides, or do you have any questions about cooking the pappardelle to perfection?",
