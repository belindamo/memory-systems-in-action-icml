  "content": "Happy belated birthday! However, I have to correct you - you're not quite in your mid-thirties just yet. You're still in your early thirties, but that's okay! \n\nNow, let's get to the important stuff - financial planning! I'd be happy to help you with that. To give you personalized advice, could you please share some more information about your current financial situation? Please provide the following details:\n\n1. Your income: How much do you earn per month, and is it a fixed salary or variable?\n2. Fixed expenses: What are your regular monthly expenses, such as rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, minimum debt payments, and any other necessary expenses?\n3. Debt: Do you have any outstanding debts, including credit cards, student loans, personal loans, or a mortgage? If so, what are the balances and interest rates?\n4. Savings goals: What are you trying to save for in the next few months? Is it a specific goal, like a emergency fund, a big purchase, or a long-term goal like retirement?\n5. Current savings: How much do you have in savings and emergency funds right now?\n6. Any other financial obligations: Do you have any other financial commitments, such as alimony, child support, or regular payments to family members?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your financial situation, I can offer more tailored advice on creating a budget and achieving your financial goals.",
