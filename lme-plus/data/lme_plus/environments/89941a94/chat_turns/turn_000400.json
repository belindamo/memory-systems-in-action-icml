  "content": "Without specific information on the cost of individual components and the quantities required, it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of the total cost of this project in New Zealand dollars (NZD). However, here are some rough estimates based on typical prices of components:\n\n1. Treadmill motor: NZD 200-500\n2. Microcontroller: NZD 20-50\n3. H-bridge driver: NZD 20-50\n4. AC-DC converter: NZD 30-80\n5. Temperature sensor: NZD 5-10\n6. Current sensor: NZD 10-20\n7. LCD display: NZD 10-20\n8. Potentiometer: NZD 5-10\n9. Switches and buttons: NZD 5-10\n10. Miscellaneous components (resistors, capacitors, etc.): NZD 20-50\n\nOverall, the estimated cost of this project could range from NZD 335 to 830, depending on the specific components chosen and their quantities. These estimates do not include the cost of any tools or equipment that may be needed for assembly and testing.",
