World-building and magic systems are crucial, but if your characters aren't well-rounded, your story will suffer.\n\nTo make your characters more relatable and believable, try these tips:\n\n1. **Give them relatable motivations**: What drives your characters? What do they want to achieve, and why? Make sure their motivations are rooted in their backstory, personality, and values.\n2. **Make them multi-dimensional**: Characters should have conflicting traits, flaws, and contradictions. This will make them more realistic and interesting. For example, a brave warrior might also be afraid of heights or have a soft spot for children.\n3. **Create nuanced relationships**: Characters don't exist in a vacuum. Develop relationships between them that are complex, nuanced, and multi-layered. This will help you understand how they interact with each other and the world around them.\n4. **Show their emotional range**: Characters should experience a range of emotions, not just happy or sad. Show their fears, anxieties, joys, and triumphs. This will help readers connect with them on a deeper level.\n5. **Make them active, not passive**: Characters should drive the plot forward, making choices and taking actions that have consequences. Avoid making them too reactive or passive, as this can lead to a lack of agency and engagement.\n6. **Give them distinct voices**: Each character should have a unique voice, including their thoughts, dialogue, and actions. This will help readers distinguish between them and make them more relatable.\n7. **Explore their inner lives**: What do your characters think about when they're alone? What are their inner struggles, desires, and fears? Exploring their inner lives will help you understand their motivations and behaviors.\n8. **Be consistent**: Consistency is key to creating believable characters. Stay true to their personality, traits, and motivations throughout the story.\n9. **Make them grow and change**: Characters should evolve over the course of the story, learning from their experiences and growing as individuals. This will make their journey more satisfying and engaging.\n10. **Write character-centric scenes**: Write scenes that focus on character development, such as introspective moments, relationships, and emotional struggles. This will help you delve deeper into their psyches and create more nuanced characters.\n\nTo get started, try writing character-centric scenes or exercises that focus on your characters' backstories, motivations, and relationships. This will help you develop a deeper understanding of who they are and how they fit into your world.\n\nRemember, character development is an ongoing process. The more you write and explore your characters, the more they'll come to life and drive your story forward.",
