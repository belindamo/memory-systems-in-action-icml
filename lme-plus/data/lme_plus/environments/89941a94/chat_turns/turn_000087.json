  "content": "Yes, the rise of digital technology and streaming platforms has led to music becoming more disposable and transient in nature. With the ability to quickly skip to the next song on a playlist or streaming service, listeners may not be giving songs a chance to fully resonate with them.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that future classic songs and artists will be harder to come by. While the way that we consume music has certainly changed, there will always be artists and songs that break through and create a lasting impact on listeners.\n\nFurthermore, classic songs and artists are often classics because they have stood the test of time and continue to resonate with listeners across generations. They are songs that capture a moment in history or reflect universal themes that are relatable to listeners regardless of the era. In this sense, classic songs and artists are created through a combination of talent, cultural relevance, and timeless appeal.\n\nSo while the rise of digital technology and streaming has changed the way we consume music, it does not necessarily mean that future classic songs and artists will be harder to come by. Rather, it means that artists and songs may need to be even more innovative, charismatic and musical to catch the attention of a listener who is bombarded with music apps and technology.",
