  "content": "Intelligentsia Coffee is indeed famous for their cold brew, and it's a popular choice among coffee fans.\n\nYes, Intelligentsia offers bottled cold brew that you can grab and go! They have a few options available:\n\n1. **Ready-to-Drink Cold Brew**: This is a pre-bottled, cold-brewed coffee that's ready to drink straight from the fridge. It's available in 12oz bottles and is perfect for a quick pick-me-up.\n2. **Cold Brew Concentrate**: If you want to customize your cold brew to your taste, you can grab a bottle of their cold brew concentrate. This is a stronger, more concentrated version of their cold brew that you can mix with water or milk to your liking.\n\nBoth options are available in their cafes, including the one at 53 E Randolph St near your office. You can grab a bottle and go, or enjoy it in their cafe if you have a bit more time.\n\nKeep in mind that they might have limited quantities of bottled cold brew available, especially during peak hours. If you're set on trying their cold brew, it's a good idea to call ahead or check their social media to confirm availability.\n\nEnjoy your Intelligentsia cold brew, and I hope it hits the spot!",
