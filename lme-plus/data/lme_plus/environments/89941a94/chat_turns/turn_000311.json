  "content": "BCE stands for Before Common Era. It is a notation used to indicate a year in the Gregorian calendar that is based on the traditional counting of years from the birth of Jesus Christ, but with no reference to the religion. BCE is used as an alternative to BC (Before Christ) to avoid religious connotations. It is part of a broader system of dating that also includes CE (Common Era), which is equivalent to AD (Anno Domini). This system allows for a secular and culturally neutral way of dating events in history.",
