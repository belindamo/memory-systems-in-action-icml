  "content": "I've been experimenting with different types of wood chips for smoking, and I recently picked up some applewood chips that added a nice fruity flavor to the asparagus I grilled a week ago. I've also been trying to perfect my BBQ sauce recipe, and I recently tried out a new recipe I found online that turned out amazing - the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. I'm thinking of trying out a new vegetable to grill this weekend, and I was wondering if you have any recommendations for grilling okra? I've never grilled okra before, but I've heard it can be a bit tricky to get right.",
