  "content": "There is no commonly used Latin phrase for BC, as BC simply means \"Before Christ.\" The commonly used Latin phrase for AD is \"Anno Domini,\" which means \"in the year of the Lord.\" These terms were first used by the monk Dionysius Exiguus in the 6th century when he created a new system for counting the years based on the birth of Jesus Christ. The use of AD and BC to label years has since become widely accepted and is still used today, although some people prefer to use the more neutral CE (Common Era) and BCE (Before Common Era) to avoid religious connotations.",
