Here it is again:\n\n\"Create a photograph of a refreshing cocktail made with rum, lime juice, and grenadine, served in a elegant coupe glass. The drink is garnished with a thin slice of lemon, twisted into a spiral and placed on the rim of the glass. The lighting in the photograph should highlight the vibrant colors of the drink and the delicate shape of the glass. The background should be subtle and not distract from the main subject.\"",
