  "content": "I'll definitely try out some of those wood chip options. I've been experimenting with different types of wood chips for smoking, and I recently picked up some applewood chips that added a nice fruity flavor to the asparagus I grilled a week ago. I served it with a side of cornbread, which I made using a new recipe that included jalapenos for an extra kick. Do you have any tips on how to pair smoked veggies with spicy sides like that?",
