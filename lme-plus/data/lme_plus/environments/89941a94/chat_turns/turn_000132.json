Community-based participatory research: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an approach to research that involves engaging with communities as equal partners in the research process. This approach ensures that the research addresses the needs of the community, and the findings are relevant and applicable. For example, a CBPR study conducted in a low-income housing community in Chicago successfully reduced residents' exposure to secondhand smoke by implementing smoke-free policies in the buildings.\n\n2. Health equity impact assessment: Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA) is a tool that helps researchers and policymakers assess the potential impact of policies and programs on health equity, identify areas of inequity, and recommend strategies to address them. HEIA was successfully used to identify and address health inequities in a public transportation project in Toronto, Canada.\n\n3. Inclusive Technology Development: Inclusive Technology Development (ITD) is a practice that involves the development of technologies that address the needs of all individuals, including those with disabilities, low-income individuals, and underrepresented minorities. An example of ITD is Hearing Aid Innovation, which is an interdisciplinary research collaboration that aims to develop affordable, accessible, and high-quality hearing aids for individuals with hearing impairments in low-and-middle-income countries.\n\n4. The Return of Research Results: The Return of Research Results is a practice that involves returning research findings to the participants or communities in which the research was conducted. This practice ensures that participants understand the results and can benefit from them. For example, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) in the United States requires researchers to return genetic research results to participants and to prevent discrimination based on those results.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that implementing strategies to distribute benefits equitably is possible across a range of research fields and can have a positive impact on communities.",
