However, based on reviews available online, the soundtrack of Suraj, a Bollywood film released in 1966, received mixed reviews. Some critics and audiences appreciated the music composed by Shankar Jaikishan, particularly the popular song \"Baharo Phool Barsao,\" which became a hit. Others found the music formulaic and uninspired. Overall, the soundtrack of Suraj was not regarded as a memorable or groundbreaking one."
