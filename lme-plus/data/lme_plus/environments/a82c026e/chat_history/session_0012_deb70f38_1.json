You can use shoe boxes or bags to protect them from dust and moisture.\n\nRemember to always read the instructions on the waterproofing spray you choose, and test it on a small, inconspicuous area of the shoe before applying it to the entire surface.\n\nI hope these tips and recommendations help you take good care of your leather shoes!"
