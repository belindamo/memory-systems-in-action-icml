Meanwhile, Elaine's new boss at her job forces her to wear a mask at all times, much to her frustration.\n\nFunniest Moments:\nJerry: \"I don't understand what the big deal is about masks. I've been breathing my own air my whole life and I'm still alive.\"\nGeorge: \"Well, I'd rather be safe than sorry. I don't want to be the one who gets sick and spreads it to everyone else.\"\nJerry: \"Sick? You think you're gonna get sick from wearing a mask? That's ridiculous.\"\n\nEpisode 2: \"The Virtual Birthday Party\"\n\nSynopsis: It's Kramer's birthday, but due to social distancing measures, he can't have a traditional party. Instead, he decides to have a virtual party on a video call platform. However, things quickly go awry when the platform glitches and everyone's screens freeze. Jerry and Elaine struggle to troubleshoot the issue while George tries to navigate his new virtual reality headset.\n\nFunniest Moments:\nKramer: \"I can't believe this is how I'm celebrating my birthday. I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of sci-fi movie.\"\nElaine: \"Well, at least we can still have cake. Jerry, can you pass me a slice?\"\nJerry: \"I can't. My hands are tied up trying to fix this stupid platform.\"\nGeorge: \"Hey, guys, can you see me? I'm waving. Wait, why can't I see you?\"\n\nEpisode 3: \"The TikTok Challenge\"\n\nSynopsis: Elaine becomes obsessed with creating viral TikTok videos and drags Jerry, George, and Kramer into her endeavors. However, their attempts at fame fall flat and they end up creating ridiculous, cringeworthy content. Meanwhile, Jerry's parents become TikTok sensations and start stealing Elaine's thunder.\n\nFunniest Moments:\nElaine: \"Come on, guys, we can do this. All we need is a catchy song and some cool dance moves.\"\nJerry: \"I'm not sure I'm ready for the world to see me do the cha cha slide.\"\nKramer: \"I've got a better idea. How about we do a montage of me eating a sandwich in slow motion?\"\nGeorge: \"I think we should just stick to the original plan and do a lip sync of 'I Will Survive.'\""
