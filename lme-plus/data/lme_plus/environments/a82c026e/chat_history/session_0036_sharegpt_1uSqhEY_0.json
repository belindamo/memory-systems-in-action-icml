      "content": "Turn this into 15 dot points\n\nThe so-called \u2018uniform evidence law\u2019 (or \u2018uniform evidence Acts\u2019) presently comprises seven Australian statutes: \n\u2022 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) \n\u2022 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) \n\u2022 Evidence Act 2001 (Tas) \n\u2022 Evidence Act 2004 (Norfolk Island) 1 \n\u2022 Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) \n\u2022 Evidence Act 2011 (ACT) \n\u2022 Evidence (National Uniform Legislation) Act 2011 (NT). \n Despite the latter statute\u2019s (non-uniform) name, the uniform evidence law is not a national law; however, it is easier to list the Australian jurisdictions where such statutes have not been enacted. \n There are just three: Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Although, as Heydon J archly observed in Baker v The Queen , 2 \u2018[t] hose polities are very large in area\u2019\u2014indeed, they total nearly 70 per cent of the continent\u2014Australia\u2019s uniform evidence law scheme has clear \u2018majority\u2019 status in two respects: \n\n\u2022 by jurisdiction, reaching seven out of the nation\u2019s ten court systems \n\u2022 by population, now reaching over fi ve out of every eight Australians (ignoring the Commonwealth Act, which applies to federal courts everywhere). \n\n On the other hand, there have been no new Australian entries to the scheme since \nthe Northern Territory\u2019s adoption in 2011. \n\n The non-adopting jurisdictions face a form of limbo, following Australia\u2019s mostly abandoned \u2018common law of evidence\u2019, tinkered with by local statutes. But the seven adopting jurisdictions likewise face the prospect of following a revolutionary scheme that has partially stalled. This third edition will continue to cover only the adopting jurisdictions, although it is clear that this task still involves attention to the earlier law (see [ 1.3.2 ] under the heading \u2018 Common law \u2019) and to an increasing set of legislative and judicial divergences in the uniform scheme (see [ 1.2 ], \u2018 Uniform law \u2019.)\n\nThis chapter introduces the uniform evidence law\u2019s basic features. First, it describes the most conservative feature of the scheme: its continuity with earlier traditions of evidence law. Second, it describes and assesses the scheme\u2019s goal of a broadly applicable, uniformly developed and easily found Australian evidence law. Finally, it details the connections between the uniform evidence law and other laws: local statutes, the common law, overseas law and human rights law"

      "content": "Here are the 15 dot points:\n\n1. The uniform evidence law is composed of seven Australian statutes.\n2. These statutes include the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), among others.\n3. The uniform evidence law is not a national law, but it is widely adopted across Australia.\n4. Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia have not adopted the uniform evidence law.\n5. The seven jurisdictions that have adopted the law account for the majority of Australia's court systems and population.\n6. There have been no new Australian entries to the scheme since 2011.\n7. Non-adopting jurisdictions are in a form of limbo, while adopting jurisdictions face challenges in implementing the scheme.\n8. This third edition will continue to cover only the adopting jurisdictions.\n9. Attention is needed to the earlier law and legislative and judicial divergences in the uniform scheme.\n10. The basic features of the uniform evidence law are introduced in this chapter.\n11. The scheme is characterized by its continuity with earlier traditions of evidence law.\n12. The scheme aims to provide a broadly applicable, uniformly developed, and easily found Australian evidence law.\n13. Connections between the uniform evidence law and other laws are detailed, including local statutes, common law, overseas law, and human rights law.\n14. The uniform evidence law is a complex and constantly evolving area of law.\n15. Legal professionals and scholars need to stay up to date with developments in the uniform evidence law and related fields."

      "content": "Turn this into dot points\n\n1.1 EVIDENCE LAW\n\nBy far the most important feature of the uniform evidence law is that it is not a radical change from the previous law. Of course, there are any number of individual provisions that could be described as radical: the new hearsay rule, the new hearsay exceptions, the tendency and coincidence rules, and many others. But to focus on such changes is to miss the (entirely traditional) wood for the (occasionally pruned, chopped down, replaced or even newly planted) trees.\n\nAustralian evidence law is, and always has been, a bundle of procedural rules that \nmake relatively limited inroads into the freedom of parties and courts to present and find facts as they wish. The uniform evidence law\u2019s basic structure of:\n\n\u2022 rules providing for various courtroom events (in this book, Part 1: Adducing Evidence)\n\n\u2022 various exceptions and sub-exceptions to the rule that a court can make use of any information that is relevant (in this book, Part 2: Admissibility of Evidence)\n\n\u2022 some mild controls on the outcomes of that use (in this book, Part 3: Proof).\n\n is identical to the approach (but not the much more amorphous form) of the common law.\n\nThis preliminary chapter introduces the unchanged purposes of Australian evidence law. It first addresses the law\u2019s primary purpose: to promote the accuracy of legal fact-finding. It then considers alternative goals that some rules of evidence promote, even to the extent of undermining that primary purpose."
