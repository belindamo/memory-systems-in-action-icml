  "content": "In the context of semi-definite programming (SDP), \"semi-definite\" refers to the type of constraints that are placed on the variables.\n\nA matrix is said to be semi-definite if it is symmetric and all of its eigenvalues are non-negative. In other words, a matrix A is semi-definite if for any vector x, the inner product x^T A x is non-negative, where x^T is the transpose of x.\n\nIn SDP, the constraints are represented by a set of semi-definite matrices, which are required to be positive semi-definite, meaning that all of its eigenvalues are greater or equal to zero.\n\nThe constraints in SDP are represented in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) like A1>=0, A2>=0,..An>=0, where Ai are the semi-definite matrices.\n\nSo, in SDP, we are trying to optimize a linear function subject to a set of LMI constraints, where the constraint matrices are semi-definite, and it is this feature that makes SDP different from other types of optimization problems, like linear programming (LP) and quadratic programming (QP), which have different types of constraints.",
