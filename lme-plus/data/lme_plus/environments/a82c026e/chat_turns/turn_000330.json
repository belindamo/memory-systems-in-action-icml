  "content": "That was really helpful, thanks for explaining the different options for buying train tickets in Japan. I think I'll try to buy my tickets online in advance to secure my seat, especially since I've never been to Japan before and I'm not sure how the train system works. By the way, I've been getting some inspiration from the travel accounts I follow on Instagram, and I was thinking of visiting the Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto. Do you know if I need to book tickets in advance for that?",
