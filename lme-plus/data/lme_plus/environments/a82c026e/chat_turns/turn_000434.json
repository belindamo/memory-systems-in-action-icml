  "content": "In the context of converting an inequality constraint into a semi-definite matrix using the Schur complement, the matrices A and B have to be symmetric for the following reasons:\n\n1. Symmetry ensures that the matrix A-BC^-1B is also symmetric, which is a requirement for a matrix to be semi-definite. A semi-definite matrix must be symmetric, which means that its transpose is equal to itself.\n2. The Schur complement is used to determine the positive semi-definiteness of a matrix, and it can only be applied to symmetric matrices. For a symmetric matrix A, it can be shown that A-BC^-1B is also symmetric, which means that it can be used to determine whether A-BC^-1B is positive semi-definite.\n3. Symmetry is also required to preserve the semi-definiteness of the matrix when using Schur complement. The Schur complement only preserves semi-definiteness if both A and B are symmetric.\n\nAdditionally, in the context of optimization, the matrices A and B are often used to represent the Hessian matrix and gradient vector of the objective function respectively. And these matrices are typically symmetric in optimization problems.\n\nIn summary, the Schur complement is a powerful tool for converting an inequality constraint into a semi-definite matrix, but it is only applicable to symmetric matrices A and B. The requirement of symmetry ensures that the resulting matrix A-BC^-1B is also symmetric and can be used to determine the positive semi-definiteness of the matrix.",
