Here are some tips to help you track those speedy heroes:\n\n1. **Focus on their movement patterns**: Study the movement patterns of Reaper and Genji. Learn their jump distances, acceleration, and deceleration rates. This will help you anticipate their movements and prepare your aim accordingly.\n2. **Use your peripheral vision**: Instead of focusing directly on the hero, use your peripheral vision to track their movement. This will help you react faster to their movements and reduce the likelihood of getting tunnel vision.\n3. **Lead your target**: Since fast-moving heroes are, well, fast, you'll need to lead your target by a small margin. This means aiming slightly ahead of their current position, anticipating where they'll be in the next fraction of a second.\n4. **Use your crosshair's momentum**: As you track a fast-moving hero, try to maintain a smooth, consistent motion with your crosshair. This will help you keep up with their speed and make adjustments more easily.\n5. **Practice \"snap-back\" aiming**: When a hero suddenly changes direction, quickly snap your crosshair back to their new position. This takes practice, but it'll help you recover from unexpected movements.\n6. **Adjust your sensitivity**: Consider increasing your sensitivity slightly (e.g., to 7 or 8) to help you track faster movements. However, be careful not to increase it too much, as this can make your aim more erratic.\n7. **Use the minimap**: Keep an eye on the minimap to anticipate where the fast-moving hero might be heading. This will give you a better idea of where to position your crosshair.\n8. **Stay calm and focused**: It's easy to get frustrated when tracking fast-moving heroes, but it's essential to remain calm and focused. Take deep breaths, and try to stay in the zone.\n9. **Practice with the \"tracking\" training bot**: In the training mode, you can set the bots to move erratically, which can help you practice tracking fast-moving targets.\n10. **Watch pro players**: Observe how professional players track and aim at fast-moving heroes. Analyze their techniques, and try to incorporate them into your own gameplay.\n\nRemember, tracking fast-moving heroes takes time and practice to develop. Be patient, stay consistent, and you'll see improvement over time.\n\nHow do you find these tips? Do you have any other questions or areas you'd like to improve upon?",
