Both approaches have their benefits, and I'll outline them below:\n\n**Conversing with native speakers:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Immersion: You'll get to practice your listening and speaking skills in a more natural, authentic way.\n* Accuracy: Native speakers can correct your mistakes and provide feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary usage.\n* Cultural insight: You'll gain a deeper understanding of the culture and nuances of the language.\n\nCons:\n\n* Intimidation factor: You might feel nervous or intimidated speaking with a native speaker, especially if you're still at a basic level.\n* Language gap: You might struggle to understand or communicate effectively due to a significant language gap.\n\n**Conversing with learners at a similar level:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Mutual understanding: You'll likely face similar challenges and can empathize with each other's struggles.\n* Encouragement: You can motivate and support each other in your language learning journey.\n* Equal footing: You'll be on a more equal level, which can make conversations feel less intimidating.\n\nCons:\n\n* Limited feedback: While you can still learn from each other, you might not receive the same level of feedback on accuracy and nuances as you would from a native speaker.\n* Limited exposure: You might not be exposed to the same level of authentic language use as you would with a native speaker.\n\nAs a beginner, it's essential to focus on building your confidence and foundation in the language. I recommend starting with other learners at a similar level. This will allow you to:\n\n* Practice your speaking skills in a more comfortable environment\n* Get used to the sound and rhythm of the language\n* Build your vocabulary and grammar gradually\n* Develop your communication skills and learn how to ask for help or clarification\n\nAs you progress and become more confident, you can gradually transition to conversing with native speakers. You can start by engaging with native speakers in small doses, such as:\n\n* Listening to podcasts or YouTube videos in Japanese\n* Participating in language exchange events or meetups\n* Joining online communities or forums for language learners\n\nRemember, the key is to start small and be consistent. Focus on making progress, not perfection. With time and practice, you'll become more comfortable conversing with native speakers and other learners alike.\n\nHow does that sound?",
