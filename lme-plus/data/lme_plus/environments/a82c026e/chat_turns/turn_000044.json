  "content": "Returning the `id` can be useful for clients to identify the newly created resource, and returning `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps can provide clients with more information about when the resource was created and last updated.\n\nHowever, whether or not to return these fields in the response depends on the specific requirements of your API and the needs of your clients. In some cases, it may be appropriate to return only a subset of the fields, while in others it may be necessary to include additional fields.\n\nIn general, it's a good practice to document the response format of your API and make sure that it meets the needs of your clients while still protecting sensitive data.",
