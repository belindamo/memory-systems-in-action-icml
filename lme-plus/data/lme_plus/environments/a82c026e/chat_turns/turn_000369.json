  "content": "Turn this into dot points\n\n1.1 EVIDENCE LAW\n\nBy far the most important feature of the uniform evidence law is that it is not a radical change from the previous law. Of course, there are any number of individual provisions that could be described as radical: the new hearsay rule, the new hearsay exceptions, the tendency and coincidence rules, and many others. But to focus on such changes is to miss the (entirely traditional) wood for the (occasionally pruned, chopped down, replaced or even newly planted) trees.\n\nAustralian evidence law is, and always has been, a bundle of procedural rules that \nmake relatively limited inroads into the freedom of parties and courts to present and find facts as they wish. The uniform evidence law\u2019s basic structure of:\n\n\u2022 rules providing for various courtroom events (in this book, Part 1: Adducing Evidence)\n\n\u2022 various exceptions and sub-exceptions to the rule that a court can make use of any information that is relevant (in this book, Part 2: Admissibility of Evidence)\n\n\u2022 some mild controls on the outcomes of that use (in this book, Part 3: Proof).\n\n is identical to the approach (but not the much more amorphous form) of the common law.\n\nThis preliminary chapter introduces the unchanged purposes of Australian evidence law. It first addresses the law\u2019s primary purpose: to promote the accuracy of legal fact-finding. It then considers alternative goals that some rules of evidence promote, even to the extent of undermining that primary purpose.",
