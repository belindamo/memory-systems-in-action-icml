  "content": "Here are the dot points:\n\n* The uniform evidence law is not a radical departure from the previous law.\n* Australian evidence law has always been a set of procedural rules that limit the freedom of parties and courts to present and find facts.\n* The basic structure of the uniform evidence law includes rules for courtroom events, exceptions and sub-exceptions to the rule of relevance, and mild controls on the outcomes of evidence use.\n* This structure is identical to the approach of the common law, though the form is different.\n* The primary purpose of Australian evidence law is to promote the accuracy of legal fact-finding.\n* This chapter introduces the unchanged purposes of Australian evidence law.\n* Alternative goals promoted by some rules of evidence are considered, even if they undermine the primary purpose of accuracy.",
