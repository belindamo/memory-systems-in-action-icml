  "content": "To increase the pool size, you need to pass the desired size as a parameter when creating the pool. The specific method for doing this may vary depending on the database library you are using.\n\nFor example, if you're using the `databases` library with `asyncpg`, you can specify the pool size as follows:\n```python\nimport databases\nimport asyncpg\n\ndatabase_url = \"postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase\"\n\ndatabase = databases.Database(database_url, pool_size=20)\n\nasync def connect_to_database():\n    await database.connect()\n\nasync def disconnect_from_database():\n    await database.disconnect()\n```\nIn this example, the `pool_size` parameter is set to 20, meaning that the connection pool will contain 20 connections.\n\nNote that increasing the pool size can have performance implications, so you should be careful not to set the pool size too high. The optimal pool size depends on factors such as the number of concurrent requests your application receives and the capacity of your database server.",
