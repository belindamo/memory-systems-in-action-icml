Making your bed and wiping down the kitchen counters can make a significant impact on the overall tidiness of your home.\n\nNow, about remembering to take out the trash and recycling... That's a great goal to work on! Setting reminders on your phone is an excellent start, but here are some additional tips to help you make it a consistent habit:\n\n1. **Create a routine**: Try to take out the trash and recycling at the same time every week, so it becomes a habitual part of your routine. For example, you could do it every Thursday evening or Friday morning.\n2. **Anchor it to an existing habit**: Link taking out the trash and recycling to an existing habit, like taking a shower or having breakfast. This will help you remember to do it consistently.\n3. **Leave a visual reminder**: Place a sticky note or a reminder on your fridge, countertop, or near the trash cans to remind you to take out the trash and recycling on the designated day.\n4. **Enlist a reminder buddy**: Share the responsibility with a family member or roommate, so you can remind each other to take out the trash and recycling.\n5. **Make it a part of your 'launching pad'**: Designate a specific spot, like a hook or a tray near the door, as your \"launching pad\" where you keep your keys, wallet, and other essential items. Place a small reminder note or a trash icon on this spot to remind you to take out the trash and recycling.\n6. **Create a 'trash day' ritual**: Develop a simple ritual, like doing a quick tidy of the kitchen or living room, to signal that it's trash day. This can help make the task more enjoyable and increase your chances of remembering.\n7. **Use a habit-tracking app**: Consider using a habit-tracking app like Habitica, HabitBull, or Loop Habit Tracker to monitor your progress and receive reminders.\n8. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for yourself when you successfully take out the trash and recycling on the designated day. This could be something as simple as a favorite snack or a short break from a task.\n9. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to forget occasionally. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a week, but instead, focus on getting back on track as soon as possible.\n10. **Celebrate milestones**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress when you reach milestones, like taking out the trash and recycling consistently for a month or quarter. This will help motivate you to continue the habit.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you'll be more likely to remember to take out the trash and recycling on the designated days. Remember to be patient and flexible, as developing a new habit takes time and effort.\n\nKeep up the great work on your habits, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance!",
