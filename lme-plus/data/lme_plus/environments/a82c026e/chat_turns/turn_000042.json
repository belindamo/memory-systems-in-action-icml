  "content": "For the sign up response, you can return a pydantic model that represents the newly created user, including its unique `id` field, such as:\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass UserOut(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    email: str\n    username: str\n    full_name: str = ''\n    bio: str = ''\n    created_at: datetime\n    updated_at: datetime\n```\nThen, you can create an instance of this model based on the newly created user, and return it in the sign up endpoint's response. For example:\n```python\n@app.post('/signup', response_model=UserOut)\nasync def signup(user: UserCreate, db: Database = Depends(get_db)):\n    # Create the user in the database\n    created_user = await crud.create_user(db, user)\n\n    # Return the newly created user as the response\n    return created_user\n```\nIn this example, `crud.create_user()` would return a `User` object based on the data from the `UserCreate` request, and then you would create a `UserOut` object based on that data to be returned in the response.",
