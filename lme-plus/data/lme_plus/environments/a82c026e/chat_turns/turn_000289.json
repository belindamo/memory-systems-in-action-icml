I'd like to dedicate 3-4 days a week to running, with one longer run on the weekends. My current fitness level is decent, but I want to increase my endurance. I have one tennis lesson per week, and it's usually on Wednesdays at 6 pm. As for rest days, I'd like to have at least one or two days off per week.",
