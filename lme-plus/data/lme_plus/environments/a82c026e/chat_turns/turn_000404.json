Having someone who can create for themselves and others would take their offense to the next level and make them even more formidable.\n\nNow, about those other sports... As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or preferences, but I can chat with you about them! Cricket, rugby, and tennis are all exciting sports with passionate fan bases. Cricket is huge in many countries, especially in the Indian subcontinent, the UK, and Australia. Rugby is popular in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, while tennis is a global sport with a massive following.\n\nWhile I don't have personal experiences, I can provide information and answer questions about these sports if you're interested! Do you have a favorite team or player in any of these sports?",
