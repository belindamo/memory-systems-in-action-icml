  "content": "To define the request body for a user sign in endpoint using Pydantic, you can create a new Pydantic model that represents the expected structure of the request body. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass UserSignInRequest(BaseModel):\n    email: str\n    password: str\n```\nIn this example, `UserSignInRequest` is the Pydantic model that represents the expected structure of the request body. It has two fields, `email` and `password`, both of which are of type `str`. These fields correspond to the email and password that the user provides when signing in.\n\nTo use this model in a FastAPI endpoint, you would declare it as the request body in the endpoint definition. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom .models import UserSignInRequest\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.post(\"/signin\")\nasync def sign_in(user: UserSignInRequest):\n    # your sign in logic here\n```\nIn this example, the `sign_in` endpoint expects a POST request with a JSON payload that matches the structure of the `UserSignInRequest` model. The request body is automatically parsed and validated by FastAPI using the Pydantic model. If the request body does not match the expected structure, FastAPI will return a 422 Unprocessable Entity response with an error message.",
