However, I must clarify again that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or senses, so I didn't actually see or smell your candle. But I'd be happy to help you with your questions about coasters and potholders!\n\n**Coasters:**\n\n1. **Choose your fabric:** Select scrap fabrics that are heat-resistant, such as cotton, linen, or canvas. You can also use felt or wool for a more rustic look.\n2. **Measure and cut:** Cut out squares or circles of fabric, depending on the shape you prefer for your coasters. A 4-inch square or a 3.5-inch circle is a good starting point.\n3. **Layer and sew:** Place two identical fabric pieces right sides together and sew around the edges, leaving a small opening to turn them right side out.\n4. **Turn and press:** Turn the coaster right side out, press the edges to create a crisp fold, and topstitch around the perimeter.\n5. **Add a backing:** If desired, add a backing fabric or a piece of cork or cardboard to the coaster for extra protection and stability.\n\n**Potholders:**\n\n1. **Choose your fabric:** Select heat-resistant fabrics like cotton, linen, or canvas. You can also use insulated batting or heat-resistant batting for added protection.\n2. **Measure and cut:** Cut out squares or rectangles of fabric, depending on the size you prefer for your potholders. A 6-inch square or an 8x10-inch rectangle is a good starting point.\n3. **Layer and sew:** Place two identical fabric pieces right sides together, with the batting in between, and sew around the edges, leaving a small opening to turn them right side out.\n4. **Turn and press:** Turn the potholder right side out, press the edges to create a crisp fold, and topstitch around the perimeter.\n5. **Add a loop or handle:** Attach a loop or handle made from fabric, yarn, or ribbon to make it easy to hang or carry the potholder.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a variety of fabrics and colors to create a unique and personalized set of coasters or potholders.\n* Add a layer of quilt batting or Insul-Bright for extra heat protection.\n* Embellish your coasters or potholders with embroidery, appliques, or other decorative stitches.\n* Experiment with different shapes, like hexagons or circles, for a unique look.\n\nRemember to always use caution when working with heat and flames, and make sure your coasters and potholders are designed to withstand high temperatures.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your coaster and potholder projects!
