These statutes include the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), among others.\n3. The uniform evidence law is not a national law, but it is widely adopted across Australia.\n4. Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia have not adopted the uniform evidence law.\n5. The seven jurisdictions that have adopted the law account for the majority of Australia's court systems and population.\n6. There have been no new Australian entries to the scheme since 2011.\n7.

This third edition will continue to cover only the adopting jurisdictions.\n9. Attention is needed to the earlier law and legislative and judicial divergences in the uniform scheme.\n10. The basic features of the uniform evidence law are introduced in this chapter.\n11. The scheme is characterized by its continuity with earlier traditions of evidence law.\n12. The scheme aims to provide a broadly applicable, uniformly developed, and easily found Australian evidence law.\n13.

The uniform evidence law is a complex and constantly evolving area of law.\n15.
