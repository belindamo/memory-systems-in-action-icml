  "content": "Project Catalyst is a platform that allows developers to easily port their iPad apps to Macs. The goal of Project Catalyst is to make it easy for developers to create one set of code that works on both iOS and macOS, rather than having to write separate codebases for each platform. This allows developers to reach more users and saves them time and effort when building and maintaining their apps. With Project Catalyst, developers can use the same tools and frameworks they use to build iOS apps, such as SwiftUI and UIKit, to create Mac apps.\n\nIn addition to the technical aspect, Project Catalyst also includes a design aspect, with Apple providing guidelines and best practices for designing apps that work well on both iOS and macOS. This includes information on how to handle keyboard and mouse input, how to use the Touch Bar on MacBook Pro, and how to optimize layouts for different screen sizes.\n\nProject Catalyst was announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2019, and since then, many developers have started to adopt the technology to bring their iPad apps to the Mac. Examples of apps that have been adapted include Twitter, GoodNotes, Jira, and many more.",
