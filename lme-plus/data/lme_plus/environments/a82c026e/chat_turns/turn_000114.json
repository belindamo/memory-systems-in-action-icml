If possible, store your shoes in a shaded area or use a UV-protective spray.\n4. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Avoid exposing your shoes to extreme heat or cold, as this can cause the leather to dry out or become brittle.\n5. **Use shoe trees or stuffers**: For shoes with removable insoles, use shoe trees or stuffers to help maintain their shape and prevent creasing.\n6. **Store shoes properly**: Store your shoes in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. You can use shoe boxes or bags to protect them from dust and moisture.\n\nRemember to always read the instructions on the waterproofing spray you choose, and test it on a small, inconspicuous area of the shoe before applying it to the entire surface.\n\nI hope these tips and recommendations help you take good care of your leather shoes!",
