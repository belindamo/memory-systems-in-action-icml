  "content": "I'm looking for some recommendations on good fishing spots around Lake Michigan. Three weeks ago, I went on a trip with my friends Alex and Ryan, and we caught some nice largemouth bass and trout. We used a mix of live bait and spinner lures, and I was surprised how well the spinner lures worked for the trout. Do you have any suggestions for other good spots around the lake?",
