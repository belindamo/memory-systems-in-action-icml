However, it depends on the size of your messenger bag and duffel bag.\n\nHere are some tips to help you decide:\n\n* **Check the size**: Measure both bags to ensure the messenger bag will fit inside the duffel bag. If the messenger bag is too large or has a rigid shape, it might not fit comfortably inside the duffel bag.\n* **Empty the messenger bag**: Pack only the essentials in the messenger bag, like your laptop, documents, and maybe a small wallet or phone. This will reduce its bulk and make it easier to fit inside the duffel bag.\n* **Use packing cubes or compression bags**: If you have packing cubes or compression bags, use them to compress the messenger bag and make it more compact. This will help it fit better inside the duffel bag.\n* **Pack it in a protective sleeve**: If you have a protective sleeve or pouch for your messenger bag, use it to add an extra layer of protection and make it easier to pack inside the duffel bag.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can try packing the messenger bag in the duffel bag and see how it fits. If it's too bulky or uncomfortable, you can always carry it separately.\n\nAlternatively, you could consider wearing the messenger bag across your body or using a backpack with a dedicated laptop compartment. This will free up space in your duffel bag and allow you to carry your laptop and documents safely and comfortably.\n\nRemember to pack smart and prioritize the items you need to bring. Safe travels!",
