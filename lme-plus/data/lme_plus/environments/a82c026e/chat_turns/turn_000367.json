Although, as Heydon J archly observed in Baker v The Queen , 2 \u2018[t] hose polities are very large in area\u2019\u2014indeed, they total nearly 70 per cent of the continent\u2014Australia\u2019s uniform evidence law scheme has clear \u2018majority\u2019 status in two respects: \n\n\u2022 by jurisdiction, reaching seven out of the nation\u2019s ten court systems \n\u2022 by population, now reaching over fi ve out of every eight Australians (ignoring the Commonwealth Act, which applies to federal courts everywhere). \n\n On the other hand, there have been no new Australian entries to the scheme since \nthe Northern Territory\u2019s adoption in 2011. \n\n The non-adopting jurisdictions face a form of limbo, following Australia\u2019s mostly abandoned \u2018common law of evidence\u2019, tinkered with by local statutes. But the seven adopting jurisdictions likewise face the prospect of following a revolutionary scheme that has partially stalled. This third edition will continue to cover only the adopting jurisdictions, although it is clear that this task still involves attention to the earlier law (see [ 1.3.2 ] under the heading \u2018 Common law \u2019) and to an increasing set of legislative and judicial divergences in the uniform scheme (see [ 1.2 ], \u2018 Uniform law \u2019.)\n\nThis chapter introduces the uniform evidence law\u2019s basic features. First, it describes the most conservative feature of the scheme: its continuity with earlier traditions of evidence law. Second, it describes and assesses the scheme\u2019s goal of a broadly applicable, uniformly developed and easily found Australian evidence law. Finally, it details the connections between the uniform evidence law and other laws: local statutes, the common law, overseas law and human rights law",
