  "content": "In the above example, the constraints can be transformed into a matrix form using the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nWe can introduce a new variable lambda1, lambda2, lambda3 and lambda4, and form a new problem that is to minimize lambda1 + lambda2 + lambda3 + lambda4 subject to the constraints:\nx1 >= 0\nx2 >= 0\nx1 + x2 <= 1\nx1^2 + x2^2 <= 1\n\nand the equations\nlambda1\\*(x1 - 0) = 0\nlambda2\\*(x2 - 0) = 0\nlambda3\\*(x1 + x2 - 1) = 0\nlambda4\\*(x1^2 + x2^2 - 1) = 0\n\nThe solution of this problem will be x1, x2, lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, lambda4 such that x1 >= 0, x2 >= 0, x1 + x2 <= 1, x1^2 + x2^2 <= 1, and lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, lambda4 will be non-negative.\n\nWe can then stack the variables x1, x2, lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, lambda4 and the equations as columns of a matrix X and a matrix G respectively, where X = [x1, x2, lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, lambda4]^T and G = [0, 0, -1, -1, 1, x1, x2, 0, 0, 0, 0, x1, x2, 0, -1, -x1, -x2, 0, 0, 0, 0, x1, x2, 0, -1]\n\nNow we can express the constraints of the problem as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) in the form X^TGX >= 0, where X^T is the transpose of X, G is the matrix of the equations and X is the matrix of the variables. The matrix G is positive semi-definite, since lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, lambda4 are non-negative.\n\nThis LMI can be solved by various algorithms such as interior-point method, first-order methods, or by using specialized software such as CVX, Yalmip, Mosek, etc.",
