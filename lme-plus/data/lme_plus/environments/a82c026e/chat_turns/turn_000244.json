  "content": "Exactly! That's the right approach. It's always better to try packing it first and see how it fits, rather than assuming it will fit and ending up with a messy or uncomfortable packing situation.\n\nRemember to pack the messenger bag in a way that distributes its weight evenly and doesn't put pressure on any fragile items in your duffel bag. You can also use some packing cubes or clothes to cushion it and keep it in place.\n\nIf it doesn't fit or feels too bulky, no worries! Carrying it separately is a great option, and it's always better to be safe than sorry.\n\nYou're welcome for the tips, and I hope you have a great time on your trip with your friends! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Safe travels!",
