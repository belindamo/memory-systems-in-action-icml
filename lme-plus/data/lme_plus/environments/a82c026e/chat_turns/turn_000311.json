Alfred Prufrock\" by T.S. Eliot: Artist Tom Phillips created a visual interpretation of Eliot's poem, titled \"A Humument,\" by redacting and altering the text of a second-hand book to create a new narrative and visual language.\n4. \"Othello\" by William Shakespeare: Performance artist Keith Hennessy created a dance interpretation of the play, titled \"Sink,\" that explores the themes of jealousy and betrayal through movement and music.\n5. \"Howl\" by Allen Ginsberg: Visual artist Eric Drooker collaborated with Ginsberg to create a graphic novel adaptation of the poet's famous work, using images and text to bring the poem to life in a new medium.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the creative possibilities of translating or interpreting verbal text into art, and show how artists and designers can use language and form to communicate complex ideas and emotions in new and innovative ways.",
