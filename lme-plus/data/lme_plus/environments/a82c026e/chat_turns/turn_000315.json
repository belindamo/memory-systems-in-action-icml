  "content": "Congratulations on beating that pesky boss! Dark Souls 3 is an incredible game, and the DLCs are no joke. It's a great feeling when you finally overcome a tough challenge like that.\n\nAiming for the higher end of the budget range will give you a lot of flexibility to choose the best components for your build. You'll be able to get top-of-the-line parts that will handle 4K gaming with ease.\n\nIf you're willing to spend a bit more, you could consider adding some extra features to your build, like:\n\n* A high-end sound card for immersive audio\n* A high-refresh-rate monitor with G-Sync or FreeSync\n* A comfortable gaming keyboard and mouse with customizable backlighting\n* A fancy case with advanced lighting and cooling systems\n\nOr, you could put the extra budget towards overclocking your components for even better performance. The possibilities are endless!\n\nWhat's your favorite part about Dark Souls 3? The lore, the world design, or something else entirely?",
