As we discussed earlier, a cup of coffee typically contains around 95-200mg of caffeine. Let's assume an average of 150mg for our tracking purposes.\n\nSo, for Thursday, you had:\n\n* 1 cup of coffee (around 8-10 oz) = 150mg of caffeine\n\nLet's update the total:\n\n* Monday: 150mg\n* Tuesday: 0mg\n* Wednesday: 100mg\n* Thursday: 150mg\n* Total: 400mg\n\nHow about the rest of Thursday and today (Friday)? Did you have any other coffee or caffeinated beverages?",
