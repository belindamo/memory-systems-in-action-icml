And don't hesitate to ask the teacher or assistant for help during the class if you need any guidance with props or modifications.\n\nRemember to also listen to your body and honor its limitations. Ashtanga can be a challenging practice, especially for beginners, so don't push yourself too hard. Take breaks when needed, and focus on breathing and alignment.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and enjoy the experience! Ashtanga is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your first class, and I hope you have a great time exploring Ashtanga!",
