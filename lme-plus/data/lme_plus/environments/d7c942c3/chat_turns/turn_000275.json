I'd be happy to recommend some top-notch routers that can handle multiple devices and provide a strong signal throughout your home.\n\nBefore we dive into specific models, let's consider a few factors to ensure you get the right router for your needs:\n\n1. **Number of devices**: How many devices do you plan to connect to your router? This will help determine the number of LAN ports and the router's capacity.\n2. **Home size and layout**: The size and layout of your home will affect the router's range and coverage. Larger homes or homes with multiple floors may require a more powerful router.\n3. **Wi-Fi standard**: The latest Wi-Fi standard is Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), which offers better performance, capacity, and range.
