  "content": "Excellent choices! Fresh onions and bell peppers will definitely elevate the flavor and texture of your chicken fajitas. And don't forget to pick up some olive oil while you're at the store - it's a staple in many recipes, including this one.\n\nIf you want to take your fajitas to the next level, you could also consider adding some aromatics like garlic, cumin, and chili powder to your marinade. These spices will give your chicken a nice depth of flavor and a bit of heat.\n\nWhile you're at the store, you might also want to grab some additional toppings for your fajitas, like avocado, sour cream, salsa, and shredded cheese. These will add some creaminess and extra flavor to your dish.\n\nLastly, if you have some fresh cilantro on hand, be sure to chop it up and sprinkle it on top of your fajitas before serving. It adds a nice burst of freshness and flavor to the dish.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for you to enjoy your delicious homemade chicken fajitas tonight!",
