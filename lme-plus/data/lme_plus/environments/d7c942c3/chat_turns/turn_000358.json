  "content": "That's a great idea! Using flowers that are significant to the mom-to-be will make the flower crowns even more meaningful and special. I'll make sure to consider that when planning the station. And I love the idea of incorporating small baby-themed decorations into the crowns - it'll add an extra layer of whimsy and fun. \n\nBy the way, I was thinking of serving some refreshing drinks at the baby shower. Do you have any suggestions for Enchanted Garden-themed drinks that would fit well with the flower crown station?",
