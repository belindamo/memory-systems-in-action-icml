  "content": "Chennai manages its water resources through a combination of infrastructure, policies, and conservation efforts. \n\nOne of the key sources of water for the city is the Cauvery river, which is diverted to tanks and reservoirs through a network of canals and pipelines. The city also relies on groundwater sources, including wells and borewells, but these have been depleted due to overuse and drought. \n\nTo secure a sustainable water supply, the city has implemented several measures, including rainwater harvesting, water conservation campaigns, and wastewater treatment and reuse. Chennai was among the first cities in India to make rainwater harvesting mandatory for all buildings, and this has helped to recharge groundwater levels and reduce reliance on external water sources. \n\nThe city also has plans to increase its water supply through desalination, where seawater is treated to produce freshwater. The first desalination plant was commissioned in 2010, and there are plans to build more such plants in the future. \n\nOther measures to secure a sustainable water supply include upgrading the city's water distribution and sewage systems, promoting efficient water use, and reducing water losses through leak detection and repair. \n\nOverall, Chennai's approach to managing its water resources involves a mix of traditional and modern methods, as well as a focus on community participation and awareness. The city has made significant progress in addressing its water challenges, but continued efforts are necessary to ensure a secure and sustainable water supply for its growing population.",
