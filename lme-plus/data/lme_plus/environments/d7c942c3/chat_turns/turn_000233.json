  "content": "There have been several shifts in global trade policies that have affected domestic manufacturing industries in different ways:\n\n1. Protectionist policies: Many countries have implemented protectionist policies to protect their domestic manufacturing industries, which has led to the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers. This move has helped to limit the influx of cheaper foreign imports, which has made it easier for domestic manufacturers to compete. However, results in retaliation from other countries also implementing protectionist policies and limiting their own countries to exports.\n\n2. Free trade agreements: Free trade agreements have increased competition and enabled domestic manufacturers to access foreign markets. This move has increased demand for locally manufactured goods and created new employment opportunities, and has often allowed for cheaper prices for the consumers. However, it has also increased the pressure on domestic manufacturers to improve their efficiency and competitiveness, making it harder for smaller manufacturers to keep up.\n\n3. Shifts in production: Many companies have started to shift their production lines to countries with lower labour and production costs to remain competitive. This shift has had a significant impact on domestic manufacturing industries as they face competition from low-cost countries. This move also affects the domestic economy by the transfer of Jobs and the loss of expertise and capabilities.\n\nOverall, shifts in global trade policies have had a significant impact on domestic manufacturing industries. While some policies have had a positive impact, others have created challenges for manufacturers, particularly smaller companies who find it difficult to cope with increased competition and higher tariffs fees.",
