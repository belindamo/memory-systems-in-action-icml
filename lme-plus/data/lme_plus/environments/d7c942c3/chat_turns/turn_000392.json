  "content": "The brown butter sage sauce is a game-changer! It's a classic Italian combination that pairs perfectly with the cauliflower gnocchi. The nutty, caramel flavor of the brown butter complements the earthy sweetness of the sage, and the crispy texture of the sage leaves adds a lovely contrast.\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Brown Butter Sage Sauce for Cauliflower Gnocchi**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 package cauliflower gnocchi\n* 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter\n* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Grated Parmesan cheese, optional\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the cauliflower gnocchi according to package instructions until they float to the surface. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining the gnocchi.\n2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue cooking the butter, stirring occasionally, until it turns golden brown and smells nutty (about 5-7 minutes).\n3. Add the chopped sage leaves to the brown butter and cook for 1-2 minutes, until crispy and fragrant. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n4. Add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet, tossing to coat with the brown butter sage sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water.\n5. Serve immediately, topped with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use high-quality, fresh sage leaves for the best flavor.\n* Don't overcook the butter, as it can quickly go from golden brown to burnt.\n* Add some garlic or shallots to the skillet with the butter for added depth of flavor.\n* Experiment with different types of cheese, like ricotta or goat cheese, for a creamier sauce.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe!
