Here's a response that you can send:\n\nHi Roommates,\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you all are on board with the revitalization project. I think this will really make our living space feel more like home and give us a comfortable and inviting area to spend time together.\n\nThanks for your support in letting me take the lead on finding suitable furniture on Facebook Marketplace. I'll make sure to keep everyone updated with my finds, and we can discuss and approve them together.\n\nI'm really looking forward to working with you all to make our common space a place where we can relax, bond, and create new memories together.\n\nThanks again, and let's do this!\n\nBest regards,\nJason",
