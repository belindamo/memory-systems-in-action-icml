  "content": "A small cup of coffee from a cafe can vary in size, but a good estimate is around 8-12 oz (240-360ml). Let's assume it was around 10 oz (300ml) for our tracking purposes.\n\nA 10 oz cup of coffee typically contains around 100-150mg of caffeine. Since you mentioned it was a small cup, let's assume it was closer to 100mg.\n\nSo, for Wednesday, you had:\n\n* 1 small cup of coffee (around 10 oz) = 100mg of caffeine\n\nLet's update the total:\n\n* Monday: 150mg\n* Tuesday: 0mg\n* Wednesday: 100mg\n* Total: 250mg\n\nHow about Thursday? Did you have any coffee or caffeinated beverages today?",
