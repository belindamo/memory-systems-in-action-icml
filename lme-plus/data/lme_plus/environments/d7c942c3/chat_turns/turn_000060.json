  "content": "To check the latency of NVIDIA GeForce Now service, you can use the following IP address to ping:\n\n`ping latencytest.fra02.nvidia.com`\n\nThis will allow you to measure the latency between your device and NVIDIA's server located in Frankfurt, Germany. You can also replace \"fra02\" in the above IP address with other locations like \"ams\", \"par\", \"sto\", \"dub\", \"mad\", \"lhr\", \"mil\", \"lis\", \"vie\", \"waw\", \"ams\" or \"cdg\" to test the latency from different locations.\n\nKeep in mind that latency can be affected by many factors, including your internet connection, network congestion, and distance from the server. Therefore, a single ping test may not provide a complete picture of your overall latency to the service.",
