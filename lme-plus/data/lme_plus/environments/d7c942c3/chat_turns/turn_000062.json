In this case, you can try pinging a different server location, like the Dublin server you tested:\n```\nping latencytest.dub1.nvidia.com\n```\nThis should allow you to measure the latency between your device and NVIDIA's server located in Dublin, Ireland. As mentioned before, keep in mind that latency can be affected by many factors, and a single ping test may not provide a complete picture of your overall latency to the service.",
