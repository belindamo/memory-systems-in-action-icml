  "content": "Certainly, I can suggest a few indie artists with more folky or acoustic sound. Here are some recommendations for you:\n\n1. Phoebe Bridgers - an indie-folk singer-songwriter who has received critical acclaim for her soulful, introspective lyrics and ethereal sound. 2. Gregory Alan Isakov - a Colorado-based indie-folk artist who combines acoustic guitar with gentle, mellow vocals and atmospheric production. 3. Lucy Dacus - a singer-songwriter who blends indie rock and folk music with her powerful vocals and introspective lyrics. 4. Fleet Foxes - a popular indie-folk group, known for their lush, harmonious sound and poetic lyrics. 5. Iron & Wine - the stage name for singer-songwriter Sam Beam, who's known for his sweet voice and soft, acoustic sound. I hope these recommendations help you find some new music to enjoy!",
