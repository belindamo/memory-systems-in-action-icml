But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger;\" | James begins by addressing his readers as \"beloved brethren\" and encourages them to be good listeners, slow to speak and slow to anger. |\n| 20 | \"for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.\" | James emphasizes that human anger is not righteous and does not accomplish God's purposes. |\n| 21 | \"Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls.\" | James urges his readers to put aside all sin and receive the Word of God with humility, acknowledging its power to save their souls. |\n| 22 | \"But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.\" | James emphasizes the importance of obeying God's Word, not just hearing it. Those who only hear the Word but do not obey it are self-deceived. |\n| 23 | \"For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;\" | James uses the analogy of a mirror to illustrate the point that hearing God's Word without obeying it is useless. It is like looking at oneself in a mirror and immediately forgetting what one looks like. |\n| 24 | \"for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.\" | The point of the previous verse is reinforced here, emphasizing the futility of hearing without obeying. |\n| 25 | \"But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.\" | James describes the one who looks intently at God's Word and obeys it as \"blessed.\" The \"law of liberty\" refers to the gospel, which sets believers free from the power of sin. |\n| 26 | \"If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man\u2019s religion is worthless.\" | James warns against false religion, which involves merely outward expressions of piety but lacks true obedience to God's Word. A failure to control one's tongue is a sign of false religion. |\n| 27 | \"Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.\" | James concludes by defining true religion as caring for the vulnerable and living a holy, set-apart life. This is the kind of religion that is acceptable to God. |\n\nIn summary, James urges his readers to be good listeners and slow to anger, and to put aside all sin and receive the Word of God with humility. He emphasizes the importance of obeying God's Word, warning against self-deception and false religion. True religion involves caring for the vulnerable and living a holy, set-apart life.",
