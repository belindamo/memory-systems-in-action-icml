Keeping them fresh for a longer period can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to share with you:\n\n1. **Store them in a cool, dry place:** Avoid storing fresh herbs near direct sunlight, heat, or moisture, as they can quickly wilt and lose their flavor. Keep them in a cool, dry place, like the refrigerator crisper drawer.\n2. **Wrap them in plastic wrap or aluminum foil:** Wrap the herbs tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent air from reaching them. This will help to slow down the wilting process.\n3. **Use a herb keeper or container:** Consider investing in a herb keeper or a container specifically designed for storing fresh herbs. These containers have built-in water reservoirs that help to keep the herbs hydrated and fresh.\n4. **Keep them hydrated:** Fresh herbs need water to stay fresh. Place the stems in a glass of water, like you would with cut flowers, and store them in the refrigerator. Change the water every few days to prevent bacterial growth.\n5. **Freeze them:** If you don't plan to use the herbs within a few days, consider freezing them. Simply chop the herbs, place them in an airtight container or freezer bag, and store them in the freezer for up to 6 months.\n6. **Use the \"stem-down\" method:** For herbs like cilantro and parsley, try storing them stem-down in a glass of water. This will help to keep the stems hydrated and prevent the leaves from getting soggy.\n7. **Monitor temperature:** Most herbs prefer temperatures between 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C). Avoid storing them near strong-smelling foods, as herbs can absorb odors easily.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your fresh herbs fresh for a longer period. Enjoy your delicious fajitas!",
