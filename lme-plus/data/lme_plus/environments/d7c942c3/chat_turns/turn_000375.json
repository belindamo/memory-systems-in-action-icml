Your primary products sold include roofing systems by GAF, vinyl siding from Royal Building Products, and Windows and Doors by ProVia. Your team uses the Sandler Selling System and focuses on uncovering pain, discussing budget, and understanding a customer's decision making process before ever jumping to a solution. Since we operate in Springfield, Illinois and the surrounding counties, we visit with many types of customers. Traditional families, older retirees, and rural homeowners are some of our biggest clientele. \n\nGiven this context, prepare an onboarding outline for a new sales representative. List the outline with subject lines only - limit prose. Then, prepare 4-5 paragraphs that best explain our company, our products, how we might better compete in the market, and top things a new salesman should keep in mind.",
