  "content": "The Big Barker 7\" Orthopedic Bolster Bed is a fantastic choice for Max!\n\nAs for discounts and promotions, Big Barker often offers various deals and discounts on their website and through authorized retailers. Here are a few ways to save:\n\n1. **Big Barker Website**: Check their website for any ongoing promotions, discounts, or bundle deals. They sometimes offer a 10% discount for first-time customers or a \"Buy One, Get One 10% Off\" deal.\n2. **Amazon Discounts**: Big Barker products are also available on Amazon, where you can find discounts, coupons, and promotions. Keep an eye on the prices and look for deals like \"Save 10% with Subscribe & Save\" or \"Clip the 10% Coupon.\"\n3. **Pet Supply Retailers**: Authorized retailers like Petco, Chewy, or 1800PetMeds might offer discounts or promotions on Big Barker products. Sign up for their newsletters or follow their social media accounts to stay informed about upcoming deals.\n4. **Coupons and Promo Codes**: Check websites like RetailMeNot, Coupons.com, or CouponCabin for Big Barker promo codes or discounts. You can also sign up for their newsletter to receive exclusive offers.\n\nRegarding your experience with Petco, I'm glad you were able to restock Luna's favorite grain-free salmon food! However, I understand that it can be inconvenient to travel to a physical store, especially when you're short on time. That's why online pet stores with fast shipping, like the ones I mentioned earlier, can be a great alternative.\n\nIf you're short on time, you can also consider using Petco's online services, such as their \"Buy Online, Pickup In-Store\" or \"Same-Day Delivery\" options (available in select areas). This way, you can order online and pick up the products at your convenience or have them delivered to your doorstep.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure Max will love his new Big Barker bed!",
