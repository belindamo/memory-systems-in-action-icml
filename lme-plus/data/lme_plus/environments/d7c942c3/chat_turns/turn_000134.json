  "content": "When attending a beginner's Ashtanga class at your local studio, it's likely that they will provide some props, but it's always a good idea to check with the studio beforehand. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Studio-provided props:**\n\n* Most yoga studios will provide blocks, straps, and blankets for students to use during class. These props can help with alignment, flexibility, and comfort.\n* Some studios might also offer other props like bolsters, pillows, or weights, depending on the specific class or style.\n\n**Investing in your own props:**\n\n* While studios usually provide props, having your own can be beneficial, especially if you plan to practice regularly. Your own props will be tailored to your personal needs and preferences, and you'll always have them available.\n* Blocks, straps, and blankets are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased at yoga studios, online retailers, or sporting goods stores.\n* If you have specific needs, such as a sensitive back or knees, you might consider investing in a high-quality yoga mat or additional props like a yoga wheel or foam blocks.\n\n**What to expect in a beginner's Ashtanga class:**\n\n* In a beginner's Ashtanga class, you can expect to focus on the fundamentals of the practice, including the sequence of postures, breathing techniques, and basic alignment principles.\n* The teacher will likely provide guidance on how to use props to assist with alignment, flexibility, and comfort.\n* Don't be afraid to ask the teacher or assistant for help with props or modifications during the class.\n\nBefore your first class, you might want to:\n\n* Call the studio or check their website to confirm their prop policy and availability.\n* Arrive a few minutes early to set up and get familiar with the studio's props and equipment.\n* Introduce yourself to the teacher and let them know you're new to Ashtanga and might need some guidance with props or modifications.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show up, be open-minded, and have fun!",
