  "content": "Certainly, I'll provide an exposition of James 1:12-18 verse by verse in a Markdown table format, based on the MacArthur NASB Study Bible and the ESV Study Bible by Crossway.\n\n| Verse | Text | Explanation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 12 | \"Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.\" | James continues his theme of perseverance under trial and promises a crown of life to those who persevere and love the Lord. |\n| 13 | \"Let no one say when he is tempted, \u201cI am being tempted by God\u201d; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.\" | James cautions against blaming God for temptation. God is not the source of temptation, but rather it comes from our own sinful desires. |\n| 14 | \"But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.\" | James explains that temptation arises from our own desires, which entice us and draw us away from God. |\n| 15 | \"Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.\" | James describes the progression of sin, from desire to action, and ultimately to death. Sin has a destructive power and leads to spiritual death. |\n| 16 | \"Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.\" | James warns his readers not to be deceived by the allure of sin, but to remember the truth of God's Word. |\n| 17 | \"Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.\" | James affirms that every good thing comes from God, who is unchanging and constant. He is the giver of all good gifts. |\n| 18 | \"In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.\" | James acknowledges that it is God's will that brings forth salvation, and that we are born again through the Word of truth. Believers are like the first fruits of God's creation, set apart for His purposes. |\n\nIn summary, James reminds his readers that temptation comes from their own desires and warns against blaming God. He affirms that all good things come from God, including salvation through the Word of truth.",
