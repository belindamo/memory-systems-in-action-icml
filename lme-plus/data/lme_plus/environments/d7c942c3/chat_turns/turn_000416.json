  "content": "While it's true that lectures on ethics can be helpful, an entire exam dedicated to it ensures that students have a deeper understanding of ethical considerations and are able to apply them in real-world situations. Ethics is not just a single topic that can be covered in one or two lectures, it's a complex subject that requires critical thinking, reflection, and application. A dedicated ethics exam helps to ensure that engineering students have a strong foundation in ethical decision-making processes and that they understand how to apply these principles in real-life situations.\n\nAdditionally, engineering professionals are often held to high ethical and professional standards, and a formal exam helps students prepare for the expectations they will face in their future careers. By demonstrating an understanding of ethics through an exam, engineering students show that they are committed to upholding ethical principles while designing and implementing solutions that can impact society in significant ways.\n\nIn conclusion, while lectures on ethics are useful, a dedicated exam provides a better way to test students' understanding and application of ethical principles in engineering practice, and ensures that engineering students are fully prepared to meet their future ethical challenges.",
