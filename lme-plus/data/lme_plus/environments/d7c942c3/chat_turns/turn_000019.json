  "content": "Cauliflower gnocchi sounds like a fantastic side dish! I've got a simple recipe for you that yields delicious and tender gnocchi. Here it is:\n\n**Simple Cauliflower Gnocchi Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 head of cauliflower\n* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1 egg\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Rice the cauliflower**: Remove the leaves and stem from the cauliflower, and pulse it in a food processor until it resembles rice.\n2. **Cook the cauliflower rice**: Saut\u00e9 the cauliflower rice in a pan with olive oil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until it's soft and lightly browned (about 5-7 minutes).\n3. **Cool and drain**: Let the cauliflower cool, then squeeze out as much liquid as possible using a cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel.\n4. **Mix with flour, Parmesan, egg, salt, and pepper**: In a bowl, combine the cooled cauliflower, flour, Parmesan, egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well until a dough forms.\n5. **Knead the dough**: Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes, until it's smooth and pliable.\n6. **Shape into gnocchi**: Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each piece into a long rope. Cut the rope into 1-inch pieces to form the gnocchi.\n7. **Cook the gnocchi**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi for 3-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface.\n8. **Serve**: Serve the cauliflower gnocchi with your favorite sauce, such as marinara, pesto, or a simple brown butter sage sauce.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to squeeze out as much liquid as possible from the cooked cauliflower to prevent the gnocchi from becoming too soggy.\n* If you find the dough too sticky, add a little more flour. If it's too dry, add a little more egg.\n* You can also add other flavorings like garlic, nutmeg, or dried herbs to the dough for extra flavor.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and devouring these cauliflower gnocchi!",
