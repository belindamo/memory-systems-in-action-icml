Since you'll be at the park early, you can scout out a comfortable and peaceful spot to unwind. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Find a shaded area**: Look for a spot under a tree or a gazebo to escape the direct sunlight and heat.\n2. **Sit near a water feature**: If the park has a pond, lake, or fountain, consider sitting nearby. The sound of water can be calming and meditative.\n3. **Choose a quiet corner**: Opt for a spot away from playgrounds, basketball courts, or other areas that might be noisy or crowded.\n4. **Look for a grassy hill or slope**: A gentle hill can provide a comfortable spot to sit and relax, with a nice view of the surrounding area.\n5. **Find a bench with a view**: If you prefer to sit on a bench, look for one with a nice view of the park's scenery, such as a garden, a walking trail, or a scenic overlook.\n\nWhen you find your spot, take a few moments to:\n\n* Take deep breaths and focus on your breath\n* Notice the sights and sounds around you\n* Feel the sun, breeze, or shade on your skin\n* Reflect on your intentions for your yoga practice or simply enjoy the present moment\n\nBy taking a few minutes to relax and center yourself, you'll be more prepared for your yoga class and can make the most of your practice.\n\nEnjoy your time at the park, and I hope you find a lovely spot to unwind before your yoga class!",
