  "content": "Thank you for the response. I'd like to add more context to your understanding of our company. We differentiate ourselves as a full-service remodeler. We have been in business over 75 years and have a full team, across departments, to support our customers. We offer warranty support, emergency support, and have many repeat customers. We do not claim to be the cheapest. Our products are high quality and our team is not a \"chuck in a truck\" style handyman. Our full suite of services is a differentiating factor. We compete on value, and like to compare ourselves to other companies/brands that sell professional level products in a full-service capacity. \n\nOur brands, ProVia, Royal Building Products, and GAF are professional class. Research each product and write a short summary on how these products are superior to other ones on the market.",
