Thank you for helping me reflect on my relationships and experiences that contradict this belief. I now choose to stop protecting myself by avoiding close relationships out of fear. I receive a new belief that I am deserving of love and capable of giving love, regardless of my mother's expectations. I will practice actively seeking and cultivating deep, meaningful relationships while recognizing and asserting personal boundaries. This new belief and practice will help me realize increased self-esteem, healthier relationships, greater self-compassion, and improved overall well-being, affirming my new identity as a person deserving of love and capable of giving love. Amen.\"",
