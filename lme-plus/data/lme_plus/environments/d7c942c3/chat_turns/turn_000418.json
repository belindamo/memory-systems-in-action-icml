  "content": "While having good character and a strong moral compass is crucial for ethical decision-making, relying solely on common sense and personal values might not always be sufficient when faced with complex ethical dilemmas. Ethics is a complex subject that requires a deep understanding of different ethical theories, principles, and their applications in engineering practice. A formal ethics exam ensures that engineering students are familiar with various ethical frameworks and are equipped with the critical thinking skills to navigate complex ethical dilemmas.\n\nMoreover, the engineering profession is one that is governed by specific codes of ethics and professional responsibilities, and it is essential for engineering students to understand these codes and responsibilities. By taking an ethics exam, engineering students are better prepared to uphold ethical standards and meet the expectations of their profession.\n\nIn conclusion, while personal values and common sense are critical to ethical decision-making, a formal ethics exam provides a more comprehensive and structured approach to learning about ethics, and ensures that engineering students are prepared to make ethical decisions in complex real-world scenarios.",
