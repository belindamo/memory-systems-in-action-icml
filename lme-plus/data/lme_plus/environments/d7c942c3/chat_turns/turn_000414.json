  "content": "While lawyers and policymakers play an important role in setting legal and ethical standards, engineers are often the ones tasked with designing and implementing solutions that directly impact people and society. For example, engineers may be responsible for designing infrastructure, developing new technologies, or creating products that have significant impacts on the environment and society. Therefore, it's important for engineers to have a strong ethical foundation to ensure that their work is safe, just, and beneficial to society.\n\nIncorporating ethics into engineering education doesn't take away from the technical focus of engineering, but rather adds an important dimension to it. Ethics helps engineers broaden their perspective and become more aware of the social implications of their work. By considering the ethical implications of their work, engineers can create more sustainable and equitable solutions for society.\n\nIn summary, ethics is an essential component of engineering and helps engineers make decisions that contribute to the greater good while still considering the technical aspects of their work.",
