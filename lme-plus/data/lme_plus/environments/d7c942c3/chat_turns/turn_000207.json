  "content": "Southwest Airlines is a great choice, and using the voucher on a Southwest flight makes sense.\n\nAccording to Southwest Airlines' route network, they do operate direct flights from Chicago (MDW) to both Denver (DEN) and Las Vegas (LAS).\n\nFrom Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW), Southwest offers multiple daily direct flights to:\n\n* Denver International Airport (DEN)\n* Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (LAS)\n\nPlease note that flight schedules and availability may vary depending on the day of the week, time of year, and other factors. I recommend checking Southwest's website or mobile app to confirm the most up-to-date flight schedules and to book your flight.\n\nWhen you're ready to book, make sure to enter your voucher number during the booking process to redeem your $200 credit. If you have any issues or questions, Southwest's customer service team will be happy to assist you.\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you enjoy your trip to Denver or Las Vegas!",
