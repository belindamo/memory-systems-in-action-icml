Regarding wraparound balconies, I have some good news for you:\n\n**Wraparound Balcony Rooms:**\n\nThe Fontainebleau Miami Beach does offer some Deluxe Oceanfront Rooms with wraparound balconies, but they are limited and scattered throughout the Oceanfront Tower. These rooms are often referred to as \"Corner Rooms\" or \"Wraparound Balcony Rooms.\"\n\n**Corner Rooms with Wraparound Balconies:**\n\nThese rooms are located on the southeast and northeast corners of the Oceanfront Tower, offering stunning 180-degree views of the ocean and the Miami Beach coastline. The wraparound balcony provides ample outdoor space to enjoy the sunrise, sunset, and everything in between.\n\n**Room Numbers:**\n\nWhile room assignments are subject to change, here are some room numbers that are known to have wraparound balconies:\n\n* Room 1416 (14th floor, southeast corner)\n* Room 1516 (15th floor, southeast corner)\n* Room 1616 (16th floor, southeast corner)\n* Room 1417 (14th floor, northeast corner)\n* Room 1517 (15th floor, northeast corner)\n* Room 1617 (16th floor, northeast corner)\n\nPlease note that these room numbers are not guaranteed, and the hotel may assign a different room with a wraparound balcony. It's always best to request a specific room or room type when booking and to confirm with the hotel directly.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* When booking, ask specifically for a Deluxe Oceanfront Room with a wraparound balcony on a high floor (14-17).\n* Be prepared for a higher room rate compared to a standard Deluxe Oceanfront Room.\n* If you're celebrating a special occasion, consider booking a room with a wraparound balcony for an unforgettable experience.\n\nKeep in mind that the Fontainebleau Miami Beach is a large resort, and room assignments can change. However, by requesting a specific room type and floor, you'll increase your chances of getting a room with a stunning wraparound balcony.\n\nNow, imagine yourself sipping coffee or cocktails on that expansive balcony, taking in the breathtaking ocean views..."
