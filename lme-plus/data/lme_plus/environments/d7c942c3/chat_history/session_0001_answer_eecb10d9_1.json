      "content": "Roasted sweet potatoes are a great addition to your dinner party! Achieving that perfect crispy outside and fluffy inside can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you get it just right:\n\n**Tips for Perfectly Roasted Sweet Potatoes:**\n\n1. **Choose the right sweet potatoes**: Look for sweet potatoes that are high in starch, like Russet or Idaho potatoes. These will yield a crisper outside and fluffier inside.\n2. **Cut them correctly**: Cut the sweet potatoes into your desired shape, such as wedges, cubes, or thin slices. Try to make the cuts uniform so they roast evenly.\n3. **Dry them thoroughly**: Pat the sweet potatoes dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps the potatoes brown better and crisp up in the oven.\n4. **Use the right oil**: Use a high-heat oil like avocado oil or grapeseed oil to roast the sweet potatoes. These oils have a high smoke point, which means they can handle high temperatures without burning or smoking.\n5. **Season liberally**: Toss the sweet potatoes with salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you like (e.g., garlic powder, paprika, or chili powder) before roasting.\n6. **Roast at the right temperature**: Roast the sweet potatoes at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until they're tender and caramelized. You can also try roasting them at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for a slightly longer time.\n7. **Don't overcrowd**: Spread the sweet potatoes out in a single layer on the baking sheet to allow for even roasting. Overcrowding can lead to steaming instead of roasting.\n8. **Shake it up**: Halfway through the roasting time, shake the baking sheet to redistribute the sweet potatoes and promote even browning.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve that perfect crispy outside and fluffy inside.\n\nAnd yay for using a grocery list app! It's always a lifesaver when planning meals and keeping track of ingredients. Which app are you using, by the way?",

Mix well until a dough forms.\n5. **Knead the dough**: Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes, until it's smooth and pliable.\n6. **Shape into gnocchi**: Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each piece into a long rope.

Cook the gnocchi for 3-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface.\n8. **Serve**: Serve the cauliflower gnocchi with your favorite sauce, such as marinara, pesto, or a simple brown butter sage sauce.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to squeeze out as much liquid as possible from the cooked cauliflower to prevent the gnocchi from becoming too soggy.\n* If you find the dough too sticky, add a little more flour. If it's too dry, add a little more egg.\n* You can also add other flavorings like garlic, nutmeg, or dried herbs to the dough for extra flavor.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and devouring these cauliflower gnocchi!",
