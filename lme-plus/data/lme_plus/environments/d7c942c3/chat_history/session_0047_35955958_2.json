By the way, speaking of pet supplies, I recently had to restock his sister Luna's food - the grain-free salmon flavor, which is her absolute favorite."

Look for one with a sturdy bolster on the sides to support his joints and provide a sense of security.\n2. **Orthopedic Memory Foam Bed**: An orthopedic memory foam bed can provide excellent support for Max's joints, especially since he's still young and energetic. This type of bed can help reduce joint stress and promote a comfortable night's sleep.\n3. **Plush Pillow Bed**: A plush pillow bed with a soft, cushioned surface can be perfect for a stretchy pup like Max. Look for one with a removable cover for easy washing and maintenance.\n\nSome popular pet bed brands that you might want to consider include:\n\n* Big Barker\n* K&H Pet Products\n* PetFusion\n* Armarkat\n* Pawfect Pets\n\nAs for Luna's food, it's great that you've found a grain-free salmon flavor that she loves!
