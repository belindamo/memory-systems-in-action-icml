I'll share it for approval and the roommates can all split the costs"

      "content": "Dear Roommates,\n\nI hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to talk about our common space in the living room downstairs. As you know, we all spend a lot of time in this area, and I think we can all agree that it could use a bit of a revitalization.\n\nThe purpose of this revitalization is to create a better space for us to hang out and spend more time together. I believe that by creating a more inviting and comfortable environment, we can all benefit from a greater sense of community and camaraderie.\n\nTo start, I propose that we begin with phase one of the revitalization, which involves adding a TV, TV stand, and coffee table. This will provide us with a central hub for entertainment and relaxation. If we are all in agreement, I am happy to take point on finding suitable furniture on Facebook Marketplace. I will share my finds with everyone for approval, and we can all split the costs evenly.\n\nIn addition to phase one, I would also like to propose that we consider phase two of the revitalization, which involves adding an additional sectional couch if desired. This will provide us with even more seating and comfort in our common space.\n\nI am excited about the possibilities that this revitalization project presents, and I hope that we can all work together to create a more enjoyable and welcoming living space.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\nJason"

      "content": "Sure, here's an additional paragraph:\n\nAs best friends and roommates, it's important for us to make time to bond and connect with each other. Having a comfortable and inviting living space can help facilitate this and create opportunities for us to hang out, have conversations, and enjoy each other's company. We all lead busy lives and have our own individual pursuits, but by investing in our living space, we can also invest in our friendship and create lasting memories. I hope that this revitalization project can help us strengthen our bond and make our living space feel like a true home for all of us."
