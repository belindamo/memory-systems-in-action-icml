      "content": "I'm sorry, I'm not aware of any specific product called \"Meta Quest 2\" that is a VR gaming headset. Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed list of hardware features for a product that does not exist. However, in general, VR gaming headsets typically have a number of features such as a high resolution display, a wide field of view, low latency, and precise motion tracking. They also typically require a powerful computer or gaming console to operate and may include additional hardware such as controllers for hand tracking and motion sensing."

      "content": "Yes, the Oculus Quest 2 is a standalone VR gaming headset, which means it does not require a connection to a computer or gaming console to operate.

However, it can also be connected to a computer via a USB cable to access additional features and content through the Oculus Link feature. The Oculus Link feature allows users to play PC VR games on their Oculus Quest 2 and use it as a PC VR headset.\n\nAdditionally, the Oculus Quest 2 can be connected to a gaming console using the Oculus Air Link feature which allows users to play some console games on the Quest 2 wirelessly.\n\nIt should be noted that in order to use the features such as Oculus Link or Oculus Air Link, the computer or gaming console must meet the minimum system requirements."
