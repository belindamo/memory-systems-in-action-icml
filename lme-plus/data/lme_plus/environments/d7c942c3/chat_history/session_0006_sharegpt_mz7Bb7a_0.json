You can also replace \"fra02\" in the above IP address with other locations like \"ams\", \"par\", \"sto\", \"dub\", \"mad\", \"lhr\", \"mil\", \"lis\", \"vie\", \"waw\", \"ams\" or \"cdg\" to test the latency from different locations.\n\nKeep in mind that latency can be affected by many factors, including your internet connection, network congestion, and distance from the server. Therefore, a single ping test may not provide a complete picture of your overall latency to the service."
