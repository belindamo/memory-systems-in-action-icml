      "content": "Fresh herbs can make a huge difference in the flavor and aroma of your fajitas. Keeping them fresh for a longer period can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to share with you:\n\n1. **Store them in a cool, dry place:** Avoid storing fresh herbs near direct sunlight, heat, or moisture, as they can quickly wilt and lose their flavor. Keep them in a cool, dry place, like the refrigerator crisper drawer.\n2. **Wrap them in plastic wrap or aluminum foil:** Wrap the herbs tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent air from reaching them. This will help to slow down the wilting process.\n3. **Use a herb keeper or container:** Consider investing in a herb keeper or a container specifically designed for storing fresh herbs. These containers have built-in water reservoirs that help to keep the herbs hydrated and fresh.\n4. **Keep them hydrated:** Fresh herbs need water to stay fresh. Place the stems in a glass of water, like you would with cut flowers, and store them in the refrigerator. Change the water every few days to prevent bacterial growth.\n5. **Freeze them:** If you don't plan to use the herbs within a few days, consider freezing them. Simply chop the herbs, place them in an airtight container or freezer bag, and store them in the freezer for up to 6 months.\n6. **Use the \"stem-down\" method:** For herbs like cilantro and parsley, try storing them stem-down in a glass of water. This will help to keep the stems hydrated and prevent the leaves from getting soggy.\n7. **Monitor temperature:** Most herbs prefer temperatures between 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C). Avoid storing them near strong-smelling foods, as herbs can absorb odors easily.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your fresh herbs fresh for a longer period. Enjoy your delicious fajitas!",

      "content": "The brown butter sage sauce is a game-changer! It's a classic Italian combination that pairs perfectly with the cauliflower gnocchi.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the cauliflower gnocchi according to package instructions until they float to the surface. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining the gnocchi.\n2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue cooking the butter, stirring occasionally, until it turns golden brown and smells nutty (about 5-7 minutes).\n3. Add the chopped sage leaves to the brown butter and cook for 1-2 minutes, until crispy and fragrant. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n4. Add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet, tossing to coat with the brown butter sage sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water.\n5.
