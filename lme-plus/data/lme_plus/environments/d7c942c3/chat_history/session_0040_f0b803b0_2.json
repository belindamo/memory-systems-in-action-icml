What type of coffee was it (e.g., espresso, latte, drip coffee)? And approximately how much did you drink (e.g., 1 shot, 1 cup, 2 cups)?\n\nWe can use this as our starting point, and then you can update me on your coffee consumption for the rest of the week."

Did you have any other coffee or caffeinated beverages on Monday, or would you like to report your coffee intake for Tuesday?"

Let's assume it was around 10 oz (300ml) for our tracking purposes.\n\nA 10 oz cup of coffee typically contains around 100-150mg of caffeine. Since you mentioned it was a small cup, let's assume it was closer to 100mg.\n\nSo, for Wednesday, you had:\n\n* 1 small cup of coffee (around 10 oz) = 100mg of caffeine\n\nLet's update the total:\n\n* Monday: 150mg\n* Tuesday: 0mg\n* Wednesday: 100mg\n* Total: 250mg\n\nHow about Thursday?
