the most inspired choice but actually it's full of flavor and in this video I'm going to explain why by talking around the exterior the interior and take it for a drive and of course I'm going to launch it to see how quick this car is from north 60 miles an hour because I'm at Watson and you're watching car wow and if you haven't done so already make sure you subscribe to this Channel and hit the Bell icon that way you won't miss any of these reviews Buy sell car wow let's start this video by talking about the design because the previous generation honda civic was a little bit there's too many like fake Vents and stuff going on it was a little bit odd really this one is much better though I have noticed some fakery already that diffuser is not a diffuser it's fake and there's even fake exhausty bits here other than that though really like the rear end of it nice sweeping tailgate looks quite sporty really notice it around the side it's got a really good silhouette this car I like it a lot you don't get short changed if you go for like one of the Lesser trims they all look pretty much the same any real difference on the outside is the entry level model gets 17 inteller Wheels all of those get 18s but yeah good strong creases in the body panels also if it's get LED headlights as standard though said the most cars these days oh from the front I really like the look of the nose of this car yeah it's good looking they've done a brilliant job what do you think do you agree with me let me know in the comments in terms of the price though it is quite expensive the Honda Civic range kicks off at just under look 30 000 pounds here it is on Caro though through Caro you can get a saving of about 600 pounds off one the savings do change so if you're thinking about buying a car head to Carlow out and see what offers are available on whatever car you're looking for if you wanna do that at a later date just simply Google help me Carl wow and we will help you choose your perfect car here on the inside the new Honda Civic has a nice neat and tidy design very simple Dash layout squidging materials on top which help make it feel and look premium also like what they've done with the air vents they're like integrated into this mesh here and you control the direction with these knobby bits here I also like the fact they haven't been tempted to put the controls for the climate in the infotainment screen instead you have physical knobs everyone loves a physical knob especially when you have knobs which are slightly illuminated and provide information like they do on this one like oh lovely luck I can yeah anyway stop it always happens maybe one of the infotainment system itself nice big screen it's reasonably responsive colors are pretty clear and the graphics they're all right not the sharpest but not the Dulles it's definitely better than the system in the old Civic which was just a bit of a nightmare anyhow no that really matters because what you do is plug in your phone use Apple carplay Android auto aren't you moving on to the driver's display only the very top spec car gets a full digital system all the other models have Port digital part analog which just seems odd the driving position though is not odd it's very good I love Honda driving positions plenty of adjustment in the steering wheel and the seats this been the top spec car you get electrical operation speaking of which you also get part of the seats so I think this bit is leather and this bit is fake leather why don't they just do all leather toxic also gets a sunroof which does come on do it chose the wrong button I'm not having a good day yeah it opens which is always good and it's a decent size sometimes when you have opening sun roofs they're just small this one's good storage yeah we've got some space under here this surprise there's no USB port in here the USBs are here and they're old-fashioned USB a or whatever they're called no usbcs you do get a wireless charging port but once again only on the top spit model and for old-fashioned people there's a 12 volt socket there now let me do a center console wobble test solid up there but the lower part is moving however you're not really going to be doing that are you one way to test quality and a new test I'm going to introduce is the stalk test so I will test things like the wipers and the indicators to just see how they feel because you touch those a lot and these have a nice solid damp to feel to them look springy yet damped at the last bit oh satisfying that's quality anyway cup holders let's do it it can just fit bigger bottles and the door bins are big enough as well they fit bigger bottles too so that's all good it's a well thought out cabin and here's an example of how well thought out is well look at this right so you've got sun visor and it moves up there a bit older that but they don't all do that see they thought about this Honda have and they created a nice sensible easy car to live with here in the back knee room is good that seats in my driving position Headroom though if I sit up straight there with that much space people have a six foot will find it quite tight for Headroom now there is this lump in the floor which just eats into foot space if you can three in the backup once however this car is actually quite wide so even with adults in the back there's enough shoulder room the issue is for the people on the attitude seats they end up hitting their head on this slopey roof line which curves inwards it is easy when it comes to fitting a babysitting it's got those so there's plenty of space to get the child seat through the door and there's enough space back here to have a bulky rear facing seat as well without having to push the passenger chair forward at all I like that we've also got two USB ports here once again show them not USBC big big big big door pockets and decent sized door bins there's also an armrest which folds down here with a couple of cup holders there they're quite shallow so unless you really read your bottle in it's going to drop out there is one thing that's missing though there is no through loading at all shame now let's check out the boot so the capacity is 410 liters which is bigger than the boot on a Kia seed a Toyota Corolla Ford Focus a Volkswagen Golf pretty much any car apart from the unfeasibly large booty of the square roctavia bit of an issue though there is a bit of a load lip to lift things over so if your suitcase is really heavy oh no you might end up doing that and scratching like the bumper and then getting really mad and then just hurling your heavy suitcase I don't know why that makes me so angry I'm gonna need to go seek some help anyway underneath here there is a bit of storage it looks like it's been recessed for a spare wheel which you don't get at all in the United Kingdom odd there's some tie down points here up another one over there a couple there there you've got your 12 volt socket there that's all good and then when you fall down the seats which is quite easy to do you don't have a completely flat floor oh now I've got to get my suitcase back with me why do I do this I know I shouldn't do this I need to stop it oh look it's a bit harder to slide things in the front see just you know imagine that was quite heavy it's not perfect another thing that's a little bit not perfect is this if you get the range shopping model it comes with a Bose sound system which is brilliant the only thing is is that you have a subwoofer here in the boot it takes up five liters of space which isn't that much but it could be an important five liters if you want to carry some golf clubs by not having that extra recess bit here you might not be able to fit a full set with a driver across there like that that brings down to five nine things about the new Honda Civic the rear window is really big but the wiper for it is quite small looking you can see the area there that's all it can clean I'll show you again actually spray the spray yeah so that means all this will remain dirty and what you do clean ends up running all over the back of your car making that grimy running Android auto and Apple carplay only apple carplay is Wireless not Android why Honda only gives a three-year warranty with the Civic whereas it's key competitors from Asia such as Hyundai and Toyota give their cars five year in fact Kia give theirs seven years the glove box looks massive on the outside look at the cutout for it but check this out for some reason the door is padded so it's not quite as deep or as useful as you might think look it's way smaller than you imagine isn't it the gear selector is just over complicated so you've got this for the reverse up for neutral up there for Park then drive down here and all the buttons are slightly different I can understand why they've done it so they feel different however sometimes you're just putting your hands in the wrong place if you're not looking directly down at it be much easier like many manufacturers to just have a simple lever and then a button for bark don't worry there's still plenty to like about this car here's a car wait five core features there are four different regen modes when you lift off the accelerator for putting energy back into the battery so you can increase the rate at which the car slows down by pulling on the paddle one two three four times to get the maximum and to reduce it again you just use the plus pedal not all normal sensible family cars have a driving mode selector but this does look so you've got economy you've got normal and you've got sport but this goes on better it has a customizable mode look at that you can actually mix and match the different settings just as you like it Honda has a cleverest Low cover look at this it's retractable and it's so easy to remove which means it's simple to store it's very light so you can throw it easily as well it even comes back to you wow got my fingers I thought it was clever so outsmarted me the location of the rear seat belt Runner means that they never get snagged on the seats when you fold them down look completely separate all Honda Civics come with auto cruise control as standard so the car keep your safe distance from the car in front and steer to keep you in Lane just takes the strain out of long distance driving there is only one engine option on the Honda Civic and it's a two liter hybrid though it's a little bit unusual how it works you see the engine doesn't normally Drive the front wheels instead it acts as a generator to produce electricity which goes into a little battery which is then used to power an electric motor which does the driving of the front wheels so effectively you're just driving around normally like an electric car with that producing the electricity and what that means is that the petrol engine can actually work at its most efficient level rather than you just coming on and off the throttle and revving up and down and not being at the best place for converting Perpetual fuel into Forward Motion however when you're at higher speeds that method isn't as efficient as it is around town and so what happens then is that you get a clutch engage between the engine and the front wheels and then the engine does actually then drive different wheels at a ratio of one to one because there is no gearbox so the speed at the engine is the speed of the wheels it's absolutely confusing it really is but to save you some confusion when it comes to choosing which trim level of Honda Civic you should get I'm going to configure what I think is the best trim level and if you want to see what that is and the current saving through car wow on the Honda Civic click on the pop-up band up there or follow the link in the description below now let's see what this Honda Civic is like to drive I'm going to start off in town first thing to note is that the visibility forwards is brilliant it's got a low Dash a nice big wide windscreen still also helps driving around town steering is reasonably light there's no gears to think of axis are automatic in fact I'm just driving around on electric power alone right now the brakes are really smooth and Progressive you don't really notice that the first part of the braking is actually regen as the cars putting energy back into the battery the only time when you realize that it is an electric car with regen is if you're crawling along sometimes surprised they make these like groaning sound didn't do it then classic who knows I'm going to show you see one thing I can't complain about is the suspension over bumps really does a good job of dealing with bumps potholes speed humps it's a very very nice car to drive right twisty Road time it's going to sports mode Sports there we are oh notice that the throttle seems to sharper now funny thing about this is even though it hasn't really got a gearbox you kind of think it has look it changes gear but it doesn't really it's lies it's Faking It it's weird and the noise it's digitized this noise just play for the speakers but it makes you think that you've actually got an engine that's revving like a normal engine would when it's attached to a normal gearbox it's actually just faked I don't know how it fakes it because there is no gearbox it doesn't make sense see what doesn't make sense either how well this thing actually Corners it really is genuinely good fun on a twisty Road it just seems to deal with the bumps really well hooks up drives around and tells you exactly what it's doing through your bottom look just grips and it makes a decent noise even though it's fake and I know he's just lying to me I don't mind being lied to not on this occasion actually I'm going to show you the whole acceleration thing again because it's just weird so I would take the car in front here we go revved out there so he's changed gear and again but it's not actually changing gear what absolute witchcraft it's bizarre but brilliant it's essentially being driven by its electric motor the whole time yet it gives you the Sensation that it's being driven by an internal combustion engine directly through a gearbox of the wheels but it's not I'm gonna do it again cruising at 50 overtaking looks like it's dropped again now it's changed up and it's quite a decent noise I can't get over and I'll keep going on about it I just can't get over it it feels totally natural I I'm dumbfounded anyway the economy this thing is averaging over 50 miles per the gallon so that system of having a petrol engine to drive a motor which works as a generator to produce electricity to drive another electric motor is actually quite efficient even though it's just hard to comprehend well I think I should point out though is that when you do floor this car and you really need constant acceleration it does connect the engine to the wheels via our clutch system but there is no gearbox as such so it's still weird I need to shut up now let's get over it man go over it it drives nice this Honda espresso note 60 in 8.1 seconds but we'll find out why specialist timing gear says now in sports mode Let's Do It foreign seconds the pickup because it's just driven by an electric motor really just nuts well I totally don't believe that I'll have to do it again maybe my specialist timing gear was playing I'm going to reset it that's another go can't be right [Music] sounds quick 6.93 that time I can't believe he's doing sub seven seconds who are you [Music] so then what's my final verdict on the new Honda Civic should you avoid it should you consider it actually shortlist it or should you just go right ahead and buy it I think you should shortlist it it really is a great all-round family hatchback I hope you'll enjoyed the video if you did give it a like let me know what you think of my verdict in the comments below if you want to watch some more videos just click on those windows there thanks for watching\""

The car is available in different trim levels, with the entry-level model getting 17-inch wheels, and all other models getting 18-inch wheels.\n\nThe interior of the Civic is simple and tidy, with a clean dashboard layout and premium-feeling materials. The air vents are integrated into a mesh, and the controls for the climate are physical knobs, which many people prefer. The infotainment system has a big screen that is reasonably responsive, and the driving position is very good, with plenty of adjustment in the steering wheel and the seats.\n\nOne drawback of the Civic is that the base model doesn't come with a full digital driver's display, and the top-spec model is the only one that has a wireless charging port. The car has a well-thought-out cabin, with plenty of storage and space for larger bottles. The back seat has good knee room, but headroom may be tight for taller people.\n\nIn terms of performance, the Civic has a quick acceleration from 0-60 miles per hour, and it handles well on the road. Whether you're looking for a practical car to live with, or a car that has plenty of flavor, the new Honda Civic is a good choice."
