  "content": "Sure! Here are some websites and resources that may help you find the latest real estate data and compare housing prices in different neighborhoods:\n\n1. Zillow - This is a popular housing marketplace that provides information on homes for sale, rent, and even sold recently. They also offer a \"Zestimate\" which is an estimate of a home's value based on the latest data they have. 2. Redfin - This is another popular housing marketplace that provides listings of homes for sale, rent, and recently sold homes. They also offer a \"Redfin Estimate\" which is an estimate of a home's value based on public records data and local real estate market trends. 3. Realtor.com - This website provides listings of homes for sale and rent, as well as home value estimates and local housing market trends. 4. Trulia - Similar to Zillow and Redfin, this website provides listings of homes for sale and rent, as well as home value estimates and local housing market trends. 5. MLS - Most real estate agents have access to their local Multiple Listing Service (MLS), which is a database where real estate professionals list and sell properties. You can ask your real estate agent to share latest housing data from the MLS to help you compare housing prices in different neighborhoods. Remember, these websites can provide helpful information, but it's always recommended that you work with a real estate professional who can help you interpret the data and provide expert advice based on your needs and circumstances.",
