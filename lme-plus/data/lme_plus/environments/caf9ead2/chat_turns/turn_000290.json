  "content": "The \"collection.anki2-journal\" file is a temporary file that Anki uses to store changes to the Anki collection database file (\"collection.anki2\") before committing those changes to the main database file. It is a part of Anki's mechanism for ensuring data integrity and preventing data loss in case of unexpected shutdowns or other errors.\n\nWhen Anki is closed normally, any changes stored in the \"collection.anki2-journal\" file are committed to the main database file. However, if Anki crashes or is forcibly closed, the changes in the journal file may not be fully committed, which can lead to data loss or corruption of the main database file.\n\nIf you encounter issues with Anki, deleting the \"collection.anki2-journal\" file is a troubleshooting step you can try. However, note that doing so will cause any uncommitted changes to the database to be lost. It is therefore recommended that you back up your Anki database before attempting to delete the journal file.",
