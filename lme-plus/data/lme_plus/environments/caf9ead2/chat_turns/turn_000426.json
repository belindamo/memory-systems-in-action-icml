  "content": "The Reformation's lasting impact on religious practices outside of Christianity is more complicated. While the Reformation was a Christian movement that primarily focused on reforming the Catholic Church, some of its ideas and values did indirectly influence religious practices and beliefs in other parts of the world.\n\nFor example, the Reformation's emphasis on individual interpretation of religious texts and the rejection of traditional religious hierarchies resonated with some movements in Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. In India, for instance, the Bhakti movement was inspired by the Protestant emphasis on direct personal experience with God and the rejection of religious rituals.\n\nAdditionally, some Native American religions have similarities with Protestantism, such as their belief in an immediate spiritual connection with a higher power and the importance of individual interpretation of religious texts. The Reformation also led to the spread of the printing press, which facilitated the dissemination of religious texts, including non-Christian religious texts.\n\nHowever, the Reformation's direct impact on non-Christian world religions is relatively limited, as they have their own distinct traditions, practices, and beliefs that were not directly affected by the Reformation.",
