  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal connections with real estate agents in the area, but I can suggest some tips on how to find a good one:\n\n1. Referrals - Ask friends or family who have recently worked with a real estate agent and see if they have any recommendations. Personal referrals from people you trust can be a great way to find a reliable agent.\n\n2. Online reviews - Look up real estate agents in the San Gabriel Valley area on websites like Zillow, Yelp or Google, and read reviews from past clients to get an idea of their reputation and expertise.\n\n3. Agent interviews - Before choosing an agent, set up a few appointments to meet with them and interview them. Ask about their experience, their pricing, their communication style, and what they can do to help you find your dream home.\n\n4. Area of specialization - Look for an agent who specializes in the particular neighborhoods or property types you're interested in, as they may have better insights and connections in that specific market.\n\nUltimately, it's important to find a real estate agent who understands your needs and goals, and who can guide you through the sometimes complex process of buying a home.",
