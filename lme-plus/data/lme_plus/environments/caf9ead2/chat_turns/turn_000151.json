  "content": "It sounds like you're getting settled into your new place, and it's taking some time to adjust to the commute.\n\nSince you mentioned the drive to your parents' house took around 2 hours, I'm going to take a wild guess that you're not in a super urban area, and your new apartment might be in a suburb or a smaller city.\n\nAssuming that's the case, I'd recommend checking out online review sites like Yelp or Google Maps to find coffee shops in your area. You can filter your search by rating, distance, and amenities like free Wi-Fi and outdoor seating.\n\nYou might also want to ask your coworkers or neighbors for recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge on the best coffee spots in the area.\n\nIf you're willing to share, what's the general area or region you're living in? I can try to give you more tailored advice or even suggest some popular coffee shops in your area.",
