  "content": "Hosting a game night with friends is always a blast!\n\nConsidering you and your friends are familiar with board games, I'd recommend the following games that are a step up from Settlers of Catan in terms of complexity:\n\n1. **Pandemic Legacy**: A cooperative game where you work together to stop the spread of diseases and save the world. It's a bit more complex than Settlers, with a unique Legacy system that adds a new layer of strategy and replayability.\n2. **Scythe**: A highly-regarded game set in an alternate history of the 1920s, where you manage resources, build structures, and recruit units to conquer territories. It's a bit more complex than Settlers, with a lot of depth and replayability.\n3. **El Grande**: A game of area control and strategy, where you take on the roles of Spanish nobles vying for influence in a medieval kingdom. It's a bit more complex than Settlers, with a unique mechanic of using cards to place your followers.\n4. **7 Wonders**: A card-drafting game where you build up your civilization by collecting cards representing different structures, technologies, and military units. It's a bit more complex than Settlers, with a lot of depth and replayability.\n5. **Terraforming Mars**: A resource management and engine-building game where you work to terraform the planet Mars and make it habitable. It's a bit more complex than Settlers, with a lot of depth and replayability.\n\nAll of these games offer a higher level of complexity and strategy than Settlers of Catan, but are still accessible and fun for experienced gamers. You can choose one that fits your group's interests and preferences.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Playtime**: How much time do you have available for the game night? Some games can take 60-90 minutes to play, while others might take longer.\n* **Number of players**: Make sure the game you choose is suitable for the number of players attending your game night.\n* **Interests**: Consider the themes and mechanics that appeal to your friends. If they enjoy science fiction, Terraforming Mars might be a great choice. If they prefer history, Scythe or El Grande could be a good fit.\n\nTake your time, and choose a game that you think your friends will enjoy. Good luck, and have a fantastic game night!",
