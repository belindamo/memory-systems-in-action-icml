Taking the stairs instead of the elevator is a fantastic way to get some extra exercise, and it's great that you're making a conscious effort to do so.\n\nNow that you're living closer to work, you might find that you have more opportunities to walk or engage in other physical activities during your daily commute. Maybe you could try walking to work one day a week, or exploring nearby parks or trails during your lunch break.\n\nIt's also awesome that you're making an effort to prioritize your health and fitness. Remember to celebrate your small victories along the way, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Those small changes can add up to make a big difference over time!\n\nHow's your new apartment complex? Are there any amenities like a gym or fitness center that you're taking advantage of?",
