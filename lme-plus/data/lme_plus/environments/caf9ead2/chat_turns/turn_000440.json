  "content": "Non-renewable energy is energy that comes from sources that cannot be replenished in a short period of time. These sources are finite, meaning that they will eventually run out. The most common sources of non-renewable energy are fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nFossil fuels formed millions of years ago from the remains of plants and animals that were buried and subjected to high temperatures and pressures. These processes converted the organic matter into hydrocarbons, which are the main components of fossil fuels. They are called non-renewable because they take millions of years to form, and once they are extracted and used, they cannot be replaced.\n\nThe use of non-renewable energy sources has many environmental and economic downsides. The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the air, contributing to climate change and air pollution. Additionally, extracting and transporting fossil fuels can be dangerous, and their increasing use is driving up global demand and prices.\n\nNon-renewable energy sources are also finite, which means that once they are depleted, they will not be available for future use. This is why many countries and organizations are promoting the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro power, which are sustainable and can be replenished in a relatively short period of time.",
