  "content": "Yeah, I think Carcassonne would be a great choice for my girlfriend. We actually played a game together a few weeks ago and she really enjoyed it. I taught her how to play and she picked it up quickly. We're planning to play again soon. Speaking of teaching people how to play, I've found that it's really helpful to play with people who are already familiar with the game. Like, when I played Settlers of Catan with my friends Mike and Rachel at a game night at Mike's apartment, they already knew how to play, so it was easy to get started. Do you have any tips for teaching new players?",
