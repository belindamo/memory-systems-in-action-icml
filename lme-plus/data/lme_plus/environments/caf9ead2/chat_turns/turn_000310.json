  "content": "A 3-inch border will indeed create a beautiful frame around your quilt.\n\nTo calculate the fabric needed for the border, we'll need to calculate the perimeter of the quilt. Since you're making a 12x12 block quilt with 12 blocks, the finished quilt size will be:\n\n12 blocks x 12 inches/block = 144 inches (across) x 144 inches (down)\n\nTo calculate the perimeter, we add up the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 2 x (144 inches + 144 inches) = 576 inches\n\nSince you want a 3-inch border, we'll add 6 inches (3 inches x 2) to the perimeter to account for the border width:\n\nTotal border length = 576 inches + 6 inches = 582 inches\n\nTo convert this to yards, we divide by 36 (since there are 36 inches in a yard):\n\nTotal border length (yards) = 582 inches \u00f7 36 = 16.17 yards\n\nSince you can't buy a fraction of a yard, we'll round up to the nearest quarter yard to ensure you have enough fabric. In this case, you'll need:\n\n16.25 yards of fabric for the border\n\nAdding this to your previous estimate for the remaining blocks, you'll need a total of:\n\n4 yards (remaining blocks) + 16.25 yards (border) = 20.25 yards of fabric\n\nSo, to be safe, you should consider getting around 21-22 yards of fabric to account for any potential errors or variations in fabric usage. This will give you a comfortable buffer to work with.\n\nRemember, it's always better to have a little extra fabric, rather than not enough!",
