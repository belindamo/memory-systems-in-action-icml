Manchester City and Chelsea did play in the 2020-21 UEFA Champions League final, but it was Chelsea who won the title, not Manchester City.\n\nNow, let's talk about the broadcasting rights for the UEFA Champions League!\n\n**Broadcasting Rights:**\n\n* The UEFA Champions League broadcasting rights are sold to media companies through a tender process, where broadcasters bid for the rights to show the competition in specific territories.\n* The broadcasting rights are typically sold for a period of three years, covering the group stage and knockout phase of the competition.\n* UEFA sells the broadcasting rights to a variety of broadcasters, including free-to-air television, pay-TV, and online streaming services.\n\n**Broadcasting Revenue:**\n\n* The UEFA Champions League generates significant revenue from broadcasting rights, with the total revenue exceeding \u20ac3.2 billion per year.\n* The broadcasting revenue is divided among UEFA's member associations, with the majority going to the top five associations (Spain, England, Germany, Italy, and France).\n* The broadcasting revenue is also distributed among the participating teams, with the teams receiving a share of the revenue based on their performance in the competition.\n\n**Who Gets to Broadcast the Matches:**\n\n* UEFA sells the broadcasting rights to a variety of broadcasters, including major television networks, pay-TV operators, and online streaming services.\n* The broadcasters are selected through a tender process, where they bid for the rights to show the competition in specific territories.\n* UEFA typically awards the broadcasting rights to the highest bidder, but may also consider other factors such as the broadcaster's reputation, technical capabilities, and commitment to promoting the competition.\n\n**How Much Do They Pay for the Rights:**\n\n* The exact figures for the broadcasting rights vary from year to year and from territory to territory.\n* However, it's reported that the UEFA Champions League broadcasting rights can fetch significant sums, with some deals worth hundreds of millions of euros per year.\n* For example, in 2020, BT Sport paid around \u20ac1.2 billion per year to broadcast the UEFA Champions League in the UK for three years.\n\n**Online Streaming:**\n\n* In recent years, online streaming services have become increasingly important for the UEFA Champions League, with many broadcasters offering live streams of the competition.\n* UEFA has also launched its own online streaming platform, UEFA.tv, which offers live and on-demand coverage of the competition.\n* Online streaming has opened up new revenue streams for UEFA, with the organization generating significant revenue from subscription fees and advertising.\n\nI hope that helps you understand the broadcasting rights for the UEFA Champions League!",
