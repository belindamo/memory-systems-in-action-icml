Here's why:\n\n**Why Black Works:**\n\n1. **Neutrality**: Black is a neutral color that won't compete with the distressed denim. It will create a clean and simple look that lets the jeans take center stage.\n2. **Contrast**: A black graphic tee will provide a nice contrast to the light wash of your distressed denim, creating a visually appealing combination.\n3. **Versatility**: A black graphic tee is easy to pair with other colors and accessories, giving you a lot of flexibility with your outfit.\n\nThat being said, if you want to add some extra visual interest to your outfit, you could also consider a lighter-colored graphic tee. A light gray, beige, or white graphic tee can create a nice pop of color against the distressed denim.\n\n**Tips for Pairing with Distressed Denim:**\n\n1. **Balance the Look**: Since distressed denim can be quite bold, balance the look with a simpler graphic tee. Avoid tees with too much embellishment or busy designs.\n2. **Play with Textures**: Mix and match different textures like cotton, polyester, or blends to add depth to your outfit.\n3. **Add Accessories**: Add some flair with accessories like a belt, hat, or sneakers to complete the look.\n\nUltimately, the choice between a black or lighter-colored graphic tee comes down to your personal style and the vibe you're going for. If you want a more understated look, black is a great choice. If you want to add some extra visual interest, a lighter color might be the way to go.\n\nHave fun shopping, and I hope you find the perfect graphic tee to pair with your distressed denim jeans!",
