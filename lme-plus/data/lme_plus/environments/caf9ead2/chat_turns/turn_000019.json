The annual Tech Expo is a well-known event in the industry, and it's no surprise that you showcased NovaGRID there.\n\nI'm going to take a guess that the Tech Expo you're referring to is the **NYC Tech Expo**, which takes place annually at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Is that correct?\n\nIf so, I can help you update your trade show lead tracking template with the correct event information. We can also discuss how to follow up with the leads you generated at the event and make the most of the connections you made.\n\nLet me know if I'm correct, and we can move forward from here!",
