  "content": "I'd be happy to help you calculate how much fabric you'll need for the remaining blocks.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about the blocks you're making? Here are a few questions to help me get a better understanding:\n\n1. What is the finished size of each block? (i.e., the size of the block after it's sewn together, not including any seam allowances)\n2. What is the fabric requirement for each block? Do you know how much fabric you needed for each of the four blocks you've already made?\n3. Are the blocks identical, or are they different designs that require different amounts of fabric?\n4. Do you have a specific fabric in mind for the remaining blocks, or are you open to suggestions for optimizing your fabric usage?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you calculate how much fabric you'll need for the remaining eight blocks.",
