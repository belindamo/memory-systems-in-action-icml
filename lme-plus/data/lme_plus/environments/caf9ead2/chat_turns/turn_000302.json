  "content": "African violets are such lovely plants, and with proper care, they'll bloom beautifully. Since your African violet is on the top shelf of your plant stand, I'll provide some tips to ensure it gets the right conditions.\n\n**African Violet Care Tips:**\n\n1. **Lighting**: African violets prefer bright, indirect light. The top shelf of your plant stand is a great spot, but make sure to filter the direct sunlight with a sheer curtain or shade to prevent scorching.\n2. **Watering**: Water your African violet carefully, as it's prone to root rot. Water from the bottom by placing the pot in a saucer of water and letting it absorb the water for 10-15 minutes. Avoid getting water on the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.\n3. **Humidity**: African violets thrive in high humidity (around 50-60%). You can place the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles to increase the humidity around the plant.\n4. **Temperature**: Keep your African violet in a spot with a consistent temperature between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C). Avoid placing it near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n5. **Fertilization**: Feed your African violet with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (like the Espoma Organic Indoor Plant Fertilizer) at half the recommended strength. You can fertilize every 2-3 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer).\n6. **Potting Mix**: Use a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for African violets. Avoid using regular potting soil, as it can retain too much water and cause root rot.\n7. **Pruning**: Remove dead or dying leaves and flowers to maintain the plant's appearance and encourage new growth. You can also prune back leggy stems to encourage bushy growth.\n8. **Pot Size**: African violets prefer to be slightly root-bound, so don't pot them up too quickly. Wait until the plant has outgrown its container and needs more room to expand.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Avoid Over-handling**: African violets are sensitive to touch, so avoid handling the leaves or stems excessively, as it can cause damage.\n2. **Watch for Pests**: Check your African violet regularly for pests like mealybugs, spider mites, or aphids. Isolate infested plants, and treat them promptly.\n3. **Repotting**: Repot your African violet every 6-12 months to provide fresh potting mix and a larger pot if necessary.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a happy and healthy environment for your African violet. Good luck, and enjoy your beautiful plant!",
