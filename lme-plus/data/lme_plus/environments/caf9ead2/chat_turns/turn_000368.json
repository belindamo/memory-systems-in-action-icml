Classic White Shirt**: A crisp, white button-down shirt is a timeless choice that will always look great with distressed denim. You can dress it up or down, and it's a great canvas for adding accessories.\n\n**2. Graphic Tees**: A graphic tee is a great way to add some visual interest to your outfit. Look for one with a fun design or a witty slogan to add some personality to your look.\n\n**3. Blouses with a Twist**: A flowy blouse with a unique detail like ruffles, bell sleeves, or a peplum hem can add a touch of femininity to your outfit. Look for lightweight fabrics like silk or cotton.\n\n**4. Thermal or Long-Sleeve Tops**: A thermal or long-sleeve top in a lightweight material like cotton or merino wool can add a cozy touch to your outfit. This is a great option for a casual, everyday look.\n\n**5. Cropped Sweaters**: A cropped sweater in a neutral color like beige, gray, or navy can add a chic touch to your outfit. Look for one with a fitted silhouette to balance out the volume of the distressed denim.\n\n**6. Peasant Blouses**: A peasant blouse with embroidery or other folk-inspired details can add a bohemian touch to your outfit. Look for one with a flowy silhouette and a V-neckline.\n\n**7. Tailored Button-Downs**: A tailored button-down shirt in a lightweight fabric like cotton or linen can add a touch of sophistication to your outfit. Look for one with a slim fit and a pointed collar.\n\n**Some General Tips**:\n\n* Stick to lightweight fabrics like cotton, silk, or linen that will drape nicely over the distressed denim.\n* Avoid tops with too much embellishment or heavy patterns, as they might clash with the distressed denim.\n* Play with different necklines like V-necks, scoop necks, or crew necks to add visual interest to your outfit.\n* Don't be afraid to experiment with different sleeve lengths, from short sleeves to long sleeves, to change up the look.\n\nSome great places to find these types of tops include:\n\n* Zara\n* H&M (you can even try pairing your distressed denim with a different H&M top!)\n* Everlane\n* Madewell\n* J.Crew\n* Anthropologie\n\nI hope these recommendations help you find the perfect top to pair with your distressed denim jeans!",
