To help you overcome the challenge of making it a habit, especially on weekends, here are a few additional tips:\n\n**Weekend strategy:** On weekends, try to maintain a consistent wake-up time, even if it's a bit later than your weekday wake-up time. This will help regulate your body's internal clock and make it easier to fit in your meditation session.\n\n**Anchor it to a habit:** Link your meditation session to a existing weekend habit, like right after waking up or before your morning coffee. This will help create a consistent routine and make it harder to skip.\n\n**Make it a self-care ritual:** View your meditation session as a self-care ritual, a time to relax and recharge before starting your weekend. This mindset can help you prioritize it and make it a non-negotiable part of your routine.\n\n**Track your progress:** Use the Headspace app to track your progress and earn rewards for consistent practice. Seeing your streaks and progress can motivate you to continue.\n\n**Be kind to yourself:** Remember that it's okay to miss a session occasionally. Don't be too hard on yourself if you sleep in later than expected or miss a session. Instead, focus on getting back on track as soon as possible.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be more likely to maintain a consistent meditation practice, even on weekends. Congratulations on taking the first step towards establishing a meditation habit!\n\nHow do you plan to remind yourself to meditate on weekends, and what's your favorite feature of the Headspace app so far?",
