  "content": "Energy is a property of matter and is present in many different forms. Some common forms of energy include:\n\n* Thermal energy, which is the energy of motion of particles in a substance. It is what we feel as heat.\n* Kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. It is the energy an object has due to its motion, such as a rolling ball or a moving car.\n* Potential energy, which is the energy an object has due to its position or state. For example, the energy stored in a stretched rubber band or a raised weight is potential energy.\n* Electrical energy, which is the energy of moving electric charges. It is what powers electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops.\n* Chemical energy, which is the energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. It is what powers our cars and heats our homes through the burning of fossil fuels.\n* Nuclear energy, which is the energy stored in the nucleus of an atom. It is what powers nuclear reactors and atomic bombs.\n\nEnergy can be transferred from one form to another through various means, such as heat transfer, work, or electromagnetic radiation. However, the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant, this is known as the law of conservation of energy. The most common unit of energy is Joules (J), but other units such as calories, kilowatt-hours, and electronvolts are also used.\n\nIn physics, energy is a scalar quantity and it is a state function, meaning that only the difference in energy between two states is important, not the absolute value of the energy.",
