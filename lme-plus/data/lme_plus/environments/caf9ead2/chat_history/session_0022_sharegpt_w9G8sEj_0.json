      "content": "Approaching a celebrity can be nerve-wracking, but here are some tips to help you approach Alan Cumming and let him know about your Queer Animation Archive:\n\n1. Be respectful: Remember that Alan Cumming is a person, and approach him with respect. Address him by his name and use polite language.\n2. Be brief: Keep your conversation brief and to the point. Let him know about your Queer Animation Archive and what it entails, but don't go into too much detail.\n3. Be prepared: Before approaching him, make sure you have any relevant materials or information ready to share with him, such as a business card or a brochure.\n4. Be enthusiastic: Let him know that you are excited about your Queer Animation Archive and that you think he might be interested in it too.\n5. Be open to his response: Alan Cumming may or may not be interested in your Queer Animation Archive, and that's okay. If he expresses interest, great! If not, don't take it personally and move on.\n\nHere's an example of what you could say to him:\n\n\"Hi, Alan! I'm a big fan of your work and I just wanted to let you know about a project I'm working on that I think you might be interested in. I'm launching a Queer Animation Archive that aims to preserve and showcase LGBTQ+ representation in animation. Would you be interested in learning more about it?\""
