      "content": "There could be several reasons why Anki browser is shutting down when you open it. Here are some steps you can try to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. Check if your Anki version is up to date. Make sure you have the latest version installed.\n2. Try restarting your computer and then opening Anki again.\n3. Check if any add-ons you have installed are causing the problem. Try disabling all add-ons and then opening Anki browser. If it works, then enable one add-on at a time to identify the problematic one.\n4. Try opening Anki browser in Safe Mode. To do this, hold down the shift key while launching Anki. If it opens in Safe Mode, then the problem may be caused by an add-on.\n5. Check if there are any corrupted files in your Anki profile. To do this, open the Anki folder on your computer and delete the \"collection.anki2-journal\" file. Then, try opening Anki browser again.\n6. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and then reinstalling Anki.\n\nIf the issue persists after trying all of these steps, you may need to seek further help from the Anki community or support team."

      "content": "The \"collection.anki2-journal\" file is a temporary file that Anki uses to store changes to the Anki collection database file (\"collection.anki2\") before committing those changes to the main database file. It is a part of Anki's mechanism for ensuring data integrity and preventing data loss in case of unexpected shutdowns or other errors.\n\nWhen Anki is closed normally, any changes stored in the \"collection.anki2-journal\" file are committed to the main database file. However, if Anki crashes or is forcibly closed, the changes in the journal file may not be fully committed, which can lead to data loss or corruption of the main database file.\n\nIf you encounter issues with Anki, deleting the \"collection.anki2-journal\" file is a troubleshooting step you can try. However, note that doing so will cause any uncommitted changes to the database to be lost. It is therefore recommended that you back up your Anki database before attempting to delete the journal file."
