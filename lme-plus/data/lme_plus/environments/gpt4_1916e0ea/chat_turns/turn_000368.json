  "content": "Implementing autonomous vehicles could potentially reduce traffic congestion in existing cities. Autonomous vehicles could help increase traffic flow by reducing the number of traffic accidents, traffic jams, and traffic caused by human errors. Autonomous vehicles could also allow for more efficient use of road space, as they could drive closer together than human-operated cars. Additionally, autonomous vehicles can drop off passengers and move to a parking area outside of city centers. Overall, implementing autonomous vehicles in existing cities could be a feasible solution for reducing traffic congestion, but it would require significant investments in infrastructure, technology, and regulations to make it work. It is also important to ensure that the widespread use of autonomous vehicles does not result in car ownership increasing and discourage the use of other modes of transportation.",
