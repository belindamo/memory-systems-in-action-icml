  "content": "Under the Interpretation Act, the word \"immunity\" is defined as \"the state of being immune, especially from an infectious disease\". This definition applies to the use of the word \"immunity\" in federal legislation in Canada.\n\nThe concept of immunity is central to the way vaccines work. When a person is immunized, their body produces immunity to a specific disease, which protects them from future infections with that disease. This can be achieved through natural infection with the disease or through vaccination.\n\nImmunity can be either active or passive. Active immunity occurs when the body produces its own antibodies to fight a specific disease, while passive immunity occurs when antibodies produced by another individual or organism are transferred to the body. Passive immunity is usually temporary and may be provided through the use of certain types of vaccines or through the transfer of antibodies from a mother to her child during pregnancy or breastfeeding.",
