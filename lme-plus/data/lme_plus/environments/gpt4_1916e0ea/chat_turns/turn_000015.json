However, I can suggest a few options to help you find a campground that suits your needs:\n\n1. **Use online campground directories**: Websites like recreation.gov, campgrounds.bytheowner.com, or rvlife.com allow you to search for campgrounds by location, amenities, and distance. You can enter your cabin's location or nearby cities to find campgrounds within a 30-minute drive.\n2. **Check with local tourism boards or visitor centers**: Contact the local tourism boards or visitor centers in southern Illinois to ask for recommendations on campgrounds near your cabin. They may have information on campgrounds that are not well-represented online.\n3. **Google search with specific keywords**: Try searching for \"campgrounds near [city or zip code]\" or \"campgrounds near [lake or pond name]\" to find options in the area. You can also add keywords like \"fishing\" or \"lake access\" to narrow down the results.\n4. **Ask your cabin neighbors or local outfitters**: If you have neighbors or local outfitters near your cabin, ask them for recommendations on campgrounds that are close by and offer good fishing opportunities.\n\nSome popular lakes and ponds in southern Illinois include:\n\n* Lake Murphysboro\n* Lake of Egypt\n* Rend Lake\n* Cedar Lake\n* Devil's Kitchen Lake\n\nOnce you have a list of potential campgrounds, be sure to check their websites, reviews, and amenities to ensure they meet your needs and preferences. Happy camping and fishing!",
