Bow and arrows: Akira is likely a skilled archer, and the bow and arrow would be his primary weapon of choice. He would likely have a custom-made bow that fits his frame and style of shooting, and would be skilled at shooting from a variety of distances and angles.\n2. Hunting knife: As a survivalist, Akira would also be proficient with a hunting knife. He would likely have a high-quality blade that he keeps razor sharp, and would be skilled at using it for both hunting and combat.\n3. Bo staff: While not his primary weapon, Akira may also be proficient with a bo staff. This would be useful in close-quarters combat, or in situations where he needs to disarm or disable an opponent without causing serious harm. His skills with the staff would likely reflect his natural athleticism and grace.",
