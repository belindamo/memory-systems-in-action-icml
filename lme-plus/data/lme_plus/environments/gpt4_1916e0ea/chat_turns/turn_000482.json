  "content": "The decision to completely eliminate combustion engines on the forest moon of Kodia III is a significant step in preserving the environment and minimizing the impact of human activity on the delicate ecosystems present. Combustion engines produce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and noise pollution, all of which can have detrimental effects on wildlife and the environment.\n\nInstead, the colony and the Kodian Frontier Service have adopted clean energy alternatives for transportation and power generation. Grav-bikes and FHLTs use advanced propulsion systems that do not rely on combustion engines, making them more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Other vehicles and equipment on the moon also rely on electric, solar, or other clean energy sources.\n\nPower generation for the colony and its facilities is provided by a combination of solar, geothermal, and energy storage systems, ensuring a reliable and clean supply of electricity. This approach aligns with the broader commitment to conservation and the protection of Kodia III's unique ecosystems and protosapient species.\n\nThe ban on combustion engines demonstrates the dedication of the Kodian Frontier Service and the colony's administration to sustainable practices and responsible stewardship of the forest moon's natural resources. This forward-thinking policy sets a strong precedent for future colonization and exploration efforts in the Yamatai Star Empire and beyond.",
