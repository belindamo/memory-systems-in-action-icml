For example:\n\n* Are you looking to restock groceries, household essentials, or something specific like party supplies or pet food?\n* Do you have any upcoming events or meals you're planning for that you need to prepare for?\n* Are there any specific categories you're trying to tackle, such as personal care items, cleaning supplies, or office supplies?\n\nFeel free to provide as much or as little information as you'd like, and I can help you generate a list of items you might need to pick up from the store.",
