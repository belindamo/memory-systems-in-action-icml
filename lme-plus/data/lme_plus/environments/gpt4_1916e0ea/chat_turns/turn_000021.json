That's great!\n\nWhile I don't have specific knowledge of the exact lakes and ponds near your cabin, I can tell you that the lures I mentioned earlier are generally effective for largemouth bass in southern Illinois. However, it's always a good idea to consider the specific characteristics of the waters you're fishing in.\n\nHere are a few factors to consider when choosing lures for the lakes and ponds near your cabin:\n\n* **Water clarity:** If the water is clear, you may want to use lures with more subtle actions and natural colors. If the water is murky, you may want to use lures with stronger vibrations or brighter colors.\n* **Vegetation:** If the lakes and ponds have a lot of vegetation, such as lily pads or submerged weeds, you may want to use lures that can be worked through or around the vegetation, such as a frog or a jig.\n* **Structure:** If there are plenty of rocks, logs, or other structure in the lakes and ponds, you may want to use lures that can be bounced off or worked around these features, such as a crankbait or a spinnerbait.\n\nBased on your experience turkey hunting in the area, you may have a good sense of the terrain and the types of habitat that are present. You can use this knowledge to inform your lure selection and presentation.\n\nIt's also a good idea to talk to local fishermen, check online fishing reports, or consult with a fishing guide to get a better sense of what's working well in the specific lakes and ponds you're planning to fish.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the experience of fishing with your family. Good luck, and I hope you catch some big ones!",
