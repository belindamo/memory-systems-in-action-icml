When beginning yoga, you are using muscles in new ways, and it may take some time for your body to adjust. It's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard, especially when starting out. Over time, your muscles will begin to adapt to the practice, and the soreness should diminish. It's also important to stay hydrated and to stretch after your practice to help alleviate any soreness.",
