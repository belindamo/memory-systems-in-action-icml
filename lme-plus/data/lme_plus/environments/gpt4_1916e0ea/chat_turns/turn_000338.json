  "content": "\"Westworld\" is an HBO original series, which means it's primarily available through HBO's platforms. However, there are a few ways to access HBO content, including \"Westworld,\" depending on your current subscriptions and streaming services:\n\n**Option 1: HBO Subscription**\n\nIf you have a traditional cable or satellite TV subscription, you can add HBO to your package. This will give you access to HBO's linear channel and its streaming service, HBO GO.\n\n**Option 2: HBO Max**\n\nHBO Max is a relatively new streaming service that offers a vast library of content, including all HBO originals, movies, and TV shows. You can subscribe to HBO Max directly, which will give you access to \"Westworld\" and other HBO content. HBO Max is available as a standalone service or as an add-on to certain streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Video.\n\n**Option 3: Amazon Prime Video with HBO Add-on**\n\nIf you're an Amazon Prime member, you can add HBO as a channel to your Prime Video subscription. This will give you access to HBO content, including \"Westworld,\" through the Prime Video app. The HBO add-on is a separate subscription that costs $14.99/month or $139.99/year.\n\n**Option 4: Purchase Individual Episodes or Seasons**\n\nIf you don't want to commit to a subscription, you can purchase individual episodes or seasons of \"Westworld\" through Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, iTunes, or Vudu. This option might be more expensive than subscribing to HBO or HBO Max, but it gives you flexibility.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* You cannot watch \"Westworld\" exclusively through Amazon Prime Video without an HBO add-on or a separate HBO subscription.\n* If you have an Amazon Prime membership, you can add HBO as a channel to your subscription.\n* You can also subscribe to HBO Max or purchase individual episodes/seasons of \"Westworld\" through various digital stores.\n\nI hope this helps you figure out the best way to access \"Westworld\"!",
