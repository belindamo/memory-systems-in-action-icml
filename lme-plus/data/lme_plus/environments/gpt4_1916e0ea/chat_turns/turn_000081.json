For example:\n\n* What time do you want to wake up for work?\n* What time have you been waking up lately?\n* What's your current morning routine like (e.g., do you exercise, meditate, check your phone, etc.)?\n* How long does it take you to get ready for work in the morning?\n\nAlso, since today's schedule is a bit off, let's focus on tracking your habits starting from tomorrow. I'll provide you with a simple template to track your morning routine for the next few days. This will help us identify patterns and areas for improvement.\n\nHere's a template to get you started:\n\n| Day | Wake-up Time | Bedtime | Morning Routine | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Tomorrow] |  |  |  |  |\n| [Day after] |  |  |  |  |\n| [Day after that] |  |  |  |  |\n\nPlease fill in the columns with the following information:\n\n* Wake-up Time: The time you wake up in the morning\n* Bedtime: The time you go to bed the night before\n* Morning Routine: A brief description of what you do in the morning (e.g., exercise, breakfast, shower, etc.)\n* Notes: Any additional information that might be helpful, such as how you're feeling, if you hit the snooze button, or if you had any trouble falling asleep\n\nTrack your habits for the next few days, and we can review them together to identify what's working and what areas need improvement.",
