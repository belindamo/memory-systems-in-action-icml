  "content": "I do not have personal opinions, but i can understand why someone might think it would be interesting to compare american movies to films from other countries. in fact, there are many other organizations and publications that create \"best of\" lists that include films from all over the world, such as sight & sound's famous list of the greatest films of all time. additionally, the afi does recognize the contributions of international cinema to the art form and has created lists such as \"afi's 100 years...100 passions: america's greatest love stories,\" which includes films from around the world. so while the afi's primary focus is on american cinema and cultural heritage, there are many other resources available for those interested in exploring films from other countries.",
