The violence and instability of the period led to the deaths of many thousands of people, and it caused widespread disruption and suffering for millions more.\n\nHowever, despite these negative aspects, many historians argue that the French Revolution ultimately had a positive impact on the world. By overthrowing the old feudal order and establishing the principles of democracy, human rights, and individual freedom, the revolution paved the way for many of the progressive developments that have taken place since that time.\n\nFor example, the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity that emerged from the French Revolution have inspired countless social and political movements throughout the world. These ideas have led to the development of new democracies, the abolition of slavery and other forms of oppression, and the establishment of more just and equitable societies.\n\nSo while it is true that the French Revolution was a complex and at times violent period in history, many historians view it as an important and ultimately positive development that helped to shape the modern world in important ways.",
