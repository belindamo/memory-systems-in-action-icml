Now you can plan ahead for your next oil change.\n\n**Typical Oil Change Intervals:**\n\n* Most car manufacturers recommend oil changes every 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km) for conventional oil.\n* If you use synthetic oil, you might be able to go up to 10,000 to 15,000 miles (16,000 to 24,000 km) between changes.\n* Some newer cars may even have oil change intervals of up to 20,000 miles (32,000 km) or more.\n\n**Mark Your Calendar:**\n\nBased on your March 10th oil change, you can estimate your next oil change will be due around:\n\n* August 10th (5,000 miles / 8,000 km) or\n* October 10th (7,500 miles / 12,000 km)\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates and may vary depending on your car's make, model, and driving conditions. Always consult your owner's manual or speak with a mechanic if you're unsure.\n\n**Stay Ahead of Schedule:**\n\nTo avoid forgetting, consider setting a reminder on your phone or calendar for your next oil change. You can also ask your mechanic to remind you when you're due for your next service.\n\nNow that you've got your oil change schedule in check, you can focus on tackling those other maintenance tasks, like replacing your air filter and getting your brakes checked.",
