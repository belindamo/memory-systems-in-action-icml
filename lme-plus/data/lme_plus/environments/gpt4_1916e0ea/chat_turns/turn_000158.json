Watching a sumo tournament is an unforgettable experience, and I'm happy to help you prepare.\n\n**Tips for a great sumo tournament experience:**\n\n1. **Dress code:** Dress comfortably and modestly, as you'll be sitting on the floor (seiza style) for an extended period. Avoid revealing clothing, and opt for layers, as the venue can get hot.\n2. **Arrival and seating:** Plan to arrive at the Ryogoku Kokugikan (sumo arena) early to soak in the pre-tournament atmosphere. Your ticket will indicate your seat location and entrance time. Be prepared for security checks and bag inspections.\n3. **Understanding the tournament:** A sumo tournament (honbasho) typically lasts for 15 days, with each day featuring a series of matches. The top-ranked wrestlers (sekitori) compete in the highest division (makuuchi), while lower-ranked wrestlers compete in lower divisions. You can find the tournament schedule and wrestler rankings online.\n4. **Match format:** A sumo match (bout) typically lasts between 5-20 seconds. Wrestlers try to force each other out of the ring or make their opponent touch the ground with any part of their body except the soles of their feet.\n5. **Etiquette:** Be respectful of the wrestlers, officials, and fellow spectators. Avoid loud noises, photography during matches, and walking in front of the ring when a match is in progress.\n6. **Food and drinks:** You can purchase food and drinks at the venue, including traditional Japanese snacks like senbei (soy sauce-flavored crackers) and sake.\n7. **Language:** While some signs and announcements are in English, Japanese is the primary language used during the tournament. You can download the official sumo app or bring a guidebook to help you navigate.\n8. **Atmosphere:** Be prepared for a lively atmosphere, with cheering, chanting, and drumming. The energy is electric, especially when top-ranked wrestlers compete.\n\n**Additional tips for your April 17th visit:**\n\n* The April tournament is one of the most popular, so expect large crowds.\n* Consider purchasing a bento (Japanese lunchbox) or snacks beforehand, as the venue can get busy during lunch hours.\n* If you're interested in watching a specific wrestler, check the tournament schedule to ensure you're seated during their match.\n* Be prepared for a long day, as the tournament can last from 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM.\n\nYou're in for an unforgettable experience! Enjoy the sumo tournament, and I hope you have a fantastic time in Tokyo!",
