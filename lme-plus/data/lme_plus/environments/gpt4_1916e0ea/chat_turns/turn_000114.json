  "content": "Under the Food and Drugs Act, vaccines are considered to be \"drugs\". The Act defines a drug as \"any substance or mixture of substances manufactured, sold or represented for use in (a) the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of a disease, disorder or abnormal physical state, or its symptoms, in humans or animals, (b) restoring, correcting or modifying organic functions in humans or animals, or (c) disinfection in premises in which food is manufactured, prepared or kept.\"\n\nThis definition is broad and encompasses a wide range of products, including vaccines, which are used to prevent or treat diseases in humans or animals. Vaccines are regulated as drugs under the Act and are subject to the same requirements for safety, effectiveness, and quality as other drugs.\n\nThe other terms you listed in your question, such as \"advanced therapeutic product,\" \"cosmetic,\" \"device,\" and \"food,\" refer to different categories of products that are regulated under the Act. These categories are distinct from drugs and are subject to different requirements.",
