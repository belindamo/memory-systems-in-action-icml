Choose a simple, slouchy style to keep the focus on the bright yellow tee.\n4. **Sunglasses:** If you're planning to wear the outfit during the day, consider adding a pair of sunglasses. Black or dark-colored frames will blend in with the rest of the outfit.\n5. **Simple chain or pendant:** A delicate chain or pendant can add some visual interest to the outfit.
