  "content": "In order to minimize the impact on the environment and reduce the potential disturbance to the protosapient species and other native wildlife, the use of wheeled vehicles outside the colony's grounds is strictly prohibited on Kodia III. This policy is a key part of the Kodian Frontier Service's conservation efforts and is enforced by the Kodian Frontier Rangers.\n\nInstead of using traditional wheeled vehicles, the Kodian Frontier Rangers and other personnel rely on alternative modes of transportation, such as grav-bikes, which are designed to have a minimal impact on the environment. Grav-bikes use anti-gravity technology, allowing them to hover above the ground, thereby avoiding the disruption of soil, vegetation, and wildlife habitats.\n\nIn addition to grav-bikes, the Fast Heavy Lift Transports (FHLTs) serve as a primary means of transportation for various missions and operations. These versatile aircraft utilize tilting ducted fans for lift and propulsion, enabling them to operate in remote and challenging environments without the need for large runways or other infrastructure.\n\nThe ban on wheeled vehicles reflects the commitment of the Kodian Frontier Service and the colony's administration to protect the fragile ecosystems and unique species found on the forest moon. This policy helps to ensure that the exploration, research, and interaction with the protosapient species proceed in a responsible and sustainable manner, preserving Kodia III's rich biodiversity for future generations.",
