  "content": "I think I'll go with the retro candy bar, rock 'n' roll sliders, and vintage veggie platter. I also like the idea of a retro soda bar and electric lemonade. For desserts, I'll do the vinyl record cookies and retro cupcake tower. I'll also make sure to use retro-themed tableware and music-inspired centerpieces. One more thing, do you think it's a good idea to give out party favors, like guitar picks or music-themed keychains, to the guests as a memento of the party?",
