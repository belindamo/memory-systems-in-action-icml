  "content": "Summarise this article: Our Climate-related Risks and Opportunities\nThe key climate-related risks and opportunities faced by Sembcorp\u2019s businesses are managed as part of our Climate Action Plan. We manage our climate risks and opportunities in line with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. Sembcorp also conducts risk-based scenario analysis in its investment decisions to evaluate the impacts of rising carbon prices over time. Our Climate Change Working Committee oversees the development of plans, processes and reports that address the Group\u2019s climate change risks and opportunities. Its role includes the review and development of policies and frameworks, assessment of risks and opportunities, the setting of targets and implementation of relevant initiatives, as well as facilitating the reporting and disclosures of performance. This committee is chaired by the executive vice president, Office of the Group President & CEO. The committee meets at least twice a year, and provides updates to our Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and Sustainability Steering Committee, both chaired by the Group President & CEO, as well as the board\u2019s Risk Committee (RC). The ERC monitors and reviews the risk management performance and appropriateness of risk mitigation measures. The ERC then reports to the RC on a quarterly basis to monitor group-wide risks, including significant risk exposures as well as corresponding risk mitigation plans.",
