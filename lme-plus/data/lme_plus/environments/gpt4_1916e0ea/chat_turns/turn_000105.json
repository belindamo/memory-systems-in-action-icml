Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n3. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.\n4. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla extract.\n5. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.\n6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops.\n7. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean.\n8. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\n9. Once the cakes are cool, you can frost and decorate them as desired. Enjoy!",
