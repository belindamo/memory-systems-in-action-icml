Here's how:\n\n1. **Visit Bed Bath & Beyond's website**: Go to [www.bedbathandbeyond.com](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com) and click on \"Registry\" at the top of the page.\n2. **Search for the registry**: Click on \"Find a Registry\" and enter your cousin's first and last name, or their registry ID (if you have it).\n3. **View the registry**: Once you've found their registry, click on it to view the list of items they've registered for.\n4. **Check the item's status**: Look for the item you're considering purchasing and check its status. If it says \"Purchased\" or \"Fulfilled,\" it's likely been bought by someone else. If it says \"Available\" or \"Not Purchased,\" it's still available for you to buy.\n\nAlternatively, you can also:\n\n* **Call Bed Bath & Beyond's customer service**: Reach out to their customer service department at 1-800-GO-BEYOND (1-800-462-3966) and provide your cousin's registry information. They can check the registry for you and let you know if the item has been purchased.\n* **Check with your cousin**: If you're still unsure, you could always reach out to your cousin directly and ask if they've received the item or if it's still on their wish list.\n\nBy checking the registry, you can avoid duplicating a gift and ensure that your cousin receives a thoughtful and unique present.",
