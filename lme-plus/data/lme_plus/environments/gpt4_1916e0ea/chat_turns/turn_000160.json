The market is divided into two main areas:\n\n1. **Inner Market (Jogai Shijo):** This is the wholesale market where seafood auctions take place. Unfortunately, the inner market has moved to a new location called Toyosu Market in 2018, and it's no longer accessible to tourists.\n2. **Outer Market (Jogai Shijo):** This area is open to the public and offers a fascinating glimpse into Tokyo's seafood culture. You'll find a variety of sushi restaurants, seafood stalls, and shops selling fresh seafood, kitchenware, and souvenirs.\n\n**Getting to Tsukiji Fish Market from Park Hyatt Tokyo:**\n\nThe Park Hyatt Tokyo is located in Shinjuku, which is about 10-15 kilometers from Tsukiji Fish Market. Here are your best options to get to Tsukiji:\n\n1. **Taxi:** A taxi ride takes around 20-30 minutes, depending on traffic, and costs approximately \u00a54,000-5,000 (~ $35-45 USD).\n2. **Subway:** Take the Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line from Shinjuku Station to Ginza Station, then transfer to the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line to Tsukiji-shijo Station.
