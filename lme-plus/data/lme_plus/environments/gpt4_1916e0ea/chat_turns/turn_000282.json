However, you should have your bylaws drafted and approved by your Board of Directors before filing your articles of incorporation, as they are an important legal document that will govern the operation and decision-making processes of your nonprofit organization.\n\nThe bylaws should be kept on file with the organization's records and should be made available to members of the organization upon request. They should also be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in governing the organization's operations.\n\nWhile the bylaws are not required to be filed with the articles of incorporation in Texas, you should review the state's nonprofit corporation laws to ensure that your bylaws comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You may wish to consult with an attorney or other legal professional to ensure that your bylaws are well-crafted and provide a solid framework for the operation of your nonprofit.",
