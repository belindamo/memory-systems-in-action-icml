  "content": "I think some of these suggestions will definitely help, especially the self-care and relaxation techniques. I've actually started taking yoga classes twice a week, which has been helping me relax and focus more. Additionally, I've been practicing meditation for 10 minutes every morning, which has been helping me set intentions and focus on my goals for the day. However, I recently had a huge argument with my best friend, which really took a toll on my mental health. We hadn't spoken in weeks, and it was really affecting my self-esteem and making me feel lonely. But we recently had a conversation and cleared the air, which has helped me feel a bit better. Do you have any suggestions on how to maintain a healthy friendship, especially after a big argument?",
