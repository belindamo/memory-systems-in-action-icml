  "content": "Usually, rental shops provide a map of the area where you can hike or bike. However, it's always a good idea to have a map with you as a backup or in case the rental shop doesn't have any available. You can get a map of Gy\u0151r and its surrounding areas at the local tourist office or from any travel agency in the city.
