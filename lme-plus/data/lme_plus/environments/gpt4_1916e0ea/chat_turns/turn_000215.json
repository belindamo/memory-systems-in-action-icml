Let's assume you've just posted something new. To track your likes and comments, I'll need to know a few things:\n\n1. Which social media platform are you using (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, etc.)?\n2. How many likes and comments do you currently have on your new post?\n\nPlease share that information, and I can help you keep track of your engagement from here on out!",
