Here's how:\n\n1. **Website:** Visit the SF Rec and Parks website at [www.sfgov.org/recpark](http://www.sfgov.org/recpark). Click on \"Adult Sports\" and then \"Volleyball\" to find the Co-ed Indoor Volleyball league information. Look for the \"Registration\" or \"Season Information\" section, which should provide the deadline and start date.\n2. **Phone:** Call the SF Rec and Parks Department's registration office at (415) 831-6800. They should be able to provide you with the registration deadline and season start date.\n3. **Email:** Send an email to [recpark@sfgov.org](mailto:recpark@sfgov.org) with your inquiry. They'll respond with the information you need.\n\nAs a rough estimate, many recreational sports leagues in San Francisco tend to have registration deadlines around 1-2 weeks before the season starts. The season start date might be around early November, considering the 8-week season duration you mentioned.\n\nMake sure to register as soon as possible to secure your spot, as leagues can fill up quickly. You can also ask about any potential tryouts or assessments, if they're required, and what the league's policies are regarding team formation and player placement.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you have a blast playing volleyball with the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department!",
