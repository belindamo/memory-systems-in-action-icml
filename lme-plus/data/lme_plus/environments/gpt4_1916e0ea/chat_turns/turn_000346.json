It's a fantastic introduction to modern board games, and it's wonderful that you and your roommate enjoy playing it together.\n\nAs for beating your roommate, I can offer some general strategic tips:\n\n1. **Focus on early game drafting**: Try to get a good mix of tiles in your starting hand, and focus on drafting tiles that will give you an advantage in the early game.\n2. **Block your opponent's plans**: Pay attention to the tiles your roommate is collecting and try to disrupt their plans by drafting tiles that will limit their options.\n3. **Build a diverse palette**: Aim to collect a variety of tile colors to give yourself more options for creating sets and scoring points.\n4. **Manage your tiles efficiently**: Make sure to use your tiles wisely, and try to minimize the number of tiles you have left over at the end of each round.\n\nNow, regarding games for a group of 6-8 people, here are some excellent options:\n\n**Party games:**\n\n1. **Codenames**: A word-guessing game where players try to identify words based on one-word clues given by their teammate.\n2. **Taboo**: A fast-paced word-describing game where players take turns explaining a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases.\n3. **Deception**: A social deduction game where one player takes on the role of a spy, and the others must figure out who it is.\n\n** Cooperative games:**\n\n1. **Forbidden Sky**: A cooperative game where players work together to build a flying contraption and escape a stormy sky.\n2. **Ghost Stories**: A cooperative game where players take on the roles of Taoist monks defending a village from invading ghosts.\n3. **Mysterium**: A cooperative game where one player takes on the role of a ghost trying to communicate with the other players (psychic mediums) to solve a murder mystery.\n\n**Competitive games:**\n\n1. **Wits & Wagers**: A trivia game where players bet on the answers given by their opponents, making it a fun and social experience.\n2. **The Resistance**: A social deduction game where players work together to complete missions, but some players may be spies trying to sabotage the effort.\n3. **Dixit**: A creative game where players try to guess which card was chosen by the storyteller based on a single clue.\n\nThese games are all highly rated and can accommodate 6-8 players.
