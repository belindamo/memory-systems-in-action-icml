  "content": "Magical realism, as a literary technique, is often associated with Latin American culture and tradition. However, I think that readers from other cultures can still fully appreciate its usage and understand the issues that the novel is trying to address. Although unfamiliar to some readers, magical realism, at its core, is a universal concept that transcends cultural boundaries. It explores the supernatural, the surreal, and the inexplicable in the context of the everyday world. It enables the reader to explore the emotional, psychological, and spiritual dimensions of human experience outside of traditional realistic narrative conventions. In many ways, magical realism allows us to suspend our disbelief and examine the world with different lenses.\n\nWhile acknowledging that some readers may initially find it challenging to relate to magical realism, especially in cultures that are not accustomed to it, I believe that the deeper meanings conveyed through this literary technique can resonate universally. The themes and messages of Marquez's work are ultimately rooted in the human experience and are capable of transcending cultural barriers. The magical realism in Marquez's work is not merely an ornament, but an essential part of his storytelling that reflects the essence of the culture and experience he portrays. Therefore, readers from all cultures can appreciate and understand Marquez's use of magical realism in his works.",
