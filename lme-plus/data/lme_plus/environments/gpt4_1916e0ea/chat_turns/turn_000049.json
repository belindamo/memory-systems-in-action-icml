Use containers or ziplock bags to store each portion.\n2. **Cooling and Refrigeration:** Cool your cooked meals to room temperature before refrigerating or freezing. This helps prevent bacterial growth and keeps your food fresh.\n3. **Labeling and Dating:** Label each container or bag with the meal name, date, and any reheating instructions. This ensures you know what you have and how long it's been stored.\n4. **Storage Containers:** Use airtight, microwave-safe containers or ziplock bags to store your meals. Glass containers are a great option, but make sure they're oven-safe if you plan to reheat in the oven.\n5. **Reheating:** Reheat your meals in the microwave, oven, or on the stovetop until they reach a minimum internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n\n**Specific Tips for Grilled Chicken Fajitas and Beef and Veggie Meatballs:**\n\n**Grilled Chicken Fajitas:**\n\n* Portion: Divide cooked chicken and vegetables into 3-4 portions, depending on your serving size.\n* Store: Place each portion in an airtight container or ziplock bag with a slice of lime, some cilantro, and a small amount of salsa (if using).\n* Reheat: Reheat in the microwave for 1-2 minutes or in the oven at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for 5-7 minutes.\n\n**Beef and Veggie Meatballs:**\n\n* Portion: Divide cooked meatballs into 4-6 portions, depending on your serving size.\n* Store: Place each portion in an airtight container or ziplock bag with a side of quinoa or brown rice and steamed vegetables (if desired).\n* Reheat: Reheat in the microwave for 1-2 minutes or in the oven at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for 5-7 minutes.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Freezing:** If you don't plan to consume your meals within 3-4 days, consider freezing them for up to 3 months. Label and date the containers or bags, and store them in the freezer. When reheating, thaw overnight in the refrigerator or reheat from frozen in the microwave or oven.\n* **Meal Prep Schedule:** Plan your meal prep schedule according to your busy days and cooking preferences. You can prep on the weekends, a few days a week, or even just one day a week.\n* **Variety:** Mix and match different meals throughout the week to keep things interesting. You can also swap out ingredients or add new spices to change up the flavor.\n\nBy following these meal prep strategies, you'll be able to enjoy your delicious Grilled Chicken Fajitas and Beef and Veggie Meatballs throughout the week, while saving time and money.\n\nHappy meal prepping!",
