  "content": "Yes, I did catch some of the visuals and lighting effects during the show, and they were really impressive. The 1975's lighting design is always so creative and thought-provoking, and it added a lot to the overall atmosphere of the concert. I especially loved the strobe lights during \"Give Yourself a Try\" - it really got the crowd pumped up!\n\nAnd yes, I think I will add \"Give Yourself a Try\" to my \"Electric Whispers\" playlist. It's a great song, and it'll be a nice reminder of that amazing night. I might even add some other songs from the concert to the playlist, like \"It's Not Living (If It's Not with You)\" or \"Love Me\".",
