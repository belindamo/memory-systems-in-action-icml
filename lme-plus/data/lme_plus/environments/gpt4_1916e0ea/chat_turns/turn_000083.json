Let's break down your morning routine and see where we can make some adjustments.\n\n**Morning Routine Analysis**\n\n1. **Meditation**: You want to meditate for 10 minutes, but you've only managed to do it three times this week. This suggests that it's not a habit yet, and we need to make it more achievable.\n2. **Coffee and emails**: These seem to be consistent parts of your morning routine, but they might be affecting your wake-up time. Caffeine can make it harder to fall asleep and reduce the quality of your sleep. Checking emails can also be a source of stress and make it harder to wake up feeling relaxed.\n3. **Get ready for work**: You take 45 minutes to get ready, which is a reasonable amount of time. However, we can explore ways to optimize this process to make it more efficient.\n\n**Suggestions and Adjustments**\n\n1. **Start small with meditation**: Instead of aiming for 10 minutes, try committing to 2-3 minutes of meditation per day. This will make it easier to establish a consistent habit, and you can gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.\n2. **Replace coffee with a gentler wake-up routine**: Consider switching to a gentler morning pick-me-up, like a glass of water, a short walk, or some stretching exercises. This might help you wake up feeling more refreshed and reduce your reliance on caffeine.\n3. **Limit email checks**: Try to avoid checking your emails until you're fully awake and ready to tackle your day. This will help you start your day on a more positive note and reduce stress.\n4. **Optimize your getting-ready routine**: Take a closer look at your morning routine and identify areas where you can save time. For example, you could prepare your outfit the night before, pack your lunch, or simplify your beauty routine.\n\n**Action Plan**\n\nFor the next few days, try the following adjustments:\n\n* Set your alarm for 7:00 AM and aim to wake up at that time.\n* Start with 2-3 minutes of meditation as soon as you wake up.\n* Replace coffee with a gentler wake-up routine (e.g., a glass of water or some stretching).\n* Limit email checks until you're fully awake and ready for the day.\n* Optimize your getting-ready routine to save time and make it more efficient.\n\n**Tracking Your Progress**\n\nPlease fill in the template I provided earlier to track your morning routine for the next few days. This will help us identify what's working and what areas need further adjustment.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make small, sustainable changes that you can maintain in the long term. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. We'll work together to fine-tune your morning routine and help you wake up feeling refreshed and ready for work.",
