  "content": "No, you are not required to submit your bylaws with the Texas Secretary of State (SOS) when you file your nonprofit corporation's articles of incorporation. However, you should have approved bylaws in place before filing your articles of incorporation, as they are an important legal document that will govern the operation and decision-making processes of your nonprofit organization.\n\nThe bylaws should include provisions related to the organization's governance, including rules and procedures for electing and removing Board members, holding meetings, making decisions, and carrying out the organization's mission. They should also include provisions for managing conflicts of interest, ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and managing the organization's finances and assets.\n\nWhile the Texas SOS does not require you to submit your bylaws, you should keep a copy of your bylaws on file with your organization's records and make them available to members of the organization upon request. You should also review your bylaws periodically to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in governing the organization's operations.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about your nonprofit organization's bylaws or filing requirements with the Texas SOS, you may wish to consult with an attorney or other legal professional for guidance.",
