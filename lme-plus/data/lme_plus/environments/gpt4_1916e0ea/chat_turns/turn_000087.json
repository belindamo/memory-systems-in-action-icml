Cold showers and peppermint oil can be a powerful combo to help increase alertness and focus.\n\nRegarding meditation reminders, **ABSOLUTELY!** Setting reminders can be a great way to establish a consistent meditation practice. Here are a few options you can try:\n\n1. **Phone reminders**: Set a recurring reminder on your phone to meditate at the same time every day. You can choose a specific time, like 7:00 AM, and set a reminder to meditate for 2-3 minutes.\n2. **App notifications**: Download a meditation app like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer that offers reminder features. These apps can send you notifications to meditate at your preferred time and even track your progress.\n3. **Habit tracker**: Use a habit-tracking app like Habitica, HabitBull, or Loop Habit Tracker to monitor your meditation practice. These apps allow you to set reminders and track your progress over time.\n4. **Physical reminder**: Place a meditation cushion, pillow, or a small note in a visible spot where you'll see it every morning, reminding you to meditate.\n\nRemember, the key is to make meditation a habit by performing it at the same time every day. Consistency is key to developing a strong meditation practice.\n\nAs you start using reminders, be kind to yourself if you miss a day or two. Don't get discouraged, and simply acknowledge the setback. Gently nudge yourself back on track, and celebrate your small wins along the way.\n\nKeep me updated on your progress with the cold showers, peppermint oil, and meditation practice. I'm excited to hear about your experiences and provide further guidance as needed!",
