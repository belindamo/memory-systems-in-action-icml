The isolation of the Tepuis and their unique ecological systems have attracted many scientists to the region. The first scientific expeditions to the Tepuis occurred as far back as the 19th century.\n\nIn the 20th century, numerous scientific expeditions were carried out by different groups of researchers from around the world. One of the most notable expeditions was led by the British botanist, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1912. His expedition to the Tepuis was said to be the inspiration for his novel, The Lost World.\n\nSince then, numerous scientific expeditions have returned to the Tepuis to study the geology, biology and archaeology of these mountains. Many discoveries have been made over the years, including the discovery of numerous new species of plants and animals that are unique to the Tepuis. Researchers have also found evidence of prehistoric human settlements on top of some of the Tepuis, indicating that these mountains were once used as habitats by ancient peoples.\n\nOverall, the scientific exploration of the Tepuis is ongoing, and as new technologies and methods become available, we are likely to continue learning more about these unique and fascinating geological landmarks of the Amazon rainforest.",
