It's first-come, first-served, so arrive early to secure a spot.\n3. **Ten-X Campground**: A more secluded option, located about 2 miles from the South Rim, with basic amenities. It's open on a first-come, first-served basis.\n4. **Flagstaff Campgrounds**: If you'd like to camp near Flagstaff, consider **Fort Tuthill County Park** or **Woody Mountain Campground**. Both offer amenities like showers and hookups.\n\n**Hiking Trails:**\n\n1. **Bright Angel Trail**: One of the most popular trails, it's a well-maintained, steep hike down to the bottom of the canyon and back up again. Be prepared for a challenging 9.5-mile round-trip hike.\n2. **South Kaibab Trail**: Another popular trail, similar to Bright Angel, but with slightly more elevation change. It's also 9.5 miles round-trip.\n3. **Rim Trail**: A more leisurely option, this trail runs along the rim of the canyon, offering stunning views. You can hike as much or as little as you like, as it's a 13-mile trail.\n4. **Hermit Trail**: A less crowded option, this trail is more rugged and steep, but offers unique views of the canyon. It's a 9.5-mile round-trip hike.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to check the Grand Canyon National Park website for up-to-date trail information, as weather conditions can change quickly.\n* Winter weather can be cold and snowy, so pack warm clothing and gear accordingly.\n* Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection, as services can be limited within the park.\n* Consider purchasing an America the Beautiful annual pass, which grants access to all national parks, including the Grand Canyon.\n\n**Flagstaff Stopover:**\n\n* Visit the **Lowell Observatory**, a famous astronomy research facility with stargazing opportunities.\n* Explore **Downtown Flagstaff**, which features a charming atmosphere, shops, and restaurants.\n* Take a short hike at **Walnut Canyon National Monument**, just east of Flagstaff.\n\nI hope this helps you plan an unforgettable trip to the Grand Canyon with your friends!"
