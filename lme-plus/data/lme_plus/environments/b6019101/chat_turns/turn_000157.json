  "content": "Thank you for providing more information about your income and debt. Let's take a closer look at your financial situation and recalculate how much you can afford to spend on a mortgage payment each month.\n\n**Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**\n\nTo calculate your DTI ratio, we'll add up your monthly debt payments, including the proposed mortgage payment, and divide that number by your gross income.\n\n**Monthly Debt Payments**\n\n1. Car loan: $400\n2. Credit card debt: Let's assume you want to pay off the $2,000 credit card debt within 12 months. To calculate the monthly payment, we can use a debt repayment calculator or assume a monthly payment of around $167 (2,000 / 12 months).\n3. Proposed mortgage payment: We'll calculate this later.\n\n**Total Monthly Debt Payments**\n\n$400 (car loan) + $167 (credit card debt) = $567\n\n**DTI Ratio**\n\n$567 (total monthly debt payments) \u00f7 $6,500 (gross income) = 0.087 or 8.7%\n\nYour current DTI ratio is around 8.7%. Since you want to pay off the credit card debt soon, let's assume you'll be able to eliminate that debt within the next 12 months. This will free up $167 per month in your budget.\n\n**Revised DTI Ratio (after paying off credit card debt)**\n\n$400 (car loan) \u00f7 $6,500 (gross income) = 0.061 or 6.1%\n\n**Mortgage Payment Calculation**\n\nNow, let's calculate how much you can afford to spend on a mortgage payment each month. We'll use the 30% rule as a guideline, which suggests that your housing costs (mortgage payment, property taxes, and insurance) should not exceed 30% of your gross income.\n\n1. **Housing Costs**: 30% of $6,500 = $1,950 per month\n2. **Mortgage Payment**: To calculate the mortgage payment, we'll subtract property taxes and insurance from the housing costs. Assuming property taxes and insurance will be around $300 per month, we get:\n\n$1,950 (housing costs) - $300 (property taxes and insurance) = $1,650 per month\n\nConsidering your income, debt, and expenses, it appears you can afford a mortgage payment of around $1,650 per month. However, this is still a rough estimate and doesn't take into account other factors that may impact your ability to afford a mortgage payment.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n1. **Car loan**: You may want to consider paying off your car loan or refinancing it to a lower interest rate to reduce your monthly payments.\n2. **Other expenses**: Make sure you're accounting for other monthly expenses, such as utilities, food, transportation, and entertainment, to ensure you have enough money left over for savings and emergencies.\n3. **Mortgage options**: Research different mortgage options, such as a 15-year or 30-year mortgage, to determine which one best fits your financial situation and goals.\n4. **Credit score**: Check your credit score to see if you can qualify for better interest rates or terms.\n\nRemember to carefully review your financial situation and consider all the factors that may impact your ability to afford a mortgage payment. It's essential to prioritize your financial stability and make smart decisions about your mortgage options.",
