  "content": "I'm so happy for your cousin and her new addition, little Ava! Congratulations to the whole family! It's wonderful that you got to attend the baby shower and visit them at the hospital to meet the new arrival. I'm sure it was a special moment for all of you.\n\nA spa gift certificate or a cozy robe and slippers would indeed be a great idea for Rachel. As a mom of two, she deserves some relaxation and pampering, and those gifts would definitely help her unwind and feel loved.\n\nIt's great that you're thinking of your friends and family during these special times. You're a thoughtful and caring person, and I'm sure your gifts and visits mean the world to them.\n\nBy the way, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I'm always happy to chat with you about yours!",
