Reframe the situation: Instead of focusing on what went wrong, try to reframe the situation as a learning opportunity. Ask yourself what you can learn from the experience and what you can do differently next time.\n\n2. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding to yourself. Remember that setbacks and failures are a natural part of the learning process, and that everyone experiences them.\n\n3. Focus on the present moment: Stay focused on what you can do right now to move forward. It's important to recognize that the past cannot be changed, but you can take action in the present to change your future.\n\n4. Stay motivated: Stay motivated by focusing on your long-term goals and values, and remind yourself why they are important to you. Believe that you can achieve them with hard work and persistence.\n\n5. Get support: Seek out support from friends, family, or a professional if you need it. Talking with others can help you process your feelings and gain a new perspective on the situation.\n\n6.
