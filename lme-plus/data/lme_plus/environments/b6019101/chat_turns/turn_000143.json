Here are some tips to help you find more relevant hashtags for your wellness-related content:\n\n1. **Research popular hashtags in your niche**: Use tools like Hashtagify, RiteTag, or Instagram's built-in search bar to find popular hashtags in the wellness space. Look for hashtags with a moderate to high number of uses (10,000 to 100,000) for better visibility.\n2. **Identify specific sub-niches**: Wellness is a broad topic. Drill down into sub-niches like #yogalife, #mindfulness, #plantbased, #fitnessmotivation, or #selfcare to attract a more targeted audience.\n3. **Use a mix of niche and broad hashtags**: Combine specific hashtags like #wellnesscoaching with broader ones like #healthyliving to reach a wider audience.\n4. **Create a unique branded hashtag**: Develop a branded hashtag that's specific to your content or business. This can help you track user-generated content and create a community around your brand.\n5. **Participate in hashtag challenges**: As you've already discovered, participating in popular challenges like #WellnessWednesday can help increase engagement and attract new followers.\n6. **Use Instagram's \"Reels\" and \"Stories\" hashtags**: Since Instagram's algorithm favors Reels and Stories, use relevant hashtags in these formats to increase your visibility.\n7. **Analyze your competitors' hashtags**: Research your competitors' hashtags and identify ones that are relevant to your content. This can help you tap into their audience and attract new followers.\n8. **Use a hashtag research tool**: Tools like Ahrefs, Hootsuite, or Sprout Social offer hashtag research features that can help you find relevant hashtags and track their performance.\n9. **Keep an eye on trending hashtags**: Use Instagram's \"Discover\" page or third-party tools to stay up-to-date on trending hashtags in the wellness space.\n10. **Rotate and refresh your hashtags**: To avoid fatigue, rotate your hashtags every few weeks and refresh them with new ones to keep your content visible and engaging.\n\nRemember to keep your hashtags relevant to your content, and don't overdo it. Using 5-10 hashtags per post is a good starting point. Good luck, and I hope these tips help you increase your Instagram engagement and attract more followers!",
