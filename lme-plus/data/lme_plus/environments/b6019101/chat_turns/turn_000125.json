  "content": "There are many movies that are known for their great plot twists. Here are some of my recommendations:\n\n1. \"Fight Club\" (1999) - This movie is a classic example of a twist ending that completely changes the viewer's understanding of the story.\n\n2. \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995) - This movie features one of the most iconic plot twists in film history, and it has been emulated in many movies since.\n\n3. \"The Prestige\" (2006) - This movie uses a nonlinear narrative to keep the viewer guessing, and the payoff at the end is worth the wait.\n\n4. \"Memento\" (2000) - This movie is famous for its unconventional storytelling and unexpected twist ending.\n\n5. \"Shutter Island\" (2010) - Although the twist ending in this movie has been debated by many, it is still a fascinating and memorable film.\n\nThese are just a few examples of movies with great plot twists! There are many others out there, and I'd be happy to recommend more based on your preferences.",
