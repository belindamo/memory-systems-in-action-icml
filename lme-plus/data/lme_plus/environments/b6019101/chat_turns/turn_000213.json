  "content": "ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) and SIs (System Integrators) are key players in the software and technology industry. They create and sell software applications and integrate multiple software systems for their clients, respectively. Forming early partnerships with these companies can be highly beneficial for a new platform for the following reasons:\n\n1. Increased market reach: Partnering with established ISVs and SIs provides a new platform with access to a wider market. These partners already have an existing customer base that they can introduce the new platform to, which can lead to an increase in adoption rates and user engagement.\n2. Validation and credibility: Partnering with established ISVs and SIs can lend credibility to a new platform, which can be critical in the early stages of market entry. The endorsement of a well-respected ISV or SI can help to establish the new platform as a reliable and trustworthy solution.\n3. Access to expertise and resources: Partnering with ISVs and SIs can also provide a new platform with access to additional expertise and resources. For example, an SI may be able to provide guidance on how to best integrate the new platform with existing systems or provide technical support, while an ISV may be able to help with software development or provide access to resources such as APIs.\n4. Potential for co-development: Partnering with ISVs and SIs can also create opportunities for co-development. This can result in the creation of new, customized solutions that meet the specific needs of customers.\n\nOverall, early partnerships with ISVs and SIs can help a new platform gain traction, establish credibility, and provide access to additional resources and expertise. It is an important strategy for new platforms to consider when entering the market.",
