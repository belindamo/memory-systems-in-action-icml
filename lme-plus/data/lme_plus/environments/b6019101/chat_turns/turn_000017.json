International pressure: International pressure has been effective in drawing attention to the situation in Tibet and putting pressure on the Chinese government to improve its human rights record. In various forums, government leaders from different countries have urged China to respect the human rights of Tibetan Buddhists.\n\n2. Legal action: Legal action in the international courts by various organizations and individuals against the Chinese government for human rights abuses has put pressure on the government to change its policies towards Tibetan Buddhists.\n\n3. Public awareness: Campaigns by advocacy groups, and individuals have raised public awareness of the situation in Tibet and the plight of Tibetan Buddhists. This increased awareness has led to increased support for the Tibetan cause and more pressure on the Chinese government to change its policies.\n\n4. Increased cooperation: Organizations and governments have increased their cooperation with each other in advocating for Tibetan Buddhists. This increased coordination has led to more success in promoting the cause of religious freedom and human rights in Tibet.\n\nWhile these efforts have had some success, the situation remains difficult for Tibetan Buddhists in China.
