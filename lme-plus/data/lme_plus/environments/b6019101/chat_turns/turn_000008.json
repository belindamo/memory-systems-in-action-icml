I love how the show explores the power of love and the lengths people will go to for those they care about. It sounds like the music and story are really intertwined, which I think would make for a powerful and emotional experience. Can you tell me more about the creative team behind **Hadestown**? Who wrote the music and lyrics, and what was the inspiration behind the show?",
