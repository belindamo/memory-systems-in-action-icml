Let's start with a few assumptions and calculations.\n\n**Current Rent**\n\nYou mentioned you're paying $1,800 per month for a 2-bedroom apartment, which is a bit steep. This will serve as a good starting point for our calculations.\n\n**Gross Income**\n\nWhat is your gross income (before taxes) per month? This will help us determine how much you can afford to spend on a mortgage payment.\n\n**Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**\n\nLenders typically recommend that your DTI ratio not exceed 36%. This means that your total monthly debt payments (including the proposed mortgage payment, car loans, student loans, credit cards, and other debt) should not be more than 36% of your gross income.\n\n**Other Expenses**\n\nDo you have any other monthly expenses that might impact your ability to afford a mortgage payment, such as:\n\n* Car loan or lease payments\n* Student loan payments\n* Credit card debt\n* Alimony or child support\n* Other debt obligations\n\n**Assumptions**\n\nLet's assume you want to allocate a similar amount of your income towards housing costs as you do now (i.e., $1,800 per month). We'll also assume you'll need to factor in property taxes and insurance (PITI) into your mortgage payment.\n\n**Calculations**\n\nBased on these assumptions, here's a rough estimate of how much you can afford to spend on a mortgage payment each month:\n\n1. **Housing Costs as a Percentage of Income**: Let's assume you want to allocate 30% of your gross income towards housing costs (mortgage payment, property taxes, and insurance). This is a common benchmark.\n2. **Gross Income**: Plug in your gross income per month.\n3. **Housing Costs**: Calculate 30% of your gross income.\n4. **Mortgage Payment**: Subtract other housing costs (property taxes and insurance) from your housing costs. A rough estimate for property taxes and insurance is 1.25% of the home's purchase price per year. Let's assume $300 per month for now.\n\nHere's an example calculation:\n\n* Gross Income: $6,000 per month\n* Housing Costs: 30% of $6,000 = $1,800 per month\n* Mortgage Payment: $1,800 - $300 (property taxes and insurance) = $1,500 per month\n\n**Result**\n\nBased on these calculations, it appears you may be able to afford a mortgage payment of around $1,500 per month. However, this is just a rough estimate and doesn't take into account other factors that may impact your ability to afford a mortgage payment, such as your credit score, debt, and other expenses.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nTo get a more accurate picture of how much you can afford, consider the following:\n\n1. Check your credit score: A good credit score can help you qualify for better interest rates and terms.\n2. Review your debt: Make a list of all your debts, including credit cards, student loans, and car loans, to determine your total monthly debt payments.\n3. Research mortgage options: Look into different types of mortgages, such as fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans, and explore government-backed loans like FHA or VA loans.\n4. Consult with a lender: Talk to a lender or mortgage broker to get pre-approved for a mortgage and discuss your options.\n\nRemember, this is just a rough estimate, and your individual circumstances may vary. It's essential to carefully consider all your financial obligations and expenses before making a decision.",
