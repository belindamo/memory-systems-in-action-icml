  "content": "You're welcome! Creating designated quiet areas or alternative learning spaces is an excellent way to cater to auditory learners while also keeping the noise level manageable in the classroom. It's important to encourage students to communicate their learning preferences and to provide them with a safe and conducive learning environment. With patience and creativity, you'll be able to strike a balance between a lively, interactive class with a tolerable noise level and a peaceful, quiet learning environment where auditory learners can concentrate better. Good luck!",
