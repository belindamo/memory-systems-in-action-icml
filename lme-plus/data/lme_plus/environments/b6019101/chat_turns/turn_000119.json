  "content": "Yes, you are correct. In \"The Sixth Sense,\" the plot twist occurs near the end of the movie when it is revealed that the character of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) has been dead the whole time, and he is actually a ghost. This revelation completely changes the viewer's understanding of the events that have been portrayed up until this point. Suddenly, seemingly innocuous details take on a whole new meaning, and the viewer is forced to re-evaluate everything they have seen thus far.\n\nThe impact of this plot twist is profound as it changes the way we view the character of Malcolm Crowe and the story itself. It makes the viewer realize that the narrative they thought they were following was not what it seemed, and it forces them to revisit every scene with new eyes. The twist also adds a layer of emotional complexity to the story, as we realize that this ghostly presence has been trying to help a troubled child throughout the entire movie, and we see his redemption in a new light. Overall, the plot twist in \"The Sixth Sense\" is incredibly powerful and adds a new dimension to the film that makes it unforgettable.",
