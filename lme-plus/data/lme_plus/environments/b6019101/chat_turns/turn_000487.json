The mix of adventure, humor, and heart makes it a great film to watch together as a family.\n\nI completely understand about The NeverEnding Story. It's a beautiful film, but it does deal with some mature themes and intense scenes. It's great that you're considering the sensitivity levels of the younger kids in your family. You can always save it for a later time when they're a bit older and can appreciate its themes and beauty.\n\nWith The Lion King, Back to the Future, and The Goonies, you've got a fantastic lineup for your movie marathon! You might also consider adding some snacks and activities to make the experience even more special. Perhaps you could have a treasure hunt inspired by The Goonies or serve some African-inspired snacks during The Lion King.\n\nHave a fantastic movie marathon, and I hope everyone enjoys the films!",
