  "content": "I think it was the emotional resonance that really stood out to me. I loved how the music in Dear Evan Hansen was able to capture the emotional highs and lows of the characters, and how it really added to the overall impact of the story. With that in mind, I'm leaning more towards **Hadestown** now, since it seems to have a similar emotional resonance. What can you tell me about the story and characters in **Hadestown**?",
