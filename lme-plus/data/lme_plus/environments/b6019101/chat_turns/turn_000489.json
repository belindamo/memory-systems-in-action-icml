Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Movie Trivia**: Create a quiz with questions about the three movies: The Lion King, Back to the Future, and The Goonies. You can include questions about the plots, characters, actors, and behind-the-scenes facts.\n2. **Character Match**: Print out pictures of characters from the three movies and create a matching game. For example, match Simba with Nala, Marty McFly with Doc Brown, or Mikey with Mouth.\n3. **Quote-along**: Prepare a list of famous quotes from the movies and have a quote-along competition. See who can recite the most quotes correctly.\n4. **Movie-themed Charades**: Write down movie titles, characters, or iconic scenes on slips of paper, and have each person act them out for the others to guess.\n5. **The Goonies' Treasure Hunt Challenge**: Hide small treasures or clues around the house, and give each person a treasure map or clues to find them. You can hide items related to the movies, like a small toy lion, a clock (like the one in Back to the Future), or a \"Goonies\"-themed sticker.\n6. **Time-Travel Trivia**: Create a timeline of the events in Back to the Future and have a quiz to see who can put the events in the correct order.\n7. **Lion King Karaoke**: Set up a karaoke session with songs from The Lion King soundtrack. You can even offer prizes for the best performance.\n\nThese games and quizzes will add an extra layer of fun to your movie marathon and create memorable moments with your family. Have fun planning, and I hope everyone enjoys the activities!",
