Here are some common house rules you might encounter:\n\n**1. Quiet Hours**:\n\t* Some hosts may have quiet hours, especially in apartment buildings or shared spaces, to respect neighbors or other guests.\n\t* Be prepared to keep noise levels down during specified hours, usually between 10 PM and 8 AM.\n\n**2. No Smoking**:\n\t* Many hosts prohibit smoking inside the apartment or on the property to maintain a clean and healthy environment.\n\t* If you're a smoker, look for apartments that allow smoking or have a designated smoking area.\n\n**3. No Parties or Events**:\n\t* Some hosts may not allow parties or events in their apartments, especially if they're in a residential building.\n\t* Be respectful of the host's home and neighbors, and avoid hosting gatherings that might disturb others.\n\n**4. Guest Limits**:\n\t* Hosts may have a maximum number of guests allowed in the apartment, so make sure you're not exceeding that limit.\n\t* If you're traveling with a large group, look for apartments that can accommodate your party size.\n\n**5. Check-in and Check-out Times**:\n\t* Hosts may have specific check-in and check-out times, so be sure to respect those hours.\n\t* If you need to arrive earlier or depart later, communicate with the host to see if they can accommodate your request.\n\n**6. Cleaning and Maintenance**:\n\t* Some hosts may require guests to clean up after themselves, including washing dishes, taking out the trash, or doing a load of laundry.\n\t* Be prepared to maintain the apartment's cleanliness and report any issues or damages to the host.\n\n**7. Pet Policy**:\n\t* If you're traveling with a pet, look for apartments that allow pets and understand any pet-related rules or fees.\n\t* Some hosts may have specific requirements, such as pet size or breed restrictions.\n\n**8. Shoes Off**:\n\t* In some cultures or apartments, it's customary to remove shoes before entering the home.\n\t* Be respectful of the host's request, especially if they have a no-shoes policy.\n\n**9. No Candles or Open Flames**:\n\t* Some hosts may prohibit candles, open flames, or incense due to fire safety concerns or insurance restrictions.\n\n**10. Respect the Neighborhood**:\n\t* Be mindful of the neighborhood's quiet hours, parking restrictions, and any other local regulations.\n\t* Be respectful of the host's neighbors and the community to ensure a positive experience for everyone.\n\nWhen booking an Airbnb, make sure to review the house rules carefully and ask the host any questions you may have.
