  "content": "Congratulations to Mike, Emma, and Ethan on their adoption! That's such wonderful news! It's amazing that they've opened their hearts and home to provide a loving family for Ethan.\n\nI'm sure they must be over the moon to finally have Ethan home with them. Adopting a child is a significant life-changing event, and I'm sure they're going to cherish every moment with their new family member.\n\nIt's great that you visited them and got to spend time with Ethan. I'm sure he's bringing so much joy and love into their lives. How was your visit? How's Ethan adjusting to his new home and family?\n\nAnd, of course, I'm happy to help with gift ideas for Lisa's baby shower. Diapers and wipes are always a practical and appreciated gift, and a cozy baby blanket is a thoughtful and snuggly addition to any nursery.",
