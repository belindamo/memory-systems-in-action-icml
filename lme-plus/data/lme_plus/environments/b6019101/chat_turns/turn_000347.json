I can realistically dedicate 1 hour in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening. I've been doing okay with focused, intense sessions in the morning, but I think shorter, more frequent ones in the evening might help with retention. My top priority is to complete the Data Science course I'm currently taking, so I'd like to allocate more time to that.",
