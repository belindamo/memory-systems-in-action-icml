To get the most out of your shoes, make sure to clean them regularly and store them properly when not in use.\n\nIf you're still concerned about durability, you might want to consider purchasing from a retailer with a good return or exchange policy, in case you're not satisfied with the shoes' performance.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Nike has a reputation for producing high-quality, durable basketball shoes.
