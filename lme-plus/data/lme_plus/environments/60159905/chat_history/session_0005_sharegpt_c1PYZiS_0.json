      "content": "To pass UTM parameters through a website form and send the data to an internal Excel database, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Create a form on your website that includes fields for the UTM parameters that you want to track, such as source, medium, campaign, content, and term. You can use HTML or a form builder tool to create the form.\n2. Add hidden fields to the form for each UTM parameter. For example, you can add the following code to the form:\n```html\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"utm_source\" value=\"[source]\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"utm_medium\" value=\"[medium]\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"utm_campaign\" value=\"[campaign]\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"utm_content\" value=\"[content]\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"utm_term\" value=\"[term]\">\n```\nReplace `[source]`, `[medium]`, `[campaign]`, `[content]`, and `[term]` with the corresponding UTM parameter values that you want to track.\n\n3. When the form is submitted, the data will be sent to a server-side script that can extract the UTM parameter values and save them to an Excel database. You can use a scripting language like PHP, Python, or JavaScript to create the server-side script.\n4. In the server-side script, you can extract the UTM parameter values from the form data using the `$_POST` variable in PHP, `request.POST` in Python, or `req.body` in JavaScript. For example, in PHP, you can use the following code to extract the UTM source value:\n```php\n$utm_source = $_POST['utm_source'];\n```\n5. Once you have extracted the UTM parameter values, you can save them to an Excel database using a library like PHPExcel, OpenPyXL, or SheetJS. For example, in PHPExcel, you can use the following code to save the UTM source value to an Excel file:\n```php\nrequire_once 'PHPExcel.php';\n$excel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load('database.xlsx');\n$sheet = $excel->getActiveSheet();\n$row = $sheet->getHighestRow() + 1;\n$sheet->setCellValue('A'.$row, $utm_source);\n$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($excel, 'Excel2007');\n$writer->save('database.xlsx');\n```\nThis code loads an existing Excel file called `database.xlsx`, gets the highest row number in the first sheet, sets the value of cell A[row] to the UTM source value, and saves the updated file. You can modify this code to save the other UTM parameter values to the appropriate columns in your Excel database.\n\n6. Finally, you can retrieve and analyze the UTM data from your Excel database using Excel functions or by exporting the data to a business intelligence tool like Tableau or Power BI.\n\nNote that this approach assumes that you have access to a server-side environment and that you have permission to write to an Excel database. If you don't have access to a server-side environment or want to use a cloud-based database, you can use a third-party form builder tool like JotForm or Google Forms that integrates with cloud databases like Google Sheets or Airtable."
