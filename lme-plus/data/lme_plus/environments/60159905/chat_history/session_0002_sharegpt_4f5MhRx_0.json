      "content": "An ecological niche refers to the unique role or position that a species occupies within an ecosystem. It includes the physical and biological factors that allow the species to survive, reproduce, and interact with its environment. The ecological niche of a species is determined by its physiological, behavioral, and ecological adaptations, such as the food it eats, the type of habitat it lives in, and the temperature and moisture requirements it has. The niche of a species can be very specific, meaning that the species can only survive in a limited range of environmental conditions, or it can be very broad, allowing the species to thrive in a wide range of different environments. The concept of ecological niche is important in understanding how different species interact with one another and with their environment."
