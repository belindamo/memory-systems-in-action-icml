Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\n3. In a large bowl, cream together sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and almond extract.\n4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until a dough forms.

The nutty flavors of the biscotti complement the coffee's balanced acidity and body.\n2. **Fruit and Nut**: Pair a fruit-infused biscotti (e.g., cranberry orange or cherry almond) with a lighter-roasted coffee, like an Ethiopian or Kenyan coffee. The fruit flavors in the biscotti enhance the coffee's bright acidity and fruit notes.\n3. **Chocolate**: Pair a chocolate-dipped biscotti with a rich and bold coffee, like an Italian Roast or a French Roast. The bitter notes of the chocolate and coffee create a decadent and indulgent experience.\n4. **Cantuccini**: Pair cantuccini (small, crunchy almond biscuits) with a stronger coffee, like an Espresso or a Ristretto. The crunchy texture and nutty flavor of the cantuccini provide a delightful contrast to the rich and intense coffee.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Store biscotti in an airtight container to maintain freshness.\n* Consider dipping biscotti in chocolate or flavored syrups (e.g., hazelnut or caramel) for added flavor and texture.\n* Offer a variety of biscotti flavors and coffee blends to cater to different tastes and preferences.\n\nI hope these tips and recipe help you create a wonderful coffee and biscotti experience for your dinner party!
