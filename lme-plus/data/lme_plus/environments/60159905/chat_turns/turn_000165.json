However, I need to clarify that the NBA playoffs schedule is typically released after the regular season ends, and the dates and times of the games are subject to change.\n\nAs of our conversation, the 2022-2023 NBA regular season is still ongoing. The Los Angeles Lakers are indeed fighting for a playoff spot, but the exact schedule for the playoffs has not been announced yet.\n\nI recommend keeping an eye on the official NBA website, the Los Angeles Lakers' website, or reliable sports news sources for the latest updates on the playoff schedule. You can also set reminders or notifications for when the schedule is released, so you don't miss any important games!\n\nIn the meantime, you can continue to follow the Lakers' progress and cheer them on as they push for a playoff spot. Good luck to your team!",
