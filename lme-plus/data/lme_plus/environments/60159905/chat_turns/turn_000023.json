It's great that you're taking steps to monitor your progress and stay motivated.\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to retain information about individual users or keep track of specific dates and purchases. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation.\n\nThat being said, I'd be happy to provide general advice or answer any questions you may have about fitness tracking or smartwatches. If you have any specific questions or topics you'd like to discuss, feel free to ask!",
