That's amazing!\n\nCalculating the total value of your collection can be a bit subjective, but I can guide you through a simple approach. We'll create a few additional columns to help estimate the value of each doll.\n\n**Adding columns for valuation:**\n\n1. **Estimated Value** (your best estimate of the doll's value, based on research or appraisals)\n2. **Source** (where you got the estimate from, e.g., online marketplaces, collector forums, appraisals, etc.)\n3. **Value Type** (e.g., mint, near mint, used, etc.)\n\n**Example updated row:**\n\n| ID | Name | Type | Brand/Manufacturer | Series/Collection | Release Date | Acquisition Date | Description | Condition | Display Status | Notes | Estimated Value | Source | Value Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Sailor Moon Figurine | Figurine | Bandai | Sailor Moon | 2022 | 2023-02-10 | Limited Edition, Japan exclusive | Mint in Box | Displayed | Special edition package | $200 | Online Marketplace | Mint |\n| 2 | Vintage Barbie (1960s) | Fashion Doll | Mattel | Vintage Barbie | 1965 | 2023-03-05 | Original packaging and accessories | Mint | Displayed | Rare find, still in original box | $1,500 | Collector Forum | Mint |\n\n**Calculating the total value:**\n\nCreate a new column to calculate the total value of your collection. You can use the `SUM` function in Google Sheets to add up the estimated values.\n\n1. **Total Value** ( formula: `=SUM(Estimated Value)` )\n\n**Example:**\n\n| ID | ... | Estimated Value | ... | Total Value |\n| --- | ... | --- | ... | --- |\n| 1 | ... | $200 | ... | =SUM(Estimated Value) |\n| 2 | ... | $1,500 | ... |  |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |  |\n| 37 | ... | $X | ... |  |\n|  |  |  |  | **Total:** $1,700 |\n\nIn this example, the `Total Value` column will automatically update as you add or update the estimated values for each doll. You can also use this column to track changes in the total value over time.\n\n**Tips for estimating values:**\n\n1. Research online marketplaces like eBay, Amazon, or specialized doll marketplaces to get an idea of what similar dolls are selling for.\n2. Consult collector forums, social media groups, or online communities dedicated to doll collecting.\n3. Consider getting your dolls appraised by a professional, especially for rare or high-value items.\n4. Keep in mind that the value of your dolls can fluctuate over time, so it's essential to regularly update your estimates.\n\nRemember to keep your spreadsheet organized, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance. Congratulations again on your growing collection!",
