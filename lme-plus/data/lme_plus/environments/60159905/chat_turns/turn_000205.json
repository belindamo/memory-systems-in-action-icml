I'd be happy to help you create a spreadsheet to organize your doll collection.\n\nHere's a suggested template to get you started:\n\n**Doll Collection Inventory Spreadsheet**\n\n**Columns:**\n\n1. **ID** (unique identifier for each doll)\n2. **Name** (name of the doll or character)\n3. **Type** (e.g., fashion doll, figurine, ball-jointed doll, etc.)\n4. **Brand/Manufacturer** (e.g., Mattel, Bandai, etc.)\n5. **Series/Collection** (e.g., Sailor Moon, Barbie, etc.)\n6. **Release Date** (if applicable)\n7. **Acquisition Date** (date you received the doll)\n8. **Description** (brief notes about the doll, e.g., limited edition, exclusive, etc.)\n9. **Condition** (e.g., new, used, mint in box, etc.)\n10. **Display Status** (e.g., displayed, stored, etc.)\n11. **Notes** (any additional information you want to keep track of)\n\n**Example Row:**\n\n| ID | Name | Type | Brand/Manufacturer | Series/Collection | Release Date | Acquisition Date | Description | Condition | Display Status | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Sailor Moon Figurine | Figurine | Bandai | Sailor Moon | 2022 | 2023-02-10 | Limited Edition, Japan exclusive | Mint in Box | Displayed | Special edition package |\n\nYou can add or remove columns as needed to fit your specific collection. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n* Use a unique ID for each doll to make it easier to reference and update information.\n* Include a brief description of each doll to help you remember the details.\n* Use the Condition column to track the state of each doll, including any flaws or damage.\n* The Display Status column can help you keep track of which dolls are currently on display and which are stored away.\n* The Notes column is for any additional information you want to keep track of, such as the doll's value, provenance, or any restoration work done.\n\nYou can use Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to create your spreadsheet. If you're not familiar with spreadsheets, you can also consider using a digital collection tracking app like Collectionaire or DollKeeper.\n\nGood luck with organizing your collection, and enjoy displaying your new Sailor Moon figurine!",
