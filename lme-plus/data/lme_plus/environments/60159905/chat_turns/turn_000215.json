Displaying your antique vintage camera collection can add a unique touch to your living room and spark interesting conversations with guests.\n\nI'm happy to help you create a spreadsheet to organize and track your camera collection as well. Here's a suggested template:\n\n**Camera Collection Spreadsheet**\n\n**Columns:**\n\n1. **ID** (unique identifier for each camera)\n2. **Make** (manufacturer of the camera)\n3. **Model** (model name or number of the camera)\n4. **Year** (year the camera was produced)\n5. **Type** (type of camera, e.g., film, digital, SLR, rangefinder, etc.)\n6. **Condition** (e.g., excellent, good, fair, poor)\n7. **Working Condition** (whether the camera is in working condition or not)\n8. **Value** (estimated value of the camera, based on research or appraisals)\n9. **Source** (where you got the value estimate from, e.g., online marketplaces, collector forums, appraisals, etc.)\n10. **Notes** (any additional information, such as rarity, historical significance, or restoration work needed)\n11. **Display Status** (whether the camera is currently on display or stored)\n\n**Example Row:**\n\n| ID | Make | Model | Year | Type | Condition | Working Condition | Value | Source | Notes | Display Status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Kodak | Brownie | 1920s | Film | Excellent | Needs servicing | $500 | Collector Forum | Rare model, needs cleaning and lubrication | On Display |\n\n**Calculating the total value:**\n\nCreate a new column to calculate the total value of your camera collection. You can use the `SUM` function in Google Sheets to add up the estimated values.\n\n1. **Total Value** (formula: `=SUM(Value)` )\n\n**Example:**\n\n| ID | ... | Value | ... | Total Value |\n| --- | ... | --- | ... | --- |\n| 1 | ... | $500 | ... | =SUM(Value) |\n| 2 | ... | $200 | ... |  |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |  |\n| 10 | ... | $X | ... |  |\n|  |  |  |  | **Total:** $5,000 |\n\n**Tips for estimating values:**\n\n1. Research online marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, or specialized camera forums to get an idea of what similar cameras are selling for.\n2. Consult collector forums, social media groups, or online communities dedicated to vintage camera collecting.\n3. Consider getting your cameras appraised by a professional or seeking estimates from reputable dealers.\n4. Keep in mind that the value of your cameras can fluctuate over time, so it's essential to regularly update your estimates.\n\nRemember to keep your spreadsheet organized, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance. Congratulations on your beautiful camera collection!",
