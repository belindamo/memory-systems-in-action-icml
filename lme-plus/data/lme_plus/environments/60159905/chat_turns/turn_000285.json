But I can offer some general tips on increasing engagement and getting more responses from your followers on Instagram Stories:\n\n1. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage followers to share their thoughts, opinions, or experiences.\n2. **Make it relevant and timely**: Ask questions that are relevant to your content, audience, or current events. This will increase the likelihood of getting more responses.\n3. **Keep it concise and clear**: Keep your question concise and easy to understand. Avoid asking complex or multi-part questions.\n4. **Use humor and creativity**: Add a touch of humor or creativity to your question to make it more engaging and attention-grabbing.\n5. **Use the \"Poll\" sticker**: In addition to the \"Question\" sticker, use the \"Poll\" sticker to ask followers to vote on a topic or choose between options.\n6. **Timing is everything**: Post your question at a time when your followers are most active and engaged, such as during peak hours or during a live event.\n7. **Encourage engagement**: Ask followers to share their own experiences, tips, or stories related to the question. This can help create a sense of community and encourage more responses.\n8. **Respond to responses**: Engage with followers who respond to your question by commenting, liking, or sharing their responses. This will encourage more followers to participate.\n9. **Use Instagram's features**: Take advantage of Instagram's features, such as the \"Question\" sticker, \"Poll\" sticker, and \"Chat\" sticker, to make your content more engaging and interactive.\n10. **Monitor and adjust**: Keep an eye on your Instagram Insights to see which types of questions and content are performing well, and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\nRemember, engagement is a two-way street.
