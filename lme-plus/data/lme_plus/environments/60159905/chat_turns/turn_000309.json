Here are some tips to help you portion like a pro:\n\n**Portioning Tips:**\n\n1. **Use a scale:** Invest in a kitchen scale to measure out exact portions. This ensures consistency and helps you track your macronutrients if you're tracking them.\n2. **Measure by volume:** If you don't have a scale, use measuring cups to portion out your quinoa and veggies. A general guideline is to use 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of cooked quinoa per serving.\n3. **Visualize your portions:** Divide your quinoa salad into equal portions based on your individual container size. For example, if you're using 8 oz containers, aim for 3-4 oz of quinoa and 4-5 oz of veggies.\n4. **Layer your ingredients:** Start with a layer of quinoa, followed by a layer of veggies, and finally a drizzle of citrus vinaigrette. This helps keep the ingredients separate and makes the salad look appealing.\n5. **Leave room for toppings:** Consider leaving a small space at the top of the container for any additional toppings you might want to add later, like nuts, seeds, or avocado.\n6. **Label and date your containers:** Use a marker to label each container with the date, meal name, and any relevant notes (e.g., \"Quinoa Salad Jar - 3/10 - Add nuts and seeds\").\n7. **Store them properly:** Place the containers in the refrigerator and store them at a consistent refrigerator temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n\n**Container Preparation:**\n\n1. **Choose the right size:** Select containers that are the right size for your portions. You can use small, medium, or large containers depending on your meal prep needs.\n2. **Prepare your containers:** Before filling, make sure your containers are clean and dry. You can also add a small piece of parchment paper or a silicone liner to prevent sticking.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Cook quinoa in bulk:** Cook a large batch of quinoa and portion it out into individual containers to save time during the week.\n2. **Prep veggies in advance:** Chop and prep your veggies on the weekend or a day before, and store them in separate containers to make assembly easier.\n3. **Customize your portions:** Adjust the portion sizes based on your individual calorie needs and dietary preferences.\n4. **Get creative with toppings:** Experiment with different toppings like nuts, seeds, cheese, and proteins to keep your meals interesting and satisfying.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be a meal prep pro in no time!",
