That's a great achievement, and I'm sure it'll help you make progress on your stories.\n\nCreating compelling characters is a crucial aspect of storytelling, and it's great that you're focusing on making them relatable and realistic, even in a sci-fi setting. Here are some tips to help you craft characters that will resonate with your readers:\n\n1. **Give them relatable motivations**: Characters should have desires, fears, and motivations that readers can identify with. Even in a sci-fi setting, characters should have universal human desires, such as love, acceptance, or a sense of belonging.\n2. **Make them multidimensional**: Characters should have contradictions and flaws that make them more realistic and relatable. A character who is both brave and afraid, or confident and insecure, is more interesting than one who is purely one-dimensional.\n3. **Create a rich backstory**: Each character has a history that shapes who they are today. Develop a backstory for your characters, including their family, education, relationships, and significant life events. This will help you understand their motivations and behaviors.\n4. **Use dialogue and body language**: Characters should speak and move in a way that's consistent with their personality and background. Dialogue and body language can reveal a character's traits, emotions, and intentions.\n5. **Show vulnerability**: Characters should be vulnerable and open to growth. This makes them more relatable and allows readers to invest in their journey.\n6. **Avoid stereotypes and tropes**: Steer clear of overused character archetypes and stereotypes. Instead, focus on creating unique individuals with their own strengths, weaknesses, and quirks.\n7. **Make them active, not passive**: Characters should drive the plot forward through their actions and decisions. Avoid making them too reactive or passive, as this can make them seem unengaging.\n8. **Use character development to reveal theme**: Characters can illustrate the theme of your story through their growth, struggles, and relationships. This helps to create a more cohesive and impactful narrative.\n9. **Be consistent**: Consistency is key when it comes to character development. Ensure that your characters' actions, dialogue, and behavior align with their personality and traits.\n10. **Know when to hold back**: Don't reveal too much about your characters too quickly. Leave some mystery and intrigue to keep readers engaged and curious about your characters.\n\nIn the context of sci-fi, you can also consider the following:\n\n* **How do characters adapt to new technologies or environments?**: Show how your characters learn, adapt, and respond to the unique challenges of a sci-fi setting.\n* **How do characters interact with AI or alien species?**: Explore the relationships between humans and non-human entities, and how these interactions reveal character traits and themes.\n* **What are the consequences of advanced technologies on character relationships?**: Consider how advanced technologies, such as memory extraction or virtual reality, impact character relationships and interactions.\n\nRemember, character development is an ongoing process, and it's okay to learn and grow alongside your characters. The most important thing is to create characters that resonate with you and your readers.\n\nI hope these tips help you in crafting compelling characters for your short stories!
