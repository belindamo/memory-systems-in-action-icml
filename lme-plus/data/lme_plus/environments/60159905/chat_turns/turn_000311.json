Having a new cookbook can be really exciting, and it's great that you're already thinking about putting the recipes into practice with your meal prep.\n\nWhat's the name of the cookbook, if you don't mind me asking? I'm always curious about new cookbooks, and I might be able to help you with any questions or provide suggestions for recipes to try.\n\nAlso, how do you like the containers you got from Walmart? Are they working out well for you so far?",
