I recently finished listening to the entire \"How I Built This\" podcast series by Guy Raz, which explores the stories behind some of the world's most successful companies. It was really inspiring and motivating, and it's made me think more about my own career goals and aspirations. Have you listened to any educational podcasts or taken any online courses that you'd recommend?",
