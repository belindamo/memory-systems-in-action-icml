  "content": "What a great choice! Reading The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August in print will definitely be a different experience from listening to an audiobook, and I think you'll appreciate the opportunity to savor the language and introspective tone of the novel.\n\nAnd yay! I'm so glad you loved American Gods as an audiobook! The audiobook version is indeed amazing, and George Guidall's narration brings the story to life in a wonderful way. Neil Gaiman's writing is already so vivid and immersive, but the audiobook adds an extra layer of depth and atmosphere to the story.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention listening to a lot of audiobooks lately. I've noticed that many readers enjoy switching between audiobooks and print books, depending on their mood, schedule, or the type of story they're in the mood for. Do you find that you prefer audiobooks for certain types of stories or genres, or is it more about the convenience of being able to listen on-the-go?\n\nAlso, what did you think of the ending of American Gods? Without giving away any spoilers, I'm curious to know if you found the conclusion satisfying or if you were left with any lingering questions or thoughts about the story.",
