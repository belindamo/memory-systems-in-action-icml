Here are some tips and recommendations for making a delicious vegan marinara sauce:\n\n**Homemade Marinara Sauce Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 medium onion, finely chopped\n* 4-6 garlic cloves, minced\n* 2 cups canned crushed tomatoes (look for a brand with no added salt or sugar)\n* 1 cup canned diced tomatoes\n* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1 teaspoon dried basil\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for some heat)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.\n2. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n3. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant.\n4. Add the crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using).\n5. Stir well to combine, then bring the sauce to a simmer.\n6. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the flavors have melded together and the sauce has thickened slightly.\n\n**Store-Bought Options:**\n\nIf you're short on time or prefer a convenient option, look for a high-quality, vegan marinara sauce at your local health food store or online. Some popular brands include:\n\n* Rao's Homemade Marinara Sauce (make sure to choose the vegan version)\n* Buitoni Marinara Sauce\n* Amy's Organic Marinara Sauce\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use fresh tomatoes: If you have the time and resources, use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Simply blanch and peel them, then chop and add to the saucepan.\n* Add some depth: A splash of red wine, balsamic vinegar, or nutritional yeast can add depth and complexity to your marinara sauce.\n* Spice it up: Add some diced bell peppers, mushrooms, or olives to give your sauce some extra flavor and texture.\n* Make it arrabbiata: Add some diced jalape\u00f1os or hot sauce to give your marinara a spicy kick.\n\nNow, go ahead and pair your homemade marinara sauce with your tofu meatballs and lasagna for a delicious, satisfying, and vegan Italian-inspired meal!\n\nP.S. Congratulations on learning how to make vegan mac and cheese at the cooking class! Cashew cream and nutritional yeast are a game-changer for vegan cheese sauces.",
