His album \"Sing to Me Instead\" is a great blend of pop and show tunes.\n2. **Sara Bareilles**: While not strictly a musical theatre artist, Sara Bareilles' music often has a theatrical quality to it. Her album \"What's Inside: Songs from Waitress\" is a great example, featuring songs she wrote for the musical \"Waitress.\"\n3. **Josh Groban**: With his powerful vocals and classical training, Josh Groban's music often has a musical theatre flair. His album \"Stages\" features covers of famous show tunes.\n\n**Pop Artists with a Theatrical Bent**\n\n1. **Lorde**: While not a traditional musical theatre artist, Lorde's music often has a dramatic, cinematic quality to it.
