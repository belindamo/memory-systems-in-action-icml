Here are some popular and highly-regarded expansions for Carcassonne:\n\n1. **Inns and Cathedrals**: This is a classic expansion that adds new mechanics, including inns (which score points for roads) and cathedrals (which score points for cities). It's a great starting point and adds a lot of depth to the game.\n2. **Traders and Builders**: This expansion introduces new mechanics like trade goods, which allow players to score points for certain city configurations, and builders, which enable players to place a second tile on their turn. It's a great expansion for players who enjoy strategic planning.\n3. **Princess and Dragon**: This expansion adds a princess token that can be used to block other players' followers, and a dragon that can be used to remove followers from the board. It adds a bit of interaction and competition to the game.\n4. **Abbey and Mayor**: This expansion introduces new mechanic where players can build abbeys, which score points for surrounding landscape features, and mayors, which allow players to score points for cities in a specific way.\n5. **Under the Big Top**: This expansion adds a circus theme, with new followers and mechanics that allow players to score points for circus tents, animals, and performances.\n\nThese expansions are all highly rated and can be mixed and matched to create a unique Carcassonne experience. If you're looking for a good starting point, I'd recommend Inns and Cathedrals or Traders and Builders.\n\nSome tips for choosing expansions:\n\n* Consider your girlfriend's playstyle and preferences. If she enjoys strategic planning, Traders and Builders might be a good fit. If she enjoys interacting with other players, Princess and Dragon could be a good choice.\n* Start with a single expansion and see how it changes the gameplay. You can always add more expansions later.\n* You can also consider the 10th Anniversary Edition of Carcassonne, which includes some of the expansions and new artwork.\n\nRemember, expansions can change the gameplay dynamics, so it's essential to read the rules and understand how they interact with the base game before introducing them to your girlfriend.",
