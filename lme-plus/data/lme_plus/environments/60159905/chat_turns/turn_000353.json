Did you find the process of making pasta dough from scratch intimidating at first, or did you dive right in?\n\nNow that you've made fettuccine, you might want to experiment with other types of pasta shapes, like spaghetti, pappardelle, or even filled pasta like ravioli or tortellini. The possibilities are endless, and it's exciting to think about all the different flavors and ingredients you can combine with your homemade pasta.\n\nWhat's next on your pasta-making agenda?
