I've been focusing on making them more multidimensional and giving them relatable motivations.\n\nSpeaking of characters, I've been wondering about how to create a compelling protagonist. Do you have any tips on how to make a protagonist that readers will root for? I want to make sure my protagonist is likable and relatable, but also flawed and realistic.\n\nAlso, I've been thinking about my writing schedule and habits. I've been trying to set aside 30 minutes every day to write, but I'm not sure if that's enough. Do you have any advice on how to establish a consistent writing routine and stay motivated?",
