That's great!\n\nIt's wonderful that you've found a activity that helps you relax and unwind after a long day. The combination of light stretching exercises and watching a familiar, comforting TV show can be very soothing. The routine itself becomes a signal to your brain that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep.\n\nBy doing this routine consistently between 9-10 pm, you're creating a predictable sleep schedule, which can help regulate your body's internal clock. This can lead to improved sleep quality, better energy levels, and even enhanced overall well-being.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention watching a rerun of your favorite show. Familiarity can be very comforting, and watching something you know and love can be a great way to relax. It's almost like your brain is saying, \"Ah, I know what's going to happen next. I can just relax and enjoy the ride.\"\n\nRemember to continue doing what works for you and making adjustments as needed. If you find that your routine starts to feel stale or you need to make changes, you can always experiment with new activities or habits to keep things fresh.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing, and enjoy your relaxing evening routine!",
