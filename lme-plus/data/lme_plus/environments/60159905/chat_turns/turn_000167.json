However, I need to clarify that the UEFA Champions League schedule can be a bit complex, and matches are typically played on specific days of the week.\n\nThe Liverpool vs Bayern Munich match you're referring to was likely played during the 2022-2023 UEFA Champions League group stage, which took place from September to November 2022. The knockout phase of the tournament started in February 2023.\n\nTo get the latest information on the UEFA Champions League schedule, I recommend checking the official UEFA website or reliable sports news sources. They usually provide updated fixtures, schedules, and results for all the teams participating in the tournament.\n\nAs for Liverpool's next match, I would suggest checking the official Liverpool FC website or their social media channels for the latest updates on their upcoming fixtures. You can also sign up for their newsletter or follow reputable sports news sources to stay informed about their schedule.\n\nRemember to double-check the dates and times of the matches, as they might be subject to change. Enjoy the rest of the tournament!",
