I'd be happy to help you find a scenic route that fits your description.\n\nSince I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your exact location, but I can provide you with some general guidance on how to find a route that meets your criteria.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Map Apps and Websites**: Use online mapping tools like MapMyRide, Strava, or Ride with GPS to explore routes in the countryside 30 miles east of your location. These platforms allow you to filter routes by distance, elevation gain, and surface type. You can also read reviews and ratings from other cyclists to get an idea of the route's scenery and difficulty.\n2. **Local Bike Shops or Cycling Clubs**: Reach out to local bike shops or cycling clubs in the area you're planning to visit. They often have knowledge of the best routes in the region and can provide you with recommendations tailored to your preferences.\n3. **State or County Websites**: Check the website of the state or county you're planning to visit for information on bike trails, scenic byways, or rural routes. Many government websites have resources on cycling routes, including maps and descriptions.\n4. **Scenic Byways**: Look for designated Scenic Byways or rural routes in the area. These routes are often chosen for their natural beauty and can provide a more leisurely and scenic ride.\n\nWhen searching for a route, keep an eye out for features like:\n\n* Rolling hills with moderate elevation gain (around 500-1000 feet)\n* Rural landscapes with open fields, forests, and farmland\n* Lakes, rivers, or streams along the route\n* Quiet roads with minimal traffic\n* Scenic overlooks or vistas\n\nRemember to always check the route conditions, road surfaces, and any local regulations before heading out on your ride. It's also a good idea to bring a map, snacks, and plenty of water to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find a beautiful route for your countryside bike trip!",
