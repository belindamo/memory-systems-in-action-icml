Do you think we could also have a potluck where everyone brings a dish to share? That way we can all try each other's favorite foods. By the way, we decided to have this picnic because our last family get-together was so much fun - we had our annual family reunion at my aunt's house last weekend and it was amazing. We're all looking forward to catching up again next month.",
