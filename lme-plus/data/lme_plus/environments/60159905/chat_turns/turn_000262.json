I've been focusing on creating characters that are multidimensional and have relatable motivations. I've also been trying to show their vulnerability and make them more active in driving the plot forward.\n\nSpeaking of plot, I've been thinking about the pacing of my stories. Do you have any tips on how to balance action, dialogue, and description in a sci-fi story? I want to make sure my stories have a good flow and don't feel too slow or too fast.",
