  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have an opinion or a perspective on an institution's reliance on technology. However, a lot of organizations implement technology extensively to remain competitive and thrive in today's digital world. While using technology can bring tremendous benefits, overreliance on technology can also have negative impacts, such as dependency on outdated software, over-reliance on automated systems, and significant cybersecurity risks.\n\nSuccessful institutions understand the potential risks that come with overreliance on technology and implement strategies to mitigate them. They design their systems in such a way to ensure flexibility and maintain control over technology usage. They also take a balanced approach by combining digital tools and human expertise to ensure that technology is put to the best use possible.\n\nTherefore, it's critical for institutions to keep a balance between technology and human expertise, ensuring they make the best use of both. Doing so would help maintain their competitive advantage and improve their overall effectiveness.",
