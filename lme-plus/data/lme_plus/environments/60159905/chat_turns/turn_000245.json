It's a fantasy adventure set in a mythical Middle Eastern world, where a retired holy warrior named Adoulla Makhslood must team up with a young tribeswoman and a mysterious assassin to stop a powerful evil force from destroying the city. The novel combines elements of Arabian Nights, sword and sorcery, and horror.\n* **The Black Khan** (2019) - This is the second book in the Crescent City series, set about 10 years after the events of **Throne of the Crescent Moon**. The story follows Adoulla's friend and fellow holy warrior, Raseed bas Raseed, as he navigates the complexities of court politics and supernatural threats in a fantastical Middle Eastern city.\n\n**Nnedi Okorafor:**\n\nNnedi Okorafor is a Nigerian-American science fiction and fantasy author, born in 1971. Her work often explores the intersection of African culture, mythology, and science fiction, with a focus on strong female characters and social commentary. Okorafor's writing is known for its vibrant world-building, unique magical systems, and exploration of identity, culture, and power.\n\n**Recommended starting point:** **Who Fears Death**\n\n* **Who Fears Death** (2010) - This novel is set in a post-apocalyptic Sudan and follows a young woman named Onyesonwu, who is the product of a rape between a sorcerer and a woman from a rival tribe. Onyesonwu embarks on a journey to defeat her sorcerer father and bring peace to the war-torn land. The novel combines elements of fantasy, science fiction, and African mythology.\n* **Binti** (2015) - This novella is the first book in the Binti trilogy and follows a young Himba girl named Binti, who is accepted into the prestigious Oomza University, which is located on another planet. Binti's journey becomes a quest to understand her own identity, culture, and the mysteries of the universe.\n\nBoth authors offer a unique blend of fantasy and science fiction elements, with a focus on diverse characters and world-building. If you're interested in exploring more African and Middle Eastern-inspired fantasy, I'd recommend starting with **Who Fears Death** or **Throne of the Crescent Moon**. If you prefer a more science fiction-oriented story, **Binti** might be a great starting point.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more recommendations!",
