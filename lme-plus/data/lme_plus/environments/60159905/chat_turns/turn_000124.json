  "content": "I was thinking of something related to honey, since I'm using honey in my soap recipes and it's a natural ingredient. Maybe something like \"Honeyed Skin\" or \"Beeutiful Soaps\"? I like the idea of incorporating a bee or honeycomb into the logo, but I'm not sure how to make it look professional and not too childish.\n\nAlso, I'm considering offering a discount to customers who bring their own containers for refills. Do you think that's a good idea?",
