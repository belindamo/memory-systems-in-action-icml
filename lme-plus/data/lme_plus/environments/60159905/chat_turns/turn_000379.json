The personalized photo album from Shutterfly is a wonderful idea, and I'm sure she'll treasure it.\n\nSince you've already spent $60, you might not need to get another gift, but if you want to add a little something extra or surprise her with a small treat, here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Candle or home fragrance**: A nice candle or room spray from a brand like Yankee Candle (you mentioned you liked their products!) or a similar brand could complement the photo album nicely. ($10-$30)\n2. **Gourmet food or tea**: A box of gourmet chocolates, specialty teas, or a gourmet food item she's been wanting to try could be a lovely addition to your gift. ($10-$30)\n3. **Flowers or plants**: A bouquet of her favorite flowers or a potted plant can add a touch of elegance and freshness to her space. ($20-$50)\n4. **Relaxation and self-care**: A scented eye mask, a set of essential oils, or a gift certificate for a massage or spa day could help her relax and unwind. ($20-$50)\n5. **Book or magazine subscription**: If your mom enjoys reading, consider gifting her a book by her favorite author or a subscription to a magazine that aligns with her interests. ($10-$20)\n\nRemember, the thought and love behind the gift matter more than the price tag. Your mom will appreciate the personalized photo album, and any additional gift you choose will be a nice surprise.\n\nIf you're happy with the album, you could also consider creating a special experience or memory with your mom, like planning a fun outing or activity together. Sometimes, the best gifts are the ones that create lasting memories!",
