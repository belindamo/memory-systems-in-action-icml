As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences, so I didn't actually go to Walmart or buy any containers or cookbooks. I'm just here to provide information and assist with questions!\n\nHowever, I'm happy to help you with your meal prep planning and grocery shopping. If you'd like to share what ingredients you're planning to use this week, I can offer suggestions or recipe ideas to help you make the most of your groceries!",
