I've been thinking about my own writing, and I realized that I started writing short stories again on 15th February, after a gap of almost six months. It's been great to get back into the habit, and I've been setting aside 30 minutes every day to write. I've found that it really helps me to brainstorm and develop my ideas. Speaking of which, do you have any tips on how to create compelling characters? I'm particularly interested in creating characters that feel relatable and realistic, even in a sci-fi setting.",
