The most recent Super Bowl, Super Bowl LVII, was played on February 12, 2023.\n\nIf you're thinking of a different game, could you please provide more details or context about the game you're referring to? I'd be happy to try and help you find the score or information you're looking for.\n\nAlso, it sounds like you had an exciting party! Watching sports with friends can be such a fun and energetic experience.",
