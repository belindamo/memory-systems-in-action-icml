She's already familiar with your practice and teaching style, so it's likely she can tailor a private lesson to your specific needs and goals.\n\nIf she doesn't offer private lessons or isn't a good fit, the other options I mentioned are definitely worth exploring. Remember to communicate clearly with any potential instructor about your goals, needs, and expectations to ensure you find the right fit.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further recommendations. I'm always here to help.\n\nGood luck with your private lesson search, and I hope you find an instructor who helps you take your practice to the next level!",
