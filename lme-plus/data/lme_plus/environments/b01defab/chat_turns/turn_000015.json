  "content": "Sure, here are some more examples of provocative questions from the Spark Selling methodology:\n\n1. \"What's the real cost of not solving this problem?\"\n2. \"What's the real impact on your customers if you don't address this issue?\"\n3. \"What's the real opportunity cost of not taking action now?\"\n4. \"What's the real effect on your bottom line if you don't make this change?\"\n5. \"What's the real reason you're hesitant to move forward?\"\n6. \"What's the real reason you haven't made a decision yet?\"\n7. \"What's the real reason you're considering alternative solutions?\"\n8. \"What's the real reason you're not fully committed to this project/initiative?\"\n9. \"What's the real reason you're holding back resources/budget for this?\"\n10. \"What's the real reason you're not fully on board with this idea/concept?\"\n\nThese questions are designed to push the prospect to consider the implications of not taking action, and to help the salesperson understand the customer's underlying motivations, fears and concerns. This allows the salesperson to address the customer's true needs and provide solutions that align with their objectives.",
