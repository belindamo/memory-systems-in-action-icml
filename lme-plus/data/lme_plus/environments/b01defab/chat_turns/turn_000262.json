  "content": "Yes, as amphibians grow and develop, they rely less on cutaneous respiration and more on pulmonary respiration (breathing through lungs). This is because their lungs develop and become more efficient at exchanging gases. \n\nIn the beginning, amphibians hatch from an egg in an aquatic environment and rely on cutaneous respiration to get enough oxygen until they develop functional lungs. Once they start to develop lungs, they will gradually transition from relying mostly on cutaneous respiration to using their lungs more and more. The exact timing and pattern of this transition depend on the species, but in general, this transition occurs during the metamorphosis stage, when the juvenile amphibians undergo a dramatic transformation from a water-breathing larva to a lung-breathing adult. \n\nDuring metamorphosis, the animals\u2019 gills and tail (if present) are usually reabsorbed, and the lungs and circulatory system undergo significant changes to accommodate the transition to a terrestrial lifestyle. Once the juvenile amphibians develop functional lungs, they can breathe both through their lungs and their skin, but as they continue to grow and mature, they become increasingly dependent on lung respiration.\n\nIn summary, amphibians develop the ability to breathe through their lungs as they grow older and depend more on lung respiration than cutaneous respiration as they mature.",
