  "content": "I'm planning a bike trip to the Blue Ridge Parkway this summer and I'm trying to figure out what kind of safety gear I should bring. I recently got a new bike light, a Bontrager Flare R, which has been great for my evening rides, but I'm wondering if there's anything else I should consider.
