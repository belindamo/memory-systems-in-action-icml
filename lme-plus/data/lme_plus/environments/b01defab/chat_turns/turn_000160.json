  "content": "Sure! Here's the formula:\n\nFor each animal i:\nLet F\\_i = min(max(F \\* H\\_i / (H\\_1 + H\\_2 + H\\_3 + H\\_4 + H\\_5), L\\_i), M\\_i)\n\nThis formula calculates the proportional hunger level of each animal, allocates a proportional amount of food (F \\* H\\_i / (H\\_1 + H\\_2 + H\\_3 + H\\_4 + H\\_5)), and then clamps the result between the minimum and maximum amount for that animal. The min() function ensures that the animal gets at least L\\_i food if the proportional allocation is less than that, and the max() function ensures that the animal gets at most M\\_i food if the proportional allocation is greater than that.",
