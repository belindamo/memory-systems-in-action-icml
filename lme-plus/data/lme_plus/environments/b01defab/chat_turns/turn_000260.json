  "content": "Yes, all amphibians have the ability to breathe through their skin. Gas exchange through the skin is one of the defining features of the Class Amphibia, which includes frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians. However, the effectiveness of cutaneous respiration varies between different species and life stages. For example, juvenile amphibians and aquatic species tend to rely more on cutaneous respiration, while adult terrestrial species rely primarily or exclusively on pulmonary respiration (breathing through the lungs). The skin of amphibians is highly permeable to gases due to its structure and high vascularity, allowing for efficient gas exchange. However, the skin is also vulnerable to environmental pollutants and pathogens, which can enter the animal's bloodstream through the skin. Overall, the ability to breathe through the skin has allowed amphibians to colonize a wide range of habitats, including aquatic and terrestrial environments.",
