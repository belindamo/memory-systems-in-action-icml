  "content": "White Peony Tea is a lovely and delicate tea that's perfect for exploring the world of floral teas.\n\nYes, White Peony Tea does contain some caffeine, but the amount is relatively low compared to other teas. On average, a cup of White Peony Tea can contain between 6-8 milligrams of caffeine. For comparison, a standard cup of green tea typically contains around 25-30 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nThe caffeine content in White Peony Tea is due to the young leaves and silvery buds used in its production. However, the delicate processing and minimal oxidation help to reduce the caffeine levels, making it a great option for those who are sensitive to caffeine or prefer a more relaxed tea experience.\n\nWhen brewing White Peony Tea, be sure to use water at a lower temperature (around 160\u00b0F to 170\u00b0F) and steep the leaves for a shorter time (around 2-3 minutes) to bring out the floral and fruity notes. This will help to minimize the bitterness and astringency that can come with higher-caffeine teas.\n\nI hope you enjoy your White Peony Tea experience! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further guidance on brewing or pairing.",
