  "content": "Mythology-inspired books are fascinating! I'd be happy to recommend some titles beyond \"The Song of Achilles\". Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Circe** by Madeline Miller: Another beautifully written novel by the same author as \"The Song of Achilles\", this one retells the story of Circe, the witch from Homer's \"The Odyssey\".\n2. **The Silence of the Girls** by Pat Barker: A retelling of the Trojan War from the perspective of Briseis, a Trojan princess who becomes a concubine to Achilles.\n3. **The Penelopiad** by Margaret Atwood: A novella that reimagines Homer's \"The Odyssey\" from the perspective of Penelope, Odysseus's wife.\n4. **The Golem and the Jinni** by Helene Wecker: A historical fantasy novel that draws inspiration from Middle Eastern and Jewish mythology, set in early 20th-century New York City.\n5. **The City of Brass** by S.A. Chakraborty: A fantasy novel set in 18th-century Cairo, drawing inspiration from Middle Eastern mythology and folklore.\n6. **The House of Shattered Wings** by Aliette de Bodard: A dark fantasy novel set in a post-apocalyptic Paris, inspired by Vietnamese and French mythology.\n7. **The Library of the Unwritten** by A.J. Hackwith: A fantasy novel that explores the concept of unfinished stories and forgotten myths, set in a mystical library.\n\nAs for your question about reading time, it depends on several factors, including your reading speed, commute time, and personal reading habits. However, here's a rough estimate:\n\nAssuming you read during your daily commute, which is approximately 30-60 minutes per day, and you read at an average speed of 2-3 pages per 10 minutes, you can estimate the following:\n\n* 30-minute commute: 6-9 pages per day (approx. 15-20 days to finish a 440-page book)\n* 60-minute commute: 12-18 pages per day (approx. 25-30 days to finish a 440-page book)\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and your actual reading time may vary. Additionally, if you're reading a dense or complex book like \"The Poppy War\", you might need more time to absorb the material.\n\nFeel free to adjust these estimates based on your personal reading habits and pace. Happy reading!",
