  "content": "I hiked at Oakwood State Park, which is about 30 minutes from my city. The terrain was mostly hilly with some steep inclines, and the trail was wooded with some scenic overlooks. I'd say the difficulty level was moderate to challenging. I'm open to exploring other types of trails, and I'd love to find a trail with scenic views, especially if it has a summit or a lake view.",
