  "content": "Tea-to-water ratios can greatly impact the flavor and character of your brew. For White Peony Tea, I recommend the following ratios:\n\n* Traditional Chinese method: 1 teaspoon of loose-leaf tea per 8 oz (237ml) of water\n* Western-style brewing: 1 teaspoon of loose-leaf tea per 6 oz (177ml) of water\n\nYou can adjust these ratios to your taste preferences, but this should give you a good starting point. Keep in mind that White Peony Tea is a delicate and subtle tea, so it's better to err on the side of caution and start with a lighter ratio.\n\nRegarding sweeteners, White Peony Tea is a great choice for those reducing sugar intake! This tea is known for its natural sweetness and subtle flavor profile, making it an excellent option for enjoying without added sweeteners. The floral and fruity notes will shine through without any masking or overpowering flavors.\n\nThat being said, if you prefer a hint of sweetness, you can try adding a small amount of natural sweetener like honey or stevia. However, I'd recommend trying the tea without sweetener first to appreciate its natural flavor profile.\n\nSome tips to enhance the flavor without adding sweeteners:\n\n* Use filtered water to reduce impurities and minerals that might affect the taste.\n* Experiment with brewing temperatures between 160\u00b0F to 170\u00b0F to find the optimal balance of flavor and aroma.\n* Try brewing the tea for a shorter time (around 2 minutes) to bring out the delicate flavors and avoid bitterness.\n* Store your White Peony Tea in an airtight container to preserve its flavor and aroma.\n\nEnjoy your White Peony Tea journey, and I hope you find the perfect balance of flavor and sweetness for your taste buds!",
