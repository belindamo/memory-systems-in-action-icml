It provides temporary medical coverage for a limited period, usually up to 8 months, to help you receive necessary medical care.\n\n**What kind of medical coverage does RMA provide?**\n\nRMA covers essential health benefits, including:\n\n1. **Outpatient services**: Doctor visits, clinic services, and mental health care.\n2. **Inpatient services**: Hospital stays, surgeries, and emergency room care.\n3. **Prescription medications**: Most medications, including those for chronic conditions.\n4. **Laboratory and diagnostic services**: Blood tests, X-rays, and other diagnostic tests.\n5. **Maternity care**: Prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care.\n\nRMA does not cover elective procedures, cosmetic services, or services not deemed medically necessary.\n\n**How do I apply for RMA?**\n\nTo apply for RMA, you'll need to:\n\n1. **Contact your local refugee resettlement agency**: Reach out to the agency that helped you with your asylum application or resettlement process. They can guide you through the RMA application process.\n2. **Gather required documents**: You'll need to provide proof of your asylum approval, identification, and income information.\n3. **Complete the RMA application**: Your local agency will help you complete the application, which typically includes a medical screening and a review of your income and family size.\n4. **Wait for approval**: Once your application is submitted, you'll receive a decision on your eligibility within a few weeks.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n* RMA is a temporary program, and coverage typically lasts up to 8 months.\n* You may be eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs after the RMA period ends.\n* RMA is not a substitute for long-term health insurance. You should explore other health insurance options, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace or employer-sponsored plans, once you're eligible.\n\n**Additional resources:**\n\n* The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) website: [www.acf.hhs.gov/orr](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr)\n* Your local refugee resettlement agency or social services department\n* Your state's Medicaid office or health department\n\nRemember to ask questions and seek guidance from your local agency or social services department if you need help with the RMA application process.",
