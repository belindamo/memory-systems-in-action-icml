  "content": "If some animals do not have a defined minimum or maximum threshold, you can modify the formula as follows:\n\nFor each animal i:\n\n* Calculate the proportional hunger level as H\\_i / (H\\_1 + H\\_2 + H\\_3 + H\\_4 + H\\_5)\n* If both minimum and maximum exist for animal i, allocate the proportional amount of food as F \\* proportional hunger level, clamped between the minimum and maximum values\n* If only the minimum exists for animal i, allocate the maximum of the proportional amount of food and L\\_i, clamped at the maximum value if it exists\n* If only the maximum exists for animal i, allocate the minimum of the proportional amount of food and M\\_i, clamped at the minimum value if it exists\n* If neither minimum nor maximum exists for animal i, allocate the proportional amount of food as F \\* proportional hunger level\n\nThis modified formula respects the existing thresholds for each animal while still trying to satisfy its hunger level as best as possible. If both minimum and maximum exist for an animal, the proportional allocation is clamped between the two values. If only the minimum or maximum exists, the allocation is clamped at that value if it is defined, and otherwise the animal receives the maximum or minimum possible allocation. If neither minimum nor maximum exists, the animal receives a proportional allocation based only on its hunger level.",
