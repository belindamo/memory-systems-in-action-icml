They'll be happy to provide guidance and modifications throughout the class.\n\nRemember, it's essential to listen to your body and take breaks when needed, especially in a hot yoga class. Stay hydrated, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance from the instructor.\n\nHave fun exploring these studios, and I hope you find a hot yoga class that resonates with you!",
