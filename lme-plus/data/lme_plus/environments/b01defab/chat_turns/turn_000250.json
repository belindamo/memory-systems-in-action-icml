Flexibility and mobility work can make a huge difference in your overall performance and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nAnkle mobility is crucial for both running and swimming, so it's great that you're focusing on that area. Here are some exercises and stretches that can help:\n\n**Ankle Mobility Exercises:**\n\n1. Ankle circles: Rotate your ankles in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions, 5-10 reps each.\n2. Toe raises: Stand on the edge of a stair or curb with your heels hanging off, and raise up onto your toes, then lower back down. 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n3. Calf raises with ankle rotations: Stand on a flat surface, raise up onto your toes, and then rotate your ankles in both directions. 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. Single-leg balance: Stand on one leg, keeping the other foot lifted off the ground. Hold for 30-60 seconds, then switch legs. 3 sets each leg.\n\n**Stretches:**\n\n1. Calf stretch: Stand facing a wall with one hand on the wall for balance. Step one foot back about a foot, keeping your heel on the ground. Bend the front knee and lean forward, stretching your calf. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs.\n2. Ankle mobilization stretch: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Loop a towel around the ball of one foot, and gently pull your toes back towards your shin. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then release. Repeat 3-5 times, then switch legs.\n3. Achilles tendon stretch: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Step forward with one foot, keeping your heel on the ground. Bend your front knee and lean forward, stretching your Achilles tendon. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. Incorporate dynamic stretching into your warm-up routine, such as leg swings, high knees, and ankle rotations.\n2. Use a foam roller or roller massager to roll out your calves and ankles after your workouts.\n3. Consider incorporating exercises that strengthen your core and glutes, as weak hips and glutes can contribute to ankle instability.\n\nRemember to start slow and gentle, especially if you're new to ankle mobility exercises. Increase the intensity and duration as you become more comfortable with the movements.\n\nHow do these exercises and stretches sound? Do you have any questions about how to perform them or how to incorporate them into your routine?",
