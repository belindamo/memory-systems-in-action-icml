And if you find something you like, you can always check if it's available in-store or order it online and try it on at home.\n\nAnd yay for scoring that yellow sundress at H&M's sale! $15 is an amazing price for a dress, and it sounds like you got a fantastic deal. I'm sure you'll look lovely in it at the wedding. Yellow is such a happy, sunny color, and it's perfect for a summer wedding.\n\nRemember to have fun and enjoy the wedding, and don't stress too much about finding the perfect heels. You've got a great dress, and with a pair of neutral heels, you'll be sure to turn heads. Good luck with your shoe hunt, and I hope you find the perfect pair to complete your outfit!",
