You can typically update the information on your existing credit cards, but the process may vary depending on the credit card issuer. Here's a general outline to help you update your credit cards:\n\n**Update existing credit cards:**\n\n1. **Contact your credit card issuer:** Reach out to your credit card issuer's customer service department via phone, email, or online chat. Let them know you need to update your name on your account.\n2. **Provide required documents:** You'll likely need to provide documentation to support your name change, such as:\n\t* A certified copy of your name change document (e.g., court order, marriage certificate, or divorce decree)\n\t* A government-issued ID with your new name (e.g., driver's license, state ID, or passport)\n3. **Verify your identity:** The credit card issuer may require you to verify your identity through various methods, such as:\n\t* Answering security questions\n\t* Providing additional identification documents\n\t* Verifying your identity through a third-party service\n4. **Update your account:** Once your identity is verified, the credit card issuer will update your account with your new name.\n\n**New credit card issuance:**\n\nIn some cases, you might need to apply for a new credit card with your new name. This might happen if:\n\n1. **Card design or material changes:** If the credit card issuer has changed the card design or material, they might issue a new card with your new name.\n2. **Card expiration:** If your current card is near expiration, the issuer might issue a new card with your new name.\n3. **Account changes:** If you've made significant changes to your account, such as changing the account type or adding a new authorized user, a new card might be issued.\n\n**Tips and considerations:**\n\n* **Credit score:** Updating your credit card information with your new name shouldn't affect your credit score. However, applying for a new credit card might result in a hard inquiry, which can temporarily lower your score.\n* **Credit limit and benefits:** Your credit limit and benefits should remain the same, but it's essential to review your account terms and conditions to ensure everything is accurate.\n* **Automatic payments:** Don't forget to update any automatic payments, such as recurring subscriptions or bill pay, with your new credit card information.\n* **Keep records:** Keep a record of your updated credit card information, including the new card number, expiration date, and security code.\n\nBefore updating your credit cards, it's a good idea to review your credit report to ensure all information is accurate and up-to-date. You can request a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) once a year from AnnualCreditReport.com.\n\nRemember to contact your credit card issuer directly for specific guidance on updating your credit cards with your new name. They'll be able to provide you with more detailed instructions and information on their process.",
