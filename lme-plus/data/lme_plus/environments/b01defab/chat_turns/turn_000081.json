  "content": "A medium-dark roast is a great choice for a balanced flavor with a hint of acidity. It's a versatile roast level that can work well with various brewing methods.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring other brewing methods, pour-over and French press are excellent choices to consider. Both methods can bring out unique characteristics in your coffee beans and offer a more nuanced flavor experience.\n\nFor pour-over, you'll need a pour-over dripper, a coffee filter, and a kettle. It's a manual brewing method that requires you to slowly pour hot water over the grounds, which allows for a high degree of control over the brewing process. Pour-over is great for bringing out the bright, acidic notes in your coffee.\n\nFrench press, on the other hand, involves steeping coarse coffee grounds in hot water and then pressing the grounds to the bottom of the container to separate the liquid. It's a more immersive brewing method that can bring out the richer, more full-bodied flavors in your coffee.\n\nIf you're new to these methods, I'd recommend starting with a pour-over. It's a bit more forgiving, and the equipment is relatively affordable. You can find plenty of online resources and tutorials to help you get started.\n\nRegarding your coffee shop experience, it's great that you're trying out new flavors and spots! Cold brew is a fantastic way to enjoy coffee, especially during warmer months. It's interesting that you still prefer your usual spot downtown \u2013 there's something to be said for consistency and familiarity, especially when it comes to our daily coffee routines.\n\nDo you think you'll continue to experiment with different coffee brewing methods, or are you happy to stick with your drip coffee maker for now?",
