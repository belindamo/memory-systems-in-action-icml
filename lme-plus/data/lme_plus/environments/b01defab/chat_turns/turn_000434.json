  "content": "Excellent idea to check out other shoe websites like Zappos or DSW! They often have a wide selection of shoes and frequent sales, so you might find some great deals on neutral heels.\n\nAs for your question, it's a great debate: trendy vs. classic. Here are some pros and cons of each option to consider:\n\n**Trendy heels:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Can add a fun, fashion-forward touch to your outfit\n* Might be more affordable since they're trendy and widely available\n* Can be a great way to update your shoe game and stay on top of current styles\n\nCons:\n\n* Might go out of style quickly, making them less wearable in the long run\n* Can be less versatile and harder to pair with other outfits\n* Quality might not be as high since they're designed to be trendy rather than timeless\n\n**Classic heels:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Timeless design that won't go out of style quickly\n* Can be paired with many different outfits and occasions\n* Often made with higher-quality materials and construction, making them more durable\n\nCons:\n\n* Might be more expensive since they're investment pieces\n* Can be less exciting or fashion-forward if you're looking for a trendy look\n* Might not be as versatile if you're looking for a specific style or trend\n\nUltimately, it depends on your personal style, budget, and preferences. If you want a pair of heels that will last for years to come and can be paired with many different outfits, a classic style might be the way to go. However, if you're looking for a fun, trendy option to add some excitement to your outfit, a trendy pair might be the better choice.\n\nIn your case, since you're looking for a pair of neutral heels to pair with a yellow sundress, a classic style might be a safer bet. A pair of classic neutral heels can complement your dress without drawing attention away from it, and they'll likely be more versatile for future outfits.",
