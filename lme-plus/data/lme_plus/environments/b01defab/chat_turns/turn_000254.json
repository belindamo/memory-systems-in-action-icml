  "content": "That's a great plan! Consistency is key when it comes to improving ankle mobility and strength. Doing the exercises 2-3 times a week will help you make progress and see improvements over time.\n\nIt's excellent that you're setting specific goals for yourself, too. Being able to do more intense ankle exercises without discomfort or pain is a great target to work towards. Remember to be patient and gentle with yourself, especially if you're just starting out.\n\nTo help you track your progress, you might want to consider keeping a log or journal of your exercises. Write down the exercises you do, the number of reps and sets, and any notes about how you feel. This can help you identify areas where you need to focus more attention and track your progress over time.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider incorporating some exercises that target your core and glutes, as strong hips and core muscles can help stabilize your ankles and improve your overall balance and stability.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and take rest days as needed. It's better to err on the side of caution and recover properly than to push through pain or discomfort and risk injury.\n\nHow do you plan to incorporate the ankle circles and calf raises into your existing workout routine? Will you do them as a warm-up or cool-down, or as a standalone exercise session?",
