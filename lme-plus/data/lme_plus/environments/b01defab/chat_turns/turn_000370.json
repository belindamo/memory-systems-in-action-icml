The cost-sharing amounts vary by state and service provider, but they're generally minimal.\n\nHere are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Copayments:** You might pay a small copayment (e.g., $5-$10) for:\n\t* Doctor visits\n\t* Prescription medications\n\t* Lab tests and X-rays\n2. **Coinsurance:** You might pay a percentage of the total cost (e.g., 10%-20%) for:\n\t* Hospital stays\n\t* Surgical procedures\n\t* Durable medical equipment\n\nHowever, these cost-sharing amounts are typically capped at a certain amount per year, and you won't be responsible for paying more than that.\n\n**Services with no cost-sharing:**\n\nSome services are exempt from cost-sharing, including:\n\n1. **Preventive care:** Routine check-ups, vaccinations, and screenings are usually covered without copayments or coinsurance.\n2. **Pregnancy-related care:** Prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care are typically covered without cost-sharing.\n3. **Emergency services:** Emergency room visits and urgent care services are usually covered without copayments or coinsurance.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n* RMA is a temporary program, and you may need to transition to another health insurance plan or program after the 8-month period.\n* Some states may have different cost-sharing structures or exemptions, so it's essential to check with your local refugee resettlement agency or social services department for specific information.\n* If you're unable to pay the copayment or coinsurance, you may be eligible for a waiver or reduction. Your local agency can help you explore these options.\n\nRemember, RMA is designed to provide temporary medical coverage, and it's essential to explore other health insurance options once you're eligible to ensure continuous coverage.",
