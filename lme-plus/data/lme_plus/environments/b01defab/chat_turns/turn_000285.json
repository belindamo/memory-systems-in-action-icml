I'd be happy to help you find a good one.\n\nBefore I make some recommendations, can you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for in a portable charger? Here are a few questions to consider:\n\n1. How much power do you need? Are you looking for a small charger that can give your phone a quick boost, or do you need something that can fully charge your phone multiple times?\n2. How portable do you need it to be? Are you looking for something super compact and lightweight, or are you okay with a slightly larger charger if it means more power?\n3. Do you have any specific features in mind, like USB-C, wireless charging, or a built-in cable?\n4. What's your budget for the charger?\n\nAs for your new phone case, that sounds like a great deal!
