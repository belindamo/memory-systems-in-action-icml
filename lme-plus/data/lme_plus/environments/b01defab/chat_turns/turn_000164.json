  "content": "If the total food is not sufficient to satisfy the total hunger level of all animals, you can modify the formula as follows to guarantee a pro-rata and fair allocation subject to the same criteria as before:\n\n1. Calculate the total hunger level of all animals: total\\_hunger = H\\_1 + H\\_2 + H\\_3 + H\\_4 + H\\_5\n2. If total\\_hunger is less than or equal to F, allocate food to each animal as described in the previous answer (clamped between minimum and maximum thresholds if they exist)\n3. If total\\_hunger is greater than F, allocate food to each animal as follows:\n\t* For each animal i, calculate its proportional share of the available food as: F\\_i = F \\* (H\\_i / total\\_hunger)\n\t* For each animal i, allocate the proportional amount of food as follows:\n\t\t+ If both minimum and maximum exist for animal i, allocate F\\_i, clamped between L\\_i and M\\_i\n\t\t+ If only the minimum exists for animal i, allocate the maximum of F\\_i and L\\_i, clamped at the maximum value if it exists\n\t\t+ If only the maximum exists for animal i, allocate the minimum of F\\_i and M\\_i, clamped at the minimum value if it exists\n\t\t+ If neither minimum nor maximum exists for animal i, allocate F\\_i\n\nThis modified formula ensures that each animal receives a fair share of the available food according to its proportional hunger level, while respecting the minimum and maximum amounts if they exist. If the total available food is not enough to satisfy the total hunger level of all animals, each animal will receive a proportionally smaller amount of food while still respecting the minimum and maximum levels if they exist.",
