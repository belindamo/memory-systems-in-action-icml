  "content": "Yes, the formula to allocate the food to each animal in a fair manner, satisfying the criteria is:\n\nFor each animal i:\n\n* Calculate the proportional hunger level as H\\_i / (H\\_1 + H\\_2 + H\\_3 + H\\_4 + H\\_5)\n* Allocate the proportional amount of food as F \\* proportional hunger level\n* If the allocated amount is less than the minimum, allocate the minimum amount L\\_i instead\n* If the allocated amount is greater than the maximum, allocate the maximum amount M\\_i instead\n\nThis formula ensures that each animal receives a fair share of the available food according to its hunger level, while respecting the minimum and maximum amounts. If the total available food is not enough to satisfy the total hunger level of all animals, each animal will receive a proportionally smaller amount of food while still respecting the minimum and maximum levels.",
