So you're looking for a portable charger with a decent capacity to fully charge your phone multiple times, but still want it to be compact and lightweight.\n\nHere are some recommendations for you:\n\n1. **Anker PowerCore 20000**: This is a popular and highly-rated portable charger with a capacity of 20,000mAh. It's compact and lightweight, weighing only 12.5 oz (355g), and can charge your phone 4-6 times on a single charge. It has two USB ports, so you can charge two devices at once. ($45)\n2. **Mophie Powerstation XXL**: This charger has a capacity of 20,800mAh and can charge your phone 5-7 times. It's a bit larger than the Anker, but still compact and lightweight (14.4 oz / 408g). It has two USB ports and a sleek design. ($60)\n3. **Jackery Titan 20000**: This charger has a whopping capacity of 20,800mAh and can charge your phone 5-7 times. It's a bit larger than the other two, but still relatively compact (15.2 oz / 430g). It has two USB ports and a built-in LED flashlight. ($50)\n4. **Aukey Power Bank 26800**: This charger has a massive capacity of 26,800mAh and can charge your phone 7-10 times! It's a bit larger and heavier (18.3 oz / 520g), but it's still portable and has three USB ports. ($40)\n\nAll of these options are high-quality and reliable, but the Anker PowerCore 20000 is a great balance of capacity and portability.\n\nBefore you make a final decision, consider the following:\n\n* Check the charger's compatibility with your phone's charging speed. Some chargers support fast charging, while others may not.\n* Look for reviews and ratings to ensure the charger is reliable and durable.\n* Consider any additional features you might need, like a built-in cable or solar charging.\n\nWhich one of these options sounds most appealing to you?",
