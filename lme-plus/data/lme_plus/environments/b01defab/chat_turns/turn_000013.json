Here are some examples of provocative questions from the Spark Selling methodology:\n\n1. \"What's the real problem you're trying to solve?\"\n2. \"What's the real opportunity you're trying to capitalize on?\"\n3. \"What's the real risk you're trying to mitigate?\"\n4. \"What's the real value you're trying to capture?\"\n5. \"What's the real change you're trying to make?\"\n6. \"What's the real outcome you're trying to achieve?\"\n7. \"What's the real impact you're trying to have?\"\n8. \"What's the real story behind your decision?\"\n9. \"What's the real reason you're considering this solution?\"\n10. \"What's the real reason you're thinking about making a change?\"\n\nProvocative questions like these are intended to push the prospect beyond surface-level responses and get to the heart of their true needs, pain points, and objectives. This allows the salesperson to better understand the customer's perspective, and tailor their approach accordingly.",
