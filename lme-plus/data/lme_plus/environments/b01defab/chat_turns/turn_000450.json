  "content": "Adding live plants to your community tank can be a great way to control algae, and there are several species that are well-suited for a tank with neon tetras and guppies. Here are some popular, algae-controlling plants that can thrive in a community tank like yours:\n\n1. **Java Moss**: A popular choice for community tanks, Java Moss is a low-maintenance, carpeting plant that can outcompete algae for nutrients. It's easy to care for and can be attached to rocks or driftwood.\n2. **Anacharis**: A fast-growing plant that can absorb excess nutrients, Anacharis is a great choice for controlling algae. It's also a good food source for your fish, and can be used as a snack or added to their diet.\n3. **Cabomba**: Cabomba is a stem plant that can help control algae by absorbing excess nutrients. It's relatively easy to care for and can be trimmed to maintain a desired length.\n4. **Water Wisteria**: A versatile, fast-growing plant that can be trained to grow on a trellis or left to trail. Water Wisteria is great for controlling algae and can be pruned to maintain a desired shape.\n5. **Hornwort**: A low-maintenance, mid-water plant that can help control algae by absorbing excess nutrients. Hornwort is also a good choice for a community tank, as it's not a favorite snack for most fish.\n6. **Dwarf Hairgrass**: A carpeting plant that can help control algae by absorbing excess nutrients and providing shade. Dwarf Hairgrass is a great choice for a community tank, as it's relatively low-maintenance and can be used to create a natural-looking substrate.\n\nWhen introducing plants to your tank, make sure to:\n\n* Choose plants that are compatible with your tank's water parameters and lighting conditions.\n* Plant them in a way that allows for good water circulation and doesn't create hiding places for algae.\n* Monitor your plants' health and adjust your care routine as needed.\n* Be patient, as it may take some time for the plants to establish themselves and start controlling algae.\n\nRemember, live plants can be a great addition to your community tank, but they should be used in conjunction with regular water changes, proper water parameters, and good tank maintenance to effectively control algae.",
