The flowy design of the top will add a romantic touch to your overall look, while the distressed jeans will keep the outfit grounded and casual.\n\nHere are a few styling suggestions to consider:\n\n* Roll up the hem of the jeans to show off your shoes and add a relaxed vibe to the outfit. You could opt for sandals, sneakers, or even ankle boots, depending on the weather and your personal style.\n* Add a statement belt to define your waist and break up the flowy top. A wide leather belt or a woven belt with a natural fiber like wicker or rattan would work well.\n* Keep jewelry simple and understated. A delicate necklace or a pair of stud earrings will add a touch of elegance without overpowering the outfit.\n* If you want to add a pop of color, throw on a lightweight denim jacket or a cardigan in a pastel shade. This will not only add a layering element but also tie in the casual, weekend vibe.\n\nAs for the black graphic tee, you could save it for a different outfit or wear it on its own with the distressed jeans for a more laid-back, street-style look. You could also pair it with a flowy skirt or shorts for a fun, summery vibe.\n\nRemember, the key to a great casual outfit is to look polished without trying too hard. Keep the accessories simple, and don't be afraid to add your own personal touches to make the outfit feel like you!\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Do you have any other questions or would you like more ideas?",
