  "content": "That's great to hear! Yoga can be a fantastic addition to your fitness routine, especially for improving flexibility, balance, and overall body awareness. It's awesome that you've noticed improvements in your flexibility and balance since starting yoga classes in July.\n\nAnkle circles and calf raises are a great starting point for ankle mobility and strength. Remember to start slow and gentle, and gradually increase the intensity and duration as you become more comfortable with the movements.\n\nIt's also excellent that you're being proactive about addressing your ankle issues. Strengthening and mobilizing your ankles can help prevent injuries and improve your overall performance in both running and swimming.\n\nSince you're already doing yoga, you might find that it complements your ankle mobility exercises nicely. Yoga can help improve your overall flexibility, balance, and body awareness, which can in turn enhance your ankle mobility and strength.\n\nAs you continue with your yoga practice, you might find that you're able to incorporate some yoga poses that target your ankles and calves, such as:\n\n* Downward-Facing Dog (stretches calves and ankles)\n* Warrior II (strengthens ankles and calves)\n* Tree Pose (improves balance and ankle stability)\n* Seated Forward Fold (stretches calves and ankles)\n\nRemember to listen to your body and modify or avoid any poses that cause discomfort or pain in your ankles.\n\nHow often do you plan to do the ankle circles and calf raises, and do you have any specific goals in mind for your ankle mobility and strength?",
