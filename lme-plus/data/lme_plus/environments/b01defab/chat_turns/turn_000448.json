Preventing algae growth in a 20-gallon freshwater tank requires a combination of good tank maintenance, proper water parameters, and a few simple adjustments. Here are some tips to help you keep algae at bay:\n\n1. **Regular Water Changes**: Perform partial water changes (25-50% every 1-2 weeks) to remove excess nutrients and prevent the buildup of algae-promoting substances.\n2. **Maintain Good Water Quality**: Monitor and adjust water parameters such as:\n\t* pH (6.5-8.5)\n\t* Ammonia (0)\n\t* Nitrite (0)\n\t* Nitrate (<20 ppm)\n\t* Phosphate (<1 ppm)\n3. **Provide Adequate Filtration**: Ensure your filter is suitable for your tank size and type. Clean or replace filter media as recommended by the manufacturer.\n4. **Control Excess Nutrients**: Limit the amount of food and avoid overfeeding. Remove any uneaten food within a few minutes of feeding. Consider using a high-quality, nutrient-controlled fish food.\n5. **Increase Water Circulation**: Improve water flow and oxygenation by:\n\t* Adding powerheads or adjusting filter outlets\n\t* Rearranging decorations to create more water movement\n6. **Reduce Light**: Algae thrive in bright lighting. Consider:\n\t* Reducing the duration or intensity of your lighting period\n\t* Using a timer to simulate a natural day-night cycle\n\t* Switching to lower-wattage or specialized \"low-light\" aquarium lighting\n7. **Introduce Algae-Controlling Species**: Add plants or algae-eating fish, such as:\n\t* Live plants like Anacharis, Cabomba, or Java Moss\n\t* Algae-eating fish like Amano shrimp, Otocinclus, or Plecos\n8. **Clean the Tank Regularly**: Regularly clean the tank walls, decorations, and substrate to remove algae buildup and prevent it from spreading.\n9. **Monitor Temperature**: Keep your tank temperature stable and within the recommended range for your fish (usually between 72\u00b0F and 82\u00b0F).\n10. **Avoid Overcrowding**: Ensure your tank is not overcrowded, as this can lead to increased waste and algae growth.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to prevent algae from coming back. Remember to stay vigilant and make adjustments as needed to maintain a healthy and thriving aquarium.",
