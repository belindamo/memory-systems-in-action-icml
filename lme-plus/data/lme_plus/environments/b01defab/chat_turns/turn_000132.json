  "content": "Page 77: Common Math Symbols\n\nMathematics uses a variety of symbols to represent different operations, relationships, and concepts. Here are some of the most common symbols used in math:\n\n1. * (plus sign) \u2013 indicates addition\n2. \u2013 (minus sign) \u2013 indicates subtraction\n3. \u00d7 (multiplication sign) \u2013 indicates multiplication\n4. \u00f7 (division sign) \u2013 indicates division\n5. = (equals sign) \u2013 indicates equality\n6. \u2260 (not equal sign) \u2013 indicates inequality\n7. < (less than sign) \u2013 indicates that one quantity is less than another\n8. > (greater than sign) \u2013 indicates that one quantity is greater than another\n> \n>\n9. \u2264 (less than or equal to sign) \u2013 indicates that one quantity is less than or equal to another\n10. \u2265 (greater than or equal to sign) \u2013 indicates that one quantity is greater than or equal to another\n11. \u2211 (summation symbol) \u2013 indicates the sum of a sequence of numbers or variables\n12. \u222b (integral symbol) \u2013 indicates integration or finding the area under a curve\n13. \u221a (square root symbol) \u2013 indicates finding the square root of a number\n14. \u03c0 (pi symbol) \u2013 represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159\n15. \u03b8 (theta symbol) \u2013 commonly used to represent an angle in geometry\n16. \u22a5 (perpendicular symbol) \u2013 used to indicate that two lines or segments are perpendicular to each other\n\nThese symbols are just a few of the many used in mathematics. Understanding these symbols is essential to communicating mathematical ideas effectively, and will be useful throughout your studies in math.",
