  "content": "Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum) is an excellent choice for your tank! It's a low-maintenance, versatile, and effective plant for controlling algae. Here's why:\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. **Algae control**: Hornwort is a great algae-fighter, as it absorbs excess nutrients and outcompetes algae for resources.\n2. **Low maintenance**: Hornwort is easy to care for and can thrive in a wide range of water conditions.\n3. **Hardy**: It's a hardy plant that can tolerate minor water parameter fluctuations and doesn't require frequent pruning.\n4. **Mid-water dweller**: Hornwort grows in the mid-water column, providing a natural, layered look to your tank.\n\n**Care requirements:**\n\n1. **Lighting**: Hornwort can thrive in low to moderate lighting conditions, making it suitable for your tank.\n2. **Water parameters**: It can tolerate a wide range of water parameters, but prefers:\n\t* pH: 6.5-8.5\n\t* Temperature: 65\u00b0F-85\u00b0F (18\u00b0C-29\u00b0C)\n\t* Water hardness: Soft to moderately hard\n3. **Substrate**: Hornwort doesn't require a specific substrate, but it does benefit from a nutrient-rich substrate or fertilization.\n4. **CO2**: Hornwort doesn't require CO2 supplementation, but it can benefit from it.\n\n**Tips for success:**\n\n1. **Planting**: Simply place the Hornwort stems in the substrate, and they'll anchor themselves.\n2. **Pruning**: You can trim the stems to encourage bushy growth or remove any dead or dying leaves.\n3. **Propagation**: Hornwort can be easily propagated by cutting the stems and replanting them.\n\n**Compatibility:**\n\nHornwort is a great choice for your tank, as it's not a favorite snack for most fish, including neon tetras and guppies. However, keep an eye on your fish to ensure they're not nipping at the plant's leaves.\n\nBy adding Hornwort to your tank, you'll not only get a low-maintenance, algae-controlling plant, but also a natural, attractive addition to your aquarium.",
