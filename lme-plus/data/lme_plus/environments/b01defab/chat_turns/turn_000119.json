  "content": "Computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools are software programs designed to help translators improve productivity and consistency in their work. Here's how they typically work:\n\n1. Segmentation: CAT tools break down the source text into smaller, more manageable segments such as sentences or paragraphs.\n2. Translation memory: As the translator works on each segment, the CAT tool stores the source text and the corresponding translation in a database called the translation memory. When the translator encounters a similar segment in the future, the tool suggests the stored translation, saving time and improving consistency.\n3. Termbase: A termbase is a database of specialized terminology related to the subject matter being translated. CAT tools can use this database to suggest the most appropriate translation for technical or industry-specific terms.\n4. Alignment: CAT tools can also align previously translated documents with the corresponding source documents to create a translation memory. This allows the translator to reuse previous translations for similar content in the future.\n5. Glossary: A glossary is a list of terms and their definitions, which can be imported into the CAT tool to ensure consistency in the translation of specific terms.\n6. Quality control: CAT tools typically include quality control features, such as spell-checking, grammar-checking, and consistency checking, to help ensure the accuracy and consistency of the final translation.\n\nIn summary, CAT tools use a combination of translation memory, termbase, alignment, and quality control features to help translators work more efficiently and consistently, reducing errors and improving the quality of the final translation.",
