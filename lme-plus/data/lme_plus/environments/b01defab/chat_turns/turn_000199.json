  "content": "ForgeFX is a company that describes itself as : \"ForgeFX Training Simulations is a custom training simulation software development company. ForgeFX creates AR/VR simulation-based training. Founded in 2002, ForgeFX develops high-quality custom interactive 3D simulation and visualization software products for clients across a wide array of industries. Leveraging high-fidelity 3D graphics and modern game engine development tools, ForgeFX provides virtual and augmented reality application development services for clients who are looking to distribute interactive simulation-based training solutions, as well as machine learning development services applicable to a variety of different business processes. Our training products, employed by industries including national defense, healthcare, pharmaceutical, insurance, mining, construction, and transportation, produce measurable improvements in trainee engagement and knowledge retention.\"\n\nAs an owner of ForgeFX please help me write a response to this request for proposal: \"23-NH2: Immersive Virtual Reality Training on Impaired Driving for Law Enforcement.\nNHTSA is interested in the development of new training tools that can support the agency\u2019s continuing \nefforts to provide law enforcement professionals the necessary training resources to identify and \nremove impaired drivers from our nations\u2019 roadways. Preliminary estimates show roadway deaths \nclimbing to 42,915 in 2021, a 16 year high. Every day, about 32 people in the United States die in \ndrunk-driving 9 crashes \u2014 that's one person every 45 minutes. In 2020, 11,654 people died in alcohol-\nimpaired driving traffic deaths \u2014 a 14% increase from 2019 (NHTSA Media, 2022). \nThe ability of law enforcement to identify impaired drivers is a critical component to reducing fatalities \ninvolving alcohol and/or drug impairment. Impaired driving is a human factor that must be addressed \nto overcome the vision zero challenge to eliminate all fatalities and serious injuries on our nations\u2019 \nroadways. This aligns with DOT\u2019s Strategic Goal of Safety. The effects of alcohol on an individual have \nbeen researched extensively and law enforcement are trained to identify signs and symptoms \nassociated with alcohol impairment through the basic Standardized Field Sobriety Testing curriculum, \noften included in the basic police academy/certification course. Law enforcement officials may later \nreceive advanced training in the identification of impairment through the 16-hour Advanced Roadside \nImpaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) curriculum provided through the Drug Evaluation and \nClassification Program (DECP). Due to the complexity that comes with drug use and impairment, ARIDE\nis designed to introduce law enforcement officers to the identification of signs and symptoms \nassociated with impairment from drugs other than (or in addition to) alcohol. The ARIDE curriculum \nalso identifies the practical use of a Drug Recognition Expert, post-arrest, in Driving Under the \nInfluence of Drugs (DUID) cases. \nThere is a need to make impaired driving training as realistic as practical so law enforcement can \nensure they are identifying and apprehending impaired drivers\u2019 roadside. There are limitations and \nlegitimate concerns (such as liability and harm) with dosing live individuals with impairing substances \nfor the purpose of curriculum development. This project aims to reduce unnecessary risks of harm to \nindividuals. Additionally, we aim to reduce monetary costs and time involved in dosing individuals for \nthe purpose of training. \nThis topic aims to develop a course structure and technological approach for the purposes of training \nlaw enforcement on the behaviors associated with impaired driving. To achieve this, it is expected that\nsubject matter expertise in the areas of drug-impaired driving enforcement will inform the training \napproach and material. Ideally, these subject matter experts (SMEs) should be drug recognition \nexperts (DRE); drug recognition expert instructors; or drug recognition expert state coordinators who \nare familiar with the content and application of the DECP. The proposal should explain when this \nexpertise will be introduced into the project and, when possible, by whom. \nExpected Phase I Outcomes \nExpected outcomes for the conclusion of Phase I are a \u201cProof of Concept\u201d Final Report which presents \na course design for the interactive training technology and describes the technological approach and \nsoftware and hardware requirements. The project should also produce a detailed plan for the \ndevelopment of the software files for a wide variety of virtual drivers (varying by age, gender, race, \nethnicity) that can be displayed as under the influence of various impairing drugs, combinations of \ndrugs, and control subjects. Finally, the project outcomes must include the identification of \nqualifications required (i.e., DRE Instructor) to proctor the use of the interactive training technology. A \nproctoring instructor should be well versed in the field of DUID and current DUID curricula used to train\nlaw enforcement nationwide. \nExpected Phase II Outcomes \nConditional on the outcomes of Phase I, Phase II will begin development of a market ready device for \nuse by law enforcement officers. This device will be tested using the development plan developed in \"",
