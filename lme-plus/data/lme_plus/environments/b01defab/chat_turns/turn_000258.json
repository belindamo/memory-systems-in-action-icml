  "content": "Yes, amphibians often need to breathe more frequently than mammals to get enough oxygen because of their less efficient circulatory system. Amphibians have a lower metabolism and lower oxygen requirements compared to mammals, but they still need to take in enough oxygen to fuel their body activities. To compensate for their lower oxygen delivery, amphibians have developed an effective gas exchange system through their skin, which allows them to breathe both through their lungs and their skin. \n\nThe skin of amphibians is relatively thin and very moist, which allows the exchange of gases, including oxygen and carbon dioxide, between the animal and its environment. They also have specialized blood vessels called cutaneous capillaries that run close to the surface of the skin, which increases the surface area available for gas exchange. The effectiveness of cutaneous gas exchange varies among different amphibian species, and their frequency of breathing is also affected by factors like body size, level of activity, and environmental conditions like temperature and humidity.",
