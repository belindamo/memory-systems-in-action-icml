I've been brewing with a drip coffee maker, but I've been curious about trying out other methods. I've heard great things about pour-over and French press, but I'm not sure where to start.\n\nBy the way, speaking of coffee, I met a friend at a coffee shop near her office last Thursday and we tried a new flavor of cold brew.
