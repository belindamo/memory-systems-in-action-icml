It's normal to feel a bit awkward introducing yourself with a new name, but you'll get used to it soon.\n\nNow, let's get to updating your travel documents.\n\nAfter a name change, it's essential to update your passport to reflect your new name. Here's what you need to do:\n\n1. **Apply for a passport name change**: You'll need to submit Form DS-82 (Application for a Passport by Mail) to the U.S. Department of State. You can download the form from the U.S. Department of State's website or pick one up from a regional passport agency.\n2. **Gather required documents**:\n\t* Your current valid passport\n\t* A certified copy of your marriage certificate (issued by the county clerk's office where you got married)\n\t* A photocopy of both sides of your valid government-issued photo ID (e.g., driver's license)\n\t* One recent, color photograph that meets the Department of State's requirements\n3. **Fill out the application**: Complete Form DS-82 and sign it in front of a notary public. Make sure to include your new name exactly as it appears on your marriage certificate.\n4. **Pay the fee**: The application fee for a passport book is currently $110, and the execution fee is $35. You can pay with a check or money order made out to the U.S. Department of State.\n5. **Mail the application**: Send the completed application, supporting documents, and payment to the address listed on the form.\n\nProcessing times can vary, but routine service typically takes 6-8 weeks. If you need a passport quickly, you can expedite the process for an additional fee, which takes 2-3 weeks.\n\n**Additional tips**:\n\n* Make sure your new passport is valid for at least six months beyond your planned departure date from Europe. Some countries require this as a condition of entry.\n* Update your airline, travel insurance, and any other travel-related documents with your new name.\n* Consider applying for a passport card, which can be used for land and sea travel to and from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda.\n\nNow, go ahead and practice introducing yourself with your new name \u2013 it'll get easier with time!"
