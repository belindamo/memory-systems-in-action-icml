Palm oil sustainability - The Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) has collaborated with international NGOs such as WWF and Rainforest Alliance to implement sustainability standards and certification for the palm oil industry in Malaysia. These efforts have promoted sustainable palm oil practices while also creating social and economic benefits for local communities.\n\n2.

One such collaboration is with Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) to install solar panels at airports across the country, reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.\n\n3. Circular economy - The Waste Management Association of Malaysia (WMAM) has worked with businesses to develop circular economy programs, including waste reduction and recycling initiatives. One example is the collaboration between WMAM and the Global Environment Centre (GEC) to launch a pilot project for organic waste recycling in the Klang Valley region.\n\n4.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future, but it's safe to say that collaborations among Malaysian businesses and with external partners for sustainability will likely continue to grow in the future. This is because there is increasing pressure from stakeholders, including consumers, regulators, and investors, for businesses to adopt sustainable practices.\n\nMoreover, collaboration is essential in addressing complex sustainability challenges that cannot be solved by individual businesses alone. By working together with partners, businesses can leverage one another's strengths, share innovations and knowledge, and pool resources to achieve common goals.\n\nFurthermore, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a global framework for sustainable development that encourages cross-sectoral collaboration. Many Malaysian businesses have already aligned their sustainability efforts with the SDGs, which will help to drive further collaboration and partnership building in the future.\n\nOverall, as the importance of sustainability continues to grow, businesses in Malaysia and elsewhere will increasingly recognize the value of collaboration in achieving their sustainability goals."
