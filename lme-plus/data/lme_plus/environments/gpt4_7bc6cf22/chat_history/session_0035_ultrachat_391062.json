The user may feel that a fair and balanced system is necessary to keep players interested and engaged, and that the current system is doing the opposite by frustrating and driving players away. The user seems to feel strongly that if the developers are unable or unwilling to make the necessary improvements, then they do not deserve to receive financial support from players."
