      "content": "What a great idea! Using oat milk instead of water is a fantastic way to give your cashew sour cream an even creamier texture. Oat milk is a popular dairy-free milk alternative that's naturally creamy and rich, making it an excellent choice for this recipe.\n\nWhen using oat milk, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n1. **Reduce the amount of oat milk**: Since oat milk is thicker and creamier than water, you may not need to use as much. Start with a smaller amount, such as 1/4 cup or even less, and adjust to achieve the desired consistency.\n2. **Blend longer**: Oat milk can make the mixture thicker, so you may need to blend the cashews for a longer time to break them down and achieve a smooth consistency.\n3. **Soaking time**: You can reduce the soaking time for the cashews to 2-3 hours, as the oat milk will help to break them down faster.\n4. **Flavor profile**: Oat milk has a slightly sweet and nutty flavor, which might affect the overall taste of your cashew sour cream. You can adjust the amount of lemon juice or vinegar to balance the flavor.\n\nBy using oat milk, you'll create a richer, more luxurious cashew sour cream that's perfect for topping your vegan wrap or as a dip for veggies. Enjoy!\n\nRemember, experimenting with different ingredients and ratios is all part of the fun in cooking. Don't be afraid to try new things and adjust to your taste. If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!"

Using pea milk as a base is a fantastic idea, and I'm happy to help you with some tips to make it delicious and creamy:\n\n**Tips for a Delicious and Creamy Tomato Soup using Pea Milk:**\n\n1. **Roast your tomatoes**: Roasting tomatoes brings out their natural sweetness and depth of flavor. Simply halve or quarter 2-3 pounds of tomatoes, toss with olive oil, salt, and your choice of herbs (like basil, oregano, or thyme), and roast at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 20-30 minutes.\n2. **Use a flavorful broth**: Use a high-quality vegetable broth or chicken broth as a base for your soup. You can also use a homemade broth made with roasted vegetables and herbs.\n3. **Saute aromatics**: Saute onions, garlic, and celery in a bit of olive oil until they're soft and fragrant. This will add depth and complexity to your soup.\n4. **Add pea milk gradually**: Start with a small amount of pea milk (about 1/2 cup) and add it to the soup gradually, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. You can always add more pea milk, but it's harder to remove excess milk.\n5. **Blend for creaminess**: Use an immersion blender or a regular blender to blend the soup until smooth and creamy. This will help emulsify the pea milk and create a velvety texture.\n6. **Add a roux for thickness**: If you prefer a thicker soup, make a roux by whisking together 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour. Cook for 1-2 minutes, then gradually add the pea milk, whisking constantly.\n7. **Season and adjust**: Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity, or a sprinkle of paprika for added depth.\n\n**Sample Recipe:**\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 pounds roasted tomatoes\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 onion, saut\u00e9ed\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 cups vegetable broth\n* 1/2 cup pea milk\n* 1 teaspoon dried basil\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Optional: roux (1 tablespoon olive oil + 1 tablespoon flour)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Saute the onion and garlic in olive oil until soft.\n2. Add the roasted tomatoes, vegetable broth, and basil. Bring to a simmer.\n3. Gradually add the pea milk, whisking constantly.\n4. Blend the soup until smooth and creamy.\n5. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar (if desired).\n6. Serve hot, garnished with a sprinkle of paprika or chopped fresh herbs.\n\nI hope these tips and the sample recipe help you create a delicious and creamy tomato soup using pea milk!"
