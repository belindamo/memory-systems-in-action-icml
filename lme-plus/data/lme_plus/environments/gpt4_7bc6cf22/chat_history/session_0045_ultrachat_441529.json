      "content": "As a language model AI, I don't have access to the latest information on language teaching policies in France. However, there have been some changes in recent years in the foreign languages taught in schools in France. For example, the teaching of Mandarin Chinese has become more popular in recent years, reflecting growing trade links between China and France. Additionally, there has been a push towards teaching English earlier in the curriculum, with some schools beginning to offer English classes to children as young as six or seven years old. Nonetheless, French and German remain important languages taught in French schools, especially as French is a national language and German is one of the most widely spoken languages in Europe."
