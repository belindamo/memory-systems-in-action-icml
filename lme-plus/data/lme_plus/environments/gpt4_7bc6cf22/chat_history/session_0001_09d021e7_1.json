This will help you determine if the issue is on their end or specific to your local network.\n\nWhile you're checking the ISP's status page, I'll provide some potential causes and troubleshooting steps to consider:\n\n1. **ISP Outage or Maintenance**: As you're checking, see if there are any reported outages or maintenance scheduled in your area. If there are, it might be the cause of your slow speeds.\n2. **Router Configuration**: Since you've recently upgraded your router, it's possible that some settings might need to be adjusted. Double-check that your router is configured correctly, and consider resetting it to its default settings.\n3. **Channel Congestion**: With the Archer AX50, you have a dual-band router, which means you have two frequency bands: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Check if you're experiencing congestion on a specific band. You can use tools like Wi-Fi Analyzer (for Android or iOS) to scan for nearby networks and identify the least congested channels.\n4. **Device Interference**: Other devices in your home or nearby can cause interference with your Wi-Fi signal. Check for devices that might be causing interference, such as cordless phones, microwaves, or neighbors' Wi-Fi networks.\n5. **Network Congestion**: With multiple devices connected, it's possible that your network is congested. Consider implementing Quality of Service (QoS) settings on your router to prioritize traffic for critical devices or applications.\n6. **Firmware Issues**: Ensure that your router's firmware is up to date. TP-Link regularly releases firmware updates, which can resolve performance issues.\n7. **Physical Obstructions**: Physical barriers like walls, furniture, or other obstacles can weaken your Wi-Fi signal. Try moving the router to a more central location or using Wi-Fi range extenders to improve coverage.\n\nOnce you've checked the ISP's status page and considered these potential causes, we can discuss further troubleshooting steps or potential solutions.\n\nLet me know what you find out about your ISP's status, and we'll proceed from there!"
