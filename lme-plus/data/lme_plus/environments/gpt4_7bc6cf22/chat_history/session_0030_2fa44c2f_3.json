I've recently started collecting them, particularly from the Victorian era, and I want to learn more about the different makers and styles. By the way, I've also been helping my parents declutter their attic, and we found a few antique pieces that had been stored away for decades. There was an old trunk from the 1800s, and we also found a set of antique silverware. Do you have any resources or tips on how to identify the makers of antique vases?"
