  "content": "Most concerts are designed with three sides of the audience, known as \"in-the-round\" or \"360-degree staging,\" because it allows for a more intimate and engaging experience for the audience. With the stage in the center of the arena, performers can interact with the audience on all sides, making each concert-goer feel like they have a front-row seat. It also allows for more people to attend the concert, as it increases the capacity of the venue and provides better sightlines for those in the back. Additionally, in-the-round staging can create a more dynamic and visually interesting show, as performers can move around the stage and engage with the audience from different angles.",
