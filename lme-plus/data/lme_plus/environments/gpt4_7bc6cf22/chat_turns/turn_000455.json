Many large financial institutions are investing heavily in AI to improve their operations, reduce costs, and enhance customer experiences. For example, Goldman Sachs has used AI to improve its trading algorithms, while American Express has used AI to detect fraud and personalize customer offerings. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are also using AI to improve various areas of their businesses, from customer service to credit risk management.
