The Garmin Dash Cam 66W is a great choice, and with its parking mode feature, you'll have added peace of mind when your car is parked.\n\nRemember to hardwire the camera to your car's electrical system to get the most out of the parking mode feature. This will ensure that the camera can record for an extended period while your car is parked.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your new dash cam and the added sense of security it provides!\n\nAnd, by the way, I'm glad to hear that you were able to renew your car's license plate online on February 20th and avoid any late fees. That's always a relief!",
