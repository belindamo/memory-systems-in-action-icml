  "content": "Gluten-free sourdough can be a fascinating and rewarding challenge! While traditional sourdough relies on gluten for structure and rise, gluten-free flours require a different approach. Here are some tips and resources to help you find suitable gluten-free flours for your sourdough adventures:\n\n1. **Understand the challenges:** Gluten-free flours often lack the elasticity and structure provided by gluten, which can result in a denser, heavier bread. You may need to adjust your recipe, technique, and expectations.\n2. **Blended flours:** Gluten-free flours often work best when blended together to create a balanced mix. Look for pre-mixed blends or create your own using a combination of flours.\n3. **Popular gluten-free flours:**\n\t* Almond flour: High in protein and fat, almond flour can add richness and structure.\n\t* Coconut flour: High in fiber and protein, coconut flour can help with texture and structure, but it absorbs more liquid than traditional flours.\n\t* Cassava flour: A neutral-tasting, gluten-free flour made from the root of the cassava plant.\n\t* Rice flour: A light, delicate flour that can add structure and texture.\n\t* Teff flour: An ancient, nutrient-rich flour from Ethiopia with a slightly sweet, nutty flavor.\n4. **Gluten-free sourdough starters:** You'll need a gluten-free starter or a starter adapted to gluten-free flours. You can create your own or purchase one from a reputable supplier.\n5. **Resources:**\n\t* **Gluten-Free Sourdough Academy:** A comprehensive online course and community dedicated to gluten-free sourdough bread-making.\n\t* **Gluten-Free on a Shoestring:** A website and blog with gluten-free recipes, including sourdough, and tips for working with gluten-free flours.\n\t* **King Arthur Gluten-Free:** King Arthur Flour offers a range of gluten-free flours and recipes, including sourdough options.\n\t* **Bob's Red Mill:** A well-known supplier of gluten-free flours, including almond flour, coconut flour, and more.\n\t* **Anthony's Goods:** A company specializing in gluten-free, organic flours, including cassava flour and teff flour.\n\nSome popular gluten-free sourdough recipes and resources include:\n\n* Gluten-Free Sourdough Bread by Gluten-Free on a Shoestring\n* Gluten-Free Sourdough Starter and Bread by King Arthur Flour\n* Cassava Flour Sourdough Bread by Anthony's Goods\n* Teff Sourdough Bread by The Full Helping\n\nRemember, gluten-free sourdough can be more challenging than traditional sourdough, and it may take some trial and error to find the right combination of flours and techniques.
