  "content": "Yeah, I usually grab a Slim Jim or pretzels on my way home from work. I'm not really sure about the calorie count, but I'm guessing it's around 200-300 calories per snack. I tend to snack more in the afternoon, around 3 pm. I don't have any dietary restrictions, but I'm trying to cut down on sugar. Can you suggest some healthier alternatives to my convenience store snacks?",
