  "content": "I understand your concern. The parking mode feature on the Garmin Dash Cam 66W is designed to be used intermittently, and the internal battery is intended to provide power for a limited period. If you don't hardwire the camera, you'll need to recharge the internal battery periodically to ensure it remains functional.\n\n**Recharging the Internal Battery:**\n\nThe frequency of recharging the internal battery depends on several factors, including:\n\n1. **Parking Mode Settings:** The duration and frequency of parking mode recording will impact the battery life. If you set the camera to record more frequently or for longer periods, the battery will drain faster.\n2. **Environmental Conditions:** Temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors can affect the battery's performance and lifespan.\n3. **Age of the Battery:** The internal battery's capacity will degrade over time, reducing its overall performance.\n\nAs a general guideline, Garmin recommends recharging the internal battery every 1-2 weeks, depending on your usage. However, this may vary based on your specific situation.\n\n**Recharging Methods:**\n\nYou can recharge the internal battery in two ways:\n\n1. **USB Connection:** Connect the camera to a USB port on your computer or a wall adapter using the provided USB cable. The camera will charge while it's connected to a power source.\n2. **Car's 12V Outlet:** You can also charge the camera using your car's 12V outlet (cigarette lighter). Garmin provides an adapter cable for this purpose.\n\n**Tips to Extend Battery Life:**\n\n1. **Adjust Parking Mode Settings:** Configure the parking mode to record less frequently or for shorter durations to conserve battery life.\n2. **Turn Off Parking Mode:** If you're not using the parking mode feature, turn it off to prevent unnecessary battery drain.\n3. **Store the Camera Properly:** When not in use, store the camera in a cool, dry place to prolong the battery's lifespan.\n\nKeep in mind that the internal battery is designed to provide a limited amount of power, and recharging it regularly is necessary to ensure the parking mode feature remains functional. If you're concerned about the battery life or want to use the parking mode feature extensively, hardwiring the camera to your car's electrical system might be a better option.",
