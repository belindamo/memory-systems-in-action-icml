  "content": "Yes, promoting diversity and inclusivity in programming is critical in reflecting the changing dynamics of our society and promoting social cohesion. BBC2 has made strides in this area with the production of shows such as 'Sitting in Limbo' and 'Mangrove', both of which feature Black British experiences, and highlighting the crime and social barriers that have contributed to these experiences, as well as providing visionary creativities from artistes from different societies such as \u2018 Talking Heads\u2019 which is voiced by actors from different ethnic and ability backgroups.   \n\nHowever, there is always room for improvement and continued efforts to promote diversity and inclusion, and hopefully, with increased funding, BBC2 can produce even more programs that showcase underrepresented voices and cultures, providing more insights, beyond just the mainstream perspectives.",
