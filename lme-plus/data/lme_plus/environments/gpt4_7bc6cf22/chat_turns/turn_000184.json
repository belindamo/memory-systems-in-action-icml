  "content": "The cost of first row seats for a concert can vary widely depending on a number of factors, such as the popularity of the artist, the location of the concert venue, and the demand for tickets. It's also worth noting that some concert venues may not have a designated \"first row,\" as seating arrangements can vary. In general, first row seats tend to be more expensive than seats further back, as they offer a closer and more intimate view of the performance. However, the exact price difference can vary greatly depending on the specific concert and venue. It's best to check with the concert promoter or ticket seller for the most accurate pricing information.",
