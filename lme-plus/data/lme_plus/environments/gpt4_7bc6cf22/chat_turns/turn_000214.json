  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the most recent viewership data, however, according to reported figures, BBC2's audience demographic differs slightly from that of other UK-based networks. BBC2 has historically catered to a more niche audience than other mainstream networks like ITV and Channel 4, with a focus on informative and educational programming, as well as quality drama, music, and arts programming. As a result, BBC2's viewership tends to consist of those who are interested in thought-provoking and educational content, and those who are passionate about the arts and culture. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that all TV broadcasters' audience demographics are evolving with changing viewing habits, increased competition from streaming services, and the new normal brought about by the global pandemic. Nonetheless, BBC2 continues to be a prominent platform for high-quality programming that caters to its target audience, while striking a balance between appealing to a broader audience.",
