While some concerts may reserve certain seats or sections for VIPs, it is not a universal practice. Often, the first row seats may be available for purchase by the general public, although they may be more expensive than other seats due to their proximity to the stage. It ultimately depends on the concert and the ticketing policies set by the organizers.",
