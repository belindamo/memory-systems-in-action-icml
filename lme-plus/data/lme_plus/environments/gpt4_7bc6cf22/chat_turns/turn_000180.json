  "content": "Your answer is partially correct, but it is missing an important aspect of the definition of economies of scale. Economies of scale not only refer to the decreasing cost per unit as the level of output increases, but also to the fact that the cost savings are a result of spreading fixed costs (such as rent, equipment, and management salaries) over a larger number of units.\n\nTherefore, a more complete definition of economies of scale is: \"a situation where the cost per unit of output decreases as the level of output increases, due to spreading fixed costs over a larger number of units.\"\n\nIf your teacher marked your answer as incorrect, it may be because they were looking for a more complete definition.",
