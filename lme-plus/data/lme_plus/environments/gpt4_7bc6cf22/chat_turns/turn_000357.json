Here are some of the specific actions they have taken and progress made:\n\n1. Negotiating Diversity and Inclusion Provisions: The WGAE has negotiated contract provisions with major studios and networks to promote diversity and inclusion in their hiring practices. For example, in the 2017 agreement with major studios and networks, the WGAE secured new language that required employers to consider diverse candidates for all employment and writing opportunities.\n\n2. Creating the Inclusion and Equity Department: The WGAE established the Inclusion and Equity Department to develop and implement strategies to increase diversity and inclusion in the industry. The department works with studios, networks, and production companies to create more opportunities for underrepresented groups.\n\n3. Partnering with Diversity-Focused Organizations: The WGAE has partnered with various organizations focused on promoting diversity and inclusion in the industry. This includes collaboration with organizations such as Color of Change, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, and the Women\u2019s Media Center.\n\n4. Hosting Diversity and Inclusion Events: The WGAE actively hosts events that promote diversity and inclusion in the industry. For example, the WGAE hosts an annual \"Raising Voices\" event that celebrates diverse voices in media and a \"Diversity Town Hall\" to provide members with information on how to improve inclusion within the industry.\n\n5. Conducting Research Studies and Surveys: The WGAE regularly conducts studies and surveys to better understand the challenges facing underrepresented groups in the industry. For example, in 2019, the WGAE conducted a study on sexual harassment and gender discrimination in the industry, and developed industry-wide tools to prevent sexual harassment.\n\nOverall, the WGAE has been making progress towards improving diversity and inclusion in the TV and media industry through negotiations, partnerships, events, research studies and surveys, and various other programs and initiatives.
