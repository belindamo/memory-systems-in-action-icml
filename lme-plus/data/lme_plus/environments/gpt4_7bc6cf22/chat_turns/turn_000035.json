  "content": "A mutex, short for \"mutual exclusion,\" is a synchronization mechanism that ensures only one process or thread can access a shared resource at a time.\n\nA state machine can be used to explain the use of mutexes in a simplified way:\n\n1. Unlocked state: In this state, the shared resource is accessible by multiple processes or threads.\n2. Lock request: When a process or thread wants to access the shared resource, it sends a lock request. The process then waits until the mutex is locked.\n3. Locked state: When the mutex is locked, the shared resource becomes inaccessible to other processes or threads. Only the process that has locked the mutex can access the resource.\n4. Unlock request: When the process that has locked the mutex is done using the shared resource, it sends an unlock request to the mutex.\n5. Unlocking the mutex: Upon receiving the unlock request, the mutex returns to the unlocked state, and the shared resource becomes accessible to other processes or threads again.\n\nIn this way, the mutex acts as a gatekeeper to the shared resource, ensuring that only one process or thread can access it at a time. This prevents race conditions, data corruption, and other synchronization-related issues.",
