  "content": "The hardware primitives used to create a mutex are typically atomic operations such as test-and-set, compare-and-swap, or load-linked/store-conditional. These operations allow multiple threads to coordinate access to a shared resource, such as a data structure or a region of memory, without the risk of concurrent modification. The exact implementation of the mutex will depend on the architecture and the operating system, but the basic idea is to use these atomic operations to create a lock that can be acquired and released by multiple threads, with the guarantee that only one thread can hold the lock at a time.",
