  "content": "In this version, I have added `alt` attributes to the `img` tags to provide alternative text for the images, this will make the component more accessible for users using screen readers or for those with slow internet connections.\nAlso, I have added `-90` to the angle value before applying the rotation, this is to make the eyes rotate in the right direction and follow the cursor more accurately.\nAlso, I have added the `transform` property to the `eye.style` object using string template literals, this is a more modern and better way to update the style property.\n\nAdditionally, I would recommend removing the usage of `document` object, and replace it with React state and refs, this will make the component more composable, testable and maintainable.\n\nThis improved version should work as expected and it should follow the cursor movement smoothly and be more accessible.\nPlease note that this code snippet only shows the React component, you need to create a react app and import it in your index.js file in order to run it.\nAlso it uses CSS classes that are defined in the SpaceCat.css file and you should have this file in your project.",
