  "content": "Yeah, those recipes sound amazing! I'm definitely going to try the Spicy Korean-Style ones this weekend. By the way, I was thinking about my snacking habits and I realized that my 3 pm sour cream and onion chip ritual is not the only consistent snacking habit I have. I also tend to grab a bag of pretzels or a Slim Jim on my way home from work, usually around 5-6 pm. Do you think I could replace those with some of the healthier options we discussed earlier?",
