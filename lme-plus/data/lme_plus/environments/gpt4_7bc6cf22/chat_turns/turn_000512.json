  "content": "Flannel is made by a process called carding, which involves brushing the fibers to align them in the same direction. The fibers, which can be made of cotton, wool, or synthetic materials, are then woven or knit together to create the final fabric.\n\nOne of the main reasons that flannel is softer than other cotton or wool fabrics is because of the carding process. The brushing of the fibers raises the nap, or the fuzzy surface of the fabric, which gives flannel its soft and warm texture. Additionally, the fibers can be brushed multiple times to give it an even softer feel.\n\nAnother reason flannel is softer than other cotton or wool fabrics is because it is often made from a blend of fibers, such as cotton and wool. The blend of fibers can give it a softer feel than using a single fiber type.\n\nFlannel can be brushed on one side or both sides, this is called brushed flannel. when it is brushed on both sides it is called double-napped flannel and it is even softer than a single-napped one.\n\nIn summary, flannel is made by carding and weaving or knitting fibers together, and it is softer than other cotton or wool fabrics because of the brushing process which raises the nap and the blend of fibers used to make it.",
