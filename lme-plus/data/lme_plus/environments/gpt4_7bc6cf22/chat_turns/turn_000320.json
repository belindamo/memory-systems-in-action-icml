  "content": "I'd like to learn more about the conservation and restoration of antique vases, especially those from the Victorian era. I've been taking a course on antique restoration and conservation, and I'm interested in learning about the best practices and techniques used in the field. Since I've also been helping my parents declutter their attic, and we found an old trunk from the 1800s, I'm curious about how to properly restore and conserve it as well. Do you have any tips on how to get started with the restoration process, and are there any specific materials or tools that I should be aware of?",
