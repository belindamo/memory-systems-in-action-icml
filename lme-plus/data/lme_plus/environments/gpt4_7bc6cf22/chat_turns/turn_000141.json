Using pea milk as a base is a fantastic idea, and I'm happy to help you with some tips to make it delicious and creamy:\n\n**Tips for a Delicious and Creamy Tomato Soup using Pea Milk:**\n\n1. **Roast your tomatoes**: Roasting tomatoes brings out their natural sweetness and depth of flavor. Simply halve or quarter 2-3 pounds of tomatoes, toss with olive oil, salt, and your choice of herbs (like basil, oregano, or thyme), and roast at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 20-30 minutes.\n2. **Use a flavorful broth**: Use a high-quality vegetable broth or chicken broth as a base for your soup. You can also use a homemade broth made with roasted vegetables and herbs.\n3. **Saute aromatics**: Saute onions, garlic, and celery in a bit of olive oil until they're soft and fragrant. This will add depth and complexity to your soup.\n4. **Add pea milk gradually**: Start with a small amount of pea milk (about 1/2 cup) and add it to the soup gradually, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. You can always add more pea milk, but it's harder to remove excess milk.\n5. **Blend for creaminess**: Use an immersion blender or a regular blender to blend the soup until smooth and creamy. This will help emulsify the pea milk and create a velvety texture.\n6. **Add a roux for thickness**: If you prefer a thicker soup, make a roux by whisking together 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour. Cook for 1-2 minutes, then gradually add the pea milk, whisking constantly.\n7. **Season and adjust**: Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity, or a sprinkle of paprika for added depth.\n\n**Sample Recipe:**\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 pounds roasted tomatoes\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 onion, saut\u00e9ed\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 cups vegetable broth\n* 1/2 cup pea milk\n* 1 teaspoon dried basil\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Optional: roux (1 tablespoon olive oil + 1 tablespoon flour)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
