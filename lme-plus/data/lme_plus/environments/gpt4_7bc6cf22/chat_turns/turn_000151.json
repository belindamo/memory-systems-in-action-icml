  "content": "Both Tide and Arm & Hammer Plus OxiClean are well-known and reputable brands, but they have some differences.\n\n**Tide:**\n\n* Known for its effectiveness in removing tough stains and whitening clothes\n* Has a wide range of formulas for different laundry needs (e.g., high efficiency, cold water, etc.)\n* Generally priced slightly higher than Arm & Hammer\n\n**Arm & Hammer Plus OxiClean:**\n\n* Combines the power of Arm & Hammer baking soda with OxiClean's stain-fighting ability\n* Also effective in removing tough stains and whitening clothes\n* Often priced lower than Tide\n\nConsidering the sale price, the Arm & Hammer Plus OxiClean might be a great value. If you're looking to save money and still get a quality laundry detergent, it's definitely worth considering. However, if you're particularly loyal to Tide or have specific laundry needs that require Tide's unique formulas, it might be worth splurging a bit.\n\nWith your $10 Fetch Rewards gift card, you could get the Arm & Hammer Plus OxiClean for around $9.99, leaving you with $0.01 left over. If you opt for the Tide, you might need to pay a bit more out of pocket.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on your personal preferences and laundry needs. If you're unsure, you could also consider reading reviews or asking friends and family for their opinions on the two products.",
