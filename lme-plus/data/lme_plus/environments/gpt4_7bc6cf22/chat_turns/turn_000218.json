To make the most out of Delusion's interactive experience, here are some tips:\n\n1. **Immerse yourself**: Delusion is designed to be an interactive experience, so be prepared to participate and engage with the environment and actors. Don't be afraid to touch, explore, and interact with the sets and props.\n2. **Listen carefully**: Pay attention to the story and instructions given by the actors. They will provide clues and guidance to help you navigate the experience.\n3. **Work together**: Delusion is designed for small groups, so make sure to work together with your group to solve puzzles and overcome challenges.\n4. **Don't be afraid to ask for help**: If you're stuck or unsure what to do, don't hesitate to ask the actors for guidance. They're there to help you have a great experience.\n5. **Be prepared for physical activity**: Delusion can be physically demanding, so be prepared to move around, crawl, and climb (if necessary).\n6. **Don't try to \"game\" the system**: Delusion is designed to be an immersive experience, not a competition. Focus on enjoying the story and environment rather than trying to figure out how to \"beat\" the system.\n7. **Take your time**: Don't rush through the experience. Take time to absorb the atmosphere, examine the sets, and interact with the actors.\n8. **Be respectful**: Remember that the actors are there to provide a scary experience, not to be intimidated or harassed. Be respectful of their boundaries and the environment.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to fully immerse yourself in Delusion's interactive experience and get the most out of your visit.\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed the scare zones at Halloween Horror Nights! The theming and attention to detail are always impressive. If you have any other questions or need more recommendations, feel free to ask!",
