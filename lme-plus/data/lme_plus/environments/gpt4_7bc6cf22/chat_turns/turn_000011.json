The TP-Link Archer AX50 is a great choice, known for its reliable performance and strong Wi-Fi signals.\n\nI'd be happy to help you troubleshoot your internet connection issues. Can you please describe the problems you're experiencing in more detail? For example:\n\n1. What kind of issues are you seeing? (e.g., slow speeds, dropped connections, unable to connect, etc.)\n2. When did the issues start? Was it after the router upgrade or before?\n3. Are all devices connected to the router experiencing the same issues, or is it specific to one or two devices?\n4. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that make the issues worse or better? (e.g., time of day, number of devices connected, etc.)\n5. Have you checked your internet service provider's (ISP) status page for any outages or maintenance in your area?\n\nThe more information you can provide, the better I'll be able to assist you in identifying the root cause of the problem and finding a solution.",
