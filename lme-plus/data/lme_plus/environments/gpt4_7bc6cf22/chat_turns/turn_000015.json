The default IP address for TP-Link routers is usually 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1. You can refer to your router's manual or the underside of the device for the correct IP address.\n2. **Username and Password**: Enter the admin username and password. The default credentials for TP-Link routers are usually \"admin\" for both the username and password. If you've changed them, use your custom credentials.\n3. **Wireless Settings**: Once logged in, navigate to the Wireless Settings section. Look for the following settings:\n\t* **Channel Width**: Ensure it's set to 20/40 MHz or Auto. A wider channel width can improve performance, but it may also increase interference.\n\t* **Channel**: Check if the channel is set to Auto or a specific channel. If it's set to Auto, try setting it to a specific channel (e.g., Channel 1, 6, or 11) to reduce interference.\n\t* **Wireless Network Name (SSID)**: Make sure it's set to a unique name to avoid conflicts with neighboring networks.\n4. **Save Changes**: Apply any changes you made and save your settings.\n\n**Firmware Updates:**\n\n1. **Check for updates**: Log in to your router and navigate to the Management or Advanced Settings section. Look for Firmware Update or Router Update.\n2. **Check the current version**: Note down the current firmware version.\n3. **Visit TP-Link's website**: Go to TP-Link's official website, navigate to the Support section, and search for your router model (Archer AX50).\n4. **Check for new firmware**: Compare the current firmware version with the latest version available on the website. If a newer version is available, download it.\n5. **Update the firmware**: Follow the instructions on the TP-Link website to update the firmware.\n\n**Additional Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. **Restart your router**: Perform a cold reboot by unplugging the power cord, waiting for 30 seconds, and plugging it back in.\n2. **Reduce device connections**: Temporarily disconnect some devices to see if the issue persists. This will help you determine if the slow speeds are due to network congestion.\n3. **Use Quality of Service (QoS)**: If you have critical devices or applications that require priority, consider setting up QoS on your router to allocate bandwidth accordingly.\n\nLet me know if you need help with any of these steps or if you'd like to try some additional troubleshooting methods.",
