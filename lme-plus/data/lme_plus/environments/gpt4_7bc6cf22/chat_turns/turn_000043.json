  "content": "A kprobe is a Linux kernel mechanism that allows you to dynamically intercept a specific function call in the kernel and execute custom code in response. The kprobe mechanism is used by developers and administrators to diagnose and debug issues in the kernel. The custom code executed in response to the probe can do things like log information, modify kernel state, or stop the kernel entirely. The kprobe mechanism can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as when you need to understand what a specific kernel function is doing, or when you need to debug a kernel issue that is difficult to reproduce.",
