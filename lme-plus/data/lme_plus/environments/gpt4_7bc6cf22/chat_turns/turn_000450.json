We're currently using Jira for project management, and I'm familiar with it from my previous internships. I'll also be using GitHub for version control and collaboration with my team. Additionally, we use Slack for team communication and Zoom for meetings.\n\nI'm also planning to explore other tools like Trello and Asana to see if they can help us streamline our workflow and improve our collaboration. I've heard great things about these tools, and I'm excited to try them out.\n\nDo you have any recommendations for project management tools or collaboration platforms? Have you used any tools that you'd recommend for software engineering teams?",
