  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have my own opinions, but some viewers and critics may argue that certain types of programming on BBC2 deserve more funding. For example, some may argue that BBC2 should allocate more funding to:\n\n1. Investigative journalism programs: While BBC2 has several news and current affairs programming, some may argue there is a need for more investigative journalism in the current climate. Programs that provide in-depth and impartial coverage of news worthy issues that are critical to society can help to promote transparency and accountability.\n\n2. Independent films and dramas: While BBC2 has a strong reputation for high-quality drama programming, some may argue that independent films and dramas should receive more funding. These productions can provide fresh perspectives and ideas that are not always represented in mainstream programming.\n\n3. Diversity and inclusivity programs: Although BBC2 has made strides to increase representation in its programming, some may argue that more funding should be allocated to programs that celebrate and explore diverse perspectives and experiences.\n\n4. Science and technology programs: While BBC2 has a longstanding tradition of science and technology programming, some may argue that there is a need for more programs that demystify complex scientific concepts and explore current issues in science, given the pressing nature of many scientific issues affecting society.",
