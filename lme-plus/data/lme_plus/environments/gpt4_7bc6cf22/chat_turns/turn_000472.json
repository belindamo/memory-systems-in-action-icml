  "content": "This is a React component that creates a \"space cat\" image that tracks the mouse cursor movement with its eyes. The component is using the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from React.\n\nThe component starts by importing React, './SpaceCat.css' for styling, spaceCat and spaceCatEye images from '../assets/'.\n\nIt then defines a state variable called `mousePosition` which is an object with x and y properties initially set to 0. This variable will be used to store the current position of the mouse cursor.\n\nThe component then defines a `calcAngle` function which takes the current mouse position and the center position of the space cat image, and calculates the angle between them.\n\nThe component also defines a `handleMouseMove` function that updates the `mousePosition` state variable with the current x and y coordinates of the cursor.\n\nThe component uses the `useEffect` hook to listen for changes in the `mousePosition` state variable. When this variable changes, it calls `calcAngle` function and uses the returned angle to rotate the eyes of the space cat image.\n\nIt then adds an event listener on the `mousemove` event when the component is mounted, and removes the event listener when the component unmounts.\n\nFinally, the component renders the space cat image and the eyes of the space cat using the `img` tags, and some other elements for styling and text, and it wraps them in `div` elements with specific classnames. The rendered element is wrapped in a div with classname `space-cat-container`.\n\nOverall, this component uses the mouse position to rotate the eyes of the space cat image, creating the illusion that the cat is following the cursor.\nPlease note that this code snippet only shows the React component, you need to create a react app and import it in your index.js file in order to run it.\nAlso it uses CSS classes that are defined in the SpaceCat.css file and you should have this file in your project.",
