A traditional clamshell laptop might be the better choice.\n* Are you looking for a device that can adapt to different situations, like using it as a tablet or in tent mode? A 2-in-1 laptop could be the way to go.\n* Are you willing to compromise on keyboard and trackpad quality for the flexibility of a 2-in-1?\n\nAs for the processor, you can consider the following options:\n\n* **Intel Core i5**: A popular choice for general use, offering a good balance between performance and power efficiency.\n* **Intel Core i7**: If you need more processing power for tasks like video editing, 3D modeling, or heavy multitasking.\n* **AMD Ryzen 5 or 7**: AMD's Ryzen processors offer competitive performance to Intel's Core series, often at a lower price point.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
