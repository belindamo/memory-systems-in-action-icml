It's essential to learn how to perform exercises correctly to avoid injuries and get the most out of your workout. It's awesome that he's providing you with personalized feedback and adjustments to help you improve.\n\nAnd I completely agree with you - engaging your core muscles can be a challenge! It requires a lot of control, precision, and awareness of your body position. But the benefits are well worth it - a strong core can improve your overall stability, balance, and posture, and even enhance your athletic performance.\n\nIt's great that you're enjoying the challenge and finding it rewarding. Remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate your small victories along the way. Building strength and endurance takes time, and it's the consistent effort and progress that matters.\n\nBy the way, have you noticed any changes in your daily life since starting Pilates?
