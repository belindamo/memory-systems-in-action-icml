Could you provide me with more details or clues about the channel you're thinking of? For example:\n\n* What style of dance does the channel focus on (e.g. ballet, hip-hop, contemporary, ballroom, etc.)?\n* Is it a solo channel or a team of dancers?\n* Do you remember any specific videos or routines that stood out to you?\n* Is the channel more geared towards beginners or advanced dancers?\n* Does the channel have a distinctive name, logo, or branding that you remember?\n\nAny information you can provide will help me narrow down the possibilities and try to identify the channel you're thinking of!",
