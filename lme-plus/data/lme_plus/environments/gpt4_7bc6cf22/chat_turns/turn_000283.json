  "content": "Sure, here are some healthy snack ideas to keep you fueled during your study sessions:\n\n1. Nuts and seeds: Almonds, cashews, pistachios, and pumpkin seeds are all great options. They're high in protein and healthy fats, which can help keep you full and focused. 2. Fresh fruit: Apples, bananas, and grapes are all easy-to-grab options. They provide natural sugar and fiber, which can give you a quick boost of energy. 3. Hummus and veggies: Carrots, celery, bell peppers, and cucumbers all pair well with hummus. This is a great way to get some healthy fats, protein, and fiber. 4. Yogurt: Greek yogurt is high in protein and calcium, and can be topped with berries or nuts for extra flavor and nutritional value. 5. Trail mix: Make your own trail mix with a combination of nuts, seeds, and dried fruit. This is a great option if you want something more filling but still healthy. 6. Popcorn: Popcorn is a great low-calorie snack that provides fiber and can be a good alternative to chips or other salty snacks. Just be sure to choose an air-popped variety without too much added butter or salt. Remember to also stay hydrated and drink plenty of water during long study sessions, as dehydration can make you feel lethargic and less focused.",
