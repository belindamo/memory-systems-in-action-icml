      "content": "The pigment that gives yellow color to lemons is called limonin. It is a flavonoid, which is a type of plant pigment that is responsible for the yellow, orange, and red colors of many fruits and vegetables. Limonin is present in the peel and outer layers of the lemon, and it is responsible for the bright yellow color of the fruit. Lemons are also rich in other pigments, such as carotenoids and flavonols, which contribute to their yellow color."
