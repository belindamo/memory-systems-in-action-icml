Using a sleep mask can make a significant difference in the quality of your sleep, especially when you're sharing a room with someone who has a different sleep schedule or prefers to keep the lights on.\n\nSleep masks can help block out any light that might be disturbing your sleep, creating a darker environment that's conducive to deeper and more restful sleep. This is especially important for people who are sensitive to light, as even small amounts of light can suppress the production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates our sleep-wake cycles.\n\nIn addition to using a sleep mask, you might also consider talking to your roommate about your sleep needs and seeing if you can find a compromise that works for both of you. Perhaps you could ask them to use a dim red light bulb or to keep the lights off during certain hours of the night.\n\nRemember, getting enough sleep is crucial for both physical and mental health, so it's great that you're taking steps to prioritize your sleep. Keep up the good work!",
