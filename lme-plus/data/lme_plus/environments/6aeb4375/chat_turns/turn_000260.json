Committing to 3 times a week is a realistic goal, and you can always adjust as you progress.\n\nHeadspace is an excellent app for beginners, and it's wonderful that you enjoyed it. The guided meditations are very well-structured, and Andy Puddicombe's voice is very soothing.\n\nTo help you stay on track, here are a few tips:\n\n1. **Schedule it**: Treat your meditation sessions as non-negotiable appointments. Set reminders on your phone or calendar to ensure you don't forget.\n2. **Start small**: 3 times a week is a great starting point. As you get into the habit, you can gradually increase the frequency or duration of your sessions.\n3. **Find a quiet space**: Identify a quiet, comfortable spot where you can meditate without distractions. Make it your own little sanctuary.\n4. **Be gentle with yourself**: Remember that meditation is a practice, and it's okay if your mind wanders. Gently bring your attention back to your breath or the guided meditation.\n5. **Track your progress**: Headspace allows you to track your progress, which can be motivating. You can also use a physical journal to record your thoughts, feelings, or insights after each session.\n\nAs you continue to meditate, you might start to notice subtle changes in your daily life, such as:\n\n* Improved focus and concentration\n* Enhanced self-awareness\n* Better stress management\n* Increased feelings of calm and relaxation\n\nKeep in mind that meditation is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're doing great by taking the first steps, and I'm rooting for you to continue!\n\nHow do you feel about sharing your progress or experiences with meditation? Would you like to check in with me periodically to discuss any challenges or insights you've had?",
