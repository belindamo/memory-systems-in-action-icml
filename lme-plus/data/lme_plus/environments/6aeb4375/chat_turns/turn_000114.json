  "content": "Successful characters are built backwards, meaning that before an author starts writing about a character, they should first consider what the character's ultimate goal or objective is. This approach allows the author to create a character that is both interesting and effective in achieving their goals.\n\nRecently, I received an email from Dan Kennedy, a well-known figure in the copywriting world, who doesn't usually send emails. In his message, he talked about how information is a commodity and how most copywriters don't know or teach anything worthwhile. He believes that most information can be found elsewhere for a better price or even for free, and that customers or subscribers can quickly gain all the knowledge they need.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, fiction writers should study non-fiction and non-fiction writers should read fiction. He suggests that writers should observe the world around them, paying attention to news, headlines, and people's daily habits and routines. They should also immerse themselves in nature and make observations even if their surroundings seem dull or uninteresting. By doing so, they can gain inspiration for their writing and create compelling stories.\n\nKennedy also discussed Gary Halbert and Napoleon Hill, two successful writers who he admires. He cited Hill's book \"Laws of Success\" and its focus on organized effort, which is relevant to writing with a purpose. Kennedy suggests that writers should have a clear objective when writing, particularly when writing to persuade others or form long-term relationships.\n\nHe emphasizes that writers should focus on the results of their writing and consider what they want to happen after someone reads their content. Without a clear objective, it's difficult to know if a piece of writing is effective or not. Kennedy encourages writers to use storytelling as a way to sell their ideas, citing Gary Halbert as an example of a writer who used storytelling effectively in his newsletters. Halbert's letters were known for their raw honesty, and readers eagerly awaited each installment to find out what kind of trouble he had gotten himself into.\n\nIn summary, Kennedy's message to writers is to have a clear objective when writing, focus on the results, and use storytelling as a way to sell ideas effectively. By observing the world around them and immersing themselves in nature, writers can gain inspiration for their writing and create compelling stories.",
