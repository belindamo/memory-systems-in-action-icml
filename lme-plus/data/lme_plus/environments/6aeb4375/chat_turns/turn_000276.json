Reading a book for 20 minutes before bed is a great start!\n\nAs for calming teas or drinks, I have some wonderful recommendations that can help you relax before bed:\n\n1. **Chamomile Tea**: A classic choice for promoting relaxation and calming the mind. Its soothing effects can help reduce anxiety and prepare your body for sleep.\n2. **Lavender Tea**: Lavender is known for its calming properties, and drinking lavender tea can promote relaxation, reduce stress, and help you fall asleep faster.\n3. **Tart Cherry Tea**: Tart cherry tea contains melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Drinking it before bed may help improve the quality of your sleep.\n4. **Peppermint Tea**: While peppermint can be invigorating during the day, a calming peppermint tea before bed can help reduce stress and anxiety, making it easier to fall asleep.\n5. **Decaffeinated Herbal Tea**: If you're sensitive to caffeine, opt for a decaf herbal tea like rooibos, hibiscus, or passionflower tea. These teas are caffeine-free and can promote relaxation.\n6. **Warm Milk**: A glass of warm milk contains tryptophan, an amino acid that helps produce serotonin and melatonin. This can promote relaxation and help you fall asleep faster.\n7. **GABA Tea**: GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate sleep and relaxation. Drinking GABA tea before bed may promote a sense of calm and reduce anxiety.\n\nRemember to avoid caffeinated drinks, like coffee or energy drinks, at least 4-6 hours before bedtime, as they can interfere with your sleep.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Steep your tea for the recommended time to ensure the optimal amount of calming compounds are released.\n* Drink your tea at a comfortable temperature, not too hot or too cold.\n* Experiment with different teas to find the one that works best for you.\n* Consider adding a relaxing activity, like reading or listening to soothing music, to enhance the calming effects of your tea.\n\nI hope these recommendations help you find the perfect calming drink to add to your pre-sleep routine!",
