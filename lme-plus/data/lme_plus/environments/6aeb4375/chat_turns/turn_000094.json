As a large language model, I don't have knowledge of specific museums or exhibitions, including the Photography Museum or the \"Street Photography\" exhibition featuring Henri Cartier-Bresson and Garry Winogrand.\n\nHowever, I can suggest that you check the websites of the art museums and galleries I recommended earlier to see if they have any exhibitions or collections related to street photography. You can also try searching online for photography-specific museums or galleries in Springfield that might have exhibitions that interest you.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider reaching out to the institutions directly to ask about their current or upcoming exhibitions. They might be able to provide you with more information on their collections or exhibitions related to street photography.\n\nI apologize for any confusion, and I hope you have a great time exploring Springfield's art scene!",
