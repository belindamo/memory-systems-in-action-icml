  "content": "To prevent users who should not be able to access content from being able to access that content after it has been crawled and indexed by SharePoint, you can use a combination of the following methods:\n\n1. Use SharePoint permissions: SharePoint uses the permissions of the user who is performing the search to determine what content is returned in the search results. By setting proper permissions for the users, you can restrict access to the content.\n2. Use item-level permissions: SharePoint allows you to set permissions on individual items within a library or list. This allows you to control access to specific content, even if it is within a library or list that has more permissive permissions.\n3. Use Result Sources: Result sources allow you to define a set of rules for filtering the search results based on specific criteria. You can create a result source that filters out content that should not be accessible to certain users.\n4. Use SharePoint Information Rights Management (IRM) : IRM allows you to protect sensitive information by applying usage rights and permissions to files and folders. IRM works by encrypting the data, and then the permissions and usage rights are applied to the encryption keys rather than the data itself.\n5. Use SharePoint Secure Store Service (SSS) : SharePoint Secure Store Service (SSS) is a service application that stores and maps credentials, such as account names and passwords, which are used to connect to external systems. SSS can be used to store credentials for external systems and then map them to specific users or groups.\n\nBy using these methods, you can restrict access to the content and only allow the users who should have access to the content to view it.",
