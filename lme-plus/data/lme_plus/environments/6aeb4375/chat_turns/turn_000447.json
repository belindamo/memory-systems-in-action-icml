That's a great way to share plants with friends and family, and you're lucky to have gotten some from your neighbor's garden! Hydrangea propagation can be a bit tricky, but with the right techniques, you can increase your chances of success. Here are some tips to help you propagate hydrangea cuttings:\n\n**Choosing the right cuttings:**\n\n* Take 3-4 inch stem cuttings from the current season's growth (new wood). Avoid taking cuttings from old, woody stems.\n* Select stems with at least two sets of leaves and a node (the joint where a leaf meets the stem).\n* Cut just below a node, using a clean, sharp knife or pruning tool.\n\n**Preparing the cuttings:**\n\n* Remove lower leaves, leaving only two or three sets of leaves at the top. This helps prevent the cutting from drying out and reduces transpiration.\n* Dip the cut end in rooting hormone powder or liquid to stimulate root growth.\n* Gently remove any weak or damaged leaves to prevent the spread of disease.\n\n**Rooting the cuttings:**\n\n* Fill a small pot or propagation tray with a well-draining mix, such as a mix specifically designed for cuttings.\n* Plant the cutting about 1-2 inches deep, making sure the node (where you made the cut) is buried in the soil.\n* Firm the soil gently around the cutting to secure it in place.\n* Water thoroughly, but make sure the soil isn't waterlogged.\n\n**Caring for the cuttings:**\n\n* Place the potted cuttings in a bright, indirectly lit area with temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C).\n* Keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Check the soil daily, and water when the top inch of soil feels dry.\n* Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause the cutting to dry out.\n* Keep the humidity high by covering the pot with a clear plastic bag or a cloche.\n\n**Rooting time:**\n\n* Roots should develop within 2-6 weeks, depending on the hydrangea variety and environmental conditions.\n* Check for roots by gently tugging on the cutting. If it resists being pulled out of the soil, it has developed roots.\n\n**Transplanting:**\n\n* Once the new plant has developed a robust root system and is growing well, you can transplant it into a larger pot or directly into the garden.\n* Harden off the plant by gradually exposing it to outdoor conditions over the course of 7-10 days before transplanting.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Hydrangea cuttings can be more challenging to root than other plants, so don't be discouraged if not all of them take.\n* It's essential to keep the soil consistently moist during the rooting process.\n* If you're propagating multiple cuttings, make sure to label them with the date and variety to keep track of their progress.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you should be able to successfully propagate your hydrangea cuttings and enjoy these beautiful flowers in your garden. Good luck!",
