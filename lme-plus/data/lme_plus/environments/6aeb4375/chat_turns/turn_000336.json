You want to make sure it's something that truly resonates with you and complements your grandmother's necklace beautifully.\n\nRegarding your engagement ring, it's generally recommended to take it to a jeweler who specializes in ring resizing and repair. While a pearl restorer might be able to clean and inspect your ring, they might not have the necessary expertise to resize it accurately.\n\nRing resizing requires specific skills and equipment, and a jeweler who specializes in ring repair and resizing will have the knowledge and experience to do the job correctly. They'll be able to assess the type of metal, the setting, and the stone to determine the best approach for resizing your ring.\n\nYou can search online for \"ring resizing\" or \"jewelry repair\" in your area to find a reputable jeweler who specializes in ring work. Make sure to read reviews, ask about their experience with ring resizing, and inquire about their process and materials used.\n\nIt's also a good idea to ask about their policy on resizing engagement rings, as some jewelers might have specific procedures or requirements for working with high-value or sentimental pieces.\n\nRemember to ask questions, inspect the work before leaving it with the jeweler, and get a clear estimate of the work to be done, including the cost and timeline. This will help ensure that your engagement ring receives the best care possible.\n\nI hope that helps!",
