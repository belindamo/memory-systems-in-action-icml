  "content": "What a great idea to use a gardening app to track your progress! Adding your herb garden to the app will definitely help you stay organized and on top of its needs.\n\n**Whether to start a new section or add it to your existing layout depends on a few factors:**\n\n1. **Separate or integrated:** Do you want to manage your herb garden separately from your existing garden, or do you want to integrate it into your overall garden layout? If you have a large garden with multiple sections, adding the herb garden to the existing layout might make sense. However, if you want to focus specifically on your herbs and track their progress separately, creating a new section might be a better option.\n2. **App functionality:** Check your app's features and limitations. Some apps might allow you to create separate gardens or sections, while others might not. If your app has a limited number of gardens or sections, you might need to add your herb garden to your existing layout.\n3. **Personal preference:** Consider your personal preference for organization and tracking. If you like to keep your herb garden separate from your main garden, creating a new section will give you a dedicated space to focus on your herbs. On the other hand, if you prefer to see your entire garden layout at a glance, adding the herb garden to your existing layout might be more convenient.\n\n**Pros and cons of each approach:**\n\n**New section:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Dedicated space for your herb garden\n* Easier to track and focus on herb-specific tasks and progress\n* Can set separate reminders and notifications for herb care\n\nCons:\n\n* Might take up more space in the app\n* Requires more setup and organization\n\n**Adding to existing layout:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Easy to integrate into your existing garden layout\n* Can see your entire garden at a glance\n* Less setup and organization required\n\nCons:\n\n* Might get lost among other plants and tasks\n* Less focus on herb-specific care and tracking\n\n**Ultimate decision:**\n\nIf you decide to start a new section, you can name it something like \"Herb Garden\" or \"Patio Herbs\" to keep it separate from your main garden. This will give you a dedicated space to track your herbs' progress, add notes, and set reminders specific to their care.\n\nIf you choose to add your herb garden to your existing layout, you can create a new bed or section within your garden layout and add your herb plants to it. This will allow you to see your herb garden in the context of your overall garden, but you might need to use tags or filters to differentiate it from other plants.\n\nWhichever approach you choose, make sure it works for you and your gardening style!",
