  "content": "I'm so glad you're enthusiastic about Korean food! However, I should clarify that I'm an AI, so I don't have personal experiences, taste buds, or a physical presence in a city. I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries.\n\nBut I'm thrilled to hear that you've been exploring different Korean restaurants and enjoying the variety of flavors and styles! Korean cuisine is incredibly diverse and nuanced, and there's always something new to discover.\n\nIf you're willing to share, I'd love to hear more about your experiences at the three restaurants you've tried. What dishes did you order, and what stood out to you about each place? I'm always eager to learn and improve my knowledge, and your feedback can help me better assist others who are interested in Korean cuisine.",
