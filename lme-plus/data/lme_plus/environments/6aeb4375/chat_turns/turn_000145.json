  "content": "Yes, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) is a commonly used self-report measure of intrinsic motivation. It was developed by Richard M. Ryan and Edward L. Deci in 1985 as a tool to assess the degree to which people are motivated to engage in an activity for its inherent enjoyment, interest, or satisfaction, rather than for external reasons such as rewards or pressure from others.\n\nThe IMI consists of a set of Likert-type items that assess six different dimensions of intrinsic motivation: interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, effort/importance, perceived choice, value/usefulness, and relatedness. Respondents rate the degree to which they agree or disagree with each item on a 7-point scale.\n\nThe IMI has been widely used in research on motivation across a variety of domains, including education, sports, and work. It has been shown to have good reliability and validity, and has been used to investigate a range of research questions related to intrinsic motivation, such as its relationship to performance, creativity, and well-being.",
