They may even have some insider knowledge on lesser-known routes or hidden gems that aren't well-advertised online.\n\nWhen you ask for route recommendations, be sure to let them know:\n\n1. Your desired distance (40 miles)\n2. Your preferred terrain (flat, hilly, etc.)\n3. Your concerns (minimal traffic, scenic routes, etc.)\n4. Any specific features you're looking for (bike paths, lake views, etc.)\n\nThey might even have some pre-mapped routes or cue sheets that they can share with you. Additionally, they may be able to provide tips on road conditions, bike-friendly roads, and any potential hazards to watch out for.\n\nWhile you're there, picking up some extra supplies like energy bars and a new water bottle cage is a great idea. You might also consider asking the staff about any other essentials you might need, such as:\n\n* Tire pressure checks or adjustments\n* Chain lubrication or cleaning\n* Brake pad inspections\n* Any other bike maintenance or accessories you might need\n\nThe staff at the bike shop can also offer valuable advice on how to prepare for your ride, including what to wear, what to bring, and how to stay safe on the road.\n\nHave a great time at the bike shop, and I hope you get some fantastic route recommendations for your 40-mile ride this weekend!",
