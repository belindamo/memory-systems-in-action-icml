Open your niece's image and the spooky castle illustration in GIMP.\n\t2. Select your niece's image layer, and then go to Colors > Levels.\n\t3. In the Levels dialog box, adjust the black, white, and gray sliders to match the overall tone and contrast of the castle illustration.\n\t4. Next, go to Colors > Color Balance.\n\t5. In the Color Balance dialog box, adjust the sliders for Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights to match the overall color palette of the castle illustration.\n\t6. Click OK to apply the changes.\n2. Apply Color Grade or Filter:\n\t1. Select your niece's image layer, and then go to Colors > Colorize.\n\t2. In the Colorize dialog box, select a color that matches the overall color palette of the castle illustration.\n\t3. Adjust the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness sliders to achieve the desired color grade.\n\t4. Click OK to apply the color grade to your niece's image.\n\t5. Repeat the same process for the castle illustration layer.\n3. Add Shadows and Highlights:\n\t1. Select your niece's image layer, and then duplicate it by right-clicking the layer and selecting Duplicate Layer.\n\t2. Rename the duplicated layer to \"Shadows and Highlights.\"\n\t3. Select the \"Shadows and Highlights\" layer, and then go to Filters > Light and Shadow > Drop Shadow.\n\t4. In the Drop Shadow dialog box, adjust the settings to create a subtle shadow effect that matches the lighting of the castle illustration.\n\t5. Click OK to apply the drop shadow effect.\n\t6. Repeat the same process for creating highlights by going to Filters > Light and Shadow > Dodge and Burn.\n\t7. Adjust the settings to create a subtle highlight effect that matches the lighting of the castle illustration.\n\t8. Click OK to apply the dodge and burn effect.\n4. Use a Layer Blending Mode:\n\t1. Select your niece's image layer, and then change the layer blending mode to \"Multiply.\"\n\t2. This will blend your niece's image with the castle illustration by multiplying the color values of the two layers.\n\t3. Experiment with other blending modes such as \"Overlay\" or \"Soft Light\" to achieve different effects.\n5. Apply a Light Effect:\n\t1. Select your niece's image layer, and then duplicate it by right-clicking the layer and selecting Duplicate Layer.\n\t2. Rename the duplicated layer to \"Light Effect.\"\n\t3. Select the \"Light Effect\" layer, and then go to Filters > Light and Shadow > Lighting Effects.\n\t4. In the Lighting Effects dialog box, adjust the settings to create a soft ambient light effect that matches the lighting of the castle illustration.\n\t5. Click OK to apply the lighting effect.\n\t6. Adjust the layer blending mode and opacity of the \"Light Effect\" layer to achieve a subtle and realistic effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you can achieve a more realistic and cohesive composite of your niece's image with the spooky castle illustration using GIMP.",
