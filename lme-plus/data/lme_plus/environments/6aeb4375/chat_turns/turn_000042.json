I recently got a new pair of black boots from Zara, which I've been wearing nonstop - by the way, I got a 30% discount on them when I purchased them, which was a great deal! Anyway, I'm thinking of styling them with a little white dress I just got from Madewell. Do you have any tips on how to make the outfit look chic and not too casual?",
