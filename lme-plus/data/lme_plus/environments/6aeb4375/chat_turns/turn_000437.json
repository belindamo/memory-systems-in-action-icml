  "content": "Whether to remove or keep the extra variables in your dataset depends on your research question and analysis plan.\n\nIf the extra variables are not relevant to your research question or analysis plan, it may be appropriate to remove them to simplify the analysis and reduce the risk of Type I errors. On the other hand, if the extra variables are important to your research question or analysis plan, you should keep them in the dataset and include them in your analysis.\n\nIn any case, it is a good practice to explore and understand all variables in your dataset before making a decision about whether to keep or remove them. You can use descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analyses to explore the relationships between variables and identify potential confounding variables or sources of variation.",
