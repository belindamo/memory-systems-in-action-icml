  "content": "You are correct, I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) actually consists of seven dimensions, not six. The seven dimensions are:\n\n1. Interest/Enjoyment: The degree to which the activity is perceived as enjoyable, interesting, and fun.\n2. Perceived Competence: The degree to which one feels competent and effective in performing the activity.\n3. Effort/Importance: The degree to which one feels that the activity is important and worth the effort.\n4. Perceived Choice: The degree to which one feels that they have choice and autonomy in engaging in the activity.\n5. Value/Usefulness: The degree to which one perceives the activity as meaningful and valuable.\n6. Relatedness: The degree to which the activity is related to one's values and goals.\n7. Pressure/Tension: The degree to which one feels pressured or tense while engaging in the activity.\n\nEach dimension is measured using a set of Likert-type items, and respondents rate the degree to which they agree or disagree with each item on a 7-point scale. The IMI has been widely used in research to assess intrinsic motivation across a range of domains.",
