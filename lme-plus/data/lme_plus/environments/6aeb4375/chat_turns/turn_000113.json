  "content": "do the same thing for the following: Successful characters are built backwards\nRecently, I got an email, from someone who usually doesn't do email, the legend: Dan Kennedy.\nHe mentions something about how information is like a commodity ad he was doing a recap at Russell Brunson's FHL event.\nDan pretty much says that most of us (copywriters) don't know or teach anything.\nI think he's right, and that most of the info can be found elsewhere for a better price or for FREE.\nA customer or subscriber could pretty much know everything (or believe they do) in a short amount of time.\nFiction writers should study non-fiction. Non-fiction writers should read fiction.\nHave you ever heard this before? I sure have. It's true though.\nIf you're someone that writes a a lot of fiction you owe it to yourself, and the readers, to read through the news yourself, scan the articles form various sources, pay attention to the headlines, things that grab people's attention, study people and their daily habits and routines. Take in some nature and take a look around around you\u2014even if it sucks or is boring. Then go to your little cave, where you sit in loneliness, and write about it!\nMake a movie out of the mundane.\nObviously, the same kinda idea, flipped upside-down, goes for the non-fiction writer, like myself ,and many of you who write ad copy and the kind of stuff that gets printed in magazines and trade journals.\nYou really ought to pick up as many fiction novels and fantasy books you can.\nThink about it.\nI mean look at the classic cartoons of today. The adult ones. (The kid cartoons today are just plain tacky, boring...unpalatable.)\nThe cartoon animated shows like South Park, Family Guy, Simpsons, and Rick and Morty all use real life characters, or relatable to real humans, much in the same way Marvel did with Spiderman or Captain America.\nThe characters in these shows were built on certain trigger points you'd see in the media and in real-life. (When you have a moment, and engage in couch potato behavior, watch an episode of any of those adult cartoons I mentioned.)\nAnyway, going back to Dan's recap on the recent FHL event....I like how Dan brought up Gary Halbert and Napoleon Hill in the email.\n(BTW....isn't it awesome that Dan Kennedy is STILL active in his and our world...\u201dthe world?\u201d \n(The stuff I'm referring to was written this morning which is the 22nd day of September.)\nDan Kennedy is a genius!\n...and so are the other two guys he mentioned, Napoleon and Gary, of course.\nOne of the things mentioned by Dan, about Napoleon Hill, was something from Hill's \u201cLaws of Success\u201d book, which had to do with Organized Effort. (I believe this was also mentioned in Think and Grow Rich??? I could be wrong, but feel free to look that up and correct me on that)\nAnyways, the brilliant point Dan brought up, was about writing by objectives, simply because we are writing to persuade others, create a sphere of influence and form long-term (business) relationships.\nRight?!?\nWhy just write WITHOUT purpose? I mean you can... but, that's not very sustainable. There needs to be a mission. \nOK, sure, sure, free writing for fun and practice is totally fine and mandatory, if you wan to be a \u201cgood\u201d writer, one can learn and grow a ton just setting aside time to write without boundaries or for profit and purpose.\nBut, for 95% of our writing should be intentional.\nThe next thing one might wonder is: what you want to happen after the person reads your consumes you piece of content??\nIf you can't figure that part out, it will be pretty difficult to KNOW what if what you did was good or not.\nRight?!?\nThere are no rewards in this game.\nWe can pat ourselves on the back, from time to time, but forget what your friends and family think (WHY??? Well, because we already know they'll either completely shut down the idea or give us the ol' pat on the back routine).\nReally, it's all about the results that take place in the marketplace.\nI mean, how will you or I get a result, if you don't know what we want to begin with?\nOnce you have THAT part figured out, the writing decisions become crystal clear and easier to implement.\nOh, and lastly, the 'little trick-of-the-trade' that we writers ALL can use, is, and something that Gary Halbert used quite a bit, was story telling.\nSell through story.\nAlmost all of Gary Halbert's writing, particularity his newsletters, was pure story telling. Come to think of it, I think story telling was 90% of Gary Halbert's content. But, what do I know?\nDan Kennedy mentions that if you took a pile of Gary Halbert's letters and went through them, you'd find some content littered here and there, and they are was a little bit of of teaching here and there, too. (There is, I promise you that.)\nBut, the bulk of Gary's work was basically a journal of his own life and daily rituals and business dealings. Almost like daytime television, or an episode of \u201cGary\u201d but in a printed version of a TV sitcom.\nGary Halbert was known to be a pretty raw and honest guy, so when his letters arrived at his subscribers mailbox, the recipient would basically barricade themselves and put a stop to whatever it was they were doing to read his letters. (Wow!)\nHis letters were like soap operas.\n \nPeople would want to tread Gary's letters to find out what kind of trouble he got himself into this time. Genius, if you ask me.)\nAnyway, just wanted to share this with you guys.\nOh, btw I don't get paid or have anything to offer you reading this today, but it is helpful to me if you follow me here.\nCheers!\nJustin N.
