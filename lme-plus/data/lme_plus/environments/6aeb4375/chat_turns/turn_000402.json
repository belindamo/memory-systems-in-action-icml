I'm excited to help you dig deeper into Teddy Wilson and his album \"Midnight Groove\".\n\nAfter some research, I found that Teddy Wilson is a lesser-known saxophonist, but he's not entirely unknown. Here are some tidbits to get you started:\n\n* Teddy Wilson (not to be confused with the famous pianist Teddy Wilson, who was a member of the Benny Goodman Sextet) was an American jazz saxophonist and composer.\n* He was active in the 1960s and 1970s, primarily in the New York City jazz scene.\n* \"Midnight Groove\" is indeed his debut album, released on Jazzcraft Records in 1967. The label was a small, independent imprint that released a handful of jazz albums during the late 1960s.\n* The album's personnel includes some talented, if lesser-known, musicians:\n\t+ Piano: Larry Gales (who played with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, among others)\n\t+ Bass: Richard Davis (a renowned bassist who worked with a wide range of artists, from Eric Dolphy to Bruce Springsteen)\n\t+ Drums: Clifford Jarvis (a drummer who played with Charles Mingus, among others)\n* The music on \"Midnight Groove\" is a great representation of the soul-jazz and hard bop styles of the time. Wilson's saxophone playing is reminiscent of artists like Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, and Jimmy Heath.\n* Unfortunately, I couldn't find much information on Teddy Wilson's life, such as his birth and death dates, or his early career. It's possible that he was a local New York City musician who didn't gain widespread recognition.\n\nTo further research Teddy Wilson and \"Midnight Groove\", you might want to try the following:\n\n* Check online marketplaces like eBay or Discogs for other albums or 45s by Teddy Wilson. You might find some rare or hard-to-find recordings that can provide more insight into his music.\n* Look for jazz forums, blogs, or social media groups focused on rare or obscure jazz records. You might find enthusiasts who have more information or have listened to \"Midnight Groove\" themselves.\n* Visit the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University or the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City. These institutions have extensive archives and collections related to jazz history, and their librarians or archivists might be able to provide more information on Teddy Wilson or Jazzcraft Records.\n* If you're feeling adventurous, you could try contacting some of the musicians who played on \"Midnight Groove\" or their estates to see if they have any stories or memories about Teddy Wilson or the recording session.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your journey to uncover more about Teddy Wilson and \"Midnight Groove\"!",
