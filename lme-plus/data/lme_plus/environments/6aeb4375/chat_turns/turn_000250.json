  "content": "Yes, there are many specific Maori stories and legends that are still told today. One such story is the story of Maui, a demigod who is known for fishing up the North Island of New Zealand using a fishhook made from the jawbone of his ancestor. Another notable legend is the story of Hinemoa and Tutanekai, a tragic love story between two young Maori lovers.\n\nIn addition to these stories, there are also many chants and songs that are still sung today, which tell the stories of Maori ancestors and their connection to the land. Another important part of Maori oral tradition is the reciting of genealogies or whakapapa, which trace the ancestry of individuals back to their Maori ancestors.\n\nThese stories and traditions are still actively passed down through generations, and are an important way for Maori to maintain their cultural identity and heritage.",
