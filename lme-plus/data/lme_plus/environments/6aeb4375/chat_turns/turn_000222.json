Rent a Car (Economy or Compact):**\nWhile a minivan might have been necessary for your family trip, a smaller car will suffice for solo travel. Economy or compact cars are usually cheaper and more fuel-efficient. You can expect to pay around $40-60 per day, depending on the rental agency and season.\n\n**2. Shuttle Services:**\nMany resorts and hotels offer shuttle services to and from the airport, as well as around the island. You can also book shuttle services like Maui Airport Shuttle or SpeediShuttle, which can be more cost-effective than renting a car.\n\n**3. Public Transportation:**\nThe Maui Bus is a convenient and affordable way to get around the island. The bus system covers most areas, including popular beaches, towns, and attractions. Fares are around $2-5 per ride, or you can buy a day pass for $10.\n\n**4. Bike Rentals:**\nIf you're staying in a specific area, like Ka'anapali or Kihei, you can rent a bike for a day or two to explore the nearby beaches and attractions. Many bike rental shops offer affordable rates, around $20-30 per day.\n\n**5. Walking and Hiking:**\nMaui has many scenic walking trails and beaches within walking distance from popular resorts and towns. You can also hike to scenic spots like the Iao Valley State Monument or the West Maui Mountains.\n\n**6. Ride-hailing Services:**\nUber and Lyft operate on Maui, so you can use these services to get around, especially if you're traveling short distances.\n\n**7. Car Sharing or Car Rental Alternatives:**\nCompanies like Zipcar or Car2Go offer car-sharing services, which can be a cost-effective option if you only need a car for a short period.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be sure to research and book your transportation in advance, especially during peak season (December to April).\n* Consider purchasing a Maui Gold Card, which offers discounts on various activities, including transportation services.\n* If you do decide to rent a car, look for agencies that offer free parking, as this can save you money in the long run.\n\nI hope this helps you navigate Maui on a budget!",
