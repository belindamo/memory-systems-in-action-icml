  "content": "To refer to content available on a network share in SharePoint without ingesting the content, you can create a link or a \"Shortcut\" to the network share location within a SharePoint library or page. This will allow users to access the content from the SharePoint interface, but the content will still be stored and managed on the network share. Additionally, you can configure SharePoint to index the content on the network share, so it is searchable within the SharePoint search functionality. This can be done by creating a content source for the network share in the SharePoint Search service application, and then configuring a crawl schedule for the content source.",
