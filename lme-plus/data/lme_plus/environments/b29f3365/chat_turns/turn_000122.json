  "content": "In the dream, Jacob found himself standing in the middle of a vast, nearly infinite room. All around him, pairs of spirits were gathered together, each in deep conversation. The sheer number of them was staggering, and Jacob felt small and lost in the midst of so much power.\n\nDespite the chaos of so many voices, Jacob could sense a palpable tension in the air. The spirits were all clearly agitated and upset, their conversations growing more and more heated by the moment.\n\nAs Jacob strained to listen, he heard the name \"Lorelei\" repeated over and over, along with the names of several other spirits that he couldn't quite place. He tried to follow the discussions, but the sheer collective power of all the spirits in the room was nearly overwhelming, and he struggled to stay conscious.\n\nHe scanned the crowd, looking for Eri and Racita, but the sea of spirits was endless, and he couldn't find them among the throngs. He did see spirits of all shapes and sizes, some looking human, others looking like nothing he'd ever seen before. There was a spirit with feathers for hair, another with skin made of crystal, and one with tentacles for arms.\n\nAs the discussions continued, Jacob could feel the anger and frustration in the air building, and he knew that something serious was happening. Despite his fear, he tried to stay awake and listen, determined to understand what was going on in the council of spirits.",
