The Sill is a great resource for plants, and it's wonderful that you're enjoying them.\n\nNow, about your fiddle leaf fig (FLF) - those gorgeous plants can be a bit finicky, but with the right care, they'll thrive! Here are some tips to help keep your FLF happy and healthy:\n\n1. **Lighting**: Fiddle leaf figs love bright, indirect light. East- or west-facing windows are ideal. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can cause leaf burn.\n2. **Watering**: Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Check the moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. Water thoroughly, but make sure not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot.\n3. **Humidity**: FLFs prefer a humid environment, typically above 50%. You can place the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier nearby.\n4. **Temperature**: Keep your FLF in a spot with a consistent temperature between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C). Avoid sudden changes, as this can cause stress.\n5. **Fertilization**: Feed your FLF with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n6. **Pruning**: Prune your FLF regularly to maintain its shape and encourage growth. Remove any dead or damaged leaves, and cut back long stems to encourage branching.\n7. **Soil**: Use a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for tropical plants like FLFs. Avoid using regular potting soil, as it can retain too much water.\n8. **Pest control**: Check your plant regularly for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, and scale. Isolate your FLF if you notice any issues, and treat promptly.\n9. **Repotting**: FLFs typically need to be repotted every 1-2 years as they outgrow their containers. Choose a pot that's only slightly larger than the previous one, and use fresh potting mix.\n10. **Patience**: Fiddle leaf figs can be slow-growing, so be patient and enjoy the journey. With proper care, your FLF will thrive and become a stunning addition to your room.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your fiddle leaf fig happy and healthy.
