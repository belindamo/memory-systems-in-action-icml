  "content": "I think I'll try out the polyrhythmic practice and subdivision practice. I've been wanting to improve my timing and rhythm in my blues playing, and I think these techniques will really help. By the way, I recently attended a music workshop focused on blues guitar, which was a lot of fun. I met some other musicians, and we jammed together for a few hours, playing classic blues songs like \"Sweet Home Chicago\" and \"Pride and Joy\". One of the instructors, a professional blues guitarist, gave me some great tips on bending strings and playing with more feeling.",
