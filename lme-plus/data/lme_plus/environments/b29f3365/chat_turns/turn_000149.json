  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on wallet organizers. I've recently added a new credit card to my wallet and it's feeling a bit bulky. I've been using the same wallet for a while, but now I think it's time to consider a smaller one. Do you have any recommendations? By the way, I've been using my new backpack daily for my commute to work, and it's been great so far - it's a black one with multiple compartments that I bought about three weeks ago.",
