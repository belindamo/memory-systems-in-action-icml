Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n**Project Directory Structure:**\n\n1. Create a top-level directory for your project, e.g., `customer_purchasing_dashboard`.\n2. Inside the top-level directory, create the following subdirectories:\n\t* `data`: Store your raw and processed data files here.\n\t* `src`: This is where your Python code will live.\n\t* `visualizations`: Store your visualization outputs (e.g., images, HTML files) here.\n\t* `docs`: Store documentation, such as README files, user guides, and technical notes.\n3. Within the `src` directory, create subdirectories for each component of your project:\n\t* `ingestion`: Data ingestion scripts (e.g., loading, cleaning, processing data).\n\t* `visualization`: Visualization scripts (e.g., creating plots, dashboards).\n\t* `utils`: Utility scripts (e.g., data manipulation, formatting).\n\t* `app`: Your dashboard application code (e.g., Flask, Dash).\n\n**Code Structure:**\n\n1. **Modularize your code**: Break down your code into smaller, independent modules or scripts, each with a specific purpose.\n2. **Use meaningful file names and directories**: Choose descriptive names that indicate the purpose of each file or directory.\n3. **Keep related functions together**: Group related functions or classes into a single script or module.\n4. **Use a consistent naming convention**: Follow PEP 8, the official Python style guide, for naming conventions and code organization.\n5. **Document your code**: Use docstrings and comments to explain what your code does, how it works, and any assumptions it makes.\n\n**Example Code Structure:**\n```bash\ncustomer_purchasing_dashboard/\ndata/\nraw_data.csv\nprocessed_data.csv\nsrc/\ningestion/\nload_data.py\nclean_data.py\nvisualization/\nplotly_visualizations.py\ndashboard.py\nutils/\ndata_utils.py\nstring_utils.py\napp/\napp.py\ntemplates/\nindex.html\nstatic/\ncss/\nstyle.css\njs/\nscript.js\nvisualizations/\nplots/\nplot1.html\nplot2.html\n...\ndocs/\nREADME.md\nuser_guide.md\ntechnical_notes.md\n```\n**Tips for Writing Readable Code:**\n\n1. **Use descriptive variable names**: Choose names that indicate the purpose of the variable.\n2. **Keep functions short and focused**: Aim for functions that perform a single, well-defined task.\n3. **Use whitespace and indentation**: Make your code easy to read by using consistent indentation and whitespace.\n4. **Avoid complex logic**: Break down complex logic into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n5. **Test your code**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure your code works as expected.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to creating a maintainable, readable, and scalable codebase for your dashboard project. Good luck!",
