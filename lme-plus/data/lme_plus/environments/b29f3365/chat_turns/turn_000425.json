  "content": "Asking about their experience as new parents can be a delicate matter, as they may still be adjusting to their new roles and navigating the challenges of caring for a newborn. Here are some tips to help you ask thoughtful and considerate questions:\n\n**Open-Ended Questions**\n\n1. **How's it going?**: A simple, open-ended question that allows them to share as much or as little as they like.\n2. **What's been the biggest surprise?**: This question encourages them to reflect on their experience and share something they didn't expect.\n3. **What's been the most challenging part?**: This question shows you care about their well-being and are willing to listen to their struggles.\n\n**Specific, Non-Intrusive Questions**\n\n1. **How's Lucas sleeping?**: A common concern for new parents, and a question that shows you're interested in their daily life.\n2. **How are you managing feedings?**: This question is practical and shows you're interested in their daily routine.\n3. **What's been the best part of parenthood so far?**: A positive question that encourages them to share their joys and triumphs.\n\n**Avoid Leading or Intrusive Questions**\n\n1. **Are you getting enough sleep?**: This question can come across as judgmental or critical, especially if they're not getting much sleep.\n2. **Is parenting harder than you expected?**: This question can be leading and might make them feel like they need to justify their experience.\n3. **How's your relationship changed since having Lucas?**: This question might be too personal or sensitive, especially if they're still adjusting to their new dynamic.\n\n**Active Listening**\n\n1. **Maintain eye contact**: Show you're engaged and interested in their response.\n2. **Nod and acknowledge**: Use nonverbal cues to show you're listening and understanding.\n3. **Follow up with empathy**: Respond with understanding and empathy, rather than offering unsolicited advice.\n\n**Respect Boundaries**\n\n1. **Don't push for details**: If they seem hesitant or uncomfortable sharing certain information, respect their boundaries and move on.\n2. **Avoid giving unsolicited advice**: Unless they specifically ask for your opinion or advice, refrain from offering it. They may have already received plenty of advice from others.\n3. **Don't compare**: Refrain from sharing your own parenting experiences or comparisons, which can come across as insensitive or one-upping.\n\nBy asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and actively listening to their responses, you'll show your brother and sister-in-law that you care about their experience and are interested in supporting them on their new parenthood journey.",
