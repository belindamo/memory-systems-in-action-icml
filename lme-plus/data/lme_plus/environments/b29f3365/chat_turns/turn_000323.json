  "content": "The pandemic has had a significant impact on Bulgaria's education system, forcing schools and universities to close for extended periods and resulting in a shift to remote learning. According to data from the Ministry of Education and Science, over 1 million Bulgarian students were impacted by the disruptions to the education system.\n\nThe shift to online learning has highlighted pre-existing issues with access to technology and internet connectivity, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The closure of schools has also had a significant impact on parents, many of whom have had to juggle working from home with caring for their children and supervising their education.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Bulgarian government has introduced several measures, including investment in online learning resources, the provision of laptops and tablets to disadvantaged students, and the introduction of measures to support parents, such as an extended period of paid parental leave.\n\nIn addition, the government has taken steps to promote a safe return to in-person learning, with measures such as the introduction of temperature checks in schools, mandatory wearing of masks, and the use of physical barriers in classrooms.\n\nDespite these measures, the pandemic has had a lasting impact on Bulgaria's education system, with concerns about learning loss and long-term impacts on the education and career prospects of students.",
