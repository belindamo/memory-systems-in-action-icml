Bending strings and playing with feeling are essential skills for blues playing, and it's great that you're working on those areas.\n\nFor blues, you'll often want strings that can provide a warm, rich tone with a good balance of brightness and sustain. Here are some string recommendations that might help you achieve that bluesy tone:\n\n1. **Ernie Ball Blues Slinky** (0.010 - 0.046): These strings are designed specifically for blues players, with a slightly heavier gauge to provide a fuller tone.\n2. **D'Addario NYXL1046** (0.010 - 0.046): These strings have a warm, balanced tone with a bit of brightness, making them suitable for blues and rock playing.\n3. **Gibson Vintage Reissue** (0.010 - 0.046): These strings are designed to replicate the tone of vintage Gibson guitars, with a warm, balanced sound that's perfect for blues and classic rock.\n\nWhen it comes to string gauge, you might want to experiment with a slightly heavier gauge (0.011 - 0.050 or 0.012 - 0.052) to get a fuller, more robust tone. However, if you're not used to playing with heavier strings, you might want to start with a lighter gauge and gradually work your way up to avoid fatigue.\n\nIn terms of playing with more feeling, it's great that you're focusing on bending strings and playing with emotion. Here are a few additional tips to help you take your blues playing to the next level:\n\n* **Experiment with different vibrato techniques**: Try using your wrist, arm, and finger to create subtle vibrato effects that add depth to your playing.\n* **Focus on phrasing**: Listen to blues legends like B.B. King, Albert King, and Eric Clapton, and study their phrasing and note choice. Try to incorporate more space and tension into your playing.\n* **Play with dynamics**: Blues is all about contrast, so make sure to vary your volume and intensity to create a more dynamic sound.\n\nRemember, the key to getting a great blues tone is to experiment and find what works best for you. Try out different strings, amps, and playing techniques until you find the sound that inspires you to play with feeling!",
