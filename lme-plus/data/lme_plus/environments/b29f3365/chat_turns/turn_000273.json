  "content": "**Data Ingestion:**\n\nLoading customer purchase data into a pandas dataframe can be a relatively straightforward task, especially if you have experience working with pandas. I assigned 3 Story Points to this task because it may require some effort to:\n\n1. Connect to the data source (e.g., CSV file, database, API)\n2. Handle any data formatting issues (e.g., inconsistent date formats, missing values)\n3. Perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing (e.g., converting data types, removing duplicates)\n\nHowever, if you're familiar with pandas and the data is well-structured, you might be able to complete this task quickly. In that case, you could reduce the Story Points to 1 or 2.\n\n**Data Visualization Libraries:**\n\nFor data visualization, you have several excellent options in Python. Here are a few popular ones:\n\n1. **Matplotlib**: A widely used, versatile, and customizable library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.\n2. **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.\n3. **Plotly**: A popular library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations, including 3D plots, maps, and more.\n4. **Bokeh**: Another interactive visualization library that provides a high-level interface for creating web-based plots, dashboards, and data applications.\n5. **Altair**: A relatively new library that provides a simple, grammar-based API for creating interactive, web-based visualizations.\n\nAll of these libraries have their strengths and weaknesses. If you're new to data visualization, you might want to start with Matplotlib or Seaborn, as they have a large community and extensive documentation.\n\nFor your project, I recommend using Plotly or Bokeh, as they provide interactive visualizations that can enhance the user experience.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* When choosing a data visualization library, consider the type of visualizations you want to create, the level of interactivity you need, and the ease of use.\n* If you're new to data visualization, start with a simpler library like Matplotlib or Seaborn and then move to more advanced libraries like Plotly or Bokeh.\n* Don't forget to explore the documentation and examples for each library to get a feel for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nHow do you feel about the data ingestion task now? Do you have any preferences for a data visualization library, or would you like me to suggest some resources to help you get started?",
