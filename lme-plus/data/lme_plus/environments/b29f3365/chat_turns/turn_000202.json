Oh, and I almost forgot - I finally got around to cleaning out the garage last weekend, and I found that old bike I've been missing for months. It's now parked in the living room, waiting for me to take it in for a tune-up so I can start riding it to work again. I'm hoping to get that done this weekend. Anyway, back to the living room - I've been feeling really uninspired by our current layout, and I think it's time for a change. I've been pinning some ideas on Pinterest, and I'd love to get some professional input to turn our space into a cozy oasis. Can you give me some general advice on how to create a cozy atmosphere in a living room?",
