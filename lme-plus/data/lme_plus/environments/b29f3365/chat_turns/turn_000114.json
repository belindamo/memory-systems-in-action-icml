Proceeds will go towards supporting a local food pantry. They're looking for volunteers to help with setup, judging, and cleanup.\n2. **Taste of the Community**: A community organization is hosting a food festival on May 5th, featuring dishes from local restaurants and food vendors. The event will raise funds for a local food bank and soup kitchen. They need volunteers to help with event setup, food vendor management, and ticket sales.\n3. **Soup Kitchen Volunteer Day**: A local soup kitchen is hosting a volunteer day on April 21st, where volunteers can help prepare and serve meals to those in need.
