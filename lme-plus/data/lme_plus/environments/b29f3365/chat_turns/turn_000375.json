  "content": "Thank you for providing more information!\n\nBased on what you've shared, here are a few potential causes for the yellowing leaves on your indeterminate tomato plants:\n\n1. **Overwatering**: 2 liters of water every other day might be too much for your plants, especially if the soil is not draining well. This can cause waterlogged soil, which can lead to root rot and yellowing leaves. Consider reducing the frequency or amount of water you're giving your plants.\n2. **Nutrient deficiency**: Although you've been using compost, it's possible that your soil may be lacking in specific nutrients. Compost provides a broad spectrum of nutrients, but it may not be enough to support the rapid growth of indeterminate tomatoes. Consider getting a soil test to determine if your soil lacks any essential nutrients.\n3. **Root bound**: Since your plants are 2 months old, they may have outgrown their containers and need more room to expand their roots. This can cause yellowing leaves, especially on the lower part of the plant. Consider transplanting them into larger containers or directly into the ground.\n4. **Early blight**: This fungal disease is common in tomatoes and can cause yellowing leaves, especially on the lower part of the plant. It's often accompanied by black spots or patches on the leaves. Inspect your plants carefully for any signs of fungal diseases.\n\nTo address the issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Reduce watering**: Cut back on watering to once every 3-4 days, and make sure the top 2-3 inches of soil feel dry before watering again.\n2. **Add a balanced fertilizer**: Consider adding a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) to provide your plants with a boost of nutrients. You can also side-dress with a high-phosphorus fertilizer (e.g., 10-20-10 NPK) to promote root growth and fruiting.\n3. **Transplant into larger containers**: If you suspect root bound, consider transplanting your plants into larger containers (at least 5-gallon) with fresh, well-draining soil.\n4. **Monitor for diseases**: Keep an eye out for any signs of fungal diseases, and remove any infected leaves or stems to prevent the disease from spreading.\n5. **Provide support**: Since your plants are indeterminate, they'll need support as they grow. Provide a trellis or cage to help them grow upright and promote better air circulation.\n\nKeep in mind that yellowing leaves can be a natural process as the plant ages, especially on the lower part of the plant. However, if the problem persists or spreads, it's essential to address the underlying issue to prevent further damage.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
