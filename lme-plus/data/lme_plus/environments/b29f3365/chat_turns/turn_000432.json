  "content": "I'm looking for some music recommendations. I've been listening to a lot of indie rock and electronic lately, and I recently got into Tame Impala's album \"Slow Rush\". I've been attending a bunch of live music events too, like a jazz concert at a local venue - the saxophonist was amazing, and I even bought his album after the show. What are some similar artists or albums you'd suggest I check out?",
