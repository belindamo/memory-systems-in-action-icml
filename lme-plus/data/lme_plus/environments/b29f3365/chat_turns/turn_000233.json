Here are a few ideas to consider:\n\n1. **Blanket Reveal Box**: Create a beautiful box or basket with a lid, and place the blanket inside. Decorate the box with blue and white ribbons, flowers, or other embellishments that match the party theme. When it's time to present the gift, open the box and reveal the blanket to your friends.\n2. **Special Delivery**: Wrap the blanket in a small, adorable package with a tag that says \"Special Delivery\" or \"Baby Boy [Name]'s First Gift.\" You could even add a tiny onesie or baby toy to the package to make it feel like a special delivery.\n3. **Blanket Unfolding Ceremony**: Gather everyone around and hold the blanket folded up. Explain the significance of the gift and why you chose it, then slowly unfold the blanket to reveal the baby's name and the beautiful embroidery.\n4. **Memory Lane**: Create a small, sentimental display with photos of your friends' journey to adoption, leading up to the arrival of their baby boy. Place the blanket at the end of the display, with a final photo of the baby or a card with the baby's name. This will make the gift feel like a culmination of their journey.\n5. **Special Reading**: Prepare a heartfelt poem or reading to share with your friends, and present the blanket as a symbol of love and support during this special moment. You could read a poem about adoption, love, or the importance of friendship.\n6. **Baby Blanket Blessing**: Host a small blessing or dedication ceremony for the baby, and present the blanket as a symbol of love and protection. You could invite a spiritual leader or a close friend to lead the ceremony.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to come from a place of love and thoughtfulness. Your friends will appreciate the effort you put into making this moment special, and the blanket will become a treasured keepsake for years to come.",
