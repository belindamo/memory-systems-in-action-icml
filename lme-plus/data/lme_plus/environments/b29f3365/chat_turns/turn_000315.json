  "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on Bulgaria's economy and role in the EU. The country's GDP is expected to contract by 4.6% in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, while unemployment rates are likely to increase. The crisis has also highlighted pre-existing weaknesses in the Bulgarian healthcare system and social safety net.\n\nBulgaria has taken a number of measures to address the impact of the pandemic on its economy. The government has introduced fiscal measures to support businesses and households, such as loan guarantees and reduced taxes. It has also increased public spending on healthcare and social support programs.\n\nIn terms of its role in the EU, Bulgaria has been limited in its ability to contribute to the wider European response to the pandemic due to its relatively weak economy and healthcare system. However, the country has participated in joint procurement schemes for medical supplies and has benefitted from EU-funded programs to support businesses and workers.\n\nOverall, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges for Bulgaria's economy and healthcare system, but the government has taken steps to mitigate the impact of the crisis and maintain its position within the EU.",
