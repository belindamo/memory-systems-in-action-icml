  "content": "The pandemic has had a major impact on Bulgaria's tourism industry. In 2019, the sector accounted for around 13% of the country's GDP, but the pandemic has led to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals and revenue. According to the Bulgarian Ministry of Tourism, the number of foreign tourists visiting Bulgaria dropped by more than 70% between January and August 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.\n\nTo address the crisis, the Bulgarian government has introduced a range of measures to support the tourism sector. These measures include financial assistance for hotels and tour operators, tax relief, and the creation of a tourism voucher scheme, which provided subsidies for domestic tourism.\n\nAdditionally, the government has introduced measures to promote health and safety in the sector, such as mandatory mask-wearing in hotels and other tourist facilities. Bulgaria has also introduced a \"Safe Tourism\" certification scheme, which aims to reassure visitors that the country's tourism sector is taking appropriate health and safety measures.\n\nDespite these measures, the recovery of Bulgaria's tourism industry is likely to be a slow process, with experts predicting that it may take several years for the sector to return to pre-pandemic levels.",
