  "content": "Avengers Campus is an amazing addition to Disney California Adventure Park! Web-Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure is a super popular ride, and I'm happy to help you minimize your wait time.\n\n**Virtual Queue:**\nDuring peak periods, Web-Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure might offer a Virtual Queue system. This allows you to reserve a spot in line using the official Disneyland app, and then return to the ride at a designated time. Keep an eye on the app for availability, as Virtual Queue slots can fill up quickly.\n\n**Genie+ and Lightning Lane:**\nDisneyland offers a paid service called Genie+, which includes access to the Lightning Lane for Web-Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure. This can significantly reduce your wait time, but it does come at an additional cost. You can purchase Genie+ through the Disneyland app or at the park.\n\n**Early Morning or Late Evening:**\nConsider visiting Web-Slingers during early morning or late evening hours when the park is less crowded. You might find shorter wait times during these periods, but be prepared for potential closures due to technical issues or inclement weather.\n\n**Character Meet and Greet:**\nIf you're not as concerned about riding Web-Slingers immediately, you can take advantage of the Spider-Man character meet and greet nearby. This can be a great way to get a photo opportunity with Spidey while you wait for the ride's wait time to decrease.\n\n**Dining Package:**\nKeep an eye out for special dining packages that might include priority access to Web-Slingers. These packages are usually available at select restaurants within Avengers Campus or nearby.\n\nRemember to stay flexible and be prepared for changes in wait times or ride availability. Have a fantastic time exploring Avengers Campus and Web-Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure!",
