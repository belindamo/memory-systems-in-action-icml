I'd be happy to help you find a solution to declutter your wallet and make it more compact.\n\nBefore we dive into specific recommendations, here are a few questions to consider:\n\n1. **What's your preferred wallet style?** Do you like a traditional bifold or trifold wallet, or are you open to a card holder or minimalist wallet?\n2. **How many cards do you carry?** Besides your new credit card, how many other cards do you need to carry regularly (e.g., debit card, ID, loyalty cards)?\n3. **Do you carry cash?** If so, do you need a wallet with a cash compartment or are you okay with a card-only wallet?\n4. **What's your budget?** Are you looking to spend under $20, $50, or are you open to investing in a higher-end wallet?\n\nBased on your requirements, here are some popular wallet organizer options:\n\n1. **Slim wallets:** These are designed to hold a few essential cards and are very compact. Some popular options include the Bellroy Slim Sleeve, Fossil Grant, or the CardNinja.\n2. **Card holders:** These wallets focus on holding multiple cards without a cash compartment. The Ridge Wallet, Ekster Wallet, or the Travelambo Wallet are great examples.\n3. **Bifold or trifold wallets with organizers:** These wallets have separate compartments to keep your cards and cash organized. The Levi's Bifold Wallet, The North Face Bifold Wallet, or the Fjallraven Kanken Wallet are popular choices.\n4. **Minimalist wallets:** These wallets are designed to carry only the essentials. The Raden A50, the SlimSingles Wallet, or the TGT Wallet are great options.\n\nIf you're looking for a more specific recommendation, please let me know your answers to the questions above, and I'd be happy to suggest a few options tailored to your needs!",
