Here are some simple recipes to get you started:\n\n**Kibbeh Recipe (Syrian-Style)**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pound ground meat (beef, lamb, or a combination of both)\n* 1/2 cup bulgur (#1 fine or medium grind)\n* 1 onion, finely chopped\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n* 1/4 teaspoon allspice\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, bulgur, onion, salt, pepper, cinnamon, and allspice. Mix well with your hands or a wooden spoon until just combined.\n2. Cover the mixture and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the bulgur to absorb the flavors.\n3. Wet your hands with cold water and shape the mixture into small oval-shaped kibbeh. You should end up with around 12-15 pieces.\n4. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add a few kibbeh and cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side, until they're browned and crispy.\n5. Serve hot with a side of yogurt, salad, or rice.\n\n**Dolma Recipe (Stuffed Grape Leaves)**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 20-25 grape leaves (fresh or jarred)\n* 1 pound ground meat (beef, lamb, or a combination of both)\n* 1 cup cooked rice\n* 1 onion, finely chopped\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n* 1/4 teaspoon allspice\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* Lemon wedges, for serving\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Start by preparing the grape leaves. If using fresh leaves, blanch them in boiling water for 30 seconds to remove bitterness. If using jarred leaves, rinse them with water and drain well.\n2. In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, cooked rice, onion, salt, pepper, cinnamon, and allspice. Mix well with your hands or a wooden spoon until just combined.\n3. Lay a grape leaf flat on a work surface, with the stem end facing you. Place about 1 tablespoon of the meat mixture in the center of the leaf.\n4. Fold the stem end over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll the leaf into a neat package. Repeat with the remaining leaves and filling.\n5. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. When hot, add the dolma, seam-side down, in a single layer. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, until the leaves are tender and the filling is cooked through.\n6. Serve warm or at room temperature with a squeeze of lemon juice.\n\nI hope you enjoy these recipes!
