Your brother and sister-in-law will appreciate your genuine curiosity and care.\n\nHere's a gentle reminder to keep the conversation balanced and respectful:\n\n* **Listen more than you talk**: Allow them to share their story and feelings without interrupting or dominating the conversation.\n* **Avoid comparisons**: Refrain from comparing their experience to your own or someone else's. This is their unique story, and you want to respect that.\n* **Show empathy and understanding**: Respond with kindness, understanding, and support. Acknowledge any challenges or emotions they share.\n\nBy asking thoughtful questions and listening actively, you'll create a warm and supportive conversation that shows you care about their experience as new parents. Enjoy your time with your brother, sister-in-law, and little Lucas!",
