I just wanted to ask, have you thought about sharing a little story or anecdote about your nephew Ethan when you present the gift? You could mention how you saw him recently and how tiny he was, weighing 7 pounds, and how it reminded you of the importance of celebrating new life and love. It might make the moment even more personal and special for your friends.",
