  "content": "In the dream, Jacob stumbled through the sea of spirits, searching for Eri and Racita. He finally spotted them near the front of the room, their attention focused on the heated discussion happening in front of them. As he made his way towards them, they noticed him and their expressions changed to one of alarm.\n\nEri spoke first, her voice carrying an edge of worry. \"Jacob, what are you doing here?\"\n\nJacob tried to answer, but the sheer power of all the spirits was too much for him. He felt as though his mind was about to shut down from the overload of energy. He struggled to form words.\n\nRacita stepped forward, her eyes filled with concern. \"Are you okay, Jacob? This is not a place for humans, you need to leave.\"\n\nJacob managed to force out a few words. \"What's going on? What's happening here?\"\n\nEri exchanged a look with Racita before answering. \"This is a council meeting of the spirits. There's a lot of tension in the air, we're discussing some serious matters.\"\n\nJacob felt a wave of fear wash over him as he realized the importance of what was happening in this room. He tried to focus, tried to make sense of what was being discussed, but it was all a blur.\n\nRacita placed a hand on Jacob's shoulder, her voice gentle but firm. \"You need to go, Jacob. This is not a safe place for you right now. We'll explain everything when you wake up.\"\n\nAnd with that, Jacob woke up, back in his own bed, sweating and shaking from the intense dream.",
