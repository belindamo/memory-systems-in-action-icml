Shake them up and watch Lucas track the movements and colors.\n3. **Texture Play**: Offer different textures like soft toys, velvet, or sandpaper for Lucas to touch and explore.\n\n**Visual Games**\n\n1. **Peek-a-Boo**: Cover your face with your hands and suddenly reveal yourself with a big smile. This classic game encourages object permanence and social interaction.\n2. **Baby Mirror**: Hold a mirror in front of Lucas, and watch him discover his own reflection.\n3. **Toy Tracking**: Move a toy slowly in front of Lucas, encouraging him to follow it with his eyes.\n\n**Auditory Fun**\n\n1. **Music and Movement**: Play calming music and gently sway or bounce Lucas to the rhythm.\n2. **Sound Exploration**: Introduce different sounds, like rattles, squeaky toys, or a music instrument, to stimulate his auditory development.\n3. **Story Time**: Read a board book or a cloth book with simple, contrasting images and engaging textures.\n\n**Interactive Play**\n\n1. **Face-to-Face Chat**: Hold Lucas upright and engage in a \"conversation\" using cooing sounds, facial expressions, and gestures.\n2. **Baby Massage**: Gently massage Lucas's arms, legs, and back using gentle strokes and pressures.\n3. **Toy Hand-Transfer**: Place a toy in Lucas's hand and help him transfer it to the other hand, promoting hand-eye coordination.\n\n**Tips and Reminders**\n\n* Always ensure Lucas's safety and comfort during playtime.\n* Be mindful of his cues, such as fussing or looking away, which may indicate it's time for a break.\n* Keep play sessions short and frequent, as newborns have short attention spans.\n* Make sure to wash your hands before handling Lucas and his toys.\n* If you're unsure about any aspect of play or Lucas's development, consult with his parents or a healthcare professional.\n\nRemember to have fun and be present in the moment! Your interaction with Lucas will create lasting memories and help strengthen your bond."

I want to ask them when Lucas was born, but I don't want to make it the main focus of the conversation. Maybe I can casually mention the baby shower I attended a few weeks before Lucas was born, and then ask them about his birth."

      "content": "What a great approach! Asking about Lucas's birth story can be a wonderful way to show your interest and care for their experience. By mentioning the baby shower, you're creating a natural segue to ask about the birth. Here's a suggestion on how you can phrase your question:\n\n\"Hey, I was just thinking about the baby shower we had a few weeks ago, and I'm still so excited for you both. How did everything go with the birth? Was it what you expected?\"\n\nBy framing the question this way, you're:\n\n1. **Showing you care**: You're demonstrating that you're invested in their experience and interested in hearing about this significant event.\n2. **Creating a natural segue**: Mentioning the baby shower provides a natural transition to asking about the birth, making the question feel more organic.\n3. **Keeping it casual**: By asking \"How did everything go?\" you're keeping the tone light and conversational, rather than making it a formal or prying question.\n\nThis approach also allows your brother and sister-in-law to share as much or as little as they'd like about the birth experience. They might share a brief summary, or they might open up and share more details. Either way, you're showing that you care and are interested in their story.\n\nRemember to **listen actively** and respond with empathy and interest. This will help create a supportive and engaging conversation."
