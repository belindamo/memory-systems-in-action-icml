      "content": "Idea 1: \"Blossom in Unity\"\nThe art installation could be a giant cherry blossom tree made out of recyclable materials that attendees can help build by contributing their own handcrafted cherry blossoms made from recycled paper. Each blossom could have a unique QR code that attendees can scan to access an interactive digital experience on their phones, allowing them to virtually plant their blossoms on the tree and see it come to life in augmented reality.\n\nIdea 2: \"Rooted in Tradition\"\nThe art installation could be a large-scale digital mandala, featuring traditional Chinese symbols and patterns. Attendees could participate by coloring in printed mandalas with traditional Chinese art materials, such as ink and watercolor. These colored mandalas could then be scanned and digitized, allowing them to be projected onto the larger digital mandala in real-time, creating a collaborative and interactive artwork.\n\nIdea 3: \"Waves of Unity\"\nThe art installation could be an interactive wall made up of hundreds of recycled plastic bottles, arranged to create a wave-like effect. Attendees could write their hopes and dreams for the future on recycled paper, then crumple them up and throw them into the wave, where they would be captured by sensors and displayed on an interactive screen. Attendees could then use the screen to digitally connect their hopes and dreams with others, creating a shared vision for the future.\n\nIdea 4: \"Our Singapore Story\"\nThe art installation could be a large-scale digital projection mapping that tells the story of Singapore's history and cultural diversity. Attendees could participate by drawing their own portrait or an image that represents their own cultural background on paper, which could be scanned and incorporated into the projection mapping, creating a diverse and collaborative digital artwork.\n\nIdea 5: \"Community Connections\"\nThe art installation could be a physical puzzle made up of hundreds of interlocking pieces, each one featuring a unique design created by a local artist. Attendees could contribute to the puzzle by designing and coloring their own puzzle pieces using traditional Chinese art materials. Once the puzzle is complete, it could be scanned and turned into an interactive digital puzzle that attendees can solve together, creating a sense of community and connection."
