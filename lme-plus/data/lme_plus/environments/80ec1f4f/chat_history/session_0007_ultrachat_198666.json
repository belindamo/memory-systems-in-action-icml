The virtual reality version of the festival allowed fans to experience the event in a 360-degree immersive environment.\n\nAnother example is the American DJ and producer, Marshmello, who performed a virtual reality concert in Fortnite, a popular online video game, with an estimated 10 million viewers taking part in the event.\n\nLastly, the Icelandic singer Bj\u00f6rk used virtual reality technology to create the music video for her 2015 single \"Stonemilker.\" The video allowed viewers to experience the song in a 360-degree environment on a virtual beach in Iceland. \n\nSuch examples are just some of the ways in which musicians are incorporating virtual reality into their performances to provide their fans with a unique and immersive experience."
