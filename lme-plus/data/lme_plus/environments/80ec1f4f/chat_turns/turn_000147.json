  "content": "That's a great overview of the Canon 7, 7s, and QL17 models. I'm particularly interested in the QL17, as it seems like a more convenient and modern design compared to the earlier models. Can you tell me more about the Quick Load film loading system and how it works? Also, do you know if the QL17 has any specific lens compatibility issues or requirements that I should be aware of?",
