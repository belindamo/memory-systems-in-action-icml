Here's how it works:\n\n**How RescueTime tracks websites and apps:**\n\n1. **Automatic tracking**: RescueTime tracks your activity on websites and apps in the background, without requiring you to manually log your time or switch between different modes.\n2. **Categorization**: RescueTime categorizes your activities into different productivity levels, including:\n\t* **Productive**: Time spent on work-related tasks, such as email, project management, or word processing.\n\t* **Neutral**: Time spent on activities that are neither productive nor distracting, such as reading news or browsing educational websites.\n\t* **Distracting**: Time spent on social media, entertainment, or other leisure activities that can distract you from work.\n3. **Customizable categorization**: You can customize the categorization of specific websites and apps to fit your needs. For example, you might categorize a particular social media platform as \"Productive\" if you use it for work-related activities.\n4. **Time allocation**: RescueTime provides a detailed breakdown of how much time you spend on each website, app, or activity, including the total time, percentage of time, and number of visits.\n\n**Insights you can expect to gain:**\n\n1. **Time waste identification**: RescueTime helps you identify time-wasting activities, such as excessive social media usage or procrastination, so you can optimize your time better.\n2. **Productivity optimization**: By tracking your productive time, you can identify the most effective times of the day for focused work and schedule your tasks accordingly.\n3. **Goal alignment**: RescueTime helps you align your time allocation with your goals and priorities, ensuring you're spending time on activities that matter most.\n4. **Distraction management**: With RescueTime, you can set alerts and notifications to help you stay focused and avoid distracting websites or apps during certain times of the day.\n5. **Time estimation**: RescueTime's data helps you estimate the time required for specific tasks or projects, enabling you to create more realistic schedules and deadlines.\n6. **Personalized recommendations**: RescueTime provides personalized recommendations for improving your time management, such as suggesting more productive alternatives to distracting activities.\n\n**Example insights:**\n\n* You might discover that you spend an average of 30 minutes per day on social media, which could be better spent on focused work.\n* You might find that you're most productive during the morning hours, and adjust your schedule to tackle important tasks during that time.\n* You might identify a particular website or app that's distracting you from your goals and set a goal to limit your time on it.\n\nBy gaining insights into your website and app usage, you'll be able to optimize your time, increase productivity, and make more informed decisions about how you spend your time.",
