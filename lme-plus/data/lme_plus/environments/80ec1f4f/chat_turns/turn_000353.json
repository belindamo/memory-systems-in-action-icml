  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location, so I can't suggest specific local art museums or galleries. But I can give you some general advice on how to find them!\n\nYou can try searching online for \"art museums near me\" or \"art galleries near me\" along with your city or zip code to find institutions in your area. You can also check websites like Google Arts & Culture, Museum Association, or the National Endowment for the Arts to find museums and galleries in your region.\n\nAdditionally, you can also search for online platforms or websites that offer virtual art classes or workshops, such as:\n\n* Skillshare: Offers a wide range of online art classes and workshops.\n* Craftsy: Provides online classes and tutorials on various art topics, including painting, drawing, and mixed media.\n* Artists Network: Offers online classes, workshops, and tutorials on various art subjects.\n* Drawabox: A free online drawing course with a comprehensive curriculum.\n\nIt's great to hear that you got back into art after attending a guided workshop at the Modern Art Museum! Sometimes, all it takes is a little spark to reignite our passion for creativity. Keep exploring, and I hope you find some amazing resources to fuel your artistic journey!\n\nRemember, you can also try reaching out to local art schools, community centers, or colleges to see if they offer art classes or workshops. Many institutions offer classes for beginners, and it's a great way to meet like-minded people and learn from experienced artists.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find the inspiration you're looking for!",
