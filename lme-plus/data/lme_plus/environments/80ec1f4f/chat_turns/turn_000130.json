  "content": "The weekends tend to be more crowded than weekdays, so if you'd like to avoid crowds during your visit to the National Waterfront Museum, I would recommend visiting on a weekday. However, keep in mind that the museum may have slightly different operating hours during the week, so it's always worth checking with the museum's website or calling ahead to confirm their schedule. Additionally, you can try visiting the museum during off-peak hours, such as the early morning or late afternoon when most visitors have already left or not arrived yet.",
