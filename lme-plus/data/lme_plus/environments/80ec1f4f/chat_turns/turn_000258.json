I have a lot of photos from my childhood and teenage years that I'd like to include, so I'll start with those and then move on to more recent events and activities. Within each section, I can group similar photos together, like vacations or holidays. That way, I can tell a story of our family's history while also highlighting specific memories and traditions.\n\nBy the way, speaking of recent events, I just remembered that I have some photos from a project I finished a month ago that I'd like to share with my family. It was a really busy Sunday, but I managed to get everything done, and it felt great to have that weight off my shoulders. Do you think I should include those photos in the album, or would they be out of place?",
