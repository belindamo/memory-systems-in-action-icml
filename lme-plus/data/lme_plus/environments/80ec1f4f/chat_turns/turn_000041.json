These types of items are often a hit with children, and parents are often willing to pay a premium for unique and Instagram-worthy treats.\n\nHere are a few reasons why specialty items could be a good fit for your charity bake sale:\n\n1. **Kid-appeal**: Decorated sugar cookies and cake pops are often designed to be visually appealing, making them a great choice for kids. Kids love the colorful decorations and fun shapes, and parents will appreciate the effort you've put into creating something special.\n2. **Special occasion**: Families with kids often have birthday parties, holidays, or other celebrations throughout the year. Your specialty items can be marketed as a special treat for these occasions, making them a worthwhile splurge for parents.\n3. **Premium pricing**: Since these items require more time, effort, and skill to create, you can charge a premium price for them.
