Start with light weights: When starting a new exercise, start with light weights and work your way up gradually. This will allow your body to adapt and help prevent injury. 2. Find a neutral spine: Make sure your spine is in a neutral position for exercises like squats, deadlifts, and rows. This means your spine should be straight with a natural arch in your lower back, and your shoulders should be pulled back and down. 3. Focus on your breathing: When lifting weights, focus on your breathing. Inhale before the lift, and exhale during the lift. This helps stabilize your core and maintain proper form. 4. Engage your core: Engaging your core muscles during exercises can help stabilize your body and prevent injury. Imagine pulling your belly button towards your spine and keeping your core tight throughout the exercise. 5. Keep your joints aligned: When performing exercises like lunges or squats, make sure your knees are aligned with your toes. This will help prevent knee injuries. 6. Use proper grip and stance: Use a grip and stance that is comfortable and allows you to maintain proper form. For example, when doing pull-ups, use an overhand grip with your hands shoulder-width apart and pull your body up towards the bar. Remember, it's important to focus on quality over quantity. Using proper form will not only help prevent injury, but it will also ensure that you are getting the most out of your workout.",
