You'll receive exclusive discounts, early access to sales, and rewards points that can be redeemed for cash or discounts.\n3. **Use cashback and rewards credit cards**: If you're responsible with credit, consider using a cashback or rewards credit card for your online purchases. This can earn you additional rewards points or cashback on your purchases.\n4. **Take advantage of price comparison tools**: Websites like PriceGrabber, Nextag, or Google Shopping allow you to compare prices across different online stores. You can also use browser extensions like Honey or CamelCamelCamel to find the best deals.\n5. **Look for coupon codes and promo codes**: Check websites like RetailMeNot, Coupons.com, or CouponCabin for valid coupon codes and promo codes that can be applied at checkout.\n6. **Shop during off-peak hours**: Avoid shopping during peak hours (e.g., lunch breaks or weekends) when prices might be higher. Instead, shop during off-peak hours when prices might be lower.\n7. **Use browser extensions**: Browser extensions like PriceBlink, Coupons at Checkout, or ShopMania can alert you to potential savings, provide coupon codes, or offer price comparisons.\n8. **Consider alternative shopping platforms**: Explore alternative shopping platforms like eBay, Rakuten, or AliExpress, which may offer competitive prices or unique products.\n9. **Read reviews and check seller ratings**: Always read reviews from other customers and check the seller's ratings before making a purchase.
