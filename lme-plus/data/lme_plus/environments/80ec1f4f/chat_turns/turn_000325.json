Start with a warm-up: Before you start stretching, do a short warm-up to increase your heart rate and blood flow. This can include walking, jogging in place or dynamic stretching.\n\n2. Hold stretches for 15-30 seconds: When you stretch, aim to hold the stretch for at least 15-30 seconds. This will increase your flexibility and reduce the risk of injury.\n\n3. Focus on major muscle groups: Concentrate on the major muscle groups in your body such as your legs, back, chest, hips, and shoulders.\n\n4. Don't bounce: Avoid bouncing when you stretch. This can cause injury and damage to your muscles.\n\n5. Don't overstretch: Overstretching can be just as bad as not stretching at all. Only go as far as you feel comfortable and never push your body beyond its limit.\n\n6. Stretch after exercising: Once you've finished exercising, stretch again to help cool down your muscles and reduce the risk of injury.",
