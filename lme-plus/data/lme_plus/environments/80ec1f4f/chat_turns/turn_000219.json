  "content": "That's a great idea! Sending a message and catching up is a low-key way to reconnect with Mike, and asking about his conference is a thoughtful way to show you're interested in his life.\n\nHere's a sample message to get you started:\n\n\"Hey Mike, long time no talk! I saw on social media that you were in town last weekend for a conference. How did it go? What were some of the highlights? And how have you been doing lately? I've been thinking about old times and wanted to reach out. Let me know if you're free to catch up soon.\"\n\nThis message:\n\n* Reaches out and breaks the ice\n* Shows interest in Mike's recent activity (the conference)\n* Asks about his well-being\n* Mentions your shared past and expresses a desire to reconnect\n* Ends with a casual, low-pressure invitation to catch up\n\nFeel free to modify it to fit your tone and style, and don't hesitate to add or remove details as you see fit.\n\nRemember to keep your message concise, friendly, and non-intrusive. You want to reestablish a connection, not overwhelm Mike with too much information or pressure him into meeting up right away.\n\nOnce you've sent the message, be patient and give Mike time to respond. He might be busy or need some time to think about how to respond, so don't worry if you don't hear back right away.",
