I'd be happy to provide you with some statistics on the current state of gender representation in TV and movies.\n\n**TV Representation:**\n\n1. **Female characters:** According to a 2020 report by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, women accounted for only 42% of all speaking characters on TV, while men made up 58%.\n2. **Leading roles:** In the same report, it was found that women held only 34% of lead roles in TV shows, while men held 66%.\n3. **Behind the camera:** Women made up only 28% of creators, writers, directors, producers, and editors in TV, while men held 72% of these positions.\n\n**Movie Representation:**\n\n1. **Female characters:** A 2020 report by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that, out of 100 top-grossing films, women accounted for only 34.6% of all speaking characters.\n2. **Leading roles:** In the same report, it was found that women held only 22.5% of lead roles in movies, while men held 77.5%.\n3. **Behind the camera:** Women made up only 20.5% of directors, writers, and producers in the 100 top-grossing films, while men held 79.5% of these positions.\n\n**Other noteworthy statistics:**\n\n1. **Racial and ethnic diversity:** A 2020 report by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that, out of 100 top-grossing films, only 12.5% of female characters were women of color, while 21.8% of male characters were men of color.\n2. **LGBTQ+ representation:** A 2020 report by GLAAD found that, out of 118 films released by major studios, only 18.6% included LGBTQ+ characters.\n3. **Aging and disability:** A 2020 report by the Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative found that, out of 100 top-grossing films, only 2.5% of characters were older adults (65+), and only 2.3% had disabilities.\n\n**The impact:**\n\nThese statistics have significant implications for how we perceive gender roles and stereotypes. The underrepresentation of women, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and individuals with disabilities in media can:\n\n1. Reinforce harmful stereotypes and biases\n2. Limit career opportunities and perpetuate inequality\n3. Influence children's and adults' self-perception and aspirations\n4. Contribute to a lack of diversity in the industry, perpetuating a cycle of underrepresentation\n\nHowever, there are efforts underway to improve representation and diversity in media. Many organizations, studios, and creators are actively working to increase representation, challenge stereotypes, and promote inclusivity.\n\nI hope these statistics provide a useful starting point for your exploration of the impact of media on gender roles and stereotypes!",
