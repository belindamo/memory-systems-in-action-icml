  "content": "That's great to hear that you've been working on your flexibility on your own!\n\nBoth options have their benefits, and it ultimately depends on your personal preferences, goals, and learning style. Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Taking a class specifically focused on flexibility:**\n\nPros:\n\n* **Targeted focus**: A flexibility-focused class will likely dedicate more time and attention to specific stretches and exercises designed to improve flexibility, which can lead to more significant gains in a shorter amount of time.\n* **Customization**: A dedicated flexibility class may allow for more individualized attention and adjustments from the instructor, helping you target specific areas of tightness or weakness.\n* **Deeper stretches**: A flexibility class might incorporate more advanced stretches or techniques, such as active isolated stretching or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching, which can be more challenging to learn and execute on your own.\n\nCons:\n\n* **Limited dance technique**: A flexibility class might not provide as much opportunity to work on dance technique, musicality, or expression, which are essential aspects of dance training.\n* **Repetition**: You might find yourself repeating the same stretches and exercises regularly, which could become monotonous.\n\n**Incorporating flexibility exercises into a dance class like contemporary or modern:**\n\nPros:\n\n* **Holistic approach**: Dance classes like contemporary or modern often incorporate flexibility exercises and stretches as part of the overall training, which can help improve flexibility while also working on technique, musicality, and expression.\n* **Variety**: Dance classes typically involve a variety of movements, exercises, and sequences, which can help keep you engaged and motivated.\n* **Functional flexibility**: You'll be working on flexibility in a more functional way, as you'll be using your flexibility to execute dance movements and exercises.\n\nCons:\n\n* **Limited focus**: While flexibility exercises might be incorporated into the class, they might not be the primary focus, and you might not dedicate as much time to specific stretches or exercises.\n* **Less individualized attention**: In a dance class, the instructor might not be able to provide as much individualized attention to your flexibility needs, especially if the class is larger.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n* Are you looking to improve your flexibility specifically for dance purposes, or do you want to focus on overall flexibility and range of motion?\n* Do you prefer a more focused approach to flexibility training, or do you enjoy the variety and challenge of a dance class?\n* Are you willing to dedicate time to a separate flexibility class, or would you rather incorporate flexibility exercises into your existing dance training?\n\nUltimately, you could consider combining both approaches: take a flexibility-focused class occasionally to target specific areas, and incorporate flexibility exercises into your regular dance classes to maintain and improve your overall flexibility.",
