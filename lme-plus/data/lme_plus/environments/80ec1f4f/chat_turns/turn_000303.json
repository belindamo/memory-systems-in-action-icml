  "content": "The digestive system is made up of various organs that work together to break down food into nutrients and eliminate waste from the body. The major features and functions of the digestive system are as follows:\n\n1. Mouth: The mouth is the starting point of the digestive system where food is broken down into smaller pieces by chewing and mixed with saliva that contains enzymes that begin to break down carbohydrates.\n\n2. Esophagus: The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. It uses muscle contractions to move food down to the stomach.\n\n3. Stomach: The stomach secretes digestive juices containing hydrochloric acid and enzymes that break down proteins. The stomach also mixes and grinds food, turning it into a liquid, semi-solid mass called chyme.\n\n4. Small intestine: The small intestine is the primary site for the absorption of nutrients from food. It is where the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats is completed with the help of enzymes produced by the pancreas and the liver.\n\n5. Large intestine: The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes from the remaining chyme, forming solid waste, which is eventually eliminated from the body as feces.\n\nAll of these organs work together to ensure that the body is able to extract the necessary nutrients from food and eliminate waste in a timely manner. A healthy digestive system is essential for overall health and well-being as it helps the body to maintain a healthy weight, provides energy, and supports the immune system. Additionally, digestive health has been linked to mental health and overall inflammation control in the body. Adequate fiber, hydration, and a balanced diet are some of the habits that support optimal digestive system function.",
