By the way, I've had experience with charity events before - I raised $120 at the 'Mother's Day Market' charity event by selling homemade baked goods, so I'm hoping to do even better this time around. Do you have any other questions about setting up the \"decorate-your-own\" station or pricing the decorations?",
