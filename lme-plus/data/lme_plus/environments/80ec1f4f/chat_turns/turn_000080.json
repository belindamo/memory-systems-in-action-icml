I've been thinking about the importance of representation in media and advertising, and it's great to see brands taking steps to promote more diverse and inclusive representation. I've also been paying more attention to gender representation in media and advertising lately, and it's amazing how often women and non-binary individuals are underrepresented or stereotyped. Do you have any information on how brands are using data and research to better understand their audiences and create more inclusive advertising?",
