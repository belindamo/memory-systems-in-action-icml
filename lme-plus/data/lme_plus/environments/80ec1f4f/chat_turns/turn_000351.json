With the development of electric and hybrid aircraft and the aviation industry's focus on reducing carbon emissions, we can expect to see more eco-friendly options for travelers in the future.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that electric and hybrid aircraft are still in the developing stage, and it might take a few years before they are widely accessible to the general public. Moreover, their adoption will depend on various factors such as infrastructure, regulatory support, and investment in battery technology.\n\nNonetheless, the development of electric and hybrid aircraft represents a significant step towards sustainable air travel. By reducing carbon emissions, these aircraft offer a promising solution to one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.",
