Sarah's new job: Her busy schedule might be making it tough for her to commit to a regular game night.\n2. Inconsistency: The lack of a regular schedule might be causing everyone to drift apart.\n\nTo get everyone together again, here's a plan:\n\n**Step 1: Touch base with Sarah**\n\n* Reach out to Sarah and ask about her new job, how she's adjusting, and if she's free to chat about game nights.\n* Express your enthusiasm for reviving the game nights and ask if she's open to finding a solution that works for her schedule.\n\n**Step 2: Poll the group**\n\n* Create a group chat or send out a message to the entire friend group, asking about their availability and interest in restarting game nights.\n* Ask about their preferred days and times, as well as any scheduling constraints they might have.\n\n**Step 3: Find a flexible schedule**\n\n* Based on the feedback, propose a few schedule options that cater to Sarah's busy schedule and the rest of the group's availability.\n* Consider alternative formats, like bi-weekly or monthly game nights, if weekly isn't feasible.\n\n**Step 4: Choose a consistent format**\n\n* Decide on a consistent format for game nights, such as:\n\t+ A specific day and time each week/month\n\t+ A rotating host or location\n\t+ A set duration (e.g., 2-3 hours)\n\t+ A mix of board games, card games, or video games to keep things fresh\n\n**Step 5: Communicate and commit**\n\n* Share the new schedule and format with the group, and ask everyone to commit to attending as many game nights as possible.\n* Encourage everyone to communicate their availability and any changes to their schedules in advance.\n\n**Step 6: Make it happen**\n\n* Start hosting game nights according to the new schedule and format.\n* Be flexible and adapt to any changes or conflicts that arise.\n* Make sure to have a variety of games and activities to keep things engaging and fun.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get your friend group back together for regular game nights that work for everyone.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there anything you'd like to add or change about this plan?",
