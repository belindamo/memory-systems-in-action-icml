You can use a reminder app like Apple Reminders, Google Keep, or Any.do to set a recurring reminder.\n* Title the reminder something like \"Check in with Emily\" or \"Wednesday Emily Check-in\".\n* Consider adding a brief note to the reminder, such as \"Send a supportive message or make a quick call to see how she's doing with her mom's illness.\"\n\n**Rachel:**\n\n* Set a weekly reminder on your phone to confirm your lunch date with Rachel. Choose a day and time that works for you, such as every Thursday or Friday.\n* Title the reminder something like \"True Crime Lunch with Rachel\" or \"Weekly Lunch with Rachel\".\n* Add a note to the reminder, such as \"Confirm lunch plans and discuss latest podcast episodes\".\n\nTo make it even easier, you could also:\n\n* Create a separate contact or group in your phone specifically for your close friends, including Emily and Rachel. This way, you can quickly find their contact information and send them a message or make a call when you receive the reminder.\n* Consider setting a recurring event in your calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar) for your lunch date with Rachel, so you can block out the time and ensure you don't schedule conflicts.\n\nBy setting these reminders, you'll be able to regularly check in with Emily during a difficult time and maintain your fun weekly tradition with Rachel.",
