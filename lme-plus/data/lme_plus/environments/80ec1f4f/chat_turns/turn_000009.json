  "content": "**Definitely** ask about the level of the class and its suitability for someone with a ballet background.\n\nHere are some questions you could ask:\n\n1. **What is the level of the class?** Is it beginner, intermediate, advanced, or open-level? Are there any prerequisites or experience requirements?\n2. **Is the class suitable for someone with a ballet background?** Will the class build upon your existing knowledge and skills, or will it be too repetitive or too easy?\n3. **How does the class differ from a ballet class?** Will the class focus on different techniques, movements, or styles that will challenge you in new ways?\n4. **Will I be able to apply my ballet training to this class?** Are there any similarities or transferable skills between ballet and contemporary/modern dance that I can utilize?\n5. **Are there any adjustments or modifications for students with a ballet background?** Will the instructor be able to provide guidance on how to adapt your ballet technique to the contemporary/modern style?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll get a better sense of whether the class is a good fit for you and your skills. You want to make sure you're challenged enough to improve, but not so overwhelmed that you feel frustrated or lost.\n\nIt's great that you're considering your ballet background and wanting to find a class that complements your existing training. Remember, it's okay to ask questions and advocate for yourself as a student. The instructor or studio should be willing to work with you to ensure you have a positive and productive learning experience.\n\nGo ahead and ask those questions, and I hope you find a class that's just right for you!",
