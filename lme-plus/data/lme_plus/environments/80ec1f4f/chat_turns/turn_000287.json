As a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about The Art Cube or its curator, Rachel Lee, as they seem to be fictional entities. I've been trying to help you with general art-related information and resources, but I don't have any information about a specific art space or curator.\n\nIf you're interested in finding more information about art exhibitions and events in your area, I would recommend searching online for local art organizations, museums, and galleries in your city or region. You can also try searching for art event calendars or cultural event listings in your local newspaper or online event platforms.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!",
