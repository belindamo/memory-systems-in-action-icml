Here are some eco-friendly toilet paper recommendations that can help reduce your environmental footprint:\n\n**Look for these certifications:**\n\n1. **FSC Certification**: The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) ensures that the wood pulp used to make toilet paper comes from responsibly managed forests.\n2. **Recycled Content**: Opt for toilet paper with high recycled content (at least 80%) to reduce virgin wood pulp usage.\n3. **Bamboo or Sugarcane-based**: Bamboo and sugarcane are highly renewable resources that require less water and pesticides compared to traditional wood pulp.\n\n**Eco-friendly toilet paper brands:**\n\n1. **Who Gives A Crap**: This Australian brand offers toilet paper made from 100% recycled paper, with 50% of their profits going towards building toilets in developing countries.\n2. **Bambooee**: Bambooee offers toilet paper made from 100% bamboo, which is biodegradable and compostable.\n3. **Seventh Generation**: This brand offers a range of eco-friendly toilet paper products, including ones made from 100% recycled paper and bamboo.\n4. **Cascades**: Cascades offers toilet paper made from 100% recycled paper, with a minimum of 80% post-consumer waste.\n5. **GreenWorks**: GreenWorks offers toilet paper made from 100% recycled paper, with a minimum of 80% post-consumer waste.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Use a bidet**: Bidets use significantly less water than traditional toilet paper, and can be a more hygienic option.\n2. **Use a toilet paper with a lower ply count**: Single-ply or two-ply toilet paper tends to be more eco-friendly than three-ply or higher.\n3. **Buy in bulk**: Purchasing toilet paper in bulk can reduce packaging waste and save you money.\n4. **Consider cloth wipes**: Reusable cloth wipes can be a great alternative to traditional toilet paper, especially for wiping up after using the bathroom.\n\nRemember, every small change you make can add up to make a big difference for the environment!",
