You can start with a casual \"Hey, long time no talk! How's life been treating you?\"\n2. **Share a nostalgic memory**: Dig up a funny or meaningful story from your college days and share it with Mike. This can help spark conversations and remind him of the good times you shared.\n3. **Find common ground**: Think about what you both enjoyed doing in college, such as playing sports, watching movies, or attending concerts. Reach out to Mike and suggest doing something similar, like watching a game together or attending a concert.\n4. **Use social media**: If you're connected with Mike on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, start engaging with his posts or sharing content that might interest him. This can help you rebuild a connection and create a natural conversation starter.\n5. **Plan a meetup**: If you live close to each other or will be visiting Mike's area, suggest grabbing coffee or lunch to catch up in person. Even a quick meetup can help you reconnect and create new memories.\n6. **Revisit old haunts**: If you're both local, plan a visit to your old college hangouts, such as a favorite coffee shop, bar, or restaurant. This can bring back nostalgic feelings and create a sense of familiarity.\n7. **Show genuine interest**: When you do reconnect, make sure to ask Mike about his life, interests, and goals. Show genuine interest in what he's been up to and what's important to him.\n8. **Be patient and persistent**: Rebuilding a connection takes time, so don't get discouraged if Mike doesn't respond immediately. Keep reaching out, and eventually, he may come around.\n9. **Create a shared experience**: Suggest doing something new together, like taking an online course, joining a recreational sports team, or participating in a volunteer event. This can help you bond over a shared activity and create new memories.\n10. **Celebrate milestones**: If you know Mike is approaching a birthday, anniversary, or other significant milestone, reach out to wish him well and reconnect.\n\nRemember, reconnecting with an old friend takes effort and time. Be respectful of Mike's life and schedule, and don't be too pushy or aggressive in your attempts to reconnect.\n\nWhich of these ideas resonates with you, or do you have a different approach in mind?",
