  "content": "That's a great approach!\n\n**Absolutely** ask the instructor about their approach to flexibility and stretching before signing up for the class! This will help you get a better understanding of what to expect and ensure the class aligns with your goals. Here are some questions you could ask:\n\n1. **What is your approach to flexibility and stretching in the class?** Do they focus on dynamic stretching, static stretching, or a combination of both? Do they incorporate specific techniques like Pilates or yoga?\n2. **How much time is dedicated to flexibility exercises in the class?** Is it a significant portion of the class, or are flexibility exercises scattered throughout the session?\n3. **What areas of the body do you focus on stretching?** Are they targeting specific areas like hamstrings, quadriceps, or hip flexors, or do they take a more holistic approach to flexibility?\n4. **How do you modify exercises for students with limited flexibility or injuries?** This is essential to ensure the instructor can accommodate your needs and provide adjustments if necessary.\n5. **Do you provide individualized attention and corrections?** Will the instructor be able to offer personalized feedback and adjustments to help you improve your flexibility and technique?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll get a better sense of the instructor's approach and whether it aligns with your goals and needs. This will also show the instructor that you're committed to your training and willing to invest time and effort into improving your flexibility and technique.\n\nRemember, it's essential to find an instructor who understands your goals and can provide guidance and support to help you achieve them. Don't hesitate to ask questions or observe a class before committing to a particular instructor or studio.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a fantastic contemporary or modern dance class that helps you improve your flexibility and overall dance technique!",
