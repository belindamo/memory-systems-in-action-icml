  "content": "I'm Sara, a product design based in Bristol. When I was picking up the main topic, I actually wasn't sure which one to go for. My current problem is that the current way of working cross-functional team is not defined, people are not clear with role and responsibility, I feel very stressed because I have a lots work to do and to improve, meanwhile I have to support my squad and my design team to ensure they are doing their job. On the other hands, I know I need to focus on myself, the portfolio, and my career path but I constantly deprioritise them, which means I feel more stressed about my focus and my ability. Therefore, I just want to talk to someone and understand if that's something common and how you would handle this issues. I'm sorry if that too much to ask.\n\nHow you can you advice that person?",
