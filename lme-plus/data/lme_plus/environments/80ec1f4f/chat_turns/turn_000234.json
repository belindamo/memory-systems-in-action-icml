  "content": "I've been trying to establish a consistent morning routine that sets me up for success, and I think I've made some good progress. I've been waking up at 6:30 AM every weekday, which gives me enough time to fit in a 20-minute meditation session, a 30-minute workout, and a quick breakfast before heading out the door. I've also been trying to avoid checking my work emails or taking work calls before 8:00 AM, so I can focus on my personal development during that time. I'm curious, do you have any recommendations for good books or podcasts that can help me continue to improve my productivity and time management skills?",
