Rain-X and Aquapel are both well-known brands in the industry, and their products can definitely help improve visibility during rainy or snowy conditions.\n\nAnd congratulations on selling your old 2002 Toyota Corolla! Even though you didn't get the full $1,500, selling it to your cousin for $1,200 is still a good deal. It's great that you were able to declutter and focus on your current car, the Honda Civic.\n\nSelling an old car can be a big relief, especially when you're able to get a good price for it. It's also nice that you were able to sell it to a family member, which can make the process less stressful.\n\nNow that you've got some extra cash from the sale, you can consider using it to upgrade or maintain your Honda Civic. Maybe you could put some of the money towards a detailing job, a new set of floor mats, or even a performance upgrade.\n\nRemember to take good care of your Honda Civic, and it'll continue to serve you well for years to come. Regular maintenance, proper storage, and a few smart upgrades can make a big difference in the long run.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or need any more advice on car care or maintenance. I'm always here to help!",
