That's a great personal growth goal.\n\nNow, about the game night plan: Having a rotating host or location can be a great way to mix things up and keep game nights fresh, but it might also add some complexity to the planning process. Considering you're just reviving the tradition, it might be better to start with a consistent location and host for now.\n\nHere are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Consistent location and host:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Easier to plan and organize\n* Less logistical hassle\n* Can develop a comfortable and familiar atmosphere\n\nCons:\n\n* Might get repetitive or stale\n* Host might get burned out or feel overwhelmed\n\n**Rotating host or location:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Can bring new energy and variety to game nights\n* Allows different people to contribute and take ownership\n* Can explore different environments and activities\n\nCons:\n\n* More complex to plan and coordinate\n* Might be harder to find a consistent schedule or venue\n* Could lead to inconsistent quality or atmosphere\n\nFor now, I'd recommend starting with a consistent location and host. This will help you establish a rhythm and get everyone back into the habit of attending game nights. Once you've got a solid foundation, you can consider rotating hosts or locations to keep things fresh and exciting.\n\nYou can always revisit this decision later and adjust the format as needed. The goal is to create a sustainable and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.\n\nWhat do you think? Does that make sense, or do you have any other ideas or concerns?",
