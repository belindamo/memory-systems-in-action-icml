I enjoy sharing my experiences and knowledge through video, and I think it would be a great way to showcase my coins and connect with other collectors. I'm a bit concerned about the equipment and editing aspect, but I'm willing to learn and invest in the necessary tools.\n\nRegarding equipment, what kind of camera and microphone would you recommend for a beginner? And what editing software is user-friendly and suitable for creating high-quality videos?\n\nAlso, do you have any tips on how to structure my videos and make them engaging for viewers? Should I focus on specific topics, like coin reviews or collecting tips, or should I try to create more general content that appeals to a wider audience?",
