  "content": "Offering a \"buy one get one free\" deal on your famous chocolate chip cookies is a great idea, especially since they're a popular item. Adding a \"limited time only\" aspect to the deal can indeed create a sense of urgency and encourage customers to make a purchase sooner rather than later.\n\nHere are a few ways you could implement a limited-time offer:\n\n1. **Time-based**: Offer the BOGO deal for a specific time period, such as \"11am-1pm\" or \"during the first hour of the sale.\"\n2. **Quantity-based**: Limit the number of BOGO deals available, such as \"first 50 customers\" or \"while supplies last.\"\n3. **Flash sale**: Create a surprise BOGO deal for a short period, like 30 minutes, to create a sense of excitement and urgency.\n\nWhen combining the BOGO deal with a \"limited time only\" aspect, make sure to:\n\n1. **Clearly advertise**: Prominently display the offer and its limitations on signs, flyers, and social media to ensure customers know about the deal and its time constraints.\n2. **Create a sense of scarcity**: Emphasize that the offer is only available for a limited time to encourage customers to make a decision quickly.\n3. **Have a plan for leftovers**: If you're limiting the number of BOGO deals, have a plan in place for what to do with leftover items, such as offering them at a discounted price or donating them to the animal shelter.\n\nBy adding a \"limited time only\" aspect to your BOGO deal, you can create a sense of urgency and encourage customers to take advantage of the offer, ultimately driving more sales and donations for the animal shelter.\n\nRemember to also promote your \"donation\" option alongside the BOGO deal, so customers know they can contribute even more to the charity if they choose to. Good luck with your charity bake sale!",
