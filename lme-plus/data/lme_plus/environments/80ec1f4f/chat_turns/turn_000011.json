  "content": "**Absolutely** ask about the class size and atmosphere, as well as the style of music and choreography used in the class.\n\nHere are some questions you could ask:\n\n**Class Size and Atmosphere:**\n\n1. **What is the typical class size?** Is it a small, intimate setting or a larger group?\n2. **What is the atmosphere of the class?** Is it more relaxed and casual, or is it a more intense and focused environment?\n3. **How much individualized attention can I expect from the instructor?** Will the instructor be able to provide personalized feedback and corrections, or will it be more of a \"follow-the-leader\" style class?\n4. **Are there any opportunities for feedback or questions during the class?** Is there time for discussion or Q&A, or is the class more fast-paced and focused on execution?\n\n**Music and Choreography:**\n\n1. **What style of music is typically used in the class?** Is it more contemporary, experimental, or a fusion of different styles?\n2. **What is the style of choreography used in the class?** Is it more fluid and expressive, or is it more structured and technical?\n3. **Are there any specific choreographers or styles that influence the class?** Is the instructor drawing from a particular tradition or style, or is it more eclectic and experimental?\n4. **How often does the choreography change?** Is it a new routine every week, or do you work on a piece for several weeks or months?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll get a better sense of whether the class is a good fit for you and your learning style. You want to make sure you're comfortable with the class size and atmosphere, and that the music and choreography align with your interests and goals.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask questions and advocate for yourself as a student. The instructor or studio should be willing to work with you to ensure you have a positive and productive learning experience.\n\nGo ahead and ask those questions, and I hope you find a class that's a great fit for you!",
