They'll provide sustained energy and help you power through your run. Good sources include:\n\n1. Whole grains: Oatmeal, whole wheat toast, whole grain cereals, or brown rice\n2. Fruits: Bananas, berries, apples, or oranges\n3. Vegetables: Sweet potatoes, carrots, or bell peppers (if you can stomach them in the morning)\n\n**Protein:** Include a moderate amount of protein to help with muscle repair and satiety. Good sources include:\n\n1. Eggs\n2. Greek yogurt\n3. Nuts and seeds (e.g., almonds, walnuts, chia seeds)\n4. Lean meats (e.g., turkey bacon, chicken sausage)\n\n**Hydration:** Don't forget to drink water or a sports drink to stay hydrated. Aim for 16-20 ounces of fluid about 30 minutes before your run.\n\n**Sample Breakfast Ideas:**\n\n1. Oatmeal with banana, almond butter, and a splash of low-fat milk\n2. Whole grain toast with scrambled eggs, avocado, and a slice of tomato\n3. Greek yogurt with berries, honey, and chopped nuts\n4. Smoothie bowl with whole grain cereal, frozen berries, banana, and almond milk topped with nuts and seeds\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Avoid heavy meals or greasy foods that can cause stomach upset during your run.\n2. Experiment with different foods and portion sizes to find what works best for you.\n3. If you're new to running, consider starting with a smaller breakfast and gradually increasing the amount as your body adapts.\n4. Don't try new foods on the morning of a long run. Stick to what you know and love.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust your breakfast routine as needed. Good luck with your training, and have fun running around the lake!"
