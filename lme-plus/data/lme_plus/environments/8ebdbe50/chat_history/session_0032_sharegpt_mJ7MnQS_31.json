It's like something shifted inside of me. I feel...different.\n\nJonathan: (curious) Different how, Damian?\n\nDamian: (tearful) Different in a good way. Like, I know that God loves me. I know it in my bones. And it's overwhelming, John. It's like nothing I've ever felt before.\n\nJonathan: (moved) That's amazing, Damian. I'm so happy for you.\n\nDamian: (nodding) I just wish I could explain it better. It's like, I was blind but now I see. I was lost but now I'm found. And I know that God has a purpose for my life, John. A purpose that goes beyond my own selfish desires or ambitions.\n\nJonathan: (smiling) I believe it too, Damian. And I believe that God is already shaping you and changing you, in ways that you can't even imagine.\n\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I know, John. And I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. But I still don't know how to pray.\n\nJonathan: (encouraging) That's okay, Damian. Prayer doesn't have to be fancy or eloquent. It's just talking to God, from the heart. And I believe that God loves it when we're honest and real with Him.\n\nDamian: (nodding) I see. But what if I curse or say something wrong?\n\nJonathan: (smiling) God knows your heart, Damian. And He loves you, just the way you are. Even if you curse or say something wrong. He's not looking for perfection, He's looking for a relationship.\n\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I understand. Okay, John. I'll give it a try.\n\nJonathan: (nodding) Great, Damian. And don't worry, I'll be here to guide you if you need it. But I think you'll do great.\n\nDamian: (closing his eyes) Dear God, it's me, Damian. I don't know if I'm doing this right, but I just want to say thank you. Thank you for loving me, even when I didn't love myself. Thank you for sending your Son, Jesus, to die for me, even when I didn't deserve it. Thank you for giving me a new heart and a new start, even when I felt hopeless and lost. I don't know where this journey will take me, but I know that you're with me, every step of the way. And I trust in your promise to guide me and shape me, to make me into the person you created me to be. I'm not perfect, God. I curse and say stupid things sometimes. But I know that you still love me, just the way I am. And I want to live for you, from this day forward. To follow your will and your ways, no matter what. Thank you, God, for hearing my prayer. I love you. In Jesus' name, amen.\n\nJonathan: (smiling) That was beautiful, Damian. And don't worry about the cursing or the mistakes. God hears your heart, and He loves you, just the way you are.\n\nDamian: (smiling back) Thank you, John. And thank you for being here for me, every step of the way. You're a true friend, and I'm lucky to have you."

      "content": "The next day they meet, and in dialog with Jon, Damien is starting to realize that most of his life has been spent in pride and making it all about himself. That there are ways he has been hurt by his own family (use examples from stories in the comics) and then he has acted out in return. He wishes that this cycle would stop with him, and also beginning to realize that everyone is dealing with their own past, even his actual father (Bruce Wayne/Batman) and that even adults have sin they need to repent of and suffering they need help with. Jon encourage him to pray for them and pray God would use his changing life and their friendship in Christ as a witness to others. He invites him to attend church services with him and get connected to his friends in youth group."

And I'm starting to see things in a different way.\n\nJonathan: (curious) What do you mean, Damian?\n\nDamian: (sighing) I mean, I've been so focused on myself. On my own desires and my own goals. And I've hurt people along the way. People like you and your family. People like my own family.\n\nJonathan: (understanding) I see. And I know that it's not easy to admit our mistakes and our faults. But I also believe that God can use our brokenness to bring healing and hope to others.\n\nDamian: (nodding) That's what I want, John. I want to break the cycle of pride and selfishness. I want to be a different kind of person. A person who loves God and loves others, more than himself.\n\nJonathan: (smiling) I believe you can be, Damian. And I believe that God is already using you to make a difference, in ways that you can't even imagine.\n\nDamian: (curious) What do you mean, John?\n\nJonathan: (explaining) Well, for one thing, your friendship means a lot to me. And I know that you have a lot to offer to other people, too. People who are hurting and lost, like we were. And I also believe that God can use your relationship with your own family, especially your father, to bring healing and reconciliation.\n\nDamian: (surprised) My father? You mean, Batman?\n\nJonathan: (nodding) Yes, Damian. I know that he's been through a lot, and that he's not perfect. But I also know that he loves you, and that he wants the best for you. And I believe that God can use your changing life and your friendship with me, as a witness to him and to others.\n\nDamian: (thoughtful) I see. And I want that, John. I want to be a witness for God. To show people that He's real and that He loves us, no matter what.\n\nJonathan: (smiling) That's awesome, Damian. And I believe that God has a plan for your life, that goes beyond what you can imagine. And I want to help you, in any way I can. I want to invite you to church services with me, and to get connected with my friends in youth group. To learn more about God and to grow in your faith.\n\nDamian: (nodding) Okay, John. I'm willing to try. And thank you, for everything. For being patient, for showing me the way, and for being my friend.\n\nJonathan: (smiling back) Anytime, Damian. And thank you, for being my friend too. Together, we can do great things, for God's glory."

      "content": "Next week, after youth group, Damien is learning to share his actual feelings for other people, and not try to pretend he has is all together or that he is \"manly\" and tough (give an example from supersons comics where he did think that way). Damien is reading the bible and shares a verse that has encouraged him (pick a specific verse about God's strength and our weakness) and another about how he takes way our shame. Jon sheds tears of joy about what God is doing in Damien's life and reminds him that even though God is good, life may continue to be hard and get harder, especially because other kids can be cruel (Jon shares and example from the supersons comics where other kids said and did mean things to him). This time, it's Damien who shows kindness and love for Jon, and prays for him. This time, Jon is trying to say thank you as he breaks down in tears, and Damien comforts him"

Something that I've been learning, thanks to you and your friends.\n\nJonathan: (curious) What is it, Damian?\n\nDamian: (serious) It's that I don't have to pretend anymore. I don't have to be tough and manly all the time. I can share my actual feelings with other people, and not be ashamed of them.\n\nJonathan: (smiling) That's awesome, Damian. And I'm proud of you, for being brave and vulnerable. It takes a lot of courage to be real with other people.\n\nDamian: (nodding) I know. And I've been reading this verse in the Bible that has encouraged me, John. It's from 2 Corinthians 12:9, where Paul says that God's strength is made perfect in our weakness. And it's been a comfort to me, to know that God can use even my weaknesses and my struggles, to bring glory to Him.\n\nJonathan: (encouraging) That's a great verse, Damian. And it's true. God is the one who takes away our shame, and gives us His strength, when we admit our weakness and our need for Him.\n\nDamian: (nodding) I know. And I want to be a witness to others, to show them that God can do the same for them. But I also know that life can be hard, John. Even when we have God's strength and love in our lives.\n\nJonathan: (nodding) That's true, Damian. And I know that from my own experience. When I was a kid, I used to get teased a lot, because of my powers and my family. And it was hard. But I also know that God can use our suffering, to shape us and make us stronger, in Him.\n\nDamian: (nodding) I understand, John. And I want to be there for you too, when things get tough. I want to show you the same kindness and love that you've shown me.\n\nJonathan: (tearful) Thank you, Damian. That means a lot to me. And I want to pray for you too, if that's okay.\n\nDamian: (nodding) Of course, John. I'd be honored.\n\nJonathan: (closing his eyes) Dear God, thank you for my friend, Damian. Thank you for the way that you're changing him and using him, for your glory. Please continue to shape him and guide him, in your will and your ways. And please help him to be kind and loving, to others, no matter what. Even when life gets hard and people are cruel. Please protect him and bless him, with your presence and your peace. And thank you, God, for hearing our prayer. We love you. In Jesus' name, amen.\n\nDamian: (smiling) That was a beautiful prayer, John. And thank you, for being my friend and for showing me the way. I'm grateful for you.\n\nJonathan: (smiling back) I'm grateful for you too, Damian. And for everything that God is doing in your life. Let's keep following Him, together."
