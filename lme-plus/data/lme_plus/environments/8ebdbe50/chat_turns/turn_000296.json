Here are some tips on how to approach her for advice:\n\n1. **Start with a personalized email**: Begin your email by reminding her of your meeting at the Chamber of Commerce breakfast and how you enjoyed talking to her. This will help her remember you and establish a connection.\n2. **Be clear about your request**: Clearly state the purpose of your email: you're reaching out for advice on marketing your side project. Be specific about what you're looking for (e.g., guidance on a specific marketing strategy, feedback on your current approach, or recommendations for resources).\n3. **Show that you've done your homework**: Demonstrate that you've done some research on her agency and are familiar with her work. This will show that you value her expertise and are not just looking for a free consultation.\n4. **Be respectful of her time**: Acknowledge that she's a busy professional and offer flexibility in how you'd like to receive her advice. You could suggest a quick phone call, a meeting over coffee, or even just an email exchange.\n5. **Prepare thoughtful questions**: Before reaching out, prepare a list of specific, well-thought-out questions that will allow her to provide valuable insights. This will show that you're serious about seeking her advice and willing to put in the effort to learn.\n6. **Keep it concise**: Keep your initial email brief and to the point. You don't want to overwhelm her with too much information or ask for too much of her time upfront.\n7. **Follow up politely**: If you don't hear back within a week or two, send a polite follow-up email to check in and see if she's available to chat.\n\nHere's an example email to get you started:\n\nSubject: Seeking Marketing Advice from a Pro\n\nHi [Her Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our conversation at the Chamber of Commerce breakfast last month. I really enjoyed our chat and was impressed by your accomplishments with [Her Agency].\n\nI've been working on a side project, [Your Project], and I'm looking for some expert advice on marketing strategies. I came across your agency's work online and was impressed by the success you've had with [specific campaign or client]. I'd love to pick your brain on how to effectively market my project and reach a wider audience.\n\nWould you be open to a quick call or meeting to discuss some ideas? I've prepared a few specific questions to ensure our conversation is productive and respectful of your time.\n\nIf this is something you'd be willing to chat about, please let me know a convenient time that works for you.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nRemember to be respectful, professional, and prepared, and you'll be more likely to get a positive response. Good luck!",
