  "content": "Yes, there are regulations in place to protect sequoia forests from logging. The US Forest Service manages the majority of the sequoia forest land and has specific rules and regulations regarding logging operations. For example, logging is prohibited in designated wilderness areas and protected groves within national parks. In addition, the Endangered Species Act protects species like the California condor and the spotted owl, which are found in sequoia forests. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) also requires environmental reviews for all logging projects to assess potential impacts on the ecosystem. However, there are still challenges in enforcing these regulations and preventing illegal logging activities.",
