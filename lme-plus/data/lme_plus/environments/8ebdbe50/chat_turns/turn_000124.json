  "content": "In Hindu mythology, it is believed that no one but Lord Vishnu and his avatars are capable of wielding the Sudarshana Chakra. The weapon is considered to be exclusive to Lord Vishnu, and cannot be used by anyone else. It is said that even the Devas (Gods) and Asuras (Demons) are unable to possess or control the power of the Sudarshana Chakra. In fact, it is believed that attempting to take control of the Sudarshana Chakra without Lord Vishnu's permission would result in one's immediate destruction. So, it can be said that the Sudarshana Chakra is truly an unparalleled weapon that only Lord Vishnu and his avatars have the privilege of wielding.",
