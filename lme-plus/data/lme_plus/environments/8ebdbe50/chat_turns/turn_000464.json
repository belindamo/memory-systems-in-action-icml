  "content": "The inter-topic distance is determined by the algorithm based on how distinct the topics are from one another, not how distinct the individual words or tweets are. Even though there may be some overlap in the words and tweets within each topic, the algorithm has still identified distinct patterns and distributions of words that allow it to distinguish one topic from another. This means that while some words or tweets may appear in multiple topics, the topics as a whole are still distinct from each other. Additionally, the algorithm takes into account the frequency and distribution of words across topics, so it's possible that even though some words appear in multiple topics, they are still more strongly associated with one topic over another.",
