Unlike watching a movie in a theater where you cannot pause or take breaks whenever you want, streaming allows viewers to pause and resume watching at their convenience. This can be particularly convenient for those who have busy schedules or other commitments that may interrupt their viewing experience. Additionally, streaming services often offer features like subtitles and closed captioning, which can enhance the viewing experience for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as those who prefer watching content with subtitles.",
