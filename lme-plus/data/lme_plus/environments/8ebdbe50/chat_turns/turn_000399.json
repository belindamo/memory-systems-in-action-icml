It's light, refreshing, and perfect for warm weather.\n3. **Cannoli**: These Sicilian pastries consist of tube-shaped shells filled with sweetened ricotta cheese, chocolate chips, and candied fruit.

They're a classic Italian treat that's easy to make and fun to eat.\n5. **Gelato**: Italian-style ice cream that's denser and creamier than traditional ice cream.
