I've been trying to optimize my morning routine to give myself more time to relax before leaving for work, so this will be a great addition. Instead of waking up at 7:30, I've started waking up at 7:15, and it's made a huge difference in how rushed I feel in the mornings. Do you have any tips on how to maintain consistency with my new morning routine?",
