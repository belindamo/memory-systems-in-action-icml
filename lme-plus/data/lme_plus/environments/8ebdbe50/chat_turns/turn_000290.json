  "content": "Most of the major attractions and trails in Yosemite National Park are accessible throughout the year, even during the quieter months. However, during the winter months, some roads and trails may be closed due to snow or other weather-related issues. Generally, you can still get a good view of Yosemite's major attractions during the quieter months, and you may even enjoy better viewing conditions due to fewer crowds. Additionally, some activities, such as skiing and snowshoeing, are available during the winter months. It's always a good idea to check the park's website or speak with a park ranger to get the latest updates on road and trail closures and weather conditions.",
