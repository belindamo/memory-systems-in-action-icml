  "content": "Normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. It is achieved by applying a series of rules called normal forms. The normal forms are based on functional dependencies, which describe the relationships between the attributes of a table.\n\nThere are several normal forms, each with increasing levels of normalization. The most commonly used normal forms are:\n\n1. First normal form (1NF): A table is in 1NF if it does not contain repeating groups or arrays within a single row. Each cell must contain a single value, and each column must have a unique name.\n2. Second normal form (2NF): A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key. This means that each non-key attribute must depend on the entire primary key, not just a part of it.\n3. Third normal form (3NF): A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and there are no transitive dependencies. This means that if A depends on B, and B depends on C, then A should not depend on C.\n4. Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF): A table is in BCNF if every determinant is a candidate key. This means that if A determines B, then A must be a candidate key.\n5. Fourth normal form (4NF): A table is in 4NF if it is in BCNF and there are no multi-valued dependencies. This means that if A depends on B, and B has multiple values for A, then A should be separated into a separate table.\n\nEach normal form has its own set of rules and requirements for achieving it, and higher normal forms imply lower levels of redundancy and better data integrity. Normalization is an important part of database design, as it helps ensure that data is organized in a way that is efficient, consistent, and easy to maintain.",
