Here are some tips to help you achieve that effect:\n\n1. **Wet-on-wet technique**: This technique involves adding wet paint to wet paper. Mix a light wash of blue-grey or purple pigment with plenty of water to create a soft, misty color. Apply this wash to the entire background area, making sure the paper is still damp. This will help the paint spread and blend naturally, creating a soft, hazy effect.\n2. **Glazing**: Apply multiple thin, transparent layers of paint to build up the misty effect. Start with a light wash, let it dry, and then add subsequent layers, gradually increasing the intensity of the color. This technique will help you achieve a deep, atmospheric perspective.\n3. **Soft brushstrokes**: Use a large, soft brush (like a mop or a round brush) to apply the paint in gentle, sweeping strokes. This will help create a soft, feathery texture that suggests mist or fog.\n4. **Negative painting**: Instead of painting the misty mountains directly, try painting around them. Use a small brush to paint the negative spaces around the mountains, creating a soft, hazy edge. This will help the mountains appear to fade into the background.\n5. **Lifting and blending**: Use a damp brush to gently lift and blend the edges of the misty areas, creating a soft, gradient-like effect. This will help merge the misty background with the rest of the landscape.\n6. **Pay attention to value**: To create depth and atmosphere, make sure to vary the value (lightness or darkness) of the misty areas. Darker values will create a sense of depth, while lighter values will create a sense of distance.\n7. **Experiment with granulation**: Some watercolor pigments, like Ultramarine Blue or Burnt Sienna, have a granular texture that can create a soft, misty effect. Experiment with different pigments to see if you can achieve the desired effect.\n8. **Reference photos**: Study your reference photos from your trip to get a sense of the colors, values, and textures of the misty mountains. This will help you accurately capture the atmosphere and mood of the scene.\n\nRemember to have fun and experiment with different techniques until you achieve the desired effect. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy working with your new watercolor paints!",
