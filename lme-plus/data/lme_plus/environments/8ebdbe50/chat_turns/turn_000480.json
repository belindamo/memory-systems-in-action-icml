  "content": "As the Chief Technology Officer, I have conducted a technical feasibility and product scope analysis, and have determined that taking inspiration from Android Open Source Project (AOSP) will allow us to build the new AI-enabled mobile operating system faster and more efficiently. There are many elements of AOSP that we can leverage, such as the Linux kernel, which will provide a solid foundation for our new OS.\n\nAdditionally, we will also be taking inspiration from iOS for a better user experience. We will be taking the best of both worlds, the open-source and customization capabilities of Android and the user-friendly and intuitive interface of iOS.\n\nThe technical architecture overview of the OS will be as follows:\n\n1. The OS will be based on the Linux kernel which will provide a solid foundation and stability.\n2. We will be using the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) as a base and will be building on top of it.\n3. We will be using the latest Android version as a base, this will provide us with the latest features and capabilities.\n4. We will be incorporating new features such as edge-AI and federated learning to provide advanced AI and ML capabilities.\n5. We will be incorporating homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and blockchain to provide advanced security and privacy features.\n6.
