  "content": "Hummus is a great choice! It's a tasty and nutritious snack that's high in protein and fiber. Here are some other healthy snack suggestions that are high in protein and low in calories:\n\n1. **Nuts and seeds**: Almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, and chia seeds are all high in protein and healthy fats. A 1/4 cup serving of almonds, for example, has about 8 grams of protein and 170 calories.\n2. **Hard-boiled eggs**: A large egg has about 6 grams of protein and only 78 calories. Boil a dozen eggs and keep them in the fridge for a quick protein-rich snack.\n3. **Cottage cheese**: A 1/2 cup serving of cottage cheese has about 28 grams of protein and 80 calories. Look for single-serving containers or buy a large container and portion it out yourself.\n4. **Greek yogurt**: A 6-ounce serving of Greek yogurt has about 15 grams of protein and 100 calories. Choose a plain, unflavored variety to avoid added sugars.\n5. **Edamame**: These boiled soybeans are a tasty and protein-rich snack. A 1/2 cup serving has about 10 grams of protein and 125 calories.\n6. **Protein-rich fruit**: While not as high in protein as other snacks, fruit like bananas, apples, and berries are still a healthy choice. Look for fruit that's high in protein like guavas (4 grams of protein per medium fruit) or avocados (3 grams of protein per medium fruit).\n7. **Jerky**: Beef, turkey, or chicken jerky is a convenient and protein-rich snack. Look for low-sodium options or make your own jerky at home.\n8. **Protein smoothie**: Blend Greek yogurt, frozen fruit, and a scoop of protein powder (if you like) for a quick and filling snack.\n9. **Roasted chickpeas**: Rinse and dry a can of chickpeas, then roast them in the oven with some olive oil and seasoning. A 1/2 cup serving has about 5 grams of protein and 120 calories.\n10. **Veggie sticks with hummus**: In addition to Mandarin oranges, try pairing hummus with carrot sticks, celery, or cucumber slices for a satisfying snack.\n\nRemember, portion control is key when it comes to snacking. Aim for snacks that are around 100-200 calories per serving to keep your calorie intake in check.\n\nAnd, by the way, it sounds like you had a great shopping trip to Trader Joe's!",
