I'm here to learn from you and provide information on a wide range of topics, including music.\n\nSo, tell me more about your guitar playing! What kind of music do you enjoy playing? Are you into acoustic, electric, or a mix of both? Do you have a favorite artist or band that inspires your playing style?",
