  "content": "John is a homeowner in New South Wales who wants to renovate his kitchen and bathroom. He has a budget of $25,000 and is looking for a builder to do the job. However, he is not familiar with the legal aspects of hiring a builder and wants to ensure that he is protected if anything goes wrong. John searches for information about NSW Residential Building Contracts for small works over $20,000 and comes across the Small Works Contracts (Form 10A) pricing structure. He finds the fixed price and succinct, plain-language conditions suitable for his project, which he considers low-risk. He decides to use the Form 10A contract to ensure a smooth and hassle-free renovation.",
