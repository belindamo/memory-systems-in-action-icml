  "content": "(a) Three levels of data abstraction:\n\n1. Physical level: This is the lowest level of data abstraction and deals with the physical representation of data in the database. It includes details such as how the data is stored on disk, how it is accessed and retrieved, and how it is organized within the database.\n2. Logical level: This level of abstraction deals with the logical representation of data in the database. It includes details such as the data types, relationships between data, and constraints on the data. At this level, we are concerned with how the data is organized conceptually, without worrying about the implementation details.\n3. View level: This is the highest level of data abstraction and deals with how the data is presented to users or applications. It includes details such as which data is visible, how it is presented, and how it can be accessed.\n\nFor example, consider a two-dimensional array of size n x m representing student data in a university. The physical level would include details such as how the array is stored in memory, while the logical level would include details such as the data types of the elements in the array (e.g., name, age, GPA), how the elements are related (e.g., which student belongs to which department), and any constraints on the data (e.g., a student's age must be greater than 18). The view level would include details such as which columns are visible to a user (e.g., only the name and GPA columns), how the data is presented (e.g., in a table), and how it can be accessed (e.g., through a web interface).\n\n(b) Schema and instances:\n\nA database schema is the structure or blueprint that describes the logical organization of the data in a database. It includes details such as the tables, columns, data types, and relationships between tables.\n\nOn the other hand, a database instance refers to the actual data that is stored in a database at a particular moment in time. It is the set of all the data that has been inserted into the database.\n\nFor example, in our student data array, the schema would describe the structure of the array, including the names of the columns, the data types of the elements, and any constraints on the data. The instance would be the actual data stored in the array, such as the names, ages, and GPAs of the students. The schema would remain the same regardless of the data stored in the array, while the instance would change as new data is added or removed.",
