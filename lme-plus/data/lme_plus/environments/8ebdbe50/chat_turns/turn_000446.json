However, it is important to acknowledge the significance of biodiversity for the ecosystem's health and well-being. Forests are home to many plant and animal species, including endangered and threatened species, and provide an essential habitat for them. Removing trees and degrading the ecosystem can result in the loss or decline of these species, which can negatively impact the overall ecosystem. Furthermore, research shows that protecting biodiversity and promoting sustainable use of natural resources can enhance its economic and social value, as it can provide opportunities for eco-tourism and many other nature-based enterprises.
