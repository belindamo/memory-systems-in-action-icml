  "content": "We can't know for sure if something tastes bitter without the taste of humans. Taste is a subjective experience that can only be determined by the individual experiencing it. However, we can make educated guesses about the taste of a substance based on its chemical makeup and the presence of certain compounds that are known to produce certain taste sensations. For example, alcohol contains aldehyde compounds, which are known to have a bitter taste. Based on this information, we can infer that alcohol is likely to have a bitter taste, even if we haven't personally tasted it.",
