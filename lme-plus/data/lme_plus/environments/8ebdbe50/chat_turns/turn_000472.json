Paris in January can be quite chilly, and it's not uncommon to catch a cold or respiratory infection during travel.\n\nI'm glad to hear that you've finally received a diagnosis and are on the road to recovery. Pneumonia can be a serious condition, especially if left untreated, so it's great that you're taking proactive steps to get better.\n\nIn addition to the nutrition and lifestyle tips I provided earlier, I want to emphasize the importance of listening to your body and not pushing yourself too hard. It's essential to allow your body time to recover and rebuild its strength.\n\nSince you've been dealing with a cough for an extended period, you may want to consider consulting with your doctor about any additional steps you can take to soothe your throat and lungs. They may recommend a humidifier, inhaler, or other treatments to help alleviate your symptoms.\n\nRemember, recovery is not a one-size-fits-all process, and it's crucial to be patient and gentle with yourself. Take things one day at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider if you have any concerns or questions.\n\nOn a more positive note, I'm thrilled that you're excited to dive into some new TV shows! The Witcher and Altered Carbon are both excellent choices, and I hope you enjoy them. Sometimes, getting lost in a good story can be the perfect distraction from feeling unwell.\n\nFeel better soon, and let me know if there's anything else I can do to help!",
