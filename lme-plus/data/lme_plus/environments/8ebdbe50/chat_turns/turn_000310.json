  "content": "Next week, after youth group, Damien is learning to share his actual feelings for other people, and not try to pretend he has is all together or that he is \"manly\" and tough (give an example from supersons comics where he did think that way). Damien is reading the bible and shares a verse that has encouraged him (pick a specific verse about God's strength and our weakness) and another about how he takes way our shame. Jon sheds tears of joy about what God is doing in Damien's life and reminds him that even though God is good, life may continue to be hard and get harder, especially because other kids can be cruel (Jon shares and example from the supersons comics where other kids said and did mean things to him). This time, it's Damien who shows kindness and love for Jon, and prays for him. This time, Jon is trying to say thank you as he breaks down in tears, and Damien comforts him",
