Here are the guidelines from Honda:\n\n**Conventional Oil:**\n\n* Normal driving conditions: Every 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km)\n* Severe driving conditions (e.g., frequent stop-and-go traffic, extreme temperatures, towing): Every 3,000 to 5,000 miles (4,800 to 8,000 km)\n\n**Synthetic Oil:**\n\n* Normal driving conditions: Every 7,500 to 10,000 miles (12,000 to 16,000 km)\n* Severe driving conditions: Every 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km)\n\n**Synthetic Blend Oil:**\n\n* Normal driving conditions: Every 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km)\n* Severe driving conditions: Every 3,000 to 5,000 miles (4,800 to 8,000 km)\n\nSince you've had your car for 3 years, it's a good idea to check your owner's manual or the maintenance schedule to see when the last oil change was done. If you're unsure, it's always better to err on the side of caution and get your oil changed sooner rather than later.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following factors that may affect your oil change interval:\n\n* Driving habits: If you drive aggressively, idle frequently, or drive in extreme temperatures, you may need to change your oil more often.\n* Road conditions: If you drive on dusty or polluted roads, you may need to change your oil more frequently.\n* Oil type: If you're using a high-performance or synthetic oil, you may be able to go longer between oil changes.\n\nRemember to always consult your owner's manual or speak with a trusted mechanic if you're unsure about your car's maintenance needs.",
