  "content": "It's always a good idea to make advanced reservations for lodging or campsites, even during the quieter months in Yosemite National Park. While the crowds may be smaller during the winter and shoulder seasons, many of the park's accommodations, such as campsites and lodges, are still popular and tend to fill up quickly. It is better to make advanced reservations to ensure that you secure a place to stay. Some areas of the park, such as Yosemite Valley, may have limited availability during the quieter months, and reservations will be necessary to guarantee your accommodation. However, if you decide to show up without reservation, you can check in with the park's information centers and see if there's any availability. It is risky because it's not guaranteed, and you may end up having to leave or search out of the park for accommodation.",
