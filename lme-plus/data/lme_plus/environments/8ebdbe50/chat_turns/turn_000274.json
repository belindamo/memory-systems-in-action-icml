Remember to be consistent and patient with yourself as your body adjusts to the new wake-up time.\n\nDon't forget to also work on establishing a consistent morning routine, like your hydration station and \"no screen\" rule, to help signal to your body that it's time to wake up and start the day. These small changes can add up to make a big difference in your morning routine.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, good luck with your new morning routine, and I hope you start seeing positive changes soon!",
