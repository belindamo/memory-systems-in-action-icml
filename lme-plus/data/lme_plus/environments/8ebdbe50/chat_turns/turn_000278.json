  "content": "NPC Personality Types and Traits\n--------------------------------\n\nOne of the key features of the dynamic NPCs in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is their unique personalities and traits. Each NPC has a specific personality type, which influences their behavior and interactions with the player.\n\nThere are several different personality types in the game, including:\n\n* Lazy: These NPCs are laid-back and enjoy relaxing and taking things easy. They often sleep a lot and can be found lounging in the sun.\n* Peppy: These NPCs are energetic and social. They love to host parties and make new friends.\n* Snooty: These NPCs are sophisticated and high-class. They can be a bit snobby and enjoy talking about their wealth and possessions.\n* Cranky: These NPCs are grouchy and irritable. They can be difficult to get along with, but they do have a softer side if you get to know them.\n\nIn addition to their personality type, NPCs also have specific traits that define their individual characteristics. For example, a lazy cat NPC may have the trait of being a \"foodie,\" meaning they love to eat and cook. A peppy kangaroo NPC may have the trait of being a \"party animal,\" meaning they love to throw and attend parties.\n\nDynamic Friendship Meter\n------------------------\n\nAnother important aspect of the NPC interactions in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the friendship meter. As you interact with an NPC, your relationship with them will grow and change based on your actions and dialogue choices.\n\nIf you are kind and helpful to an NPC, their friendship meter will increase, indicating that they like and trust you more. On the other hand, if you are rude or neglectful towards an NPC, their friendship meter will decrease, indicating that they are less fond of you.\n\nMaintaining good relationships with the NPCs is important, as they may provide you with valuable rewards or information as your friendship grows. You can also earn special rewards and achievements for reaching high levels of friendship with certain NPCs.",
