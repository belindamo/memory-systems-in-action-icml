  "content": "I don't have current information about the specifics of prize money distribution in horse racing, but i can tell you that prize money distribution often varies according to the type of horse racing. for example, the prize money for major thoroughbred races like the kentucky derby, the preakness stakes, and the belmont stakes is typically much larger than for other races. similarly, there may be differences in prize money distribution between races for older horses and races for younger horses, or between races run on different surfaces (such as dirt, turf, or synthetic tracks). additionally, prize money may also be influenced by the size of the race field, the class of the horses running, and the sponsorships associated with specific races. the prize money distribution is usually determined by the racing authority or governing body, taking into account factors such as the prestige of the race, the level of competition, and the financial resources available.",
