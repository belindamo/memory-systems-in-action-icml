  "content": "Bulgogi is a classic Korean dish! I'm glad you're trying to perfect your recipe. I'm sure you'll find some inspiration from the resources I provided earlier.\n\nAs for Hwang's Kitchen, I'm afraid I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or knowledge of specific locations or restaurants. I can provide general information on Korean cuisine, recipes, and cooking techniques, but I don't have personal opinions or reviews of restaurants.\n\nHowever, I'm thrilled to hear that you enjoy Hwang's Kitchen and their bulgogi! It's always great to find a restaurant that serves authentic and delicious Korean food. If you're willing to share, what do you like about their bulgogi? Is there a particular ingredient or technique they use that you're trying to replicate in your own recipe?",
