  "content": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health burden that is exacerbated by the growing number of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases. In order to combat this, there is an urgent need for new anti-TB drugs and combination regimens. The natural product antibiotic fusidic acid (FA) was investigated for its potential in repurposing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. In this study, the authors report the results of synergy screens combining FA with a panel of approved anti-TB agents. Checkerboard and time-kill kinetics assays identified seven compounds from different chemical classes that synergized with FA in inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro: rifampicin (RIF), a rifamycin and frontline anti-TB drug; the macrolides, erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLR), and roxythromycin (ROX); the oxazolidinone, linezolid (LZD); the aminoglycoside, streptomycin (STR); and the aminocyclitol, spectinomycin (SPC). Among these, the strongest synergies were observed where FA was combined with SPC and ERY. The FA-RIF combination was cidal, while all other FA combinations were bacteriostatic. These results provide in vitro evidence of the potential utility of FA-containing combinations against M. tuberculosis, and suggest that FA may be a useful anchor compound in developing matrix screening assays aimed at identifying optimal drug combinations that may be evaluated within the existing TB drug pipeline for potential clinical efficacy.",
