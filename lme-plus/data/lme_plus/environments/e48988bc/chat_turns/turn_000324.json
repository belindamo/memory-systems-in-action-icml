  "content": "Cupping therapy should not be painful, but it can cause some discomfort or a sensation of tightness or pressure during the session. The feeling of suction and pressure created by the cups can be unfamiliar and may take some time to get used to. Depending on the type of cupping therapy used, the sensation may vary, but should not cause pain. \n\nHowever, if the cupping therapy is done improperly or for too long, it can cause bruising, skin irritation, or more serious injuries. It is important to make sure to visit an experienced and licensed practitioner to avoid any potential discomfort or harm.\n\nIf you experience any pain or discomfort during a session, it is essential to communicate with your practitioner promptly so they can adjust the treatment accordingly.",
