  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data, but enforcement of anti-corruption measures varies across different countries and regions. In some countries, anti-corruption measures are strongly enforced, and corrupt politicians and public officials are prosecuted and punished. In other countries, however, anti-corruption measures may be weakly enforced, and corruption goes unpunished.\n\nThe effectiveness of anti-corruption measures depends on various factors, such as political will, institutional capacity, and public support. For example, if there is political will to fight corruption and the institutions responsible for enforcement are independent and effective, anti-corruption measures can be effectively enforced. However, in countries where corruption is deeply entrenched, reform efforts may face significant challenges, and enforcement may be ineffective.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of anti-corruption measures to ensure that they achieve their intended objectives. Also, citizens, civil society organizations, and the media can play an essential role in holding governments accountable for enforcing anti-corruption measures.",
