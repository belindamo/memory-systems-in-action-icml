Therefore, I recommend consulting with a medical professional or a physical therapist before deciding whether hiking is a suitable activity for someone with knee pain. However, if you do go hiking, it's essential to wear proper shoes or boots with good support and traction, use hiking poles to reduce stress on the knee joint, and stick to easier, flatter trails with less steep terrain. Remember to start slowly and increase the intensity and distance over time gradually. And don't forget to stretch before and after the hike.",
