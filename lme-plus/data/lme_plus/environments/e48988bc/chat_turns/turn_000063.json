I can suggest a few options to help you plan your week:\n\n1. Check online weather websites or apps: You can check websites like weather.com, accuweather.com, or use weather apps like Dark Sky or Weather Underground to get the latest forecast for your area.\n2. Check your local news: You can also check your local news website or watch the weather forecast on TV to get an idea of the weather for Saturday.\n3. Plan around your schedule: As for fitting in a bike ride with Mike, you can take a look at your schedule and see if you have enough time in the morning before your volleyball game. Consider the duration of the bike ride, the travel time to the game, and any other commitments you may have.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to plan ahead and be flexible with your schedule. You can also communicate with Mike and your volleyball team to confirm the timing and make adjustments as needed.",
