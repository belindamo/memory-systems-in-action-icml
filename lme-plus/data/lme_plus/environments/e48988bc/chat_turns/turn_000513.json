  "content": "Yes, older consumers are definitely interested in virtual reality technology. Virtual reality can offer older consumers a way to explore new places and experience different cultures without leaving their homes. This technology can also provide a way to socialize with friends and family who may live in different parts of the world, and it can even offer therapeutic benefits to older adults who may be isolated or homebound.
