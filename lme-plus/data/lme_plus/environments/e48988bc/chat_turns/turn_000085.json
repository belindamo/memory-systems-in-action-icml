  "content": "The pouring technique can be a great way to achieve a smooth and even surface, and using a pouring medium can definitely help with that. A pouring medium is a substance that you mix with the resin to change its flow characteristics, making it easier to pour and control.\n\n**Benefits of using a pouring medium:**\n\n1. **Improved flow control**: A pouring medium can help the resin flow more smoothly and consistently, reducing the likelihood of air bubbles and unevenness.\n2. **Thinner consistency**: Pouring mediums can thin out the resin, making it easier to pour and spread evenly.\n3. **Reduced viscosity**: By reducing the viscosity of the resin, you can achieve a more even and smooth surface.\n4. **Easier to mix**: Pouring mediums can make it easier to mix the resin and hardener, reducing the risk of air bubbles and uneven mixing.\n\n**Popular pouring mediums:**\n\n1. **Silicone oil**: A common pouring medium that can be mixed with resin to reduce its viscosity and improve flow control.\n2. **Mineral spirits**: A solvent that can be used to thin out the resin and improve its flow characteristics.\n3. **Acetone**: A strong solvent that can be used to thin out the resin, but be careful not to use too much, as it can affect the resin's strength.\n4. **Specialized pouring mediums**: There are also commercial pouring mediums available that are specifically designed for resin casting, such as those from Smooth-On or Alumilite.\n\n**Tips for using a pouring medium:**\n\n1. **Start with a small amount**: Begin with a small amount of pouring medium and gradually add more as needed to achieve the desired consistency.\n2. **Mix well**: Make sure to mix the pouring medium and resin thoroughly to ensure a consistent flow.\n3. **Test the flow**: Before pouring the resin onto your model, test the flow by pouring a small amount onto a test surface.\n4. **Work in a well-ventilated area**: When working with pouring mediums, make sure to work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.\n\nBy using a pouring medium, you can achieve a smooth and even surface for your Titanic model. Just remember to follow the instructions for the specific pouring medium you're using, and take necessary safety precautions when working with resin and solvents.",
