Since then, the team has experienced both highs and lows, with some seasons ending in playoff contention and others not.\n\nIn recent years, the Titans have been competitive in the AFC South division, with quarterback Ryan Tannehill and running back Derrick Henry leading a potent offense. The team made the playoffs in 2019 and 2020, but were unable to advance past the divisional round. Looking ahead, the Titans will likely continue to be a factor in the division and conference, and their current success should give fans reason to be optimistic about the future.",
