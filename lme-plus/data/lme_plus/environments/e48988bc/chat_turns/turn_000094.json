Yeah, I've thought about taking a sushi-making class, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that yet - I tried making sushi at home last week and it was a disaster! I do want to learn more about different types of international cuisine, especially the ones I mentioned. Can you give me some suggestions on cooking schools in my area that offer classes on Korean, Indian, and Thai cuisine?",
