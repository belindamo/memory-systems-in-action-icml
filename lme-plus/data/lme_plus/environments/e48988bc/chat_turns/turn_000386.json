Getting a thoughtful gift for your coworkers can go a long way in building a positive and friendly work environment.\n\nI'd be happy to help you with some gift ideas for your colleagues. Since you mentioned you got a funny mug for David, I'll suggest some ideas that are similarly priced (around $10) or a bit more. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Gourmet Food Basket**: A nice basket filled with specialty teas, cookies, or chocolates is always appreciated. You can customize it according to your colleague's taste preferences. ($15-$25)\n2. **Desk Accessory**: A decorative paperweight, a fun mousepad, or a colorful pen holder can add some personality to their workspace. ($5-$15)\n3. **Coffee or Tea Gift Card**: A gift card to their favorite coffee shop or tea house is a thoughtful way to fuel their daily routine. ($5-$10)\n4. **Personalized Item**: A monogrammed notebook, a customized phone case, or a personalized keychain shows you put thought into the gift. ($10-$25)\n5. **Wine or Champagne**: If your workplace culture allows it, a nice bottle of wine or champagne is a classic way to celebrate a birthday. ($10-$30)\n6. **Book or Magazine**: If your colleague enjoys reading, consider gifting a bestselling book or a subscription to a magazine that aligns with their interests. ($10-$20)\n7. **Fun Experience**: Gift your colleague an experience, like tickets to a local event, a cooking class, or a fun activity, like rock climbing or bowling. (prices vary)\n8. **Plant or Succulent**: A small plant or succulent can brighten up their workspace and purify the air. ($5-$15)\n9. **Luxurious Candle**: A nice candle can create a cozy atmosphere and provide a relaxing break from work. ($10-$25)\n10. **Gift Card**: A gift card to a popular restaurant or store gives your colleague the freedom to choose something they really want. ($10-$25)\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your appreciation and thoughtfulness, regardless of the price tag!\n\nWhich of these ideas resonates with you, or do you have any specific preferences (e.g., something more practical, eco-friendly, or humor-related)?",
