Here are some examples of courtship displays that you might see in ducks:\n\n- Head-throws: Some species of ducks will toss their heads back and forth and make various sounds to show off their physical prowess and vocal abilities.\n- Wing-flapping: Some ducks will flap their wings in a showy manner, creating a loud noise that can be heard from quite a distance. This is often accompanied by quiet, guttural calls.\n- Bill-wiping: Male ducks may wipe their bills on their feathers, water, or the ground as part of their courtship displays. This behavior may be used to show off their cleanliness or to scent-mark their territory.\n- Tail-wagging: Male ducks with long, fancy tails (such as mallards) may wag their tails back and forth to impress potential mates.\n- Posturing: Some ducks (including teal and pintails) will stretch their necks and bodies upward while making a low-pitched call. This posture is often used as a signal of dominance or courtship.\n\nCourtship displays can be quite varied and can depend on the species of duck and the personality of the individual.
