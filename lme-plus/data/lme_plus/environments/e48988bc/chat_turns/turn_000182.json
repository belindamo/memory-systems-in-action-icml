They call it their \"Refill Revolution\" program. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Concentrated Refills**: Seventh Generation offers concentrated refill pouches for their liquid laundry detergent. These pouches contain the same formula as their regular detergent but in a highly concentrated form. You can use these pouches to refill your existing Seventh Generation bottle up to 4 times, reducing plastic waste by 75%!\n2. **Bulk Refills**: For their powder laundry detergent, Seventh Generation offers bulk refill bags. These bags contain the same powder formula as their regular detergent but in a larger quantity. You can use these bags to refill your existing container or purchase a reusable container from Seventh Generation.\n\nBy choosing Seventh Generation's refill options, you can:\n\n* Reduce plastic waste: Refills use significantly less plastic than buying individual bottles or containers.\n* Save money: Refills are often cheaper than buying individual bottles or containers.\n* Lower your carbon footprint: Refills reduce the energy needed for manufacturing, transportation, and packaging.\n\nSeventh Generation also encourages customers to recycle their empty containers and pouches through their partnership with TerraCycle. You can collect your empty containers and pouches and send them to TerraCycle for recycling.\n\nSeventh Generation's commitment to sustainability and reducing waste is truly admirable. By choosing their refill options, you're not only getting a great eco-friendly laundry detergent but also supporting a brand that's dedicated to making a positive impact on the environment.\n\nI hope this information helps!",
