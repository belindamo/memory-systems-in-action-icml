  "content": "Most sugar mills in Meerut have modernized and automated their production process to improve efficiency and reduce labor costs. However, there are still some tasks in the production process that require human labor, such as harvesting sugarcane, loading and unloading trucks, and quality control. \n\nHarvesting sugarcane is still generally done manually with machetes, and it is a labor-intensive process. The harvested sugarcane is then loaded onto trucks and transported to the sugar mills. \n\nThere are also workers involved in the sugar mills who operate and maintain the machines and equipment used in the processing of sugarcane. They also monitor the quality of the sugar to ensure that it meets the required standards.\n\nAlthough automation has been introduced in many aspects of the production process, labor still plays an important role in the sugarcane industry in Meerut.",
