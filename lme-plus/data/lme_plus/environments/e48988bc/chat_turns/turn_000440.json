  "content": "It's hard to say whether playing on artificial turf gave the Houston Oilers a significant advantage over other teams. At the time, turf was a relatively new playing surface, and many teams were still playing on natural grass. However, the Oilers did have a distinct advantage in that they were the only team at the time playing on a fully artificial surface, while many other teams were using a hybrid surface or had only replaced part of their natural grass with turf.\n\nThe Oilers' move to the Astrodome, and the use of turf, did lead to some changes in the way the game was played. The faster surface allowed for more speed and agility, as well as a more controlled and predictable bounce. On the other hand, turf was often cited as being harder on players' bodies, leading to more injuries.\n\nOverall, it's difficult to say whether the Oilers' success was directly tied to playing on artificial turf. While it may have given them a slight advantage, there were many other factors that contributed to the team's success and decline over the years.",
