To help you achieve it, I'll create a 12-week training plan that incorporates a mix of speed workouts, hill repeats, and longer runs.\n\nBefore we dive into the plan, let's set some assumptions:\n\n* You'll be training 4-5 times a week, with one or two rest days.\n* You'll have access to a track or a measured route with hills for hill repeats.\n* You'll be able to incorporate strength training or cross-training (e.g., cycling, swimming) one or two times a week to improve overall endurance.\n\nHere's a general outline of the 12-week plan:\n\n**Weeks 1-4: Base Building**\n\n* 3 runs per week: 1 easy run, 1 hill repeat session, 1 longer run (6-7K)\n* 1-2 cross-training sessions per week (cycling, swimming, or strength training)\n* Gradually increase weekly mileage by 10-15% each week\n\n**Weeks 5-8: Speed Development**\n\n* 3 runs per week: 1 easy run, 1 speed workout (e.g., 400m repeats, 800m repeats), 1 hill repeat session\n* 1-2 cross-training sessions per week\n* Introduce tempo runs (e.g., 3-4K at a fast pace) every other week\n\n**Weeks 9-12: Specificity and Taper**\n\n* 3 runs per week: 1 easy run, 1 tempo run, 1 hill repeat session\n* Reduce cross-training sessions to 1 per week\n* Gradually reduce weekly mileage by 10-15% each week to allow for recovery and tapering\n\nHere's an example of what a typical week might look like during each phase:\n\n**Week 3 (Base Building)**\n\n* Monday: Easy 5K run\n* Tuesday: Hill repeats (6x 400m at 5K pace)\n* Thursday: 7K run at a moderate pace\n* Saturday: Cycling or swimming for 30-45 minutes\n\n**Week 7 (Speed Development)**\n\n* Monday: Easy 5K run\n* Tuesday: 400m repeats (8x 400m at 5K pace, with 200m active recovery)\n* Thursday: Hill repeats (6x 400m at 5K pace)\n* Saturday: 3K tempo run at a fast pace\n\n**Week 11 (Specificity and Taper)**\n\n* Monday: Easy 5K run\n* Tuesday: 3K tempo run at a fast pace\n* Thursday: Hill repeats (4x 400m at 5K pace)\n* Saturday: Rest or easy 3K run\n\nThis is just a general outline, and we can adjust the specifics based on your progress and how your body responds to the training. It's essential to listen to your body and not push too hard, especially as you get closer to the event.\n\nHow does this outline sound? Are you ready to get started with the plan?",
