They contain:\n\n1. **Healthy fats**: Avocados are rich in monounsaturated fats, which can slow down the digestion and absorption of glucose.\n2. **Fiber**: Avocados are a good source of dietary fiber, which can help slow down the release of glucose into the bloodstream.\n3. **Low glycemic index**: Avocados have a low glycemic index (GI) of around 10, which means they won't cause a significant spike in blood sugar levels.\n\nIn fact, a study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that adding avocado to a meal reduced the postprandial (after-meal) glucose response in healthy individuals.\n\nSo, go ahead and enjoy your Avocado Toast with Poached Eggs, knowing that the avocado will likely help regulate your blood sugar levels rather than spike them.\n\n**Tips for preparing your Avocado Toast:**\n\n1. Toast the bread until it's lightly browned to increase the fiber content.\n2. Mash the avocado and spread it evenly on the toast to ensure you're getting a good dose of healthy fats and fiber.\n3. Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste, but avoid adding any added sugars or refined oils.\n\nEnjoy your delicious and nutritious breakfast!",
