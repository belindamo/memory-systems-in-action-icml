  "content": "While ducks are known for forming pair bonds, they are not necessarily monogamous. In fact, many species of ducks engage in extra-pair copulations, which means they mate with individuals other than their primary partner.\n\nExtra-pair copulations, or EPCs, can happen for a variety of reasons. Males may seek out additional mates to increase their chances of passing on their genes, while females may engage in EPCs to obtain better genes for their offspring or to ensure that they receive sufficient parental care.\n\nWhile EPCs do occur in many duck species, they are not universal - some ducks are more monogamous than others. For example, some species such as the wood duck are known for being almost entirely monogamous, while others such as the mallard are more promiscuous.\n\nIt's worth noting that while EPCs may seem like infidelity to us humans, it's not the same thing from a biological perspective. Animals don't have the same moral or ethical values as humans do, and their behavior is driven by their instincts and evolutionary imperative. In the case of ducks, EPCs are simply one aspect of their natural reproductive strategy.",
