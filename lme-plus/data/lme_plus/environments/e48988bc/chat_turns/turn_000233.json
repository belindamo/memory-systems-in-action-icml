  "content": "Ok. In terms of team structure and the execution of work, at the outset it would be just myself. I have solid experience in product management, product design, and web development. I have recent, but significant familiarity with developing machine-learning based tools and automations. I'm open to engaging and building a remote team of other developers, product managers and designers as needed (or ideally folks that have technical and communication skills to cross all three of these disciplines and work directly with clients).\n\nHelp me think through how I might stage the build out of my team structure and successfully execute work. For example, what services might make most sense to focus on as an individually initially, how might I want to search and select others who are qualified to help, and how might I adding others to this new business as demand grows. Also, if you have other high-level considerations or suggestions let me know. Feel free to group this feedback in sections.",
