  "content": "I am sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to the Eurogamer's archive of interviews, but I can tell you that Eurogamer has a long history of interviewing up-and-coming game developers and smaller studios and giving a platform to new and unique perspectives. They often cover independent games and developers at events such as E3 and Gamescom, and highlight emerging talents and fresh ideas in the industry. In addition, Eurogamer also regularly spotlights smaller games and studios through features and reviews, giving them exposure to a wider audience. Some examples of small or independent game developers/studios that Eurogamer has covered in the past include:\n\n- Lucid Games: The developers of Destruction AllStars, interviewed by Eurogamer pre-release.\n\n- No More Robots: The indie publisher behind Descenders and other games, interviewed by Eurogamer discussing their approach to game publishing and distribution.\n\n- Adele Cutting: A freelance game developer and creator of the indie game Torpor, interviewed by Eurogamer about her experience creating a unique narrative adventure game.\n\n- Amplitude Studios: The French game development studio that created Endless Space and Endless Legend, invited to Eurogamer for a stream to discuss their newest game, Humankind.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many up-and-coming game developers and studios that Eurogamer have covered over the years.",
