Estonia: Estonia has implemented Electronic voting, digital signatures, and government-level encryption technologies to reduce the opportunities for corrupt practices.\n\n2. South Korea: South Korea has implemented an anti-corruption app named \"The Integrity Mobile,\" which enables citizens to report corruption cases and access information on government policies, campaigns, and other issues.\n\n3. Ukraine: Ukraine has implemented an electronic procurement system (Prozorro) that allows open tendering, which reduces the opportunities for insider dealing and other corrupt practices.\n\n4. India: India has implemented technology-enabled transparency mechanisms such as the Public Information Infrastructure and Innovations (PIII), which enables citizens to access government information digitally.\n\n5. Mexico: Mexico has implemented a transparency portal that provides citizens with access to public procurement, budget implementation, and expenditure data.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that technology can be a powerful tool in the fight against corruption, and there are various ways in which technology can be harnessed to promote transparency, accountability and reduce corruption. However, it is essential to ensure that these technologies are implemented and used effectively, and that they are backed by strong institutions and the political will to combat corruption.",
