  "content": "I do not have current information regarding the jockey club's approach to prize money distribution or how they work with racecourse owners. however, in general, racing authorities and governing bodies like the jockey club usually have a system in place that regulates prize money distribution. they work in partnership with the racecourse owners to ensure that the prize money on offer is distributed fairly and equitably among the winning horses and their owners. the distribution of prize money is usually based on the total purse or prize fund allocated for each race, with a certain percentage going to the winning horse and a (usually smaller) percentage going to the runners-up. in some cases, certain races may have a minimum or maximum prize money allocation, and the rules for such races may be set by the racing authority or governance body. typically, there are also rules in place for the payment of jockeys and trainers, and these can vary depending on the race conditions and the horses' performance. overall, the goal of such partnerships is to maintain a fair and transparent system that helps to ensure that racing remains a fair and competitive sport.",
