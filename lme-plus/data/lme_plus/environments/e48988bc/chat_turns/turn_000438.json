  "content": "The Houston Oilers were founded in 1960 as part of the American Football League (AFL). The team originally played at Jeppesen Stadium before moving to the Houston Astrodome in 1968, becoming the first professional football team to play on artificial turf. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, the Oilers were a successful franchise, making the playoffs 10 times and reaching the AFC Championship Game twice. \n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Oilers' fortunes began to decline. Despite having Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon, the team struggled to find consistent success, and tension between Moon and head coach Jerry Glanville led to Glanville's resignation in 1990. In 1995, owner Bud Adams announced that the team would be moving to Tennessee, citing the need for a new stadium and better financial support from the city of Houston.\n\nThe Oilers played their final game in Houston on December 17, 1996 before officially becoming the Tennessee Oilers for the 1997 season. The team played in Memphis for one year before moving to their permanent home in Nashville and changing their name to the Tennessee Titans. The Titans have had a successful run since the move, making it to the Super Bowl in 1999 and winning the AFC Championship in 2000 and 2020.",
