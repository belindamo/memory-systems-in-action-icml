The Tennessee Titans will actually open their season on September 12, 2021, with a road game against the Arizona Cardinals. The game is scheduled to start at 1:00 p.m. ET. Please note that game times are subject to change, so it's a good idea to check the NFL schedule for the most up-to-date information.",
