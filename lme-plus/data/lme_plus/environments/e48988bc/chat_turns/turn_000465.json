  "content": "Sure, here's a description of the positioning of UI elements on the \"Goal Setting\" page:\n\n1. Current Height Input Field: This input field should be positioned at the top of the page, near the header or above it. This allows the user to easily find and enter their current height.\n2. Current Weight Input Field: This input field should be positioned below the Current Height Input Field, and should be aligned with it. This allows the user to easily find and enter their current weight.\n3. Activity Level Dropdown: This dropdown should be positioned below the Current Weight Input Field, and should be aligned with the input fields above it. This allows the user to easily find and select their current activity level.\n4. Fitness Goal Radio Buttons: This set of radio buttons should be positioned below the Activity Level Dropdown, and should be aligned with it. This allows the user to easily find and select their fitness goal.\n5. Target Input Field: This input field should be positioned below the Fitness Goal Radio Buttons, and should be aligned with them. This allows the user to easily find and enter their target weight or other relevant metric.\n6. Time Period Input Field: This input field should be positioned below the Target Input Field, and should be aligned with it. This allows the user to easily find and enter the target time period for achieving their goal.\n7. Save Button: This button should be positioned at the bottom of the page, near the footer or below it. This allows the user to easily find and save their goal settings.\n\nThe UI elements should be arranged in a logical and intuitive order, with related elements grouped together and separated from unrelated elements. The input fields and dropdowns should have sufficient spacing between them to prevent confusion, and the save button should have sufficient prominence to draw the user's attention and encourage them to save their goal settings. The overall layout of the \"Goal Setting\" page should be clean, simple, and uncluttered, with clear and concise labels, to make it easy for the user to set their fitness goal, target, and time period.",
