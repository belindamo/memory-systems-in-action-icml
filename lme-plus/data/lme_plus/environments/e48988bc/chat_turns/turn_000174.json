  "content": "It is difficult to give a precise number for how many currencies have failed in the last 100 years, as there are many ways to define what constitutes a \"failed\" currency. However, there have been numerous instances of currencies experiencing hyperinflation, devaluation, or becoming obsolete in various countries over the last century.\n\nFor example, in the 20th century alone, many countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia have experienced hyperinflation, which often results in a loss of confidence in the currency and can render it effectively useless. Additionally, many countries have replaced their currencies with new ones, either as a result of political or economic events, or as part of a larger monetary union.\n\nTherefore, while it is difficult to provide an exact number, it is safe to say that there have been many instances of currency failures or changes over the last 100 years.",
