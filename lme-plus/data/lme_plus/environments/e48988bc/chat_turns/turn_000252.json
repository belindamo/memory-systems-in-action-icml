  "content": "Yes, competition and fighting can occur during duck courtship displays, particularly among males. Males may compete with each other to establish dominance and win the attention of females. Some males may physically attack or chase off other males to ensure their own mating success. \n\nIn some species, males will form \"leks,\" which are groups of males that gather in one area to display and compete for females. In leks, males may engage in physical combat or aggressive displays such as chasing or biting each other. The females will observe and compare the males' behaviors before choosing a mate. \n\nCompetition and fighting can be particularly intense among ducks that breed in dense populations or limited geographic areas. However, not all species exhibit this type of behavior - some ducks have more peaceful courtship rituals. \n\nIt's worth noting that while male competition and fighting can be aggressive, it's generally not harmful to the ducks themselves. They don't have the same level of aggression as some other animals, such as lions or bears. Nevertheless, it can still be a dramatic and interesting behavior to observe!",
