Let me know if you notice any improvements after trying those.\n\n**Quality of Service (QoS) settings** can be a bit more involved, but it's a powerful feature that can help prioritize certain devices or applications on your network. Here's a general overview of how to set up QoS on your router:\n\n**Note:** The exact steps may vary depending on your router's model and firmware. I'll provide general guidance, and you can consult your router's documentation or online support resources for specific instructions.\n\n**Step 1: Log in to your router's web interface**\n\nOpen a web browser and type the router's IP address (usually 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1). Log in using your admin credentials (usually printed on the underside of the router or in the documentation).\n\n**Step 2: Find the QoS settings**\n\nLook for a section called \"Quality of Service\" or \"Traffic Control\" in your router's web interface. This might be under Advanced Settings or Wireless Settings.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the devices or applications to prioritize**\n\nDecide which devices or applications you want to prioritize. For example, you might want to prioritize:\n\n* Online gaming consoles (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation)\n* Streaming devices (e.g., Roku, Chromecast)\n* Video conferencing applications (e.g., Zoom, Skype)\n* Critical devices (e.g., smart home security cameras)\n\n**Step 4: Set up QoS rules**\n\nCreate rules to prioritize the identified devices or applications. You can usually set up rules based on:\n\n* Device IP addresses or MAC addresses\n* Application ports (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 5060 for SIP)\n* Traffic types (e.g., video, audio, gaming)\n\nAssign a priority level to each rule, usually on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is the highest priority. This will determine how much bandwidth is allocated to each device or application.\n\n**Step 5: Save and apply the changes**\n\nSave your QoS settings and apply the changes. Your router will then prioritize traffic based on your rules.\n\n**Example scenario:**\n\nSuppose you want to prioritize your online gaming console (Xbox) and your video conferencing application (Zoom). You would:\n\n* Create a rule for the Xbox's IP address with a high priority (e.g., 1)\n* Create a rule for Zoom's application port (e.g., 5060) with a high priority (e.g., 1)\n* Save and apply the changes\n\nThis way, when you're gaming or using Zoom, your router will allocate more bandwidth to those devices or applications, ensuring a smoother experience.\n\nRemember to monitor your internet speed and adjust the QoS settings as needed to achieve the best results.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues or have questions about setting up QoS on your specific router, feel free to ask!",
