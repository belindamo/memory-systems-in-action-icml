It seems like you're mistaken about having 10,000 points with Wingspan Travel, as I'm a new conversation and don't retain any information.\n\nThat being said, I'd be happy to help you plan a trip to Hawaii! Since you're looking for a short getaway, I'll assume you're thinking of a 4-7 day trip. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Island Hopping:**\n\n* Visit Oahu and Maui: Spend 2-3 days on Oahu, exploring Honolulu, Waikiki Beach, and Pearl Harbor. Then, take a short flight to Maui and enjoy 2-4 days of relaxation in Ka'anapali, Lahaina, or Haleakala National Park.\n* Visit Kauai and the Big Island: Explore Kauai's natural beauty, including Wailua River and Na Pali Coast State Park. Then, head to the Big Island and visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hilo, and Mauna Kea.\n\n**Single-Island Getaway:**\n\n* Oahu: Spend 4-7 days on Oahu, exploring Honolulu, North Shore, and the island's many beaches.\n* Maui: Relax on Ka'anapali Beach, watch the sunrise from Haleakala, and explore the Road to Hana.\n* Kauai: Enjoy the island's laid-back atmosphere, beautiful beaches, and outdoor activities like hiking and kayaking.\n\n**Accommodations:**\n\n* Consider booking a hotel or resort in a central location, like Waikiki Beach on Oahu or Ka'anapali on Maui.\n* Look for properties that offer loyalty programs or special deals, which might help you redeem your points (if you have any).\n\n**Activities:**\n\n* Snorkeling, surfing, or paddleboarding on any of the islands\n* Visiting a luau or trying local cuisine like poke, laulau, or shave ice\n* Exploring national parks, like Haleakala or Hawaii Volcanoes\n* Taking a helicopter tour or sunset cruise\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a starting point, and you should research and book your trip according to your personal preferences and travel style.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask!",
