  "content": "Cooking classes sound like a great idea! I'd be happy to help you find a cooking school near you that offers classes on Korean, Indian, and Thai cuisine.\n\nTo get started, could you please share your location or city with me? That way, I can provide you with more tailored suggestions.\n\nAlso, yay for sushi lovers! Spicy tuna roll is a popular favorite, and it's great that you've found a spot near your office that you enjoy. Have you considered taking a sushi-making class as well? Many cooking schools offer classes on various international cuisines, including Japanese and sushi-specific classes.\n\nOnce I have your location, I can provide you with a list of cooking schools in your area that offer classes on Korean, Indian, and Thai cuisine. Additionally, I can also suggest some online resources and cooking schools that offer virtual classes, in case you prefer to learn from the comfort of your own kitchen.",
