Missing the bus by just 2 minutes can be frustrating, and the extra Uber cost doesn't help.\n\nBut don't worry, I'm here to help you set up a budgeting system to track your daily expenses and get back on track! Let's get started!\n\nTo create a budgeting system, we'll need to follow a few steps:\n\n1. **Identify your income**: How much money do you have coming in each month? This includes your salary, any side hustles, and any other regular income.\n2. **Categorize your expenses**: We'll break down your expenses into categories, such as:\n\t* Housing (rent, utilities, etc.)\n\t* Transportation (bus fare, gas, insurance, etc.)\n\t* Food (groceries, dining out, etc.)\n\t* Entertainment (movies, hobbies, etc.)\n\t* Debt repayment (credit cards, loans, etc.)\n\t* Savings (emergency fund, retirement, etc.)\n\t* Miscellaneous (gifts, subscriptions, etc.)\n3. **Assign budget amounts**: Based on your income and expenses, we'll allocate specific amounts to each category.\n4. **Track your expenses**: We'll find a way to track your daily expenses, so you can stay on top of your spending.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your income and expenses? For example:\n\n* How much do you earn each month?\n* What are your fixed expenses, such as rent/mortgage, utilities, and minimum debt payments?\n* How much do you usually spend on transportation, food, and entertainment?\n* Are there any specific areas where you'd like to cut back or prioritize?\n\nOnce we have a better understanding of your financial situation, we can start building a budget that works for you.\n\nAnd don't worry about that $15 Uber ride \u2013 we'll make sure to factor it into your budget and help you avoid similar expenses in the future!",
