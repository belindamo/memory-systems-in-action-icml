  "content": "While both \"Outlander\" and \"The Last Kingdom\" are historical dramas, they do have some fantastical elements, but they're not as prominent as in \"The Witcher\". Here's a brief breakdown of each show's approach to fantasy:\n\n**Outlander**:\n\n* While based on historical events and figures, \"Outlander\" does incorporate time travel, which is a fantastical element. The show's protagonist, Claire, travels from 1945 to 1743 Scotland, and her experiences are influenced by her knowledge of the future.\n* The show also explores themes of folklore, mythology, and mysticism, particularly in its depiction of the Scottish Highlands and the culture of the time. You'll encounter characters with supposed supernatural abilities, like the \"healing\" powers of Claire's friend, Geillis Duncan.\n* However, the show's focus remains on the historical context, characters, and relationships, with the fantasy elements serving to enhance the story rather than dominate it.\n\n**The Last Kingdom**:\n\n* This show is more grounded in historical fact, drawing heavily from Bernard Cornwell's novels, which are known for their meticulous research and historical accuracy.\n* While there are no overtly fantastical elements like time travel or magic, the show does take some creative liberties with the historical record. For example, the character of Uhtred of Bebbanburg is a fictionalized version of a real historical figure, and some events are dramatized or altered for the sake of the story.\n* The show does explore the spiritual beliefs and superstitions of the time, including the pagan practices of the Saxons and the Christian faith of the Anglo-Saxons. However, these elements are presented as part of the historical context rather than as fantastical plot devices.\n\nIn comparison to \"The Witcher\", both \"Outlander\" and \"The Last Kingdom\" are more grounded in historical fact and less focused on high fantasy elements like magic, monsters, and mythical creatures. However, they do share some similarities with \"The Witcher\" in their epic scope, complex characters, and richly detailed world-building.\n\nIf you enjoyed the historical and dramatic aspects of \"The Witcher\", you'll likely appreciate the similar elements in \"Outlander\" and \"The Last Kingdom\". If you're looking for more fantasy-heavy content, you might want to explore other shows like \"Vikings\" or \"Medici: Masters of Florence\", which both have a stronger focus on historical fact but still incorporate elements of fantasy and myth.",
