A 3-ounce serving contains about 22 grams of protein, 0 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar.\n2. **Pasture-raised chicken breast**: A 3-ounce serving contains about 26 grams of protein, 0 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar.\n3. **Wild-caught salmon**: Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, a 3-ounce serving contains about 20 grams of protein, 0 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar.\n4. **Turkey breast**: A 3-ounce serving contains about 24 grams of protein, 0 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar.\n5. **Pork tenderloin**: A 3-ounce serving contains about 23 grams of protein, 0 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar.\n\n**Plant-based protein sources:**\n\n1. **Legumes** (lentils, chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans): These are higher in carbs, but still a great option. A 1/2 cup cooked serving contains about 9 grams of protein, 20-25 grams of carbs, and 2-3 grams of sugar.\n2. **Tofu**: A 3-ounce serving contains about 9 grams of protein, 2 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar.\n3. **Tempeh**: A 3-ounce serving contains about 15 grams of protein, 10 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar.\n4. **Seitan** (wheat gluten): A 3-ounce serving contains about 21 grams of protein, 10 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar.\n5. **Nuts and seeds** (almonds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds): While higher in fat, they're a good source of protein. A 1/4 cup serving contains about 5-8 grams of protein, 5-10 grams of carbs, and 1-2 grams of sugar.\n\n**Tips for incorporating protein into your meals:**\n\n1. **Grill or bake**: Prepare your protein sources using low-carb, low-sugar methods like grilling or baking.\n2. **Pair with veggies**: Combine your protein sources with roasted or saut\u00e9ed vegetables to add fiber, vitamins, and minerals.\n3. **Use herbs and spices**: Instead of sugary sauces, use herbs and spices to add flavor to your protein sources.\n4. **Experiment with marinades**: Use citrus juice, olive oil, and herbs to marinate your protein sources before cooking.\n\nRemember to always choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible, and be mindful of portion sizes to maintain a balanced diet.\n\nWhich protein sources are you most interested in trying, or do you have any dietary restrictions I should consider?",
