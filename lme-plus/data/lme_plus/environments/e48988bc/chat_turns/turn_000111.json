Rachel was with you when you visited the bakery, so she might remember some details that can help you find out more about the bakery.\n\nYou can simply ask Rachel if she remembers the name of the bakery, its location, or any distinctive features about the place. She might recall something that can help you identify the bakery and find its contact information or menu online.\n\nSome questions you could ask Rachel include:\n\n* Do you remember the name of the bakery we went to on the third Sunday?\n* Can you describe the outside or inside of the bakery? Was there anything unique about the decor or atmosphere?\n* Do you remember what we ordered or any notable pastries they had on display?\n* Was the bakery in a specific neighborhood or part of town that you remember?\n* Did we take any business cards or flyers from the bakery?\n\nBy asking Rachel these questions, you might be able to jog her memory and get some details that can help you find out more about the bakery. Good luck!",
