The input fields and dropdowns should have sufficient spacing between them to prevent confusion, and the save button should have sufficient prominence to draw the user's attention and encourage them to save their goal settings. The overall layout of the \"Goal Setting\" page should be clean, simple, and uncluttered, with clear and concise labels, to make it easy for the user to set their fitness goal, target, and time period."
