ABSTRACT\nTuberculosis (TB) imposes a major burden on global public health which is exacerbated by the escalating number of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases. There is consequently an urgent need for new anti-TB drugs and combination regimens. We have investigated the natural product antibiotic fusidic acid (FA) for repurposing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. Here, we report the results of synergy screens combining FA with a panel of approved anti-TB agents. Checkerboard and time-kill kinetics assays identified seven compounds from different chemical classes that synergized with FA in inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro: rifampicin (RIF), a rifamycin and frontline anti-TB drug; the macrolides, erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLR), and roxythromycin (ROX); the oxazolidinone, linezolid (LZD); the aminoglycoside, streptomycin (STR); and the aminocyclitol, spectinomycin (SPC). Among these, the strongest synergies were observed where FA was combined with SPC and ERY. Moreover, the FA-RIF combination was cidal, while all other FA combinations were bacteriostatic. These results provide in vitro evidence of the potential utility of FA-containing combinations against M. tuberculosis.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCombination therapy is essential to the clinical management of tuberculosis (TB) disease (1). Until recently, strategies to identify and advance promising combinations during early-stage pre-clinical TB drug discovery were limited. However, growing recognition of the need to identify new anti-TB drugs and regimens has re-focused attention on early-stage pre-clinical identification of synergizing combination partners for potential development (2), including drugs which are not clinically effective against TB (3, 4).\n\nAs part of a drug repurposing strategy, we utilized fusidic acid (FA) as anchor compound in developing matrix screening assays aimed at identifying optimal drug combination(s) that might be evaluated within the existing TB drug pipeline for potential clinical efficacy. FA, a translational inhibitor with demonstrated (albeit moderate) activity in vitro (5, 6), was selected owing to its unique mechanism of action: specifically, inhibition of mycobacterial protein synthesis by binding to elongation factor G (EF-G) (7). The antimicrobial-potentiating effect of FA with other antibiotics including the frontline anti-TB drug, ethambutol (EMB), as well as its lack of cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes, provided additional motivation for our choice of FA (8, 9). In this short report, we present the analysis of in vitro interactions between FA and partner compounds comprising drugs currently used in TB treatment and selected translational inhibitors, the latter selected to enable evaluation the effects of combining FA with drugs acting on the same pathway (Fig. 1), (10, 11).\n\nFigure 1.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nAntibiotic targets in protein synthesis:\nSchematic representation indicating known and predicted target sites of antibiotics disrupting different stages in the (myco)bacterial translation pathway.

In standard two-drug checkerboard experiments (Table S1), SPC, ERY, CLR and TET exhibited synergy with FA, defined as FICI \u2264 0.5. These combinations displayed a 4-to 16-fold reduction in MIC90 for each of the individual drugs (Fig. S1). No antagonistic effects were observed with any of the combinations tested.\n\nThe synergies detected in M. smegmatis informed subsequent selection of combination partners for evaluation in M. tuberculosis using the checkerboard method. In addition, representative drugs consisting of clinically used anti-TB agents (first- and second-line) and selected translational inhibitors were tested in combination with FA. For these assays, a M. tuberculosis H37Rv reporter strain expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used, as described previously (12). Fig. S2 provides an example of an interaction study in which FA and ERY were analysed in the checkerboard assay. Results in Table 1 show similarity to those obtained for M. smegmatis, such that SPC, ERY and CLR exhibited synergy with FA against M. tuberculosis. The combination of FA and ERY returned a FICI value of 0.25, indicating a synergistic interaction (Fig. S2A). Other drugs that synergized with FA included RIF, STR, roxithromycin (ROX), and LZD. These synergistic interactions generally resulted in 4-to 8-fold reductions in the MICs of each drug within the combination. Even though the combination of FA and BDQ did not result in a FICI value of \u2264 0.5, it is important to note that the two displayed approximately a 4-fold reduction in their respective MICs, and the observed FICI (0.55) was very close to that defined as \u201csynergy\u201d. No antagonistic interaction was observed between FA and any of the compounds tested. For the combinations exhibiting synergy with FA, isobolograms were constructed by plotting the FIC curves of the FA-drug combinations (Fig. S3). Interactions between FA and ERY, SPC, and RIF were well within the synergy region (FICI < 0.5) whereas FA with STR, LZD, and ROX indicated borderline synergy (FICI = 0.5). The FA-INH interaction was included as a \u201cno interaction\u201d control.\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 1.\nIn vitro synergistic interaction between FA and anti TB agents or selected translational inhibitors against M. tuberculosis::gfp\n\nTo confirm results obtained using the checkerboard assay, the strongly synergistic FA-ERY combination was evaluated in a growth inhibition assay (Fig. S4). For this purpose, FA and ERY were used at 0.3 and 27 \u00b5M, respectively, since these were the concentrations at which the lowest FICI value was obtained in the checkerboard assay (Fig. S2). RIF, at a concentration of 0.015 \u00b5M, was included as a control. In the absence of drug, the population of M. tuberculosis increased over 14 days post-inoculation. In contrast, the population of viable cells remained relatively constant over the same duration when the growth medium contained the FA and ERY combination. Similarly, the medium containing FA, ERY plus sub-MIC RIF did not display any increase in the number of viable bacterial population over a 14-day period. In contrast, cultures incubated in the presence of the individual antibiotics, FA or ERY, showed equivalent growth to the untreated control.\n\nAssessing synergistic and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of FA synergizing drugs for optimal therapy\nAs a key consideration for the clinical potential of FA combinations, the respective concentrations at which synergy was observed were compared with the reported peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) for each drug. This is important in understanding whether the concentrations required to achieve the desired response are therapeutically feasible \u2013 and, consequently, whether the results obtained from an in vitro assay have any utility in guiding therapeutic use. Except for the FA-ERY interaction, synergies between FA and its partners were achieved at concentrations predicted to be below the maximum plasma concentrations (13, 14), suggesting that these concentrations are therapeutically achievable (Fig. S5). For example, the presence of FA decreased the MIC of SPC from 201 \u00b5M to 3.14 \u00b5M, which represents a greater than 98% reduction in the MIC (Table S2). This reduced concentration is far below the Cmax value of SPC in humans (30.8 \u00b5M), determined following a 1000 mg intramuscular dose (15).\n\nAssessing cidal versus static synergies\nTo determine whether FA interactions resulted in killing or merely inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis, the method of Zhang et al. was utilized (16). INH, a bactericidal agent, was used as a reference drug, and all drugs were tested alone and in combination against the M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp bioreporter strain. Results for the bacteriostatic or cidal effects of the drug combinations with FA are illustrated (Figure 2). The FA-RIF combination displayed a MBC/MIC ratio of \u2264 2 on day 14 of evaluation, suggesting cidality. The other combinations tested \u2013 combining FA with SPC, ERY, CLR, ROX or LZD \u2013 all exhibited MBC/MIC ratios >2, implying static effects. The bacteriostatic/cidal action of individual drugs is shown in Fig. S6.\n\nFigure 2.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 2.\nBactericidal versus static effects of drug combinations against M. tuberculosis.\nAnalysis of FA in combination with synergizing drugs; ERY, SPC, CLR, ROX, RIF, and LZD.

Error bars indicate standard deviations, calculated from the mean of triplicate samples.\n\nFA synergizing partners are active against the FA-resistant mutant\nA cross-resistance study was performed using a FA-resistant M. tuberculosis mutant carrying H462Y mutation in fusA1(11). The FA-resistant mutant exhibited >100-fold MIC compared to the FA-susceptible parental strain. Six synergistic FA partner drugs \u2013 RIF, SPC, CLR, ERY, STR and ROX \u2013 were evaluated using the resazurin reduction microplate assay (REMA). The results (Fig. S7) indicated that the MIC90 values of these drugs remained the same against the FA-resistant mutant relative to the wild-type strain, confirming that there was no cross-resistance to each of the tested compounds.\n\nInteraction of FA synergizing partners with selected chemically unrelated compounds\nUsing a set of six chemically and structurally diverse drug agents (Table S3), a combination assay was performed with four drugs that had displayed synergistic interaction with FA: RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC. The aim was to determine whether these compounds displayed synergy only with FA or exhibited a wider spectrum of synergistic interactions. The results of these pairwise combinations (Figure 3) revealed potentiating interactions between all FA synergizing partners (except RIF) and THS, BDQ and CPZ. CLR displayed strong synergies with BDQ and CPZ (FICI = 0.23 in both cases). The interaction between SPC and INH was also synergistic, while the remaining compounds (EMB and MOX) exhibited no interactions in combination with RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC.\n\nFigure 3.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 3.\nDrug interaction study.\nPairwise interactions between selected drugs (blue fonts) and synergizing agents (black fonts) of FA (using M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp. Red panels indicate synergistic interactions (FICI \u2264 0.5), while green panels are no interaction (0.5 < FICI \u2264 4). The bars indicate the fold-reduction in MIC required to achieve the same effect in combination versus single-drug assays. For example, in the interaction between RIF and MOX, top right-hand panel, the FIC for RIF = 0.45 (black bar) and MOX = 0.9 (blue bar). The resulting FICI for RIF-MOX = 1.35 (green bar) which indicates an additive interaction. Data are from the representative experiment performed in duplicate."
