The United Front should identify the root cause of the conflict before addressing it.\n\n3. Encourage dialogue: The organization should encourage its members to discuss and deliberate their viewpoints and try to come up with a mutual solution based on shared values and interests. An open and honest dialogue-based approach can help resolve most conflicts in a fair and transparent manner.\n\n4. Involve a mediator where required: If the members are unable to resolve the conflict among themselves, the organization can seek the intervention of an impartial and neutral mediator to facilitate the conversation.\n\n5. Develop a conflict resolution policy: The United Front should have a conflict resolution policy that outlines the steps to be taken by all stakeholders in the event of a conflict. It should define the process for referring conflicts to a higher authority, including escalation and dispute resolution.\n\nBy adopting a structured approach to conflict management, the United Front can create a harmonious work environment that fosters healthy differences and diversity of thought while ensuring that the organization's values and objectives are not compromised."
