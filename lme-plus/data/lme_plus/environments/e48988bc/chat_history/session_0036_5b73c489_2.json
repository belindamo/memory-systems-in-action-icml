Getting a thoughtful gift for your coworkers can go a long way in building a positive and friendly work environment.\n\nI'd be happy to help you with some gift ideas for your colleagues. Since you mentioned you got a funny mug for David, I'll suggest some ideas that are similarly priced (around $10) or a bit more. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Gourmet Food Basket**: A nice basket filled with specialty teas, cookies, or chocolates is always appreciated. You can customize it according to your colleague's taste preferences. ($15-$25)\n2. **Desk Accessory**: A decorative paperweight, a fun mousepad, or a colorful pen holder can add some personality to their workspace. ($5-$15)\n3. **Coffee or Tea Gift Card**: A gift card to their favorite coffee shop or tea house is a thoughtful way to fuel their daily routine. ($5-$10)\n4. **Personalized Item**: A monogrammed notebook, a customized phone case, or a personalized keychain shows you put thought into the gift. ($10-$25)\n5. **Wine or Champagne**: If your workplace culture allows it, a nice bottle of wine or champagne is a classic way to celebrate a birthday. ($10-$30)\n6. **Book or Magazine**: If your colleague enjoys reading, consider gifting a bestselling book or a subscription to a magazine that aligns with their interests. ($10-$20)\n7. **Fun Experience**: Gift your colleague an experience, like tickets to a local event, a cooking class, or a fun activity, like rock climbing or bowling. (prices vary)\n8. **Plant or Succulent**: A small plant or succulent can brighten up their workspace and purify the air. ($5-$15)\n9. **Luxurious Candle**: A nice candle can create a cozy atmosphere and provide a relaxing break from work.

      "content": "You've already got the funny mug covered for David, and you don't want to duplicate the gift.\n\nA notebook or journal is an excellent alternative! It's a thoughtful and practical gift that your colleague can use daily. Plus, it's a great way to encourage them to jot down notes, ideas, or inspiration.\n\nA notebook or journal is also a more versatile gift, as it can be used for various purposes, such as:\n\n1. Meeting notes or to-do lists\n2. Creative writing or brainstorming\n3. Sketching or doodling\n4. Goal setting or reflection\n\nWhen choosing a notebook or journal, consider the following:\n\n1. **Size**: A smaller notebook (A5 or 5x7 inches) is great for daily carry, while a larger one (A4 or 8x10 inches) is better for desk use.\n2. **Cover design**: Opt for a simple, yet stylish design that resonates with your colleague's personality or interests.\n3. **Paper quality**: Look for high-quality paper that's smooth to write on and minimizes bleed-through.\n4. **Binding**: A sewn binding or a high-quality spiral binding ensures the notebook lies flat when open.\n\nYou can find notebooks and journals in various price ranges, but for around $10, you can get a nice, quality one. Some popular brands include Moleskine, Leuchtturm1917, and Rhodia.\n\nWhat do you think? Is a notebook or journal the perfect addition to your gourmet food basket?"
