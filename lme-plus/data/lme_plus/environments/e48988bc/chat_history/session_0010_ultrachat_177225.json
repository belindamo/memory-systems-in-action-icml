However, I can provide a general answer based on how collaborations can work successfully.\n\nSuccessful collaboration between departments is critical to achieving organizational objectives. The following are some examples of what can contribute to successful collaborations:\n\n1. Common Goals: Both departments must have a clear understanding of the goal(s) they are working towards.

Departments must communicate frequently and effectively to ensure that everyone is working towards the same objectives.\n\n3. Mutual Trust and Respect: Collaboration is more effective when there is mutual trust and respect between departments. It allows each department to have the confidence that the other will do their part to achieve common goals.\n\n4. Clear Roles and Responsibilities: The roles and responsibilities of each department must be clearly defined to avoid confusion and prevent any overlap in activities.\n\n5. Openness to New Ideas: An open-minded approach brings agility, innovation, and flexibility to collaboration.

By identifying and addressing conflicts early on and adopting a practical approach, the parties involved can find a mutually beneficial solution."
