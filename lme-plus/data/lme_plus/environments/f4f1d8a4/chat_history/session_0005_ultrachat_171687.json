However, below is a general guide on the milestones/stages of a typical PhD program and the duration of each one, based on research and feedback from PhD students:\n\n1. Orientation: This stage varies among universities, but usually takes a few weeks to a month. It involves getting to know the program, the faculty, the facilities and any initial coursework.\n\n2. Coursework and Literature Review: This stage usually takes 1-2 years, depending upon the program and the student's proficiency. It focuses on research methodologies, data analysis, and the critical analysis of existing research.\n\n3. Candidacy Exam: This exam is usually taken after completing the coursework, but before beginning the dissertation research. It involves demonstrating in-depth knowledge of the chosen research area and research plans. The exam may be oral or written or both. Typically, it takes 6 months to a year to prepare for this exam.\n\n4. Research and Experimentation: This stage is usually the meat of the PhD program, as it involves conducting research and experimentation. The duration of this stage varies widely depending on the research area, funding sources, and the complexity of experiments involved. It can take 2-5 years.\n\n5. Dissertation writing and Defense: Writing and defending the dissertation are the final and most significant milestones of the PhD program. Writing a dissertation takes 1-2 years on average, but it may take longer for some individuals. The final step is the dissertation defense, where the student presents their research to a panel of faculty members in front of an audience. The length of the defense varies depending upon the student's research, the committee's feedback, and the university's standard practices.\n\nOverall, a typical PhD program takes anywhere from 4 to 8 years, depending on various factors, including the individual student's pace, their research area, funding, and program requirements."
