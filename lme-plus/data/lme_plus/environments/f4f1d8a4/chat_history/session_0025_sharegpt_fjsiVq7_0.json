Buffetize - a combination of \"buffet\" and \"visualize\", suggesting the act of visually surveying a buffet before making selections.\n2. Spreadscope - a combination of \"spread\" and \"periscope\", implying a sweeping visual survey of a food spread.\n3. Platemap - a combination of \"plate\" and \"map\", suggesting a mental mapping of the buffet layout before choosing items for one's plate.\n4. Culinary reconnaissance - This one is not a portmanteau, but it does have a nice ring to it and captures the idea of visually scouting out a buffet before making selections."
