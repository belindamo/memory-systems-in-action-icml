  "content": "That's really insightful! I've seen how festivals can help launch films and generate buzz, but I didn't realize the extent to which they factor into a film's distribution strategy. As someone who's attended Sundance and volunteered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, I've had a great experience seeing films and meeting industry professionals. Speaking of which, I'm actually preparing for the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, which takes place from May 1st to 8th. Do you have any advice on how to make the most of a festival like that?",
