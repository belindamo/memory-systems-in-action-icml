Keep your episodes concise and engaging.\n\n**6. Create a podcast artwork**:\nDesign an eye-catching cover art that represents your podcast's brand. The recommended size is 1400 x 1400 pixels.\n\n**7. Write a compelling podcast description and tags**:\nCraft a descriptive title, subtitle, and summary that accurately represent your podcast. Use relevant keywords to help people find your show.\n\n**8. Publish your podcast**:\nUpload your episodes to your chosen hosting platform and submit your podcast to popular directories like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.\n\n**9. Promote your podcast**:\nShare your podcast on social media, your website, and other online platforms. Reach out to potential guests, collaborators, or reviewers to grow your audience.\n\n**10.
