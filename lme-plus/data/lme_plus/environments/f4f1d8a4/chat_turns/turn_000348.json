I'm sure your new vase is going to be stunning!\n\nSharing your process and sneak peeks on social media is a great way to build anticipation and excitement for your art fair. An Instagram story or Facebook live video can give your followers a behind-the-scenes look at your creative process and make them feel more invested in your work. Make sure to use relevant hashtags and tag any relevant accounts to increase your reach!\n\nRegarding custom commissions, that's a fantastic idea! Creating a separate page on your website or social media profiles dedicated to custom commissions can help you showcase your capabilities and make it easy for potential clients to find and contact you. You could include examples of previous custom work, testimonials, and a clear call-to-action for people to inquire about commissions.\n\nAlternatively, you could create a dedicated email address or contact form specifically for custom commission inquiries. This will help you keep track of requests and respond to them efficiently.\n\nWhen advertising custom commissions through your regular channels, make sure to highlight the benefits of working with you, such as:\n\n* Unique, one-of-a-kind pieces tailored to their specific needs and preferences\n* The opportunity to collaborate with an artist to bring their vision to life\n* The value of owning a handmade, high-quality piece of art that will last for years to come\n\nYou could also consider offering different tiers of custom commissions, with varying levels of complexity and pricing. This will give clients options and make your services more accessible to a wider range of people.\n\nWhat do you think? Does that sound like a good starting point for your custom commission venture?",
