  "content": "There are many examples of films where the screenplay helped shape the visual aesthetic. Another recent and notable example is \"Parasite\" (2019), directed by Bong Joon-ho and co-written with Han Jin-won. The film's screenplay plays a significant role in creating the visually striking and symbolic details that are woven throughout the movie. For instance, the screenplay specifies the semi-basement dwelling where the Kim family lives and where much of the key action takes place. This setting functions as a central metaphor for the class division in South Korean society, with the dark, cramped basement representing the damp, impoverished conditions of the working-class, while the rich inhabit the open, bright spaces in the upper city. Other examples include the meticulously designed set pieces, like the Parks' expansive living room or the luxurious bathroom where Kim's friend struggles to hide, which all serve to emphasize social hierarchies present throughout the film. \n\nAnother example is \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" (2015) directed by George Miller, where the protracted visual sequences are achieved by precise descriptions of the detailed action in the script. The descriptive language in the script informed the bold color choices, vehicle designs and action choreography of the film, resulting in a visually stunning action movie. \n\nIn conclusion, the screenplay can have an enormous impact on a film's visual style and setting the tone for key elements of the film's visual design.",
