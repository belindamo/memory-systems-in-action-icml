  "content": "Adding Dean's List awards is a great way to showcase your academic achievements.\n\nWhen including Dean's List awards on your LinkedIn profile, you can mention them in the \"Education\" section or create a separate \"Awards\" or \"Achievements\" section. Here are some suggestions on how to phrase it:\n\n**Option 1: Education Section**\n\n* **Bachelor's/Master's Degree in [Field of Study], [University Name]**\n\t+ Graduated with [GPA, if 3.5 or higher] while earning Dean's List honors in [Semester/Year] and [Semester/Year].\n\n**Option 2: Awards Section**\n\n* **Dean's List Awards**\n\t+ Received Dean's List honors for outstanding academic achievement in [Semester/Year] and [Semester/Year] at [University Name].\n\n**Option 3: Achievements Section**\n\n* **Academic Achievements**\n\t+ Earned Dean's List recognition for academic excellence in [Semester/Year] and [Semester/Year] while pursuing my [Degree Level, Field of Study] at [University Name].\n\nWhen deciding how to phrase it, consider the following:\n\n1. Be concise: Keep the description brief and to the point.\n2. Include the relevant details: Mention the university, the semester/year, and the fact that it's a Dean's List award.\n3. Use action verbs: Verbs like \"Earned,\" \"Received,\" \"Graduated with,\" or \"Achieved\" help to make your description more dynamic.\n\nRemember to customize the phrase to fit your experience and the style of your LinkedIn profile.\n\nAs a side note, since the awards are from 2013 and 2014, you might consider whether they're still relevant to your current career goals and experience. If you have more recent achievements, you might want to prioritize those. However, if you feel that the Dean's List awards are still an important part of your academic background and relevant to your professional brand, go ahead and include them!",
