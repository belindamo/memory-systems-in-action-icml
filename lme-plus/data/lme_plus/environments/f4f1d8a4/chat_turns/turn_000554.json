It's called Fleur.\n\nFleur is a brand that I created with my classmates, we're all passionate about taking care of our skin and the environment. We found that there was a gap in the market for affordable and sustainable skincare options that align with our values of being animal-friendly, plant-based, environmentally conscious, and inclusive. So, we set out to create a brand that would fill that gap.\n\nWe offer a range of skincare products that include:\n\n* Butterfly Cleanse, a gentle, non-drying everyday use facial cleanser that is perfect for all skin types.\n* Hibiscus Dew, a moisturizing facial serum that helps to improve the skin's elasticity and firmness, leaving the skin looking and feeling hydrated.\n* Golden Glow, a versatile sunscreen balm with spf50PA++, providing broad-spectrum sun protection, it leaves no white cast and is not heavy, making it perfect for everyday use.\n\nAll our products are cruelty-free, vegan-friendly, sustainable and inclusive. They are made with natural ingredients that are sourced ethically and sustainably, and we strive to minimize our impact on the environment throughout all stages of production.\n\nWe're so excited to share Fleur with you and we can't wait to hear your feedback. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our story, and we hope you'll consider trying out our products.\"",
