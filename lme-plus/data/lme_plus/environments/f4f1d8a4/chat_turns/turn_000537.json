  "content": "Yes, there are many popular songs that rely more on melody than harmony to create a memorable tune. One example is \"My Heart Will Go On\" by Celine Dion from the movie Titanic. The melody of the song is simple but powerful, and the accompaniment consists mainly of sustained chords played on a keyboard, which provides minimal harmony. The song is a great example of how a strong melody can stand on its own without complex harmonies.",
