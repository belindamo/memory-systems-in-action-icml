Here's an idea for a layout of the Booking page:\n\n---\n\n| Booking Information |\n-----------------------\n\n| Destination Information |\n---------------------------\n\n| Travel Date Selection |\n-------------------------\n\n| Accommodation Selection |\n---------------------------\n\n| Transportation Selection |\n----------------------------\n\n| Activity Selection |\n----------------------\n\n| Payment and Checkout |\n------------------------\n\nThe Booking page should prominently display the Booking Information section, which summarizes the user's travel details and allows them to make changes if necessary. The Destination Information section should provide additional details about the selected destination, including weather patterns, climate, and best times to visit.\n\nThe Travel Date Selection section should allow the user to select their preferred travel dates, with options for flexible dates and date ranges. The Accommodation Selection section should display options for hotels, resorts, and other accommodations, with filters for price range, amenities, and location.\n\nThe Transportation Selection section should allow the user to select their preferred mode of transportation, with options for flights, car rentals, and other transportation options. The Activity Selection section should display recommendations for activities and attractions that are suitable for the user's selected destination and travel dates.\n\nFinally, the Payment and Checkout section should provide a secure and user-friendly interface for the user to complete their booking and payment information, with options for promotional codes and discounts if applicable.",
