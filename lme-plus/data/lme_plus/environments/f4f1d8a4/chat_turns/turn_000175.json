  "content": "Keeping your mouth clean is an important part of the healing process after wisdom teeth removal. In addition to rinsing with salt water, you can also brush your teeth and use oral fluids to help keep your mouth clean. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. Rinse with salt water: Rinse your mouth gently with salt water several times a day, especially after meals. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water and swish it around your mouth for 30 seconds before spitting it out.\n2. Brush your teeth gently: Brush your teeth gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Be careful around the extraction site, and avoid brushing too hard or using a toothpaste that contains harsh ingredients.\n3. Use an oral rinse: You can also use an antimicrobial oral rinse, like chlorhexidine, to help kill bacteria and promote healing. Follow the instructions on the label and be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly.\n4. Avoid using a straw: Drinking through a straw can dislodge the blood clot that forms in the socket after the tooth is removed, which can delay healing. Avoid using a straw for at least 24-48 hours after the surgery.\n5. Don't spit or rinse vigorously: Avoid spitting or rinsing your mouth vigorously, as this can also dislodge the blood clot and delay healing. Instead, let the water or oral rinse gently flow out of your mouth.\n\nRemember to be gentle when cleaning your mouth, especially around the extraction site, as it can be sensitive and tender. If you experience any pain, bleeding, or unusual symptoms while cleaning your mouth, contact your dentist or oral surgeon immediately.",
