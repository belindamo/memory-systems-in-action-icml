  "content": "Yes, it\u2019s possible for a piece of music to have a melody without harmony or vice versa. Here\u2019s how they sound like:\n\nMelody without harmony: In this case, the music has a single line of notes played or sung one after the other. Since there is no accompaniment, the melody stands out clearly. Examples of such music are traditional folk songs or a capella singing.\n\nHarmony without melody: This type of music is mostly found in instrumental music where there are multiple notes played simultaneously without any clear melody. An example of such music is a drone, a continuous note or chord played on a bagpipe or a tanpura. \n\nHowever, most commonly music has both melody and harmony, which complement each other to create a more immersive musical experience.",
