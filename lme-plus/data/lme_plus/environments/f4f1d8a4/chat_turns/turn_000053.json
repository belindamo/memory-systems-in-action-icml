  "content": "Participation in the decennial census is required by law, as it is mandated by the Constitution. However, the Census Bureau takes a non-coercive approach to encourage participation and typically does not enforce penalties for non-participation. Instead, the Census Bureau relies on education and outreach efforts to convey the importance of participating in the census and ensuring that everyone is counted.\n\nIf a household does not respond to the census, the Census Bureau may send a follow-up enumerator to the household to collect the required information. If the household still refuses to participate, the Census Bureau cannot force them to participate, but may use other available data sources to try to estimate the population count for that area.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that participation in the census is crucial for ensuring that communities receive their appropriate share of federal funding for important programs and services. In addition, the census is also used for political redistricting, which can impact representation in government. Therefore, participating in the census is an important civic duty for all residents of the United States.",
