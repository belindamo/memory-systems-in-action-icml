  "content": "I'm sorry to hear that you're still having trouble with the CBC solver in Pyomo. The error you're seeing indicates that Pyomo is unable to locate the CBC solver executable on your system.\n\nHere are a few things to check:\n\n1. Make sure that you have installed CBC on your system. You can do this by running the following command in a code cell:\n```csharp\n!apt-get install -y -qq coinor-cbc\n```\n2. Make sure that the CBC executable is in your system path. You can check whether the CBC executable is in your system path by running the following command in a code cell:\n```bash\n!which cbc\n```\nIf the output is empty, then CBC is not in your system path. You can add CBC to your system path by running the following command in a code cell:\n```lua\nimport os\nos.environ['PATH'] += ':/usr/bin'\n```\nThis command adds the `/usr/bin` directory to your system path, which is where the CBC executable is installed on Google Colab.\n3. Make sure that the CBC solver interface is installed in Pyomo. You can install the CBC solver interface in Pyomo by running the following command in a code cell:\n```css\n!pip install pyomo[solvers]\n```\n\nOnce you have verified these steps, you should be able to solve your Pyomo model with the CBC solver. If you're still having issues, please let me know and I can try to help further.",
