However, it's important to keep in mind that there are many things you can do to reduce your exposure and minimize the impact they have on your health.\n\nMaking some lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy, balanced diet, staying hydrated, getting enough exercise and rest, and reducing stress can all have a positive impact on your overall health and help to support your body's natural detoxification processes. \n\nIt's also important to remember that reducing your exposure to toxins is not an all-or-nothing approach. Making small, gradual changes can have a cumulative effect over time. So, take things one step at a time and focus on making small, achievable changes that you feel comfortable with.\n\nFinally, it can be helpful to reframe your thinking from a place of fear and frustration to a place of empowerment.
