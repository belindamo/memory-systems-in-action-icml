However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal information or your car's maintenance history. I don't know when you last got a full tank of gas or how much it cost you.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you:\n\n1. Check your gas receipts: If you keep your gas receipts, you can look through them to find the last time you got a full tank of gas and how much it cost you.\n2. Check your car's maintenance records: If you have a maintenance log or records, you can review them to see when your car was last serviced and what work was done.\n3. Contact your mechanic: If you have a regular mechanic or service center, you can contact them to see if they have records of your car's maintenance history.\n4. Use a fuel log app: If you use a fuel log app like Fuelly or GasBuddy, you can check your fuel history to see when you last got a full tank of gas and how much it cost you.\n\nOnce you have that information, you can schedule a maintenance check with your mechanic or service center. It's great that you're staying on top of your car's maintenance!",
