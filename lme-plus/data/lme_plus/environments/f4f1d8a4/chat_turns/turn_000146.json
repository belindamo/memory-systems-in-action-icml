After a careful look at the studies, we came to the conclusion that so far, daily intermittent fasting seems to be quite safe for the majority of people.\n\nOne question that pops up now and then is the question about the effect of IF on bone health, so when we came across this recent review of the literature on this very topic, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, it caught our attention. \n\nIt\u2019s important to understand what a review of the literature means in that the authors did not conduct a research study of their own but looked at multiple studies on bone density and intermittent fasting, which were pulled from the MEDLINE database until the 30th of September 2022. These review studies can be quite helpful in looking at the overall picture of a particular topic of interest, in this case, bone health and intermittent fasting.\n\nThe authors included studies that looked at various kinds of IF protocols, including the 5:2 diet, alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted eating (TRE) on bone health. Many of these animal studies used intermittent fasting and other practices already known to harm bone health, and the authors admit these results would be very difficult to extrapolate to humans. \n\nThe observational studies in humans do suggest some sort of a link between some IF practices, such as skipping breakfast, and a compromise in bone health, but there was no control for what are known as confounding factors, so again, the data are difficult to interpret and to apply broadly. An observational study is one in which the researchers do not make any active experimental intervention.\n\nThe results of the interventional studies that were included do suggest that time-restricted eating protocols up to six months (which both Denise and I practice) do not adversely affect bone health and, in fact, may have some modest protective effect. Studies that looked at ADF showed no negative effects on bone health, and no studies looked at the 5:2 diet and bone health outcomes. \n\nIn addition, the authors point out that these interventional studies are limited by \u201c\u2026short duration, small and diverse population samples, assessment of total body bone mass exclusively (by DXA) and inadequate control of factors that may affect bone outcomes, making the interpretation of existing data challenging.\u201d \n\nNo surprise here that much more research is needed in this area to make a definite call.\n\nIn the meantime, we say fast on! And, do all the things we currently know to protect the health of your bones, meaning adequate Vitamin D, adequate calcium intake from calcium-rich foods as well as Vitamin K2, and strength training along with weight-bearing exercise.",
