  "content": "Substituting simple syrup with honey syrup or agave syrup is a great idea, and it's definitely doable. However, it will change the flavor profile of the Rosemary Gin Fizz slightly. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Honey Syrup:**\n\n* Honey syrup will add a richer, more complex flavor to the cocktail, with notes of floral, herbal, and slightly sweet undertones.\n* Honey's flavor profile will complement the rosemary's herbal notes, creating a harmonious and balanced taste experience.\n* Keep in mind that honey syrup is sweeter than simple syrup, so you may want to adjust the amount used depending on your personal taste preferences.\n\n**Agave Syrup:**\n\n* Agave syrup will add a slightly sweet, mild flavor with hints of citrus and a touch of earthy undertones.\n* Agave syrup is generally milder than honey syrup, so it won't overpower the rosemary flavor.\n* Agave syrup is a good choice if you want to maintain a lighter, more refreshing flavor profile.\n\n**Other Sweetener Options:**\n\n* **Maple Syrup:** Similar to honey syrup, maple syrup will add a rich, complex flavor with notes of earthy, woody, and slightly sweet undertones.\n* **Gomme Syrup:** A sweetener made from gum arabic, gomme syrup adds a smooth, velvety texture and a subtle sweetness. It's a good choice if you want to maintain a light, refreshing flavor profile.\n* **Monin Syrup:** A sweetener made from natural ingredients, Monin syrup is available in various flavors, including rosemary. It's a good choice if you want to enhance the rosemary flavor without adding other flavor profiles.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* When substituting simple syrup with another sweetener, start with a smaller amount and adjust to taste. Some sweeteners are sweeter than others, so it's better to err on the side of caution.\n* Experiment with different sweetener ratios to find the perfect balance for your taste preferences.\n* Remember that the type of sweetener you choose will affect the overall flavor profile of the cocktail. Choose a sweetener that complements the other ingredients and enhances the rosemary flavor.\n\nNow, go ahead and experiment with different sweeteners in the Rosemary Gin Fizz recipe!",
