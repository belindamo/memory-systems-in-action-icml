Here are some pros and cons of starting with close friends versus acquaintances:\n\n**Close friends:**\n\nPros:\n\n* You already have a strong foundation of trust and familiarity, making it easier to pick up where you left off.\n* They might be more likely to respond quickly and be willing to catch up.\n* You can dive deeper into meaningful conversations and share more personal thoughts and feelings.\n\nCons:\n\n* You might feel more pressure to have a \"perfect\" conversation or update them on everything that's been happening in your life.\n* If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling with mental health, you might not feel ready to open up to someone close to you.\n\n**Acquaintances:**\n\nPros:\n\n* It can be less intimidating to reach out to someone you're not as close to, helping you build momentum and confidence.\n* You can start with a casual conversation and see where it goes, without feeling like you need to delve into deep topics.\n* You might be able to reconnect with someone who's been on the periphery of your social circle and strengthen that connection.\n\nCons:\n\n* You might not have as much to talk about or feel like you're starting from scratch.\n* They might not respond or be as interested in catching up, which could be discouraging.\n\nConsider starting with someone who's in between \u2013 maybe a friend you're not extremely close to, but still have a good relationship with. This can help you ease into reconnecting and build your way up to closer friends.\n\nAnother approach is to start with a low-stakes message, like responding to a post or comment on social media, or sending a funny meme or article to someone. This can help you get back into the habit of reaching out and break the ice without feeling too much pressure.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there someone in particular who comes to mind, or do you want to start with a smaller, low-stakes interaction?",
