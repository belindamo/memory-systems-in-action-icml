By creating separate projects for each of your goals and breaking them down into smaller tasks, you'll be able to tackle each project in a structured and manageable way.\n\nSetting reminders and deadlines will also help you stay on track and ensure that you're making progress towards your goals. Regularly reviewing your progress and adjusting your schedule as needed will help you stay flexible and adapt to any changes or challenges that come up.\n\nRemember to also use Todoist's labeling and prioritization features to further organize and focus your tasks. You can label tasks by project, category, or priority, and use the priority levels to ensure that you're tackling the most important tasks first.\n\nAdditionally, consider using Todoist's \"Project Templates\" feature to create a template for your personal projects. This will allow you to create a standardized structure for each project, making it easier to track progress and stay organized.\n\nIt's also great that you're thinking about reviewing your progress regularly. This will help you stay motivated and see how far you've come. You can use Todoist's \"Progress\" feature to track your progress and celebrate your accomplishments.\n\nHow often do you plan to review your progress, and what kind of adjustments do you think you might need to make to your schedule as you go along?",
