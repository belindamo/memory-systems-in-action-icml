Here are some tips and insider knowledge to help you navigate Tsukiji like a pro:\n\n**Tsukiji Outer Market (J\u014dgai Shij\u014d)**\n\n* This is the area you'll want to focus on, as it's open to the public and offers a variety of food, souvenirs, and sights.\n* Try to arrive early, as it can get crowded quickly. Aim for around 8-9 am to beat the crowds.\n* **Sushi for breakfast:** Yes, you read that right! Try some of the freshest sushi you'll ever have at one of the many restaurants in the outer market. Sushi Dai and Daiwa Sushi are two popular options, but be prepared for long lines.\n* **Fresh seafood:** Take a stroll around the market and try some fresh seafood, such as grilled scallops, uni (sea urchin), or ikura (salmon roe).\n* **Tamago (Japanese omelette):** Try a freshly made tamago at one of the many stalls. It's a delicious and filling snack.\n* **Beware of scams:** Some vendors might try to sell you overpriced or low-quality goods. Be cautious and stick to reputable stalls.\n\n**Tsukiji Inner Market (J\u014dnai Shij\u014d)**\n\n* This area is primarily for wholesalers and professionals, but you can take a guided tour if you're interested in seeing the fish auctions (more on that below).\n* **Fish auctions:** The inner market is famous for its tuna auctions, but these have been moved to a new location called Toyosu Market. If you're interested in seeing the auctions, you'll need to take a guided tour or visit Toyosu Market instead.\n\n**Tips and Precautions**\n\n* **Get there early:** As mentioned earlier, the outer market can get crowded quickly. Arrive early to beat the crowds and make the most of your visit.\n* **Wear comfortable shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking, so wear comfortable shoes and dress appropriately for the weather.\n* **Be respectful:** Tsukiji is a working market, so be respectful of the vendors and workers. Avoid taking photos of the inner market or fish auctions without permission.\n* **Avoid visiting during peak seasons:** If you can, try to avoid visiting during peak seasons like cherry blossom season or Golden Week, as the market can get extremely crowded.\n\n**Changes to Tsukiji Fish Market**\n\n* As mentioned earlier, the inner market has moved to Toyosu Market, which is located about 3.5 km away from Tsukiji.\n* The outer market remains at Tsukiji, but some vendors have moved to Toyosu as well.\n\nGetting to Tsukiji:\n\n* Take the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line to Tsukiji-shij\u014d Station (Exit 1 or 2).\n* From Shibuya, take the JR Yamanote Line to Shimbashi Station, then transfer to the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line to Tsukiji-shij\u014d Station.\n\nNow that you're armed with these tips, you're ready to tackle Tsukiji Fish Market like a pro! Enjoy your visit and try some of the freshest seafood you'll ever have.",
