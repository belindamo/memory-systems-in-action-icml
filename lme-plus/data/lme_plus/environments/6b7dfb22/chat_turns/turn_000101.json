Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things \u2013 it's all part of the creative process.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. Otherwise, I wish you all the best with your project and your new studio space. Have fun and enjoy the process!\n\n(And don't forget to take care of yourself and stay hydrated while you're working on your project. It's easy to get caught up in the creative process and forget to take care of your physical and mental health.)",
