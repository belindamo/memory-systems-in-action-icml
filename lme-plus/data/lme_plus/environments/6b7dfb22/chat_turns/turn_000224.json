Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Cushioning:**\n\nThe Brooks Ghost features a BioMoGo DNA midsole, which provides excellent cushioning and shock absorption. This midsole is designed to adapt to your individual running style, so it will feel customized to your foot strike and stride. The Ghost also has a Segmented Crash Pad, which is a specialized midsole design that helps to smooth out your heel-to-toe transition, reducing the impact on your joints.\n\nThe Ghost has a generous amount of cushioning, especially in the heel and forefoot. This makes it an excellent choice for runners who need a soft, comfortable ride. The cushioning is also responsive, so you'll feel like you're getting a bit of spring back with each step.\n\n**Support:**\n\nWhile the Ghost is considered a neutral shoe, it does offer some support features to help guide your foot during your run.
