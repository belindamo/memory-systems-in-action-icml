  "content": "I'll set aside a few hours each day to review my notes and practice what I learned during the coding bootcamp. I'll start by reviewing the basics of JavaScript, such as data types, variables, and control structures, and then move on to more advanced topics like functions and object-oriented programming. I'll also practice building small projects, like a simple calculator or a to-do list app, to apply what I learned and develop my problem-solving skills. Additionally, I'll use online resources, such as tutorials and coding challenges, to supplement my learning and stay motivated.\n\nOne area I want to focus on is improving my understanding of JavaScript syntax and semantics. During the bootcamp, I sometimes struggled with understanding the nuances of JavaScript, so I want to make sure I have a solid grasp of the language fundamentals. I'll practice writing clean, modular code and focus on best practices for coding style and organization.\n\nAnother area I want to focus on is building a habit of regular coding practice. I know that",
