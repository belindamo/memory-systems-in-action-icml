  "content": "Wonderful decision to write your own vows! It's a beautiful way to express your love and commitment to each other. I'm happy to help you get started.\n\nWriting your own vows can be a therapeutic and intimate experience. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Start by brainstorming**: Take some time to reflect on your relationship, your partner, and your feelings. Jot down memories, inside jokes, and special moments that come to mind.\n2. **Identify your love story**: Think about how you met, your first date, and the moments that made you realize you were meant to be together. This will help you tap into the emotions and sentiments you want to express.\n3. **Determine your tone**: Decide on the tone you want to convey in your vows. Do you want to be romantic, funny, heartfelt, or a mix of everything?\n4. **Use sensory details**: Incorporate sensory details that evoke emotions, such as the way your partner's smile makes you feel, the sound of their laughter, or the scent of their perfume.\n5. **Be honest and authentic**: Your vows should be a reflection of your true feelings, so don't be afraid to be vulnerable and honest. Share your fears, hopes, and dreams with your partner.\n6. **Keep it personal**: Avoid clich\u00e9s and generic phrases. Instead, focus on specific moments, memories, and qualities that make your relationship unique.\n7. **Practice and revise**: Write multiple drafts, and don't be afraid to revise. Read your vows out loud to yourself, and make adjustments until they feel natural and authentic.\n8. **Keep it concise**: Aim for a length that feels comfortable for you, but generally, 1-2 minutes is a good range.\n\nSome prompts to get you started:\n\n* What do you love and appreciate most about your partner?\n* How has your partner changed you or helped you grow?\n* What are your hopes and dreams for your future together?\n* What promises do you want to make to your partner?\n* What do you cherish most about your relationship?\n\nRemember, your vows are a personal expression of your love, so don't worry too much about grammar, syntax, or perfection. Focus on speaking from your heart, and your partner will cherish every word.\n\nHow do you feel about writing your own vows now? Is there anything specific you're struggling with or would like more guidance on?",
