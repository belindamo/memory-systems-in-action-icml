Since you mentioned you haven't had a chance to order them yet, let's set a reminder for you to do so soon.\n\nTo help me better understand your ordering schedule, can you tell me:\n\n1. How often do you usually order the freeze-dried chicken treats for Luna?\n2. How long does a pack of treats typically last her?\n3. Would you like me to remind you to order more treats at a specific interval (e.g., every 2 weeks, monthly)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you set up a reminder system to ensure you never run out of Luna's favorite treats!",
