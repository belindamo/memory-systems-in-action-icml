  "content": "Great! Let's move on to the second question.\n\n**Question 2:** Share the problems you solve, for whom, and how. Highlight the impact of doing your job well vs. not as well.\n\n*Answer example:* As a marketing specialist, I help businesses solve a variety of problems related to their marketing efforts. This includes developing effective marketing strategies, creating engaging content, managing social media accounts, and measuring results to optimize campaigns. I work with businesses of all sizes, from small startups to large corporations, and my goal is always to help them achieve their marketing objectives.\n\nWhen I do my job well, I help businesses increase brand awareness, generate leads, and ultimately increase revenue. On the other hand, if I don't do my job well, businesses may struggle to connect with their target audience, miss out on potential leads, and ultimately lose revenue.\n\n**Help and Guidance:** This question is an opportunity to talk about the problems you solve and the impact you have on businesses. Think about the specific challenges you help businesses overcome and the results you achieve. You can also talk about your target audience and the types of businesses you work with. Finally, be sure to highlight the benefits of doing your job well versus not doing it well.",
