  "content": "The Italian-Style marinade is a classic and delicious choice. \n\nCooking chicken breast in the Instant Pot is a great way to prepare it, as it helps retain moisture and tenderness. Here's a basic guide to cooking chicken breast in the Instant Pot:\n\n**Instant Pot Chicken Breast Cooking Guide:**\n\n1. **Add liquid**: Add 1-2 cups of liquid to the Instant Pot, such as chicken broth, water, or a combination of both. This will help create steam and cook the chicken evenly.\n2. **Add chicken**: Place the marinated chicken breast in the Instant Pot, making sure it's not overlapping or crowded.\n3. **Close and seal**: Close the lid and make sure the valve is set to \"SEALING\".\n4. **Cooking time**: Cook on high pressure for 8-12 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of the chicken breast.\n5. **Let pressure release**: Let the pressure release naturally for 5-10 minutes, then quick-release any remaining pressure.\n6. **Check temperature**: Check the internal temperature of the chicken breast with a meat thermometer. It should reach 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n7. **Let rest**: Let the chicken breast rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a trivet or steamer basket to elevate the chicken breast and prevent it from touching the bottom of the Instant Pot.\n* Add aromatics like onions, carrots, and celery to the Instant Pot for added flavor.\n* For a more tender chicken breast, cook it at low pressure or use the \"POULTRY\" mode on your Instant Pot.\n* If you prefer a crispy exterior, broil the chicken breast in the oven for 2-3 minutes after cooking in the Instant Pot.\n\nRemember to always follow safe food handling practices and cook the chicken breast to the recommended internal temperature to ensure food safety.\n\nI hope this helps!
