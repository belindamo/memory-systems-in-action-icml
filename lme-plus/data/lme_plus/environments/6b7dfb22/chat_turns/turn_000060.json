It's also great that you're considering the potential adjustments you might need to make to your schedule and task prioritization.\n\nBreaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks can be incredibly helpful when faced with a challenging task. And seeking help from others is a sign of strength, not weakness! Don't be afraid to ask for guidance or support when you need it.\n\nRe-evaluating priorities and delegating tasks are also great strategies for adjusting your schedule. By regularly reviewing your progress, you'll be able to identify areas where you need to make changes and make conscious decisions about how to allocate your time and resources.\n\nNow, about using a \"done\" list...\n\nA \"done\" list is an excellent idea! While to-do lists are great for tracking tasks you need to complete, a \"done\" list can help you celebrate your accomplishments and see how far you've come. It can be incredibly motivating to see a list of tasks you've completed, and it can help you stay encouraged and motivated.\n\nYou can use a \"done\" list in conjunction with Todoist by creating a separate project or label for completed tasks. This way, you can easily track your progress and reflect on your accomplishments.\n\nRemember to also acknowledge and celebrate your small wins, not just the big ones. Celebrating small victories can help you stay motivated and encouraged, even when faced with challenging tasks or projects.\n\nHow do you plan to celebrate your accomplishments and milestones along the way?",
