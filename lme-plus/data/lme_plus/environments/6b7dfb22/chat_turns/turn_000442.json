  "content": "Attaching dividers to pockets can be a bit tricky, but there are ways to do it without adding bulk. Here are some suggestions to help you attach dividers to your pockets:\n\n**1. Glue and tape:**\n\n* Apply a small amount of fabric glue or hot glue to the back of the divider and attach it to the pocket. Hold the divider in place for a few seconds to ensure a strong bond.\n* Use double-sided tape or fabric tape to attach the divider to the pocket. This is a great option if you want to be able to remove the divider later.\n\n**2. Sewing:**\n\n* Topstitch the divider to the pocket using a contrasting thread color. This will create a decorative stitch line and attach the divider securely.\n* Use a whipstitch or a simple running stitch to attach the divider to the pocket. This will create a more subtle attachment.\n\n**3. Interfacing or stabilizer:**\n\n* Cut a piece of interfacing or stabilizer to fit the divider and attach it to the back of the divider using a hot iron or steam.\n* Place the divider in the pocket and attach the pocket sides together using glue, tape, or sewing. The interfacing or stabilizer will help keep the divider in place.\n\n**4. Pocket tabs:**\n\n* Cut small tabs from fabric or paper and attach them to the top of the divider using glue or sewing.\n* Attach the tabs to the pocket using glue, tape, or sewing. This will create a small \"handle\" for the divider.\n\n**5. Slotted dividers:**\n\n* Cut the divider with a slot or a channel at the top, allowing it to slide into the pocket.\n* Attach the divider to the pocket using glue, tape, or sewing, making sure the slot aligns with the top of the pocket.\n\nTo minimize bulk, use thin materials for the dividers, such as paper, cardstock, or lightweight fabric. You can also use a single layer of fabric or a lightweight interfacing to create the dividers.\n\nRemember to keep the dividers relatively small and flexible, so they don't add too much bulk to the pocket. You can always adjust the size and shape of the dividers as needed to fit your specific supplies.",
