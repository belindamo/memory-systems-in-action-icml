  "content": "It's always a good idea to be prepared and suggest bringing some materials to discuss, but you might want to phrase it in a way that leaves the decision up to her. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I'm looking forward to catching up and discussing our potential collaboration at The Cozy Cup on [day]. Would you like to bring some materials or notes to reference during our meeting, or would you prefer to focus on a more general discussion? Either way, I'm excited to explore ways we can work together.\"\n\nBy suggesting it, you're showing that you're prepared and serious about the meeting, but you're also giving her the flexibility to decide how she wants to approach the discussion. This way, you're not putting her on the spot or assuming what she wants to bring, but you're still showing your enthusiasm for the meeting.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider sending a brief agenda or some talking points to her a day or two before the meeting, just to give her an idea of what you'd like to discuss. This can help her prepare and make the most of your time together.\n\nRemember to keep the tone light and friendly, and I'm sure you'll have a productive and enjoyable meeting!",
