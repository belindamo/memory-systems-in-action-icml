I'll create separate projects for each of my goals, and break them down into smaller, actionable tasks. This will help me stay focused and make progress on each project. I might also set reminders and deadlines to ensure I stay on track. Additionally, I'll make sure to review my progress regularly and adjust my schedule as needed.",
