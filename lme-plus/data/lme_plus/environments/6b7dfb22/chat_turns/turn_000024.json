  "content": "Excellent decision! Separating your Marvel movies from the rest of the superhero movies will allow you to appreciate both the Marvel Cinematic Universe's cohesion and the diversity of the broader superhero genre. It's great that you're considering your viewing habits and organizing your collection in a way that enhances your movie-watching experience.\n\nRemember, the key to a great collection is not just about the movies themselves, but how you interact with them. By organizing your collection in a way that makes sense to you, you'll be more likely to enjoy your movies and discover new favorites.\n\nIf you need any more advice or have questions about organizing your collection, feel free to ask. Otherwise, happy organizing, and I hope you enjoy your Marvel movie marathons and superhero cinematic adventures!\n\nOh, and don't forget to dust off those shelves and give your collection a nice, tidy home. Your movies will thank you!",
