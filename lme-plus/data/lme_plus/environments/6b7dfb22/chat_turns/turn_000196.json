  "content": "I plan to tackle a few small projects, such as building a simple calculator, a to-do list app, and a weather app. These projects will help me apply what I learned during the coding bootcamp and develop my problem-solving skills. I'll also continue to practice writing clean, modular code and focus on best practices for coding style and organization.\n\nTo celebrate my progress, I'll reward myself with small treats or activities, such as watching a movie, playing a game, or going for a walk. I'll also share my progress with friends and family, which will help me stay accountable and motivated.\n\nAdditionally, I'll track my progress using a habit tracker and reflect on what I've learned each week. This will help me identify areas where I need to focus more attention and adjust my plan accordingly.\n\nHow can I stay motivated and engaged in the long term, and what are some common pitfalls to avoid when learning to code?",
