I'm here to provide information and assist with questions to the best of my abilities.\n\nHowever, I can still help you determine when to order more treats for Luna!\n\nTo help you keep track, you can simply make a note on your calendar or set a reminder on your phone to order more treats at the appropriate time. Based on our conversation, you can consider ordering more freeze-dried chicken treats for Luna in about 2-3 weeks, depending on how quickly she goes through them.\n\nFeel free to ask me any more questions or clarifications on how to care for Luna. I'm here to help!",
