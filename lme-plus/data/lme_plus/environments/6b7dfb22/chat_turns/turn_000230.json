  "content": "The Asics Gel-Kayano is a great choice for runners who need a little extra support and stability. Here's what you can expect from the Kayano's sizing and fit:\n\n**Sizing:**\n\n* The Kayano runs true to size, so if you're a size 9 in other shoes, you'll likely be a size 9 in the Kayano.\n* However, some runners find the Kayano to be a bit more snug than other Asics models, so you may want to consider trying on a half size up if you're between sizes.\n\n**Fit:**\n\n* The Kayano has a comfortable, supportive fit with a roomy toe box and a snug heel.\n* The upper material is breathable and flexible, providing a comfortable fit that adapts to your foot as you run.\n* The heel counter is more substantial than some other Asics models, which provides additional support and stability in the heel area.\n\n**Width:**\n\n* The Kayano is available in medium and wide widths, so you can choose the one that best fits your foot.\n* If you have narrower feet, you may find the medium width to be a good fit. If you have wider feet, the wide width may be a better option.\n\n**Heel-to-toe offset:**\n\n* The Kayano has a 13mm heel-to-toe offset, which is considered a moderate offset. This can help reduce the strain on your heel and Achilles tendon.\n\n**Lacing system:**\n\n* The Kayano features an asymmetrical lacing system, which provides a comfortable, secure fit.\n* The laces are easy to adjust, and the system allows for a customizable fit.\n\n**Overall fit:**\n\n* The Kayano is designed to provide a comfortable, supportive fit for runners with high arches or plantar fasciitis.\n* The shoe is designed to reduce pronation and provide additional stability, which can help alleviate heel pain and other issues.\n\nWhen you try on the Kayano, make sure to wear the same type of socks you plan to wear during your runs. Also, try on both shoes and walk around the store to ensure a comfortable fit. If you're still unsure, don't hesitate to ask the sales associate for their opinion or try on a different size.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to find a shoe that feels comfortable and supportive for your foot. Happy running!",
