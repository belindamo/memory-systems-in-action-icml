Please share the following details:\n\n1. **Food and Supplies:**\n\t* What type of food does Luna eat, and how often do you order it?\n\t* How much food does she consume in a week/month?\n\t* What's the average cost of her food and supplies?\n\t* When was the last time you ordered food and supplies for her?\n2. **Vet Appointments:**\n\t* When is Luna's next scheduled vet appointment?\n\t* How often does she need to visit the vet (e.g., every 6 months, annually)?\n\t* Are there any specific vaccinations or check-ups she needs to receive?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you set up a reminder system to ensure you never miss an important appointment or run out of essential supplies.\n\nIn the meantime, you might consider using a pet care app or planner to keep track of Luna's schedule and routines. Some popular options include:\n\n1. **Pet care apps:**\n\t* Petnet: Tracks food, medication, and vet appointments.\n\t* PetCoach: Monitors food, exercise, and health data.\n\t* Furbo: Schedules feedings, playtime, and vet appointments.\n2. **Pet planners:**\n\t* Erin Condren Pet Planner: A physical planner for tracking appointments, vaccinations, and medications.\n\t* Pet Parent Planner: A digital planner for organizing vet appointments, food schedules, and more.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more information on these options or have any other questions!",
