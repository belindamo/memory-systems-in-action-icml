  "content": "The Cozy Cup is a popular spot, but it's not usually too crowded. I'd recommend calling ahead to reserve a table, especially if you're planning to meet during peak hours (usually between 10 am and 2 pm). You can reach them at [phone number] to make a reservation.\n\nAs for outdoor seating, yes, The Cozy Cup has a lovely quiet patio area that's perfect for a meeting. It's partially covered, so you'll have some shade, and it's surrounded by plants, which adds to the cozy atmosphere. The patio area is usually less busy than the indoor seating, so you might have a better chance of finding a quiet spot. However, keep in mind that the patio is subject to weather conditions, so it's always a good idea to have a backup plan in case of bad weather.\n\nIf you do decide to reserve a table, be sure to mention that you'd like to sit in the quiet room or on the patio, and they'll do their best to accommodate your request.\n\nOne more tip: The Cozy Cup is known for its delicious pastries and sandwiches, so you might want to consider grabbing a light bite to go along with your coffee. They also have a variety of specialty drinks, including some unique flavors and seasonal offerings.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a great meeting at The Cozy Cup!",
