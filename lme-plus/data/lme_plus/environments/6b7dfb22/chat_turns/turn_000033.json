  "content": "I'm a big fan of Miles Morales, and I've got a few variant covers featuring him in my collection. As for storage, I use a combination of bags, boards, and top-loaders to keep my comics in great condition. I've also invested in a few comic book binders to store my longer runs and keep them organized.\n\nSpeaking of organization, I've been meaning to catalog my entire collection using a software or app. Do you know of any good options that can help me track my comics, figurines, and other collectibles? Something that's easy to use and has a decent database would be ideal.",
