  "content": "IRS Form W-9 is a form used by individuals and businesses to provide their taxpayer identification number (TIN) to another party. This form is typically used by a payor to request the TIN of a payee, such as an independent contractor, so that the payor can report the payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and issue a Form 1099-MISC at the end of the year. The W-9 form requires the individual or business to provide their name, business name (if applicable), address, TIN, and certification of their taxpayer status.\n\nIRS Form W-7 is a form used by nonresident aliens and foreign nationals who are not eligible to obtain a Social Security number but need an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) to file a tax return with the IRS. The ITIN is used for tax purposes only and is not a form of work authorization. The W-7 form requires the individual to provide documentation that supports their foreign status and identity, such as a passport, and a valid federal income tax return, unless an exception applies.",
