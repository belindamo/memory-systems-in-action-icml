  "content": "That makes a lot of sense. It's interesting that you mention the concept of detachment, because I've been thinking about that a lot lately. I've been trying to practice meditation daily, which has helped me feel more centered and calm, but I still find myself getting attached to certain outcomes or experiences. Do you have any advice on how to cultivate detachment in daily life, especially when it comes to things that are important to us, like relationships or personal goals?",
