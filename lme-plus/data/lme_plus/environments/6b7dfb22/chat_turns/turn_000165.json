  "content": "As an AI language model I don't know exactly which show are you referring to, but in general, TV shows use a variety of special effects techniques to bring creatures to life. These techniques can include:\n\n1. CGI (Computer Generated Imagery): By using computer-generated graphics, computer animators can create realistic creatures and environments for the show.\n\n2. Animatronics: This involves using mechanical puppets or robots to create the illusion of a living creature.\n\n3. Prosthetics: Actors are fitted with prosthetics and makeup to transform them into otherworldly creatures.\n\n4. Puppetry: Puppeteers use hand and rod puppets to create creatures that interact with the actors.\n\n5. Motion Capture: Actors perform in motion capture suits that record their movements and translate them into lifelike animations for the creatures.\n\n6. Miniatures: Small scale models are created and filmed to create the illusion of giant monsters or creatures.\n\n7. Practical Effects: Practical effects such as pyrotechnics, stunt work, and wire work can also be used to create the illusion of creatures.",
