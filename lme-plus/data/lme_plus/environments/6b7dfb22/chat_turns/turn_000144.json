  "content": "I think I'll go with separating fiction and non-fiction books into different shelves. I already have a few shelves in my bookcase, so it should work out well. By the way, since I got rid of a bunch of old DVDs and CDs that I no longer listen to or watch last week, I was thinking of using one of the empty shelves for displaying some decorative items. Do you have any suggestions on what kind of items would look good on a bookshelf?",
