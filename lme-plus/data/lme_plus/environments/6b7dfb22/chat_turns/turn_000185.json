So, it can be used to generate truly random numbers in a decentralized way. |\n| Scalability | Depends on the scalability of the oracle provider and the connection between the oracle and the smart contract. | Scalability can be a concern, as the protocol requires all participants to submit and reveal secret numbers. |\n| Adaptability | Can be adapted to different use cases, depending on the capabilities of the oracle provider. | The protocol can be adapted to different use cases, such as choosing a leader or determining the outcome of a vote. |\n| Cost | Can be costly, depending on the oracle provider and the connection between the oracle and the smart contract. | The cost of the protocol can be low, as it relies on the submission and revelation of secret numbers by the participants themselves. |\n| Complexity | Can be complex, depending on the oracle provider and the connection between the oracle and the smart contract. | The protocol can be simple, as it relies on determining the median of the revealed numbers. |\n| Speed | Depends on the speed of the oracle provider and the connection between the oracle and the |  |",
