I'll also use online resources, such as the ones you mentioned, to help me with specific aspects of the project. For the to-do list app, I'll check out the TodoMVC example and see how I can apply the concepts to my own project. Do you have any tips on how to effectively review and practice what I learned from the coding bootcamp?",
