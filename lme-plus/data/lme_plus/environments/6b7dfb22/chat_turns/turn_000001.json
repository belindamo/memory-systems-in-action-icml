It's great that you're trying to find ways to fill the void with solo activities, but it's understandable that it's not providing the same sense of fulfillment as social connections.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's okay to have periods where you feel disconnected from your social circle. It's normal to go through ups and downs in relationships, and sometimes people's lives get busy or priorities shift. It doesn't necessarily mean there's anything wrong with you or your relationships.\n\nIt's interesting that you mentioned having dinner by yourself three times in one week. While it might not be a big deal in itself, it could be a sign that you're not getting the social interaction you need. Eating alone can be a great opportunity for self-reflection, but it can also be a reminder of feeling disconnected.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help you reconnect with your social circle or find new ways to meet people:\n\n1. **Reach out to a friend or two**: Pick someone you haven't talked to in a while and send them a message or give them a call. Catch up on their life, and share about yours. It might feel awkward at first, but it can help you reconnect and get the conversation flowing again.\n2. **Join a group or club**: Since you mentioned enjoying painting, consider joining a local art class or group. This way, you'll meet like-minded people while doing something you enjoy. You can also explore other hobbies or interests you have, like gaming, and find online communities or local meetups.\n3. ** Attend events or gatherings**: Look for events in your area, such as concerts, festivals, or volunteer opportunities. These can be great ways to meet new people while doing something enjoyable.\n4. **Host an event or game night**: Invite some friends over for a casual gathering, like a potluck dinner or game night. This can help you reconnect with your social circle and create a relaxed atmosphere for socializing.\n5. **Consider online communities**: If you're struggling to meet people in person, you can try joining online forums or social media groups centered around your interests. This can help you connect with others who share your passions and hobbies.\n\nRemember, reconnecting with your social circle or finding new connections takes time and effort. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if it doesn't happen overnight.\n\nWhat do you think about these suggestions? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or is there something else you've been thinking about trying?",
