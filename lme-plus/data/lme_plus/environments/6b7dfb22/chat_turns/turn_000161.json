Take a moment to appreciate the serene atmosphere and admire the beautiful gardens.\n* **Torii Gate:** The shrine's iconic torii gate is a popular photo spot. Be respectful and bow upon entering and exiting the gate, as it's a sacred area.\n* **Barrels of Sake:** You'll notice rows of sake barrels donated by breweries from all over Japan. These barrels are offered to the shrine as a symbol of gratitude and are replaced every year.\n* **Wedding Ceremonies:** The Meiji Shrine is a popular spot for traditional Japanese weddings. If you're lucky, you might catch a glimpse of a ceremony taking place.\n* **Treasure Museum:** The shrine's treasure museum, Homotsuden, houses a collection of artifacts and treasures donated by the Imperial Family.\n\nTips:\n\n* **Dress modestly:** Avoid revealing clothing, as the shrine is a sacred place.\n* **Remove your shoes:** When entering the shrine's buildings, remove your shoes and wear the provided slippers.\n* **Respect the rituals:** If you encounter a Shinto ritual or ceremony, observe from a distance and avoid taking photos.\n\n**Tokyo Tower ()**\n\n* **History:** Built in 1958, Tokyo Tower was inspired by the Eiffel Tower and was originally intended as a radio broadcasting tower.\n* **Height:** Standing at 332.9 meters (1,092 ft), Tokyo Tower offers breathtaking views of the city from its observation decks.\n* **Observation Decks:** There are two observation decks: the Main Deck (150m) and the Top Deck (250m).
