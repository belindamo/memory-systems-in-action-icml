I remember last time I was in Tokyo, I had a bit of trouble navigating the subway system, especially since I was exhausted from the flight and it was late at night when I arrived. I think I'll get a prepaid IC card to make travel easier. Can you tell me more about the Tsukiji Fish Market? I visited it last time and loved it, but I was wondering if there are any specific things I should try or avoid this time around.",
