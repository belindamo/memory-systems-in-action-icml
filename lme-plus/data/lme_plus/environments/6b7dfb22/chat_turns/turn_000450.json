(excellent decision) Learning about the culture and customs of Spain will definitely enhance your experience and help you connect with the locals on a deeper level. Here are some valuable tips on what to expect when interacting with Spaniards, especially when it comes to greetings and formalities:\n\n**Greetings**\n\n* **Handshakes**: A firm but brief handshake is the norm when greeting someone for the first time, especially in formal situations. With friends or in casual settings, a kiss on each cheek (dos besos) is common, but it's not expected from foreigners.\n* **Greetings vocabulary**: Learn to say \"\u00a1Hola!\" (OH-lah) or \"Buenos d\u00edas\" (BWEH-nohs DEE-ahs) in the morning, \"Buenas tardes\" (BWEH-nahs TAR-dehs) in the afternoon, and \"Buenas noches\" (BWEH-nahs NOH-chehs) in the evening.\n* **Formal vs. informal**: Use formal titles such as \"Se\u00f1or\" (Mr.) or \"Se\u00f1ora\" (Mrs./Ms.) when addressing older people or in formal situations. With younger people or in casual settings, you can use \"t\u00fa\" (you, informal) and their first name.\n\n**Formalities**\n\n* **Respect for elders**: Show respect to older people by using formal titles and greetings, and standing up when they enter the room.\n* **Physical touch**: Physical touch is an important aspect of Spanish culture. Expect to see friends and family members greet each other with hugs, kisses, and pats on the back.\n* **Eye contact**: Direct eye contact is a sign of respect and sincerity in Spain. Avoid avoiding eye contact, as it may be seen as dishonest or untrustworthy.\n* **Time and punctuality**: Punctuality is not always a priority in Spain, especially in social situations. However, it's still important to arrive on time for business meetings and appointments.\n\n**Social norms**\n\n* **Siesta**: The traditional siesta (afternoon nap) is still observed in many parts of Spain, especially in the south. Expect shops and restaurants to close for a few hours in the early afternoon.\n* **Meal times**: Lunch (la comida) is typically served between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, while dinner (la cena) is served between 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm.\n* **Tipping**: Tipping is not mandatory, but it's customary to leave 5-10% in restaurants and bars.\n* **Dress code**: Dress modestly when visiting churches or attending formal events. In general, Spaniards dress stylishly and take pride in their appearance.\n\n**Additional tips**\n\n* **Learn some regional differences**: Spain has many regions, each with its own culture and dialect. Learn about the specific region you'll be visiting to show your interest and respect.\n* **Be patient and open-minded**: Spanish culture can be quite different from what you're used to. Be patient, open-minded, and willing to learn and adapt.\n* **Smile and make an effort**: A smile and a genuine effort to communicate in Spanish will go a long way in making a good impression and building connections with locals.\n\nBy understanding and respecting these cultural norms, you'll be able to navigate everyday situations with confidence and make a positive impression on the locals. \u00a1Buena suerte!",
