  "content": "I currently use the brand Whisker Delights and I like that they're made from pure chicken breast, but I want to try something new. I'm open to different textures and flavors as long as they're healthy and Luna likes them. No specific dietary restrictions, but I do want to keep the price reasonable, around $10-15 per pack. I usually order online from PetPalace, but I'm open to other retailers if they have good reviews.",
