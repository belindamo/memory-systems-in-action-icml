  "content": "What a wonderful idea! Incorporating music into the ceremony can add another layer of emotional depth and create a more immersive experience for your guests. Acoustic guitar or a string quartet can be a beautiful addition to the ceremony, especially if you choose music that resonates with your love story or personal style.\n\nHere are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Choose music that speaks to you**: Select music that has special meaning to you and your partner, such as a song that was playing during your first date or a piece that reminds you of a special moment in your relationship.\n2. **Consider the tone**: Think about the tone you want to set for the ceremony. Acoustic guitar can create a more intimate, laid-back atmosphere, while a string quartet can add a sense of elegance and sophistication.\n3. **Keep it simple**: Remember, the focus should be on the ceremony and your vows, so keep the music simple and understated. You don't want the music to overpower the moment.\n4. **Coordinate with your musician**: Make sure to discuss the logistics with your musician, such as the timing, volume, and placement of the music during the ceremony.\n\nSome popular ceremony music options include:\n\n* Acoustic guitar: Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz, or Ed Sheeran\n* String quartet: Classical pieces by Mozart, Chopin, or Bach, or modern arrangements of popular love songs\n* Vocalists: Solo singers or duets performing love songs or hymns\n\nRemember to also consider the sound equipment and amplification needed, especially if you're having an outdoor ceremony.\n\nAsking Jen for poem recommendations is a great idea! She might suggest some beautiful pieces that you haven't considered before. You could also ask her to help you choose the music or provide feedback on your ceremony script. It's wonderful to have a trusted friend involved in the planning process.",
