  "content": "The California STD 204 form is not a substitute for the IRS Form W-9 or W-7. While the information requested on the STD 204 form may be similar to what is requested on the W-9 and W-7 forms, the purpose and scope of the forms are different.\n\nThe STD 204 form is used by California state agencies to collect payee information for tax reporting purposes specific to California state government transactions. On the other hand, the W-9 form is used by payors to request the TIN of a payee for federal tax reporting purposes, while the W-7 form is used by nonresident aliens and foreign nationals to obtain an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) for federal tax reporting purposes.\n\nIn some cases, a payee may need to complete both the STD 204 form and the W-9 form if they are providing services to a California state agency and need to report their income for both state and federal tax purposes. Similarly, a nonresident alien or foreign national may need to complete both the STD 204 form and the W-7 form if they are receiving payments from a California state agency and need an ITIN for federal tax reporting purposes.",
