It's a great way to share your perspective and emotions, and it will help your nephew connect with you on a deeper level.\n\nRegarding adding photos from other family members or friends, I think it's a fantastic idea! Including photos from different perspectives can add variety and depth to your story. It can also help to paint a more complete picture of the event and make it feel more like a shared experience.\n\nTo avoid clutter, you might consider creating separate sections or \"chapters\" within your story for the different perspectives. For example, you could have one section for your own photos and notes, and another section for photos from family members or friends. This way, your nephew can easily navigate through the different parts of the story and appreciate the different viewpoints.\n\nAnother idea is to use Google Photos' \"Collaborative Albums\" feature, which allows multiple people to contribute to a single album. You could create a collaborative album for your graduation day and invite family members or friends to add their own photos and notes. This way, everyone can contribute to the story and share their own memories of the event.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a story that feels personal and authentic, so don't be afraid to experiment and try out different approaches. You can always adjust and refine your story as you go along, and Google Photos makes it easy to edit and rearrange your content.\n\nI think your nephew will love seeing the story from different perspectives, and it will make the experience feel even more special and shared."
