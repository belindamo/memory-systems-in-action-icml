      "content": "Both \"Cliffs of Dover\" and \"Tornado of Souls\" are technically demanding songs on guitar, and they both require a high level of skill to play accurately. However, I would say that \"Cliffs of Dover\" as a whole is generally considered to be a more technically challenging song than \"Tornado of Souls.\"\n\n\"Cliffs of Dover\" features a wide range of techniques, including alternate picking, sweep picking, legato, bending, vibrato, and tapping, all of which are used in complex and intricate ways throughout the song. The song also features challenging chord progressions and intricate rhythms, which require a strong sense of timing and phrasing.\n\nOn the other hand, while \"Tornado of Souls\" is also a technically demanding song, its focus is more on speed and precision with alternate picking, sweep picking, and string skipping techniques, as well as incorporating bends, vibrato, and tapping in the solo section.\n\nOverall, both songs are challenging and require a lot of practice to master, but \"Cliffs of Dover\" is generally considered to be more technically challenging due to the wide range of techniques and the intricacy of its composition."

      "content": "I apologize for the confusion. My previous response was based on the assumption that you were a beginner guitarist and were looking for an ordered list of songs to learn that would gradually build up your technique and skill level towards playing the solo to \"Tornado of Souls.\"\n\nIn that context, I recommended learning \"Cliffs of Dover\" before \"Tornado of Souls\" because \"Cliffs of Dover\" features a wide range of techniques that will help you build a strong foundation of skills and prepare you for the more advanced techniques required to play \"Tornado of Souls.\" Additionally, \"Cliffs of Dover\" is considered a classic instrumental guitar piece that has been studied by many guitarists, and is often included in lists of songs to learn for technical development.\n\nHowever, if your goal is solely to learn the solo to \"Tornado of Souls,\" then it may be more efficient to focus on learning songs or exercises that specifically target the techniques required for that solo, such as alternate picking, sweep picking, and string skipping. Some examples of songs or exercises that could help develop these techniques include \"Eruption\" by Van Halen, \"Technical Difficulties\" by Racer X, or exercises such as the \"Yngwie Malmsteen 6-note exercise\" or the \"Paul Gilbert string skipping exercise.\"\n\nUltimately, the best approach will depend on your current skill level and your specific goals, so it's always a good idea to seek guidance from a guitar teacher or experienced player who can provide personalized advice and help you create a tailored practice routine."
