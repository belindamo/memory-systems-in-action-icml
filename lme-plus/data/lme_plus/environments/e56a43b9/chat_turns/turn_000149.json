It's overall a very humid place with regular rainfall and never gets very hot or cold, and probably only freezes at the highest altitudes and perhaps sometimes in the circumpolar regions. Most of the planet would then have a humid subtropical climate in the middle altitudes, and in the middle latitudes highland rainforest in the highest altitudes up to the snow lines, and more of a mediterranean climate around the salt lakes.
