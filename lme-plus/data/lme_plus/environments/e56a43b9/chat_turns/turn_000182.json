This study examines whether the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) exists on China\u2019s noise pollution problem. Based on the two-way fixed effects model, we study the relationship between noise pollution and economic development based on the noise monitoring data from 111 cities in China from 1991 to 2017, and the robustness test was conducted using GMM and semi-parametric methods. We find that 1) Relationship between noise pollution and economic development in China is inverted N-shaped at the national scale. 2) Shapes of noise pollution EKC curves have substantial regional variations: the curve is inverted N-shaped in the eastern region, inverted U-shaped in the central region, and linear in the western region. 3) Missing key variables in the parameter regression will change the turning point. 4) Development of the tertiary industry will increase noise pollution. Our research results show that economic development does not necessarily lead to environmental degradation. The government should play an important role in noise pollution control and pay more attention to the environmental demands of society.\nChenxi Lu, Sergey Venevsky, Xiaoliang Shi, Lingyu Wang, Jonathon S. Wright, Chao Wu,\n2021,\nAbstract: Threats posed by global climate change have heightened the urgency for economies to transition to sustainability. However, quantitative metrics that measure sustainability status remain under development, hampered in part by the difficulty of identifying clear relationships between economic growth and sustainability. The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis provides a framework for describing sustainability status relative to socioeconomic development. In this study, the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis was adopted to investigate statistical relationships between the carbon intensity of human well-being (as an indicator of sustainability) and economic development in eight economic zones of China during 1997\u20132015. The results provide new evidence that seven of eight Chinese economic zones began advances to sustainability (defined here as downward turning points marked by inverted \u201cN\u201d shapes in the Environmental Kuznets Curve) between 2012 and 2015. The lone exception was the Northwestern economic zone, in which an approach to sustainability had not yet occurred by 2015. This study thus supports the contention that environmental policies and technologies have contributed to improving sustainability in terms of carbon intensity. The results suggest two strategic options for further increasing sustainability in China: 1) \u201cfirst help the weakest\u201d; and 2) \u201cfirst help the latest to sustainability\u201d.\nHongxing Chen, Xiaoling Zhang, Rongwei Wu, Tianyi Cai,\n2020,\nAbstract: With the increasing trend of global warming, the Chinese government faces tremendous pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. The purpose of this study is to accurately measure CO2 emissions at the city scale in China and examine the environmental Kuznets curve, thereby providing a reference for decision-making. Corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data were used to accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions at the provincial and city scales in China. Then, based on the STRIPAT model, 291 cities in China were used to verify the environmental Kuznets curve. Our results show that on the provincial scale, the R2 between the estimated value and the statistical value of carbon dioxide reaches 0.85. Western cities in China emit more CO2, as do economically developed cities and industry- and mining-dominated cities. There are two CO2 emission hot spots in the north and one cold spot in the south. It was found that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists. This study has practical value in utilizing NPP-VIIRS data for the estimation of city CO2 emissions. The results also have academic value for determining factors that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions and can provide a reference for relevant decision makers. This study could be considered the first to simulate CO2 emissions at the provincial and city levels in China based on a NPP-VIIRS nighttime light model to explore the associated geographical distribution characteristics and potential influencing factors.\nYongda He, Boqiang Lin,\n2019,\nAbstract: This study pioneers investigating the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and its possible regional differential characteristics in China. Based on 2003\u20132017 years of provincial panel data, this research employs panel smooth transition auto regression (PSTR) model to analyze the impact of income levels on environmental pollution and identify the EKC threshold of energy intensity. Then, 30 Chinese provinces were categorized by energy intensity to examine the inter-provincial and interregional differences in the EKC threshold of energy intensity, rather than the traditional threshold of income. The results indicate that China's pollution emissions and energy intensities show a stepwise decreasing pattern from the western region to the eastern region. In addition, the impact of income levels on pollution emissions is non-linear, and the critical value of energy intensity is 0.9168 between the high- and low regimes. An inverted U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve is accepted for energy intensity, with 0.7670 as its threshold value. When the energy intensity is higher (lower) than the threshold value, the income elasticity of pollution emission is positive (negative). The more developed provinces and municipalities mainly in the eastern region are proved to exceed the threshold than the provinces in the central and western regions within the sample period. Given these findings, this study further divides China's provinces into eco-friendly, low-pollution, and high-pollution provinces, and accordingly, the most important policy recommendations were discussed for policy-makers and researchers. This research can provide a new insight to investigate countries with unbalanced development levels within and a reference for environmental governance policies in sub-regions.",
