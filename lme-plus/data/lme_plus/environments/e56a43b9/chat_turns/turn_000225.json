Here are some side dish recommendations that would pair well with the Spicy Pineapple BBQ Sauce:\n\n1. **Coleslaw with a twist**: A creamy coleslaw with a hint of pineapple or mango would complement the sweet and tangy flavors of the BBQ sauce. You can also add some heat to the coleslaw by incorporating diced jalape\u00f1os or red pepper flakes.\n2. **Grilled Pineapple Skewers**: Grilled pineapple skewers with a sprinkle of brown sugar and cinnamon would pair nicely with the BBQ sauce. The caramelized pineapple would add a sweet and smoky flavor to the dish.\n3. **Roasted Vegetables**: Roasted vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, and onions with a drizzle of balsamic glaze would provide a nice contrast to the sweet and spicy BBQ sauce.\n4. **Cilantro Lime Rice**: A flavorful cilantro lime rice with a squeeze of fresh lime juice would help balance the richness of the BBQ sauce. The herbal flavors of cilantro would also complement the pineapple and spices in the sauce.\n5. **Baked Sweet Potato Fries**: Crispy baked sweet potato fries with a sprinkle of paprika and chili powder would provide a nice crunch and a touch of heat to the dish.\n6. **Garlic and Herb Corn on the Cob**: Grilled or boiled corn on the cob with a compound butter made from garlic, parsley, and chives would add a fresh and herbaceous flavor to the dish.\n7. **Spicy Cornbread**: A spicy cornbread with diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers would complement the heat from the BBQ sauce.
