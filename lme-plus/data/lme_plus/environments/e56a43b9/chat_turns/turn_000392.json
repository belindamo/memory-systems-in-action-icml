Here's why:\n\n1. **Interference reduction**: Dust, dirt, and other obstructions can cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) that can affect wireless signal strength and quality. By cleaning your computer, you've likely reduced the amount of EMI that could be interfering with your wireless mouse.\n2. **Improved airflow**: Dusty fans and vents can reduce airflow, which can cause your computer to generate more heat. This heat can, in turn, affect the performance of wireless devices. By cleaning your computer, you've improved airflow, which can help reduce heat and minimize its impact on your wireless mouse.\n3. **Reduced radio frequency interference (RFI)**: A clean computer environment can reduce RFI, which can also affect wireless performance. RFI can be caused by devices like cordless phones, microwaves, and other electronic devices. By keeping your computer and surrounding area clean, you're reducing the likelihood of RFI affecting your wireless mouse.\n\nTo further minimize interference and ensure optimal performance from your new wireless mouse:\n\n1. **Keep your workspace clean and organized**: Regularly clean your desk, keyboard, and surrounding area to prevent dust and dirt from accumulating.\n2. **Position your wireless receiver wisely**: Place the receiver in a central location, away from other electronic devices and obstacles, to ensure a strong and stable connection.\n3. **Avoid interference from other devices**: Keep other wireless devices, like cordless phones and microwaves, at a safe distance from your computer and wireless receiver.\n4. **Update your wireless drivers**: Make sure your wireless drivers are up-to-date, as newer drivers can improve wireless performance and reduce interference.\n\nThe Logitech M720 Triathlon is an excellent choice, and with a clean computer environment, you can expect optimal performance from your new wireless mouse.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
