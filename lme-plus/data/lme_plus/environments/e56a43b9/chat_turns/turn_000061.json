  "content": "I've already replaced the lampshades in my living room with some new ones from IKEA, and they really help to reflect the light from the lamps. I've noticed that the room feels cozier and more inviting, especially in the evenings. For my kitchen, I'm thinking of going with a more modern design. Do you have any recommendations for recessed lighting trim styles that would fit well with a modern aesthetic?",
