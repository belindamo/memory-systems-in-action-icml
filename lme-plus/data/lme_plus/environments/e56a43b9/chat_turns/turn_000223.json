Here are some tips to help you keep your grilled chicken breasts warm and juicy:\n\n1. **Use a warming tray**: Invest in a warming tray or chafing dish with a heat source, such as a candle or electric warming element. This will help keep the chicken breasts warm and at a safe temperature (above 145\u00b0F).\n2. **Insulated containers**: Use insulated containers or thermal servers with lids to keep the chicken breasts warm. These containers are designed to retain heat and keep food warm for a longer period.\n3. **Tent with foil**: Cover the grilled chicken breasts with foil to keep them warm. You can also use a foil pan or a foil-lined serving dish to keep the chicken warm.\n4. **Keep them in a low oven**: Place the grilled chicken breasts in a low-temperature oven (around 150\u00b0F to 200\u00b0F) to keep them warm. This is a great option if you have a large quantity of chicken to keep warm.\n5. **Use a thermos**: Yes, you read that right! A thermos can be used to keep chicken breasts warm. Simply place the chicken in a thermos and close the lid. The insulation will keep the chicken warm for a few hours.\n6. **Serve in batches**: If you're serving a large crowd, consider serving the grilled chicken breasts in batches. This will ensure that each batch is served hot and fresh, rather than keeping all the chicken warm for an extended period.\n7. **Add a moisture-rich topping**: Top the grilled chicken breasts with a moisture-rich ingredient like BBQ sauce, salsa, or a fruit chutney. This will help keep the chicken breasts juicy and add flavor.\n8. **Use a steam table**: If you're serving a very large crowd, consider using a steam table to keep the chicken breasts warm. Steam tables use steam to keep food warm, which helps retain moisture and flavor.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your grilled chicken breasts warm and juicy for your family gathering. Don't forget to slather on that Spicy Pineapple BBQ Sauce to add an extra layer of flavor and moisture!\n\nRemember to always prioritize food safety when serving large crowds. Make sure to keep the chicken breasts at a safe temperature (above 145\u00b0F) and discard any chicken that's been left at room temperature for too long.",
