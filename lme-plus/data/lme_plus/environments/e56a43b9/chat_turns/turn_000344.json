  "content": "Koala populations in Eastern Australia are more densely populated than in Western Australia. This is because the eastern part of Australia has a more suitable climate and habitat for koalas, with more eucalyptus forests and milder temperatures. In contrast, the western part of Australia has a more arid, desert-like climate with fewer suitable habitats for koalas. Therefore, the majority of koala populations are found in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, which are located in the eastern part of Australia.",
