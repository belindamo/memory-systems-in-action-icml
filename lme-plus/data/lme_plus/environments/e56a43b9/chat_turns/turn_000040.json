  "content": "Citrus-herb butters are an amazing way to add extra flavor to your smoked fish, and experimenting with different citrus fruits and herbs can lead to some incredible combinations. Here are some citrus fruits and herbs that pair well with alder wood and fish:\n\n**Citrus Fruits:**\n\n1. **Orange**: Orange and alder wood are a natural pairing, especially with fish like salmon or trout. The sweetness of the orange complements the earthy sweetness of the alder wood.\n2. **Lime**: Lime adds a bright, citrusy flavor that cuts through the richness of fatty fish like salmon or halibut. It's also a great match for delicate fish like cod or snapper.\n3. **Grapefruit**: Grapefruit's tangy, slightly bitter flavor pairs well with the subtle sweetness of alder wood. It's a great match for fish like sea bass or snapper.\n4. **Meyer Lemon**: Meyer lemons have a sweeter, less acidic flavor than regular lemons, which makes them a great match for delicate fish like trout or cod.\n\n**Herbs:**\n\n1. **Dill**: Dill is a classic pairing for fish, and its bright, fresh flavor complements the alder wood nicely. It's a great match for fish like salmon, trout, or cod.\n2. **Tarragon**: Tarragon has a slightly anise-like flavor that pairs well with the earthy sweetness of alder wood. It's a great match for fish like salmon, halibut, or sea bass.\n3. **Chives**: Chives add a mild, oniony flavor that complements the smokiness of the alder wood. They're a great match for fish like trout, cod, or snapper.\n4. **Parsley**: Parsley has a fresh, green flavor that pairs well with the brightness of citrus fruits like lemon or lime. It's a great match for fish like salmon, halibut, or sea bass.\n\n**Combinations:**\n\n1. **Orange-Dill**: A classic combination that pairs well with salmon, trout, or cod.\n2. **Lime-Tarragon**: A bright, citrusy combination that pairs well with halibut, sea bass, or snapper.\n3. **Grapefruit-Chive**: A tangy, savory combination that pairs well with sea bass, snapper, or cod.\n4. **Meyer Lemon-Parsley**: A sweet, fresh combination that pairs well with trout, cod, or snapper.\n\nRemember, the key to creating a great citrus-herb butter is to balance the flavors. Start with a small amount of citrus juice or zest and herbs, and adjust to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess flavor.\n\nI hope this helps you experiment with new citrus-herb butter combinations that pair well with alder wood and fish!",
