Brands like Halo or Tech Lighting offer slim trims that are perfect for modern kitchens.\n2. **Baffle Trims**: Baffle trims feature a unique design that helps to reduce glare and provide a more focused light beam. They often have a sleek, modern look and are available from brands like WAC Lighting or Juno.\n3. **Pinhole Trims**: Pinhole trims have a small, circular opening that allows a narrow beam of light to escape, creating a modern, minimalist look.
