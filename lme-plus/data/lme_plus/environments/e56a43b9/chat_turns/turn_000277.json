  "content": "Sure, here are a few more variations of question 3 that use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n1. In a right triangle, the hypotenuse has length 20 and one leg has length x. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg in terms of x.\n2. In a right triangle, one leg has length 15 and the hypotenuse has length 17. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg.\n3. In a right triangle, one leg has length x and the hypotenuse has length y. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg in terms of x and y.\n4. In a right triangle, one leg has length 7 and the hypotenuse has length 24. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg.\n5. In a right triangle, one leg has length x and the hypotenuse has length y. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find an equation that relates x, y and the length of the other leg.\n6. In a right triangle, if the length of one leg is 8 and the hypotenuse is 10, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg in terms of logarithms.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other specifications or if you want me to focus on any specific concepts or methods.",
