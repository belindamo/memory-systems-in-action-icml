  "content": "Liu, Qu, and Zhao (2019) investigate whether China's development aligns with the Environmental Kuznets Curve and Pollution Haven hypotheses. They found a reverse U-shape relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions, and an inverted N-shaped relationship between foreign direct investment and carbon dioxide emissions. Ahmad, Jabeen, and Wu (2021) examined the heterogeneous influence of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and income on CO2 emissions across the development levels of Chinese provinces and found that FDI inflows and income promoted environmental sustainability, with FDI inflows imparting Pollution Halo influence in fifteen provinces at various development levels, and PHV influence in seven provinces at different development levels. Yin, Zheng, and Chen (2015) developed a panel data model to analyze the institutional and technical factors that affect the path of low-carbon economic development, and the results indicated that there was a CO2 emission Kuznets curve seen in China, with environmental regulation having a significant moderating effect on the curve. Shahbaz, Shafiullah, Khalid, and Song (2020) analyzed the energy consumption\u2013economic growth nexus in Chinese provinces and found a nonlinear unit root problem in energy consumption and economic growth, and nonlinear cointegration between the variables, with the Granger causality analysis revealing the presence of a mixed causal relationship between economic growth and energy consumption.",
