  "content": "Yes, the public can have a say in the lawmaking process in Mexico through a few different means:\n\n1. Citizen initiative - As I mentioned earlier, a group of citizens can propose a new law to the Chamber of Deputies or Senate. If the proposal meets certain requirements, it must be discussed and voted on by the relevant body.\n\n2. Public hearings - The Chamber of Deputies and Senate can hold public hearings on proposed laws, where members of the public can provide input and feedback on the proposals.\n\n3. Communications - Members of the public can communicate with their representatives in the Chamber of Deputies or Senate to express their views on proposed laws.\n\n4. Consultas - Consultas are a type of nationwide public referendum that can be held on certain issues or proposed laws. These referendums are rare, but they do provide a way for the public to have a direct say on certain matters.\n\nIn addition, some NGOs and advocacy groups in Mexico work to engage the public in the lawmaking process by providing information, organizing events or campaigns, and lobbying politicians.",
