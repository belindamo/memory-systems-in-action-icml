Linear switches are great for fast-paced games, while tactile switches are better for strategy and RPG games.\n* Customizable lighting: If you want to personalize your keyboard's lighting, look for keyboards with software-supported RGB lighting.\n* Macro capabilities: If you play games that require complex key combinations, look for keyboards with dedicated macro keys or software-supported macro functionality.\n* Build quality and durability: A sturdy aluminum frame and high-quality materials can ensure your keyboard lasts longer.\n* Wireless or wired: If you prefer a wireless keyboard, consider the Anne Pro 2 or Logitech G Pro X.\n\nUltimately, the best keyboard for you will depend on your personal preferences, gaming style, and budget. I recommend reading reviews and watching videos to get a better feel for each keyboard before making a purchase.",
