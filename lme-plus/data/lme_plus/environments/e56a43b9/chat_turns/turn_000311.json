  "content": "Yes, I can help you calculate financial ratios from a financial statement. Here is an explanation of how to calculate each ratio you mentioned:\n\n1. Current Ratio: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term debts. The formula is: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n2. Quick Ratio: This is similar to the current ratio, but it excludes inventory from current assets. The formula is: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n3. Debt Ratio: This measures the proportion of a company's assets that is financed by debt. The formula is: Debt Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets\n4. Inventory Turnover: This measures the number of times a company sells and replaces its stock of goods. The formula is: Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n5. Receivables Turnover: This measures how many times a company collects its accounts receivable during a period. The formula is: Receivables Turnover = Net Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n6. Days' Sales in Inventory: This measures the number of days it takes for a company to sell its inventory. The formula is: Days' Sales in Inventory = 365 / Inventory Turnover\n7. Days' Sales in Receivables: This measures the number of days it takes for a company to collect its accounts receivable. The formula is: Days' Sales in Receivables = 365 / Receivables Turnover\n8. Total Debt to Equity Ratio: This measures the proportion of a company's financing that comes from debt versus equity. The formula is: Total Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity\n9. Time Interest Earned Ratio: This measures a company's ability to meet its interest payments on debt. The formula is: Time Interest Earned Ratio = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Interest Expense\n10. Cash Coverage Ratio: This measures a company's ability to pay its debts using only its most liquid assets. The formula is: Cash Coverage Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Short-term Investments) / Total Current Liabilities\n11. Profit Margin: This measures a company's profitability, expressed as a percentage of sales. The formula is: Profit Margin = Net Income / Net Sales\n12. Return on Assets (ROA): This measures a company's efficiency in using its assets to generate income. The formula is: ROA = Net Income / Total Assets\n13. Return on Equity (ROE): This measures a company's profitability in relation to the amount of shareholder equity. The formula is: ROE = Net Income / Total Equity.\n\nPlease note that these formulas are based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the financial statement must follow GAAP standards in order for these ratios to be meaningful.",
