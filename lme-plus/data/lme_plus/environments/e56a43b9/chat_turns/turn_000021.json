The MVP has a budget of $1 million and we will be building the technology and we will be on boarding and facilitating the project. We want to describe this in the format of an implementation strategy, so please take on board all of the information, understand it and then create a table of contents so that we are able to start the implementation approach . The Mvp launch: project is gonna be broken up into four main stages. The first stage we\u2019re going to create the digital Twins for the pilot project. We are going to create the data management platform to group to KP eyes of carbon biodiversity, nutritional density, water, retention, and chemical residues, we are going to connect the digital twin into the Farmer profile in the project management community platform, we going to on-board the farmer with the on boarding process which goes deep data on the farm methodologies challenges. We are going to write a policy using the guardian with Hedera and create the first tokens, the fresh, the first fresh earth tokens that we are going to be able to sell in the website, we are going to also register the KPI\u2019s baselines so that they meet the requirements for clean energy regulator, vera and carbon markets. This will allow us to be compliant and issue.Carbon credits, and sell the carbon credits does futures synthetics in the Hedera guardian environment phase one in broad will facilitate the on boarding of farmers into the digital twin with independent verification of the KPI\u2018s through the audit process, which will go into the data management platform it will allow the verification of the measurement protocols and the validation protocols for the KPI\u2018s. This will allow us to issue in mini tokens and also to issue carbon credits, this will require the digital twin also will go into the project management community in the Farmer profile which will allow the collaboration around the digital twin through the participants in the community platform",
