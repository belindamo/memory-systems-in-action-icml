  "content": "I've been meaning to try using oat milk in a bechamel sauce for a while now, so thanks for the tips. I've been getting more into plant-based cooking recently, and it's been really inspiring to see how versatile these alternatives can be. Watching a documentary on Netflix about the environmental impact of the meat industry really opened my eyes to the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle, and I've been experimenting with different recipes and cooking techniques ever since. Do you have any other vegan cheese sauce recipes that you'd recommend?",
