  "content": "Xu et al. (2020) investigated whether the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) exists on China\u2019s noise pollution problem. The study examined the relationship between noise pollution and economic development based on the noise monitoring data from 111 cities in China from 1991 to 2017. The authors found that the relationship between noise pollution and economic development in China is inverted N-shaped at the national scale, with regional variations across the country, and the development of the tertiary industry will increase noise pollution. Lu et al. (2021) adopted the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis to investigate statistical relationships between the carbon intensity of human well-being and economic development in eight economic zones of China during 1997\u20132015. The results provide new evidence that seven of eight Chinese economic zones began advances to sustainability between 2012 and 2015. Chen et al. (2020) accurately measured CO2 emissions at the city scale in China using corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data, and examined the environmental Kuznets curve. The results show that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists and emissions vary across regions. Finally, He and Lin (2019) employed panel smooth transition auto regression (PSTR) model to investigate the regional differential characteristics of EKC hypothesis in China. The authors found that China's pollution emissions and energy intensities show a stepwise decreasing pattern from the western region to the eastern region, and the impact of income levels on pollution emissions is non-linear, with an inverted U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve for energy intensity.",
