  "content": "That's really helpful, thank you! I think I'll start with the lentil curry and vegan quinoa bowls, as they sound like great options for meal prep. I've had success with cooking lentils and quinoa before, so I'm confident I can make them in bulk. The stuffed bell peppers and vegan soups also caught my attention, so I might try those out later.\n\nSince I made a huge pot of chana masala last weekend, I was thinking of incorporating that into my meal prep as well. Do you have any suggestions on how I can repurpose the leftovers into different meals throughout the week?",
