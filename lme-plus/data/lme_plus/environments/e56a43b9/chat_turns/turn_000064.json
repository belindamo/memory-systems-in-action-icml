Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Color Temperature:**\n\n* **5000K-5500K (Daylight White)**: This range provides a bright, energizing light that's perfect for task-oriented areas like kitchens. It's also closer to natural daylight, which can help improve visibility and ambiance.\n* **4000K-4500K (Cool White)**: This range offers a slightly warmer tone than daylight white, but still provides a crisp, modern look.\n\n**Lumen Output:**\n\n* **800-1000 lumens**: This range is suitable for most kitchen tasks, such as food preparation, cooking, and socializing. It's bright enough to provide good visibility, but not so bright that it's overwhelming.\n* **1000-1200 lumens**: If you have a larger kitchen or want an even brighter light, consider bulbs with a higher lumen output.\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n* **CRI (Color Rendering Index)**: Look for bulbs with a high CRI (80+), which ensures that the light is accurate and vibrant, making food and surfaces appear more natural.\n* **Dimming**: If you plan to install dimmer switches or want to adjust the light level, choose bulbs that are dimmable.\n* **Smart Bulb Compatibility**: If you're investing in a smart lighting system like Philips Hue, ensure the bulbs are compatible with the system.\n\nSome popular LED bulb brands for modern kitchens include:\n\n* Philips Hue\n* LIFX\n* GE Smart Bulbs\n* Sylvania Smart+\n* Cree\n\nWhen selecting bulbs, be sure to check the packaging or manufacturer's website for the specific features and specifications that matter most to you.\n\nDo you have any other questions about LED bulbs or would you like more recommendations?",
