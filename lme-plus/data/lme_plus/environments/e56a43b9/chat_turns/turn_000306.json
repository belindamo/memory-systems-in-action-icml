  "content": "I think I'll be using the GS Mini for solo playing and possibly some acoustic jams with friends. I've been enjoying playing solo electric guitar, but I think the GS Mini will be a great addition to my solo performances. I'm also thinking of maybe starting a little band with some friends, and the GS Mini would be a great fit for that too. Speaking of which, have you got any tips on how to get the best sound out of a small acoustic ensemble? We're thinking of having a mix of acoustic guitars, vocals, and maybe some hand percussion.",
