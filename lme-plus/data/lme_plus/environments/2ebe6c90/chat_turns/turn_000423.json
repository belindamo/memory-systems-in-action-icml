  "content": "The promotion process in the Indian Army can take different lengths of time, depending on the rank and vacancy available at higher ranks. For lower ranks, such as from Lieutenant to Captain, a promotion may take a year or two, while higher ranks such as Colonel and above, may take much longer, typically between 1-3 years. \n\nPromotions are based on vacancies available at higher ranks, which means that sometimes promotion lists may get delayed until the next vacancy arises, especially for higher ranks. The seniority cum merit process also plays a role in determining promotions, and based on the ACRs and RORs submitted by the officers, the promotion board evaluates each officer's eligibility for promotion. \n\nOverall, the promotion process in the Indian Army can take several years, with evaluation of each officer's performance, availability of vacancies, and promotion testing. The promotion process is designed to ensure the selection of the best-qualified officers for higher ranks and to preserve the historic traditions of the Indian Army.",
