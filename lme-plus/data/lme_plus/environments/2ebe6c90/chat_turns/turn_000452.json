I've also been experimenting with different attachments, like the pastry roller and the food grinder.\n\nAs for what's next, I've been thinking about trying my hand at making croissants again. I tried making them a while back, but they didn't turn out quite right. I'm thinking of trying a different recipe and seeing if I can get them to turn out flaky and light. Do you have any tips or advice for making croissants?",
