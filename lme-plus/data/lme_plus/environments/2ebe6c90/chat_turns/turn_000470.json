  "content": "There isn't a specific work that explicitly connects rules in use to SEA of UN peacekeepers using the terminology of Elinor Ostrom's IAD framework. However, there are studies and reports that explore the relationship between informal norms, military culture, and SEA in peacekeeping missions, which can be linked to the concept of rules in use. Some relevant works include:\n\n1. Whitworth, S. (2004). \"Men, Militarism, and UN Peacekeeping: A Gendered Analysis.\" Lynne Rienner Publishers.\n\t* This book examines the role of masculinity, military culture, and informal norms in shaping the behavior of UN peacekeepers, including the problem of SEA.\n2. Henry, M. (2007). \"Discourses of Discipline: An Anthropology of Corporal Punishment in the British Army and Recidivism in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone.\" Political and Legal Anthropology Review, 30(1), 1-23.\n\t* This article provides an anthropological analysis of the link between military discipline, culture, and recidivism in the context of UN peacekeeping, touching upon the issue of SEA.\n3. Jennings, K. M., & Nikoli\u0107-Ristanovi\u0107, V. (Eds.). (2009). \"Victimisation of Women, Children and Men in Post-conflict Societies: Experiences from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and South Africa.\" NHC Series in Human Rights and Democratic Development, 15.\n\t* This book discusses various forms of victimization in post-conflict societies, including sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers, and explores the role of social and cultural norms in these contexts.\n4. Aoi, C., de Coning, C., & Thakur, R. (Eds.). (2007). \"Unintended Consequences of Peacekeeping Operations.\" United Nations University Press.\n\t* This edited volume examines the unintended consequences of peacekeeping operations, including issues related to SEA, and discusses the role of informal norms and practices in shaping peacekeeper behavior.\n\nWhile these works may not use the exact terminology of \"rules in use\" from the IAD framework, they provide insights into the relationship between informal norms, military culture, and SEA in peacekeeping missions, which can be conceptually linked to the idea of rules in use.",
