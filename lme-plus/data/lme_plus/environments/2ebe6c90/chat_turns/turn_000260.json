  "content": "Jacob felt a surge of fear as Racita moved away from him. He was still trying to regain control of his voice after the relentless grip of Lorelei, and the thought of being alone with the other spirits was almost too much to bear.\n\n\"Racita, please don't go,\" he cried out, his voice shaking. \"Don't leave me here with them.\"\n\nRacita turned to him, her expression gentle and understanding. \"I won't be far, Jacob,\" she said, her voice soft and comforting. \"Eri needs my help, but I'll come back for you as soon as I can.\"\n\nJacob's heart was pounding in his chest. He had never felt so alone, so vulnerable, and he didn't want to be left with the spirits that had been tormenting him for what felt like an eternity.\n\n\"Please, Racita,\" he begged. \"Don't leave me here.\"\n\nRacita took a step closer to him and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"I'll be back soon, Jacob,\" she promised. \"Just hold on.\"\n\nAnd with that, she was gone, leaving Jacob to face the spirits once more. He took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart, and waited for Racita to return.",
