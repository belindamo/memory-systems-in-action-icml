  "content": "Observations from telescopes and other instruments are instrumental in the process of stellar classification. Astronomers use the characteristics observed, such as spectral lines and brightness, to classify stars into categories that reflect their physical properties.\n\nSpectral lines observed in the spectrum of a star can help astronomers determine its temperature, chemical composition, and other properties. The brightness of a star also provides information on its size and distance.\n\nAll of these observations are combined to determine a star's classification, which is reflected in its designation. For example, a star may be classified as a main sequence star, a red giant, or a white dwarf based on its physical properties.\n\nOverall, observations from telescopes and other instruments provide astronomers with vital information about the properties of stars, which is necessary for the accurate classification and understanding of these celestial objects.",
