Here's why:\n\n1. **Stress and disturbance:** Getting too close to warblers can cause them stress, leading to changes in their behavior, such as flying away or becoming more vigilant. This can negatively impact their energy reserves and overall well-being.\n2. **Habituation:** If you consistently approach warblers for photography, they may become habituated to human presence, leading to a loss of natural wariness. This can make them more vulnerable to predators and other threats.\n3. **Nesting and breeding:** During breeding season, warblers are particularly sensitive to disturbance, as they're protecting their nests and young. Approaching them too closely can cause them to abandon their nests or young, leading to reduced reproductive success.\n\nInstead, focus on capturing images from a safe distance, using the following tips:\n\n1. **Use a telephoto lens:** Invest in a good quality telephoto lens (at least 200-300mm) to capture images from a distance. This will allow you to get great shots without disturbing the birds.\n2. **Be patient:** Spend time observing the warblers from a distance, waiting for them to come to you or move into a more favorable position for photography.\n3. **Respect their space:** If a warbler appears agitated or stressed by your presence, back off and give it space. Prioritize the bird's well-being over getting a shot.\n4. **Learn about bird behavior:** Understanding warbler behavior and body language will help you anticipate and capture their natural behaviors, such as foraging, singing, or interacting with other birds.\n\nBy keeping a safe distance and respecting the warblers' space, you'll not only get great photos but also contribute to their well-being and conservation.\n\nRemember, as a responsible birder and photographer, it's essential to prioritize the birds' welfare and follow ethical guidelines for bird photography.",
