  "content": "Jacob's voice was shaking as he tried to speak to Racita. But all that came out was twisted praise to Lorelei. Racita's voice was gentle and reassuring.\n\n\"Hold on, Jacob,\" she said. \"We'll get you out of here.\"\n\nDespite the distorted praise continuing to come from his mouth, Jacob couldn't help the sobs of relief that escaped him. He felt a glimmer of hope for the first time in what felt like an eternity.\n\nLorelei sneered at the sight of Jacob's tears, but she couldn't take the smile off Racita's face. \"You two think you can save him? How quaint.\" she said.\n\nRacita's eyes narrowed. \"We'll do whatever it takes,\" she said, determination in her voice. \"Jacob, focus on my voice. We're getting you out of here.\"\n\nJacob tried to nod, but even that small motion was controlled by Lorelei's hold on him. He could feel the benevolent energy of Racita and Eri pressing against the oppressive force of Lorelei and her minions, but he didn't know if it would be enough.\n\nBut he held on to Racita's words, willing himself to believe that they could save him. And for the first time in what felt like an eternity, he felt a glimmer of hope.",
