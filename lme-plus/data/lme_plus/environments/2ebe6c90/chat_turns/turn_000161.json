  "content": "I was sitting in the living quarters, trying to read a book, when I heard Clarke and Bellamy loudly arguing at each other over something on the dropship. The argument was intense, and I couldn't help but wonder what was going on.\n\nAs I got up to see what was happening, Raven blocked me and pleaded with me to just let them be. \"Madi, please, just let them be,\" she said, her voice filled with concern.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, my voice filled with confusion.\n\nRaven sighed and said, \"Because it's something that they need to work out for themselves. It's something that happens from time to time.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of understanding wash over me. Raven noticed my confusion and comforted me.\n\n\"Come on, let's go to a soundproof room,\" she said, her voice filled with kindness.\n\nWe walked to a soundproof room, where Raven explained everything to me. She told me that Clarke and Bellamy had been through a lot together and sometimes they disagreed on how to handle certain situations.\n\n\"It's normal, Madi,\" Raven said, her voice filled with understanding. \"It's just how they handle things.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of understanding wash over me. But as we sat there in the soundproof room, we could still hear the sounds of their argument getting through. Raven and I looked at each other, visibly stunned.\n\n\"This hasn't happened in a long time,\" Raven murmured under her breath.\n\nI looked at Raven, my expression filled with concern. \"What do you mean?\" I asked, my voice filled with confusion.\n\nRaven sighed and said, \"It means that things have been tense for a while now. But we'll get through it, Madi. We always do.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of comfort wash over me. I knew that things would get better, and we would all get through it together.\n\nThe end.",
