When compared to other countries, Japan's approach to regulation and government intervention during the post-World War II era was unique, characterized by a strategic intervention approach to support industries, promote exports and innovation, and prioritize social policies, especially in the education sector. These policies contributed to Japan's significant economic development, which became evident in the 1980s when Japan emerged as one of the world's most advanced economies.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to economic development, but by studying Japan's experience, policymakers around the world could draw practical lessons from its policies.
