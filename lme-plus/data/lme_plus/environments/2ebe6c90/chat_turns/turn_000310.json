  "content": "When it comes to noise reduction, you have two options: using the in-camera noise reduction or Lightroom's noise reduction. Here's a brief rundown to help you decide:\n\n**In-camera noise reduction:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Can be more effective at reducing noise, especially in very noisy images\n\t+ Can help reduce noise in real-time, which can be beneficial for burst mode or continuous shooting\n* Cons:\n\t+ Can soften the image, leading to a loss of detail\n\t+ May introduce artifacts or \"smudging\" in some cases\n\t+ Can't be adjusted or turned off after the fact (since it's baked into the RAW file)\n\n**Lightroom's noise reduction:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ More flexible and adjustable than in-camera noise reduction\n\t+ Can be applied on a per-image basis, allowing for more control\n\t+ Can be easily adjusted or turned off if needed\n\t+ Preserves more image detail compared to in-camera noise reduction\n* Cons:\n\t+ May not be as effective at reducing noise in extremely noisy images\n\t+ Can be more time-consuming to adjust and fine-tune\n\nIn general, I recommend using Lightroom's noise reduction over in-camera noise reduction for several reasons:\n\n1. **Flexibility**: Lightroom's noise reduction is more adjustable, allowing you to fine-tune the amount of noise reduction to your taste.\n2. **Preservation of detail**: Lightroom's noise reduction tends to preserve more image detail compared to in-camera noise reduction.\n3. **Non-destructive editing**: Since Lightroom is a non-destructive editor, you can always go back and adjust or turn off the noise reduction if needed.\n\nThat being said, if you're shooting in extreme low-light conditions or using very high ISOs, you may want to enable in-camera noise reduction as a safety net. However, for most cases, I recommend disabling in-camera noise reduction and relying on Lightroom's noise reduction tools.\n\nIn your case, since you're working with a Canon 80D and a Tamron 70-300mm lens, you may not need to worry too much about noise reduction. The 80D is known for its good low-light performance, and the Tamron lens is a good performer in its class. Still, it's always a good idea to check the noise levels in your images and apply noise reduction as needed using Lightroom's tools.",
