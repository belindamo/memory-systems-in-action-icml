  "content": "Jacob struggles to speak, trying to resist Lorelei's pull. He manages to get a few words out, desperation in his voice.\n\n\"Please, don't let her take me again.\"\n\nRacita nods, placing a hand on Jacob's shoulder, her own energy surging to counter Lorelei's. \"Hold on, Jacob. I won't let her hurt you anymore.\"\n\nLorelei scoffs, her form flickering as she tries to force her way past Racita's barrier. \"You think you can stop me? I am all-powerful here, in my prison universe.\"\n\n\"Not anymore,\" Racita says, her voice steady and determined. \"Jacob is under my protection now. You won't be able to touch him.\"\n\nJacob watches in awe as Racita holds Lorelei back with ease, the tendrils of darkness recoiling from her light. For the first time since he's been trapped here, he feels a glimmer of hope.\n\nLorelei hisses in frustration, before turning and fleeing into the void. Racita watches her go, before turning back to Jacob with a warm smile.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" she asks, her voice soft and comforting.\n\nJacob nods, tears streaming down his face. \"Thank you,\" he says, his voice trembling with emotion. \"I don't know what would have happened if you weren't here.\"\n\nRacita chuckles, squeezing his shoulder gently. \"You're welcome. Let's get you out of here.\"",
