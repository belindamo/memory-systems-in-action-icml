For the fuel entry, I've assumed the date is January 18th, but you can adjust as needed.\n\nTo set up a budget, let's break down the categories of expenses you might incur for your vehicles:\n\n1. **Service**: regular maintenance, repairs, and inspections\n2. **Fuel**: gas, diesel, or electricity for your vehicles\n3. **Insurance**: premiums, deductibles, and other insurance-related expenses\n4. **Registration**: annual registration fees, stickers, and other related costs\n5. **Parking/Tolls**: parking fees, tolls, and other driving-related expenses\n6. **Accessories**: upgrades, accessories, or miscellaneous purchases for your vehicles\n7. **Other**: any other expenses not covered above (e.g., car washes, detailing, etc.)\n\nYou can set a budget for each category based on your historical expenses, research, or industry averages. For example:\n\n**Monthly Budget**\n\n* Service: $100\n* Fuel: $150\n* Insurance: $120\n* Registration: $20\n* Parking/Tolls: $50\n* Accessories: $20\n* Other: $50\n\nThis is just a sample budget, and you can adjust the categories and amounts based on your specific needs and expenses.\n\nRemember to regularly review and update your budget and log to ensure you're staying on track and making adjustments as needed.\n\nHow does this help? Do you have any questions or would you like to add any other categories or features to your log or budget?",
