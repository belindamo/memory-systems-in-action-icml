Don't be afraid to take breaks: If you need to take a break, it's okay! Simply take a moment to rest in child's pose, or sit cross-legged and breathe deeply until you're ready to join the class again.\n\n2. Focus on your breath: Your breath is a powerful tool in yoga, and can help you stay calm and centered even when the class feels challenging. Focus on your breath, and let it guide your movements.\n\n3. Modify the poses: If a pose feels too challenging, modify it by using props or adjusting your posture in a way that feels comfortable. A good teacher will be able to offer modifications and alternatives that work for your body.\n\n4. Practice at home: Practicing yoga at home can help you build confidence and familiarize yourself with the poses before joining a class. Try watching online yoga videos or using a yoga app to get started.\n\n5. Remember that everyone's journey is different: Yoga is not a competition, and everyone's body is different. It's important to honor your body and do what feels right for you, regardless of what others in the class are doing.\n\nUltimately, the best way to improve your yoga practice is by showing up and practicing regularly. Over time, you will build strength, flexibility, and confidence, and the poses will become more accessible.",
