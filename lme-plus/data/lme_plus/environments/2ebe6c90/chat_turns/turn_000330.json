  "content": "Once you have installed and configured OpenShift using Nix, there are a few additional steps that you will need to take in order to get OpenShift working on your cluster.\n\nFirst, you will need to generate the necessary SSL certificates and keys that will be used by the OpenShift components to secure communication between them. You can use the `oc adm` command-line tool to generate these certificates and keys, which will typically be stored in the `/etc/openshift/keys` directory on your system.\n\nNext, you will need to start the OpenShift components. This is typically done using the `systemd` service manager, which is included in most Linux distributions. You can use the `systemctl` command to start the various OpenShift components, such as the API server, the node components, and the controllers.\n\nOnce the components are started, you can use the `oc` command-line tool to manage and configure your OpenShift cluster. This tool allows you to create and manage projects, deploy applications, and manage users and permissions within your OpenShift cluster.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is just a general overview of the steps that you will need to take in order to get OpenShift working on your cluster. The specific steps may vary depending on your specific environment and requirements. If you need help getting OpenShift up and running on your cluster, I would recommend consulting the OpenShift documentation or seeking help from the OpenShift community.",
