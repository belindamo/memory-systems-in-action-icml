  "content": "A prime lens is an excellent addition to your kit, and both 50mm and 35mm are popular focal lengths for portraits and street photography. Here's a brief comparison to help you decide:\n\n**50mm:**\n\n* A 50mm prime lens is often considered a \"standard\" or \"normal\" lens, as it closely matches the human field of view.\n* It's an excellent choice for portraits, as it provides a natural perspective and compression, making faces and features look more flattering.\n* The 50mm focal length is also great for street photography, as it allows you to get close to your subjects without being too intrusive.\n* Many 50mm primes are relatively affordable and compact, making them easy to carry around.\n\n**35mm:**\n\n* A 35mm prime lens is a bit wider than a 50mm, providing a slightly more expansive view of the scene.\n* It's often preferred for street photography, as it allows you to capture more of the environment and context around your subject.\n* The 35mm focal length is also suitable for portraits, especially if you want to include more of the surroundings or create a sense of atmosphere.\n* Some photographers find the 35mm focal length more versatile, as it can be used for a variety of genres, from landscapes to portraits.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n* If you're primarily interested in portraits, a 50mm might be the better choice, as it provides a more flattering perspective and compression.\n* If you're interested in street photography or want a more versatile lens, a 35mm might be the better choice, as it offers a wider angle of view and more flexibility.\n* Consider the camera you're using: If you have a crop sensor camera, a 35mm lens will provide a slightly narrower angle of view compared to a full-frame camera.\n\n**Lens Recommendations:**\n\n* For a 50mm prime, consider the Tamron 45mm f/1.8 Di VC USD or the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM. Both are excellent options with a wide aperture and affordable prices.\n* For a 35mm prime, consider the Tamron 35mm f/1.8 Di VC USD or the Sigma 35mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art. Both are highly-regarded lenses with a wide aperture and excellent image quality.\n\nUltimately, the choice between a 50mm and 35mm prime lens depends on your personal preference, shooting style, and the type of photography you want to do. You can't go wrong with either focal length, and both will provide excellent image quality and a unique perspective.",
