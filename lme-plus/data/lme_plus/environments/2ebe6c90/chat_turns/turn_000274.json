Clearing out a section of your countertop and creating zones will definitely help streamline your breakfast routine.\n\nStoring breakfast utensils can be a challenge, but there are several options to keep them organized and within easy reach. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Utensil Holder**: Use a utensil holder or a crock to store spoons, spatulas, and other breakfast utensils. You can place it near your coffee zone or cereal zone, depending on your workflow.\n2. **Drawer Organizer**: Designate a drawer near your breakfast station for utensils and use a divider or inserts to separate spoons, bowls, and other items. This keeps them out of the way but still easily accessible.\n3. **Magnetic Strip**: Install a magnetic strip on the side of a cabinet or fridge to store metal utensils like spoons and spatulas. This is a great space-saving solution and keeps them within easy reach.\n4. **Over-the-Counter Utensil Holder**: Use an over-the-counter utensil holder that attaches to the edge of your countertop.

Look for bowls with a non-slip base to prevent them from scratching your countertops.\n2. **Bowls on a Rack**: Install a bowl rack on a wall or on the side of a cabinet to store bowls. This keeps them organized, saves space, and adds a decorative touch.\n3. **Cabinet Storage**: Store bowls in a cabinet near your breakfast station.
