  "content": "There are a variety of rehabilitation services that can be accessed through tele-rehabilitation, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and mental health counseling. Tele-rehabilitation has been used to provide assessment, treatment, monitoring, and ongoing management for a range of conditions, such as strokes, spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, neuromuscular disorders, and mental health conditions.\n\nThe limitation of tele-rehabilitation depends on the technology and infrastructure available, as well as the expertise of the rehabilitation specialist. Some rehabilitation techniques may require tactile or manual manipulation, which cannot be done remotely. However, many rehabilitation services can be delivered via tele-rehabilitation, and the technology is constantly evolving to bridge the gaps in service delivery caused by distance and location.",
