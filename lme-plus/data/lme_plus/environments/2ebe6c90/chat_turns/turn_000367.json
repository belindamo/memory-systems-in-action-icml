  "content": "I'm happy to help, but I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to know about specific workshops or events that you attended in the past. I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, and I don't retain any information about our previous conversations.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to provide general information about warblers and help you with your question!\n\nWarblers are a diverse group of birds, with over 50 species in North America alone. While many warblers are migratory, some species can be found in wetlands and surrounding areas during specific times of the year.\n\nIf you're visiting the wetlands this weekend, you might be able to spot some of the following warbler species, depending on the region and time of year:\n\n1. **Yellow Warbler**: A common breeder in wetlands, yellow warblers can be seen during the spring and summer months.\n2. **Common Yellowthroat**: Another common warbler in wetlands, common yellowthroats can be seen during the breeding season (spring-summer).\n3. **American Goldfinch**: While not exclusively a warbler, American goldfinches can be found in wetlands and surrounding areas, especially during the breeding season.\n4. **Nashville Warbler**: A migratory species, Nashville warblers can be seen during the spring and fall migrations, particularly in areas with dense vegetation.\n5. **Orange-crowned Warbler**: Another migratory species, orange-crowned warblers can be seen during the spring and fall migrations, often in wetlands and surrounding areas.\n\nKeep in mind that the availability of these species depends on the specific region, time of year, and habitat conditions. It's always a good idea to check with local birding reports, birding groups, or nature centers for more specific information on recent sightings and hotspots.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck on your birding adventure this weekend!",
