  "content": "Racita held Jacob tightly, shielding him from the chaos around them. Suddenly, he felt a small flicker of control return to his voice. He tried to speak, hesitantly at first, \"R-Racita...?\"\n\nRacita's eyes lit up as she heard his voice. \"Jacob! You're back!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes...yes, I am,\" he stammered, still in shock.\n\n\"Don't worry, I won't let her take you again,\" Racita promised, her voice firm.\n\nJacob couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over him. He was finally able to speak and Racita was there to protect him. He leaned his head against her shoulder, feeling safe for the first time in what felt like an eternity. \"Thank you, Racita,\" he whispered, his voice filled with gratitude.",
