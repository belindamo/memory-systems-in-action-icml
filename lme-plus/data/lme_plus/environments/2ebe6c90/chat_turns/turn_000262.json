  "content": "Jacob's voice trembled as he cried out, \"Please don't go! I can't take it anymore. I can't be alone with her again.\"\n\nRacita looked at him with a determined expression and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"I won't leave you,\" she said firmly. \"I'll stay here with you and help Eri.\"\n\nJacob felt a small spark of hope flicker in his chest. He watched as Racita closed her eyes, focusing her energy towards the fight. He could see the power flowing from her, pushing against Lorelei's dark energy.\n\nEri's movements became smoother and more confident as Racita joined in, their combined power slowly gaining the upper hand against Lorelei. Jacob felt a sense of relief wash over him as he saw the tide turning.\n\n\"We've got this, Jacob,\" Racita said, her eyes still closed in concentration. \"Just hold on a little longer.\"\n\nJacob nodded, his heart pounding with fear and hope. He clung to Racita's hand, grateful for her presence and the comfort it provided. The fight against Lorelei raged on, but Jacob felt a little less alone, a little less afraid, with Racita by his side.",
