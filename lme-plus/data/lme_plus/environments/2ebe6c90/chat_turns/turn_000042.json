I'm sure you'll have many fond memories of that trip.\n\nNow, about keeping kids occupied during long drives... Here are some tips that might help:\n\n1. **Audiobooks and podcasts**: Engage your kids with engaging stories, educational podcasts, or fun kids' shows. You can find plenty of options on platforms like Audible, Scribd, or popular podcast apps.\n2. **Road trip bingo**: Create bingo cards with items commonly seen on the road, like cows, billboards, or rest stops. The first one to get five in a row wins!\n3. **Car games**: Classics like \"I Spy,\" \"20 Questions,\" and \"Would You Rather\" are great for encouraging imagination and interaction. You can also play \"License Plate Tag\" where kids try to spot license plates from different states.\n4. **Tablets and handheld games**: Load up on educational apps, games, and e-books to keep kids entertained. Don't forget headphones to keep the noise level down.\n5. **Snack and drink stations**: Set up a snack station with healthy options and let kids help themselves. You can also create a \"mystery snack box\" with surprise treats.\n6. **Pit stops and breaks**: Plan regular breaks at rest stops, parks, or attractions to stretch legs, run around, and refuel. This helps prevent boredom and restlessness.\n7. **Scavenger hunt**: Create a list of items for kids to find on the road, like different types of cars, roadside attractions, or cloud shapes.\n8. **Car karaoke**: Sing along to favorite songs or create a playlist with kid-friendly tunes. You can also have a \"car dance party\" to get everyone moving.\n9. **Travel journals**: Encourage kids to document their trip by writing, drawing, or collecting souvenirs like brochures, postcards, or ticket stubs.\n10. **Take turns**: Let each child take turns choosing the music, picking a game, or deciding on a snack. This helps them feel more invested in the trip and reduces squabbles.\n\nRemember, the key is to be flexible and adapt to your kids' moods and interests. With a little creativity, you can turn long drives into enjoyable bonding experiences for the whole family!\n\nHow's your planning going so far? Are there any specific activities or attractions you're looking to prioritize in Yellowstone?",
