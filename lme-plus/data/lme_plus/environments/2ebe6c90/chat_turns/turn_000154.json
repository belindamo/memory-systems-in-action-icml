  "content": "While some rehabilitation exercises and techniques can be learned and performed independently, it is generally recommended to have a healthcare provider guide you through the exercises and techniques to ensure you are doing them safely and effectively. A healthcare provider can also make adaptations to the exercise to fit your specific needs.\n\nWith tele-rehabilitation, a healthcare provider can observe your exercises and techniques, offer feedback, and suggest modifications or adjustments as necessary. In addition, some video conferencing platforms support screen sharing, so a therapist can demonstrate techniques and provide visual feedback. Orthopedic, speech and occupational therapy providers have found this option to be especially helpful for evaluating form and technique, as well as fine motor movements or speech concerns.\n\nOverall, a healthcare provider's guidance and feedback are essential to maximize the effectiveness and safety of your rehabilitation exercises and techniques, but tele-rehabilitation can be an excellent option for remote access. It's important to discuss with your healthcare provider whether tele-rehabilitation services are appropriate for you and the exercises or the techniques you need to perform, as some may require in-person guidance or monitoring.",
