By the way, when I got my Toyota Camry serviced, they replaced the air filter, changed the oil, and rotated the tires. Can you add those details to the log? Also, can you help me calculate my fuel efficiency for the Toyota Camry? I remember the odometer reading was 23,456 miles when I filled up gas on January 18th.",
