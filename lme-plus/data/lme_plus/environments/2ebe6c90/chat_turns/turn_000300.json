  "content": "If a star cannot be observed with telescopes, it is not possible to directly classify it. This may happen if the star is too faint, too far away or if it is obscured by dust or gas clouds. However, scientists can still infer some properties of this star indirectly using techniques such as gravitational lensing, astrometry, and proper motion measurements.\n\nFor example, the gravitational attraction of an invisible companion star can be inferred from its effect on the motion of a visible star. The luminosity of a distant star can be estimated based on its apparent brightness, and by assuming the star is at a known distance.\n\nIn addition, theoretical models can also be used to predict the physical properties of stars based on their mass, size, age, and composition. These models can help to categorize these stars based on their properties even if they cannot be directly observed.\n\nSo while it may not be possible to directly classify a star that cannot be observed with telescopes, it is still possible to make scientific progress by inferring information about it indirectly.",
