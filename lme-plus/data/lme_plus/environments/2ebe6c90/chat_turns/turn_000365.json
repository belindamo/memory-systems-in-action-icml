  "content": "The nearby wetlands sound like a great spot for birding! Ospreys are amazing birds, and it's fantastic that you've already spotted one there.\n\nAs for spotting other birds of prey, the wetlands can be a good habitat for several species. Hawks and eagles are possible, but it depends on the time of year, the specific wetland conditions, and a bit of luck. Here are some possibilities to keep an eye out for:\n\n1. **Bald Eagles**: While not as common in wetlands as other birds of prey, Bald Eagles can be found near bodies of water, especially if there's a nearby fish supply. They're more likely to be seen during the winter months or during migration periods.\n2. **Red-tailed Hawks**: These hawks are common in open areas, including wetlands, and can be seen year-round in many regions. They're opportunistic hunters, feeding on small mammals, reptiles, and birds.\n3. **American Kestrels**: These small, colorful falcons are often seen hovering over wetlands, searching for insects, small mammals, and birds. They're common in open areas and can be seen during the breeding season (spring-summer).\n4. **Northern Harriers**: These hawks are known for their slow, low-flying hunting style, often seen over wetlands, grasslands, and marshes. They're more common during migration periods (spring and fall).\n5. **Cooper's Hawks**: These medium-sized hawks are known for their agility and speed, often seen flying through dense vegetation in pursuit of small birds. They can be seen in wetlands, especially during the breeding season.\n\nTo increase your chances of spotting these birds of prey:\n\n* **Be patient**: Spend time observing the wetlands, and keep an eye out for birds soaring, perching, or hunting.\n* **Look for perches**: Trees, power lines, or other elevated spots can be great vantage points for birds of prey to scan their surroundings.\n* **Scan the skies**: Regularly scan the horizon and sky for birds in flight, as they can be easily missed when they're soaring or flying at a distance.\n* **Observe bird behavior**: If you notice other birds behaving erratically or fleeing, it might indicate the presence of a bird of prey in the area.\n\nRemember to respect these magnificent birds and maintain a safe distance to avoid disturbing them. Enjoy your trip to the wetlands, and I hope you spot some amazing birds of prey!",
