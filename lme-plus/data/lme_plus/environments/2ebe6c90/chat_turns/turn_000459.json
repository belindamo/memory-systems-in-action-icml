  "content": "Now we have all the information we need to calculate your fuel efficiency.\n\nLet's calculate the fuel efficiency:\n\n**Previous odometer reading**: unknown (we'll call it X)\n**Odometer reading at fill-up**: 23,456 miles\n**Gallons of fuel consumed**: 15 gallons\n\nTo calculate the fuel efficiency, we need to know the miles driven between fill-ups. Let's call the previous odometer reading X. Then, the miles driven between fill-ups is:\n\nMiles driven = Odometer reading at fill-up - Previous odometer reading\n= 23,456 - X\n\nWe can now calculate the fuel efficiency:\n\nFuel Efficiency (MPG) = Miles driven / Gallons of fuel consumed\n= (23,456 - X) / 15\n\nTo get an accurate calculation, we need to know the previous odometer reading (X). If you can recall or find the previous odometer reading, we can plug it in and get the exact fuel efficiency.\n\nIf you don't have the previous odometer reading, we can still estimate your fuel efficiency by using the average miles driven between fill-ups. For example, if you typically drive around 300-400 miles between fill-ups, we can use that estimate.\n\nLet me know if you remember the previous odometer reading or if you'd like to use an estimate.",
