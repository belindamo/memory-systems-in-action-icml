Can you remember or check your records for the previous odometer reading? Once we have that, we can calculate your fuel efficiency.\n\nLet's assume the previous odometer reading was X miles. We can use the following formula to calculate your fuel efficiency:\n\nFuel Efficiency (MPG) = (Odometer reading at fill-up - Previous odometer reading) / Gallons of fuel consumed\n\nSince you filled up on January 18th, we know the odometer reading at fill-up is 23,456 miles. You mentioned the fuel cost was $35.50, but we need to know the number of gallons purchased. Can you check your receipt or remember how many gallons you filled up? If you don't have the exact number, we can estimate it based on the price per gallon in your area.\n\nOnce we have the gallons consumed, we can plug in the numbers and calculate your fuel efficiency.",
