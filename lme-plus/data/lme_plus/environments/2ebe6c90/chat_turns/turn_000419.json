  "content": "Promotions in the Indian Army are based on a combination of seniority and merit. The primary factor in promotion is seniority, with officers being promoted based on their length of service in their current rank. However, merit is also a key consideration, with officers being evaluated on their performance in a range of areas, including physical fitness, leadership skills, and professional competence. Officers who demonstrate exceptional merit can be promoted ahead of their peers, even if they have not yet achieved the requisite seniority. Overall, the Indian Army seeks to balance the need for experienced leadership with the importance of recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance.",
