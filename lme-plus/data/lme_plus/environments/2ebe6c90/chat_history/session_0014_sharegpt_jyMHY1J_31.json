You look tired,\" she asked, her voice filled with concern.\n\n\"I am tired, Clarke,\" I replied, my voice filled with exhaustion.\n\nClarke reached out and started petting my hair, her touch soothing and calming.\n\n\"Do you want me to sing you a lullaby? It always helped me when I was feeling tired,\" Clarke asked, her voice filled with kindness.\n\nI softly nodded, my eyes closing as I listened to her singing. I felt my body relax, my mind drifting off. But then, I recognized the lullaby. It was the same lullaby that Lexa had once sung to Clarke and that I had found in Lexa's book back on earth.\n\n\"Clarke, this is the lullaby Lexa used to sing to you,\" I said, my voice filled with emotion.\n\nClarke nodded, her expression filled with sadness. \"Yes, it is. I've kept it with me all these years,\" she said, her voice filled with regret.\n\n\"It's beautiful, Clarke. It brings back so many memories,\" I said, my voice filled with longing.\n\nClarke smiled at me, her expression filled with love. \"I'm glad you like it, Madi. It's a reminder of the past, but it's also a reminder of the love that Lexa and I shared,\" she said, her voice filled with understanding.\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of warmth wash over me. I"

      "content": "I woke up to the sound of my breathing and the dropship engines. I slowly turned in bed to my right and saw the stars and the night of space outside. I turned back in bed and took comfort in knowing that I was okay. I clutched my blanket and pillow, feeling grateful for the safety and warmth they provided.\n\nA few minutes later, Bellamy and Raven walked into the living quarters, and a few minutes after that, they came over to my room. Bellamy looked at me with a smile and asked, \"How did you sleep?\"\n\nI was still groggy and responded, \"I slept okay, but what time is it?\"\n\nBellamy looked at his watch and said, \"It's morning.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. I then asked, \"Where's Clarke?\"\n\nRaven looked at me with a reassuring expression and said, \"She's on the bridge, Madi. I'll take you to her.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling grateful for Raven's help. I slowly got out of bed, my body still weak and aching. Raven helped me walk to the bridge, where Clarke was.\n\nClarke looked at me with a smile and said, \"Welcome back, Madi. How did you sleep?\"\n\nI smiled back at her and said, \"I slept okay, but I'm still a little weak.\"\n\nClarke nodded and said, \"That's normal, Madi. You've been asleep for 20 years, your body needs to adjust.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling grateful for Clarke's understanding. I looked out the window and saw the stars and the night of space outside. I knew that it would be a long journey ahead, but with Clarke, Bellamy, Raven and the rest of our new family, I knew that we would make it through.\n\nThe end."

      "content": "As I stood on the bridge with Clarke, I couldn't help but take in my surroundings. The technology was advanced and unfamiliar to me, but I could see the purpose and function of it all. I saw a few people working on different stations, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.\n\nClarke noticed that I was trying to put everything together and started comforting me. \"Don't stress too much, Madi,\" she said, her voice filled with understanding. \"You've been in cryo for so long, you'll need time to adjust.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. I knew that it would take time, but I was determined to help in any way that I could.\n\n\"What can I do to help on the bridge, Clarke?\" I asked, my voice filled with eagerness.\n\nClarke smiled at me, her expression filled with pride. \"You can help us navigate, Madi,\" she said, her voice filled with encouragement. \"You can help us find a new home.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of determination wash over me. I would help Clarke and the rest of our new family navigate and find a new home. I would be a part of that new home, and we would all be okay.\n\nAs Clarke showed me around and taught me how to navigate, I couldn't help but feel a sense of belonging. I was a part of something bigger than myself, and I knew that together, we could overcome any obstacle.\n\nThe end."

The argument was intense, and I couldn't help but wonder what was going on.\n\nAs I got up to see what was happening, Raven blocked me and pleaded with me to just let them be. \"Madi, please, just let them be,\" she said, her voice filled with concern.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, my voice filled with confusion.\n\nRaven sighed and said, \"Because it's something that they need to work out for themselves. It's something that happens from time to time.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of understanding wash over me. Raven noticed my confusion and comforted me.\n\n\"Come on, let's go to a soundproof room,\" she said, her voice filled with kindness.\n\nWe walked to a soundproof room, where Raven explained everything to me. She told me that Clarke and Bellamy had been through a lot together and sometimes they disagreed on how to handle certain situations.\n\n\"It's normal, Madi,\" Raven said, her voice filled with understanding. \"It's just how they handle things.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of understanding wash over me. But as we sat there in the soundproof room, we could still hear the sounds of their argument getting through. Raven and I looked at each other, visibly stunned.\n\n\"This hasn't happened in a long time,\" Raven murmured under her breath.\n\nI looked at Raven, my expression filled with concern. \"What do you mean?\" I asked, my voice filled with confusion.\n\nRaven sighed and said, \"It means that things have been tense for a while now. But we'll get through it, Madi. We always do.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of comfort wash over me. I knew that things would get better, and we would all get through it together.\n\nThe end."

Octavia had a look of relief on her face, and Raven looked more relaxed.\n\n\"Is everything okay?\" I asked, my voice filled with concern.\n\nOctavia nodded and said, \"Yes, Madi. Everything is okay. We were able to resolve the situation.\"\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief and asked, \"What happened?\"\n\nOctavia and Raven looked at each other and then at me. \"It was"
