Here are some tips to help you repot your fiddle leaf fig tree:\n\n**When to Repot:**\n\n* Fiddle leaf fig trees typically need to be repotted every 1-2 years, as they can outgrow their containers quickly.\n* Look for signs like roots growing out of the drainage holes, water draining quickly, or the plant becoming top-heavy.\n\n**Choose the Right Pot:**\n\n* Select a pot that is only 1-2 sizes larger than the current one. Fiddle leaf figs prefer a slightly root-bound condition.\n* Make sure the new pot has good drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil.\n\n**Prepare the Soil:**\n\n* Use a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for indoor plants.\n* Avoid using regular garden soil, as it can compact and prevent proper drainage.\n\n**Repotting Steps:**\n\n1. **Water the plant**: Water your fiddle leaf fig tree 1-2 days before repotting to make the soil easier to handle.\n2. **Remove the plant**: Gently remove the plant from its pot, taking care not to damage the roots or disturb the soil.\n3. **Inspect the roots**: Inspect the roots to see if they've become pot-bound. If they have, gently tease them apart with your fingers or a blunt instrument to encourage new growth.\n4. **Trim old soil**: Remove any old, dead, or circling roots, and trim away any old potting mix from the roots.\n5. **Add fresh soil**: Place a layer of fresh potting mix in the new pot, and gently place the plant in its new home.\n6. **Add more soil**: Fill in the sides with fresh potting mix, gently firming it in place as you go. Make sure not to compact the soil too much.\n7. **Water well**: Water your fiddle leaf fig tree thoroughly after repotting to settle the soil and provide enough moisture.\n\n**Post-Repotting Care:**\n\n* **Monitor watering**: Keep an eye on your plant's watering needs, as they may change after repotting.\n* **Provide humidity**: Fiddle leaf figs prefer a humid environment, so you can place the pot on a tray with pebbles and water to increase the humidity around the plant.\n* **Prune**: Prune your fiddle leaf fig tree 1-2 weeks after repotting to maintain its shape and encourage new growth.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully repot your fiddle leaf fig tree and give it the room it needs to thrive. Good luck!",
