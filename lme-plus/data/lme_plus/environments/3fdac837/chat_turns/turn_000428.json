  "content": "Frogs and toads belong to the same class of amphibians, but there are some differences between them.\n\nBody structure: Frogs have smooth, slimy skin while toads have dry, bumpy and warty skin. Frogs are usually slim and agile while toads are stout and slow-moving.\n\nHabitat: Frogs are mostly found in or near water such as ponds, lakes, swamps, and other wetlands. Toads can be found in a wide range of environments such as grasslands, forests, deserts, and rocky areas. They prefer drier habitats than frogs.\n\nEggs: Frogs lay their eggs in clusters, while toads lay them in long strands.\n\nHind legs: Frogs have longer hind legs compared to their front legs, which allows them to jump and swim efficiently. Toads have shorter hind legs, and they mostly walk or slowly hop.\n\nTongue: Frogs have a long and sticky tongue that they use to catch insects and other prey. Toads have a shorter and less sticky tongue, and they mostly eat larger prey like worms, snails, and small mammals.\n\nOverall, frogs prefer watery habitats while toads prefer drier areas. However, there are exceptions to these generalizations, and some types of frogs and toads may share similar habitats.",
