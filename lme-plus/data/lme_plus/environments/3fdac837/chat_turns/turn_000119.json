  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! Strawberries might not be the best fit for Quiche Lorraine or Egg and Veggie Frittata, as they're savory dishes that typically don't pair well with sweet ingredients like strawberries. Quiche Lorraine is a classic French dish that typically features bacon or ham, onions, and cheese, while Egg and Veggie Frittata is a versatile Italian-style omelette that can accommodate various vegetables like bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and spinach.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to suggest some alternative recipes that feature strawberries as a main ingredient! Strawberries are a delicious addition to sweet dishes like:\n\n1. **Strawberry French Toast**: Sliced strawberries layered with French toast, whipped cream, and maple syrup make for a delightful breakfast or brunch.\n2. **Strawberry Spinach Salad**: A refreshing summer salad featuring sliced strawberries, baby spinach, crumbled feta, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.\n3. **Strawberry Smoothie**: Blend fresh strawberries with your choice of milk, yogurt, and honey for a quick and healthy snack or breakfast on-the-go.\n\nIf you're looking to incorporate more veggies into your meals, I can suggest some alternative vegetables that pair well with eggs in the Quiche Lorraine and Egg and Veggie Frittata recipes:\n\n* Bell peppers\n* Onions\n* Mushrooms\n* Spinach\n* Broccoli\n* Zucchini\n* Carrots\n\nFeel free to pick one or a combination of these veggies to add to your quiche or frittata. Simply saut\u00e9 them in a pan with some olive oil, salt, and pepper before adding the eggs and cheese.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
