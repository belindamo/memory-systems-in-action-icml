  "content": "I'm really intrigued by the Fried Zucchini Flowers. I've never had them before, but they sound delicious! Do you have a recipe I could follow, and do I need any special ingredients or equipment? Also, by the way, I've been keeping track of all the recipes I've tried and cooking classes I've attended in a spreadsheet - it's become my go-to resource for meal planning. Speaking of cooking classes, do you think I could find a class that focuses on Korean BBQ? I've been wanting to learn more about working with ingredients like tofu and tempeh.",
