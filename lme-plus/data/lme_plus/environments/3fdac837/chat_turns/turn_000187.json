The key is to balance the contrast between the dark boots and the light dress. Here are a few tips to consider:\n\n1. **Add a layering piece**: Throw on a denim jacket, a cardigan, or a kimono to add a layer between the dress and the boots. This will help break up the contrast and create a more cohesive look.\n2. **Emphasize the dress's details**: If the sundress has interesting details like lace, ruffles, or embroidery, try to draw attention to those features with a statement necklace or a belt. This will distract from the contrast between the dress and the boots.\n3. **Play with textures**: Mix different textures to add depth to the outfit. For example, pair the flowy sundress with a suede jacket or a faux-fur coat to add a tactile element.\n4. **Consider the dress's length**: If the sundress is very short, it might be challenging to pull off with black boots. However, if it's a midi or maxi dress, the longer length can create a more balanced look.\n5. **Accessories can make or break**: Add some earthy or natural accessories like a woven bag, a floppy hat, or a pair of layered necklaces to bring the outfit together.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could try a few things:\n\n* Take a photo of yourself wearing the dress and boots together. Sometimes, seeing the outfit in a photo can help you visualize the look better.\n* Experiment with different ways of styling the dress, like adding a belt or tying a scarf around your waist.\n* Try pairing the boots with a similar light-colored top and dark-washed jeans to see if you like the contrast.\n\nRemember, fashion is all about experimentation and having fun! If you're feeling unsure, you can always try out the outfit and see how you feel about it.",
