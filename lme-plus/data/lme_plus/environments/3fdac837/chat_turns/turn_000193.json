I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can tell you that Sephora is a popular beauty retailer with a wide range of products from various brands. They usually have a great selection of skincare, makeup, and fragrances, as well as knowledgeable staff to help with any questions or recommendations.\n\nIf you're planning to visit the new store, I recommend checking out their website or social media to see if they have any promotions, discounts, or events happening. You might be able to score some great deals or get a sneak peek at new products.\n\nAlso, if you're a beauty enthusiast, you might want to consider joining their loyalty program, Beauty Insider. It's free to join, and you'll get access to exclusive perks, rewards, and early access to new products.\n\nHave fun exploring the new store, and happy shopping!",
