You'll love it!\n\nI'm so glad to hear you had a great time exploring Chicago during your last trip in March! The Lake Michigan shoreline is indeed a beautiful spot to walk and take in the sights. The city's lakefront path, which stretches from North Avenue Beach to Navy Pier, offers stunning views of the city skyline and the lake.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more of the lakefront, you might want to consider visiting some of the city's beautiful beaches, like Oak Street Beach or North Avenue Beach. During the summer months, these beaches are perfect spots to soak up the sun, take a dip in the lake, or try your hand at water sports like kayaking or paddleboarding.\n\nIf you're looking for more outdoor activities, you could also explore Millennium Park, which is just a short walk from The Wit Hotel. The park is home to iconic landmarks like the \"Cloud Gate\" sculpture (also known as \"The Bean\"), the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, and the beautiful Lurie Garden.\n\nWhat are your interests? Are you looking for more outdoor activities, cultural attractions, or something else during your trip?",
