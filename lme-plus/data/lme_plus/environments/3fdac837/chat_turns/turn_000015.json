Watering them every Sunday morning is a great routine, but I do have some suggestions to help you keep them pest-free:\n\n1. **Inspect your plants regularly**: Set aside some time each week to inspect your plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stems, for any signs of pests. Look for tiny eggs, larvae, actual pests, or unusual damage.\n2. **Check for pests before watering**: Before watering, gently shake or tap the pot to dislodge any pests that might be hiding in the soil. This can help prevent them from spreading to other plants.\n3. **Use a well-draining potting mix**: A well-draining potting mix can help prevent waterlogged soil, which can attract pests. Make sure your potting mix contains ingredients like perlite, vermiculite, or sand to improve drainage.\n4. **Avoid overwatering**: Overwatering can attract pests and create an ideal environment for them to thrive. Stick to your Sunday watering schedule, and adjust as needed based on the weather and your plants' needs.\n5. **Keep your plants clean**: Regularly wipe down your plants' leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust and debris. This can help prevent pests from settling in.\n6. **Isolate new plants**: When introducing new plants to your collection, keep them isolated for a few weeks to ensure they're pest-free. This can prevent any potential pests from spreading to your other plants.\n7. **Use neem oil**: Neem oil is a natural, non-toxic pesticide that can be used to control a wide range of pests. Mix neem oil with water according to the label instructions and spray it on your plants as a preventative measure or to treat infestations.\n8. **Keep your home clean**: Regularly vacuum and dust your home, especially areas around your plants, to reduce the risk of pests being introduced to your plants.\n\nSome specific tips for your plants:\n\n* **Snake Plant**: Snake plants are generally low-maintenance, but they can be susceptible to spider mites. Keep an eye out for fine webbing or tiny, moving dots on the leaves.\n* **Spider Plant**: Spider plants can be prone to mealybugs, spider mites, and scale. Check the undersides of leaves and stems regularly, and treat promptly if you notice any issues.\n* **Peace Lily**: Peace lilies can be susceptible to spider mites, mealybugs, and scale. Make sure to inspect the plant's leaves and stems regularly, and avoid getting water on the plant's crown (where the leaves meet the stem).\n* **Dracaena**: Dracaena can be prone to spider mites, mealybugs, and scale. Keep an eye out for yellowing or dropping leaves, and inspect the plant's stems and leaves regularly.\n* **Basil**: Basil is susceptible to aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Regularly inspect the leaves and stems, and treat promptly if you notice any issues. Keep your basil plants away from other plants to prevent pests from spreading.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep your plants pest-free and thriving. Happy planting!",
