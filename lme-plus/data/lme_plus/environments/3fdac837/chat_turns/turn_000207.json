  "content": "Family advice on decorating can be...interesting, can't it? Don't worry, I'm here to help you explore some fresh ideas for your living room layout!\n\nBefore we dive into specific suggestions, could you please tell me a bit more about your space and your personal style? For instance:\n\n1. What's the approximate size of your living room?\n2. What's the shape of the room (e.g., rectangular, square, L-shaped)?\n3. What type of furniture do you already have or plan to purchase (e.g., sectional sofa, armchairs, coffee table)?\n4. Do you have any specific design styles or eras in mind (e.g., modern, minimalist, industrial, bohemian)?\n5. What's your preferred color palette or any specific colors you'd like to incorporate?\n6. Do you have any windows or architectural features (e.g., fireplace, built-in shelves) that you'd like to highlight or work around?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your space and preferences, I can offer more tailored suggestions for your living room layout.\n\n(And feel free to ignore or consider your mom's advice as you see fit \u2013 after all, it's your space!)",
