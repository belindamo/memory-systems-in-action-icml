  "content": "The local retailer has been in business for 20 years, selling car batteries and accessories, as well as providing repair services. The business model has remained traditional, serving local customers with loyalty, but facing stock pressure due to the need to meet sales targets in order to receive discounts from suppliers. The retailer sometimes struggles to serve all customers due to a lack of available staff and the difficulty in providing product recommendations based on the customer's car model. Additionally, appointments for repairs are sometimes missed due to scheduling issues. The proposed system aims to provide a platform that will improve the customer shopping experience by offering a user-friendly frontend with a comprehensive product recommendation system based on the customer's car model, a shopping cart, payment gateway, and appointment scheduling. The backend system will support the frontend and provide the retailer with an interface to manage inventory, orders, and schedules more easily. The goal of this project is to make the shopping and repair experience more convenient and efficient for customers while providing the retailer with improved management capabilities.",
