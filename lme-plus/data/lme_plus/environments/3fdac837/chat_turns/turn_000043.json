You can set up challenges that mimic the Umbrella Academy's training exercises, like agility tests, strength challenges, and problem-solving activities. Don't forget to add some fun elements, like balloons to pop or \"laser beams\" to navigate through.\n\n**TV Show-Themed Costume Contest:** Absolutely love it! A costume contest is a great way to encourage creativity and engagement among your guests. By opening it up to all TV shows, you'll get to see a wide range of creative costumes. It'll be fascinating to see which characters your friends choose to embody.\n\nTo make it even more exciting, you could offer prizes for different categories, such as:\n\n* Best Overall Costume\n* Best Group Costume (for groups of 3 or more)\n* Best TV Show Representation (for costumes that perfectly capture the spirit of a specific show)\n* Most Creative Use of Materials (for costumes that showcase innovative crafting or DIY skills)\n\nYou could also have a \"People's Choice\" award, where guests vote for their favorite costume. This will encourage everyone to mingle and appreciate the creativity on display.\n\nTo take it to the next level, consider setting up a photo booth with TV show-themed backdrops or props. This will give your guests a chance to take memorable photos with their friends and showcase their costumes.\n\nHow's your party planning going so far? Are there any other activities or elements you're considering adding to the mix?",
