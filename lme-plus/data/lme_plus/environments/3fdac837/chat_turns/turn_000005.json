Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Fried Zucchini Flowers (Fiori di Zucchina Fritti) Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 12-15 zucchini flowers (male flowers work best, as they have a longer stem and are less bitter)\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1 cup whole milk\n* Vegetable oil for frying\n* Mozzarella cheese, sliced (optional)\n* Anchovies, chopped (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the filling: In a bowl, mix together Parmesan, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper.\n2. Prepare the zucchini flowers: Gently rinse the flowers and remove the stamens. Pat them dry with paper towels.\n3. Fill the flowers: Stuff each flower with about 1-2 teaspoons of the filling, depending on their size.\n4. Prepare the batter: In a separate bowl, whisk together flour and milk until smooth. The batter should still be slightly lumpy.\n5. Fry the flowers: Heat about 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Dip each stuffed flower into the batter, making sure it's fully coated, then gently place it in the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.\n6. Serve: Serve the fried zucchini flowers hot, garnished with additional parsley and a dollop of whipped ricotta or a slice of mozzarella cheese, if desired. Anchovies can be added on top for a salty kick.\n\nSpecial equipment needed:\n\n* Deep frying pan or a deep fryer\n* Thermometer (optional, but recommended to ensure the oil reaches 350\u00b0F/175\u00b0C)\n\nTips:\n\n* Use fresh and dry zucchini flowers for the best results.\n* Don't overfill the flowers, as the filling can make them burst during frying.\n* If you want to get fancy, you can add a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top of the fried flowers for a sweet and savory contrast.\n\nNow, about your spreadsheet \u2013 that's an amazing way to keep track of your cooking journey!
