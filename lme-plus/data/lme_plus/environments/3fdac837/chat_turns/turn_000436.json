  "content": "Yes, there have been several cases of humans being harmed by frog and toad toxins. The severity of the effects can vary depending on the species and amount of toxins involved. Here are a few examples:\n\n1) Poison dart frogs: While the toxins in poison dart frogs are toxic to predators, they can also be harmful to humans if ingested or touched. The toxins can cause numbness, tingling, and muscle spasms, and in extreme cases, can lead to paralysis or death. However, it's important to note that not all species of poison dart frogs are toxic, and some are harmless to humans.\n\n2) Colorado River toad: The toxins in Colorado River toads can be deadly to humans if ingested or touched. Symptoms can include hallucinations, vomiting, seizures, and even cardiac arrest. In some cases, the effects of the toxins can be fatal.\n\n3) Cane toad: The toxins in cane toads can cause a range of symptoms in humans, including vomiting, seizures, and paranoia. While fatalities are rare, some cases of human deaths have been linked to cane toad toxins.\n\n4) Fire-bellied toad: The tetrodotoxin produced by fire-bellied toads is toxic to humans if ingested. Symptoms can include numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness, and in extreme cases, can lead to paralysis or even death.\n\nWhile cases of human harm from frog and toad toxins are relatively rare, it's important for people to be aware of the potential risks and to avoid handling or ingesting these animals. If you do come into contact with a frog or toad and experience any symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.",
