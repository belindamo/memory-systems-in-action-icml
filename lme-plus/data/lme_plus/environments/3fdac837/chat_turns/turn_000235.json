You can also use the \"Marketplace\" section to find records that are not commonly listed.\n5. **Be patient**: Rare records can take time to find, so be prepared to wait and keep an eye on your wantlist.\n\n**eBay:**\n\n1. **Use specific keywords**: Similar to Discogs, use specific keywords to find the record you're looking for.\n2. **Use eBay's filters**: eBay's filters can help you narrow down your search by condition, price, location, and seller rating.\n3. **Check the seller's feedback**: Make sure the seller has a good feedback rating (95% or higher) and a high number of feedback ratings.\n4. **Look for rare or hard-to-find records**: Use eBay's \"Completed listings\" feature to find records that have sold in the past, which can give you an idea of their rarity.\n5. **Be cautious of auctions**: Auctions can be risky, as you may end up paying more than you intended. Set a maximum bid and stick to it.\n\n**Negotiating Prices:**\n\n1. **Research the market value**: Before making an offer, research the market value of the record to determine a fair price.\n2. **Start with a low offer**: If you're making an offer, start with a lower price than you're willing to pay. This gives room for negotiation.\n3. **Be respectful and polite**: When negotiating, be respectful and polite in your messages. Avoid being pushy or aggressive.\n4. **Look for bundle deals**: If you're buying multiple records from the same seller, ask if they'd be willing to give you a discount for a bundle deal.\n5. **Walk away if necessary**: If the seller is unwilling to negotiate, be prepared to walk away. There are often multiple sellers with the same record, so don't be afraid to look elsewhere.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Keep an eye on prices**: Prices for rare records can fluctuate, so keep an eye on prices and pounce when you find a good deal.\n2. **Consider buying from smaller sellers**: Smaller sellers may have lower prices or be more willing to negotiate than larger sellers.\n3. **Check the record's condition**: Make sure you understand the record's condition and any flaws before making a purchase.\n4. **Use a secure payment method**: Always use a secure payment method, such as PayPal, to protect yourself in case of a dispute.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to finding rare records on Discogs and eBay, and negotiating prices like a pro!",
