I'd be happy to help you get started and offer some advice on growing your audience.\n\n**Getting Started:**\n\n1. **Define your niche**: While you've branched out from vinyl records to coins and sports cards, consider focusing on a specific aspect of collecting, like rare records, error coins, or vintage sports cards. This will help you attract a targeted audience.\n2. **Set up your channel**: Create a YouTube account, choose a username, and customize your channel art, description, and tags. Make sure your channel name and description clearly reflect your content.\n3. **Invest in quality equipment**: You'll need a good camera, microphone, and lighting. You don't need the most expensive gear, but invest in a decent setup to ensure your videos look and sound professional.\n4. **Plan your content**: Develop a content calendar to help you stay organized and consistent. You can start with introductory videos, showcasing your collection, and then move on to tutorials, reviews, and tips.\n5. **Record and edit**: Use a video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve to edit your videos.
