  "content": "You're absolutely right! Bundling records together can be a fantastic way to score some amazing deals, and it's always worth asking sellers if they're willing to bundle or offer a discount for multiple purchases. And I completely agree about reaching out to sellers with questions or to negotiate prices. Most sellers are passionate about music and want to find their records a good home, so they're often willing to work with you to come to a fair price.\n\nIt's also important to build relationships with sellers, especially if you find ones who consistently have great inventory and are willing to work with you. You can build trust and get access to exclusive deals or early access to new listings.\n\nAdditionally, don't be afraid to make an offer on a record even if it's not listed as \"negotiable\". Sometimes, sellers are open to negotiating, but don't always advertise it. A polite and respectful offer can go a long way in getting you a better price.\n\nRemember, buying rare records online requires patience, persistence, and research. But with the right mindset and strategies, you can find some incredible deals and add to your collection.\n\nDo you have any favorite rare records in your collection, or ones that you're still on the hunt for?",
