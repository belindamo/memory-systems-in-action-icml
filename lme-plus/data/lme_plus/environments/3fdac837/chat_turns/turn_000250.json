I was thinking of doing a video on my favorite vintage baseball cards from the 1950s, and I have a few rare ones featuring players like Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays. I also have some coins from my grandfather's collection that I've been researching, and I'd love to share some of the interesting history behind them. Do you have any tips on how to incorporate my coin collection into my YouTube channel, especially since it's not directly related to sports cards or vinyl records?",
