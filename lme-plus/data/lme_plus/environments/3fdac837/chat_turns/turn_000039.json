Encourage guests to dress up in retro-inspired outfits.\n2. **The Upside Down Invasion**: Transform your party space into Hawkins, Indiana, with a dark, eerie atmosphere, dim lighting, and plenty of nostalgic 80s references.\n3. **Mystery Mansion Soiree**: Create a sophisticated, mysterious ambiance inspired by The Haunting of Hill House or The Twilight Zone. Use dark colors, candelabras, and eerie lighting.\n4. **Superhero Training Academy**: Design a space inspired by The Umbrella Academy, with a superhero training facility theme, complete with obstacle courses, superhero posters, and a \"training simulation\" area.\n\n**Decorations:**\n\n* Use balloons, streamers, and banners in retro colors like neon pink, green, and blue.\n* Hang up posters and prints of the TV shows you're featuring.\n* Set up a \"strange\" or \"mysterious\" area with eerie lighting, fog machines, and strange artifacts.\n* Create a \"command center\" with old computers, radios, and other retro tech.\n* Set up a \"training area\" with obstacles, punching bags, and superhero gear.\n* Use caution tape, police lights, and crime scene markers to create a crime scene atmosphere.\n\n**Snacks and Drinks:**\n\n* **Retro Snacks**: Serve classic snacks like popcorn, candy, and chips, as well as retro-themed treats like pixelated cupcakes, \"Dungeons & Dragons\"-inspired cookies, or \"Stranger Things\"-themed ice cream.\n* **Mysterious Morsels**: Offer mysterious, eerie treats like \"poison\" apples, \"mystery meat\" sandwiches, or \"otherworldly\" energy drinks.\n* **Superhero Snacks**: Serve snacks inspired by The Umbrella Academy, like \"superhero trail mix,\" \"power punch\" energy bars, or \"superhero juice\" boxes.\n* **Beverages**: Offer themed drinks like \"Eleven's Eggos Cereal Milk,\" \"The Upside Down Punch,\" or \"The Umbrella Academy's Superhero Soda.\"\n\n**Activities and Games:**\n\n* Host a trivia contest featuring questions about the TV shows.\n* Set up a \"mystery box\" challenge, where guests have to solve puzzles to open a box containing a prize or surprise.\n* Create a \"superhero training course\" where guests can test their skills.\n* Host a cosplay contest or encourage guests to dress up as their favorite characters.\n* Have a \"spot the Easter egg\" game, where guests have to find hidden references to the TV shows throughout the party space.\n\nRemember to have fun and get creative!
