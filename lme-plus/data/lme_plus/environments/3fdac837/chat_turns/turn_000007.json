  "content": "I'm glad you're excited about trying Korean BBQ! Taking a class is a fantastic way to learn about the cuisine and get hands-on experience with new techniques and ingredients.\n\nRegarding your first cooking class, I'd be happy to help you try to figure out when you took it. Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal calendar or memory, so I won't be able to pinpoint the exact date. However, I can ask you some questions to help jog your memory:\n\n1. Was it a weekday or weekend when you took the class?\n2. Do you remember the time of year or season when you took the class? (e.g., summer, winter, holidays)\n3. Was it a morning, afternoon, or evening class?\n4. Do you recall the location of the class? Was it at a cooking school, restaurant, or community center?\n5. Was it a one-time class or a series of classes?\n6. Do you remember any distinctive details about the class, such as the instructor, the kitchen, or any specific techniques you learned?\n\nAny information you can provide will help me try to help you narrow down the possibilities.",
