Here are some tips to keep them healthy and happy:\n\n**Snake Plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata)**\n\n* Watering: Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Overwatering is the most common cause of death in Snake Plants.\n* Humidity: Snake Plants prefer average humidity, around 40-50%. You can place the pot on a tray with pebbles and water to increase the humidity around the plant.\n* Temperature: Keep the temperature between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C).\n* Lighting: Snake Plants can thrive in low-light conditions, but they'll do better with bright, indirect light.\n\n**Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**\n\n* Watering: Water thoroughly, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry between waterings. Spider Plants prefer moist soil, but don't like to be waterlogged.\n* Humidity: Spider Plants prefer high humidity, around 50-60%. You can mist the leaves regularly to maintain humidity.\n* Temperature: Keep the temperature between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C).\n* Lighting: Spider Plants prefer bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to become scorched.\n* Propagation: Spider Plants produce baby plants (spiderettes) on the ends of their stems. You can propagate these by cutting them off and potting them up.\n\n**Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii)**\n\n* Watering: Water thoroughly, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Peace Lilies prefer moist soil, but don't like to be waterlogged.\n* Humidity: Peace Lilies prefer high humidity, around 50-60%. You can mist the leaves regularly to maintain humidity.\n* Temperature: Keep the temperature between 65\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C).\n* Lighting: Peace Lilies prefer bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to become scorched.\n* Blooming: Peace Lilies can produce beautiful white blooms. To encourage blooming, provide bright light, and fertilize regularly during the growing season (spring and summer).\n\nGeneral Tips:\n\n* Fertilization: Feed your plants with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).\n* Potting mix: Use a well-draining potting mix to prevent waterlogged soil.\n* Pruning: Prune your plants regularly to maintain their shape, promote healthy growth, and encourage blooming.\n* Pest control: Check your plants regularly for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, and scale.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a happy and healthy environment for your new plants. Enjoy watching them thrive in your living room!",
