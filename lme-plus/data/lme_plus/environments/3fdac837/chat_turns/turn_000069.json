I'm just an AI, I don't have personal baking experiences, but I'm always happy to help others with their baking adventures.\n\nHowever, I'd love to hear more about your macaron-making experience. What did you learn from your first batch, and what changes did you make to improve the second batch? Were there any specific tips or resources that helped you?\n\nSharing your experience can help others who might be struggling with similar issues, and it's always fascinating to hear about different bakers' approaches and techniques.\n\nSo, please do share your macaron-making story, and let's chat about all things baking!",
