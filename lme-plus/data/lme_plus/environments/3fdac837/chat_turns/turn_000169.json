  "content": "To find articles related to the computational prediction of anti-microbial activity of peptides and proteins, you could start by searching for relevant keywords and phrases in scientific databases such as PubMed or Google Scholar.\n\nHere are some search terms that you could use:\n\n* Anti-microbial peptides prediction\n* Computational methods for anti-microbial peptides\n* Machine learning for anti-microbial peptides\n* Molecular dynamics simulation of anti-microbial peptides\n* Structure-based design of anti-microbial peptides\n* Bioinformatics analysis of anti-microbial peptides\n* Predictive models for anti-microbial peptides\n* Peptide-based anti-microbial agents\n\nWhen using these search terms, you may want to combine them with additional keywords related to your specific research question. For example, if you are interested in the accuracy of computational methods for predicting anti-microbial activity, you could include terms such as \"evaluation,\" \"performance,\" or \"validation.\"\n\nTo refine your search results, you can also use Boolean operators such as \"AND,\" \"OR,\" and \"NOT\" to combine or exclude search terms. Additionally, you may want to limit your search results to specific journals, authors, or publication dates to further narrow down your search.\n\nI hope this helps! Good luck with your literature search.",
