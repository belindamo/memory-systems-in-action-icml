It sounds like you had a great experience in Chef Maria's class, and who can blame you for loving that Spaghetti Bolognese?\n\nUnfortunately, I'm still a large language model, I don't have the ability to access your personal calendar or memory, so I won't be able to pinpoint the exact date of the class. However, I'm happy to have helped you jog your memory and relive that fun experience!\n\nIf you want to keep track of your cooking classes and recipes, you might consider adding a \"Cooking Classes\" tab to your spreadsheet, where you can log the date, class name, instructor, and any notes or recipes from the class. That way, you'll have a record of your culinary journey and can easily reference it in the future.\n\nNow, go forth and cook up some more deliciousness, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more assistance or recipe ideas!",
