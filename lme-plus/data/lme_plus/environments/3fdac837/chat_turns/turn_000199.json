  "content": "That's a great plan! Meetup.com is a fantastic resource for finding groups of people with shared interests, and asking your coworkers is a great way to get personal recommendations. It's also a good idea to tap into your existing social network to see if anyone knows of any hiking groups or can introduce you to people who share your interests.\n\nI totally understand how you're feeling about being isolated since your best friend moved away. It's tough to lose a close connection, but it's amazing that you're taking proactive steps to meet new people and fill that void. Joining a hiking group can be a great way to meet new people who share your passion for the outdoors, and it's a low-pressure way to socialize while doing something you enjoy.\n\nRemember, it might take some time to find the right group or click with new people, but don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen right away. Keep attending events, and eventually, you'll find people who share your interests and values.\n\nIn the meantime, you can also try to stay connected with your best friend through regular video calls or online activities. Even though you're physically far apart, technology can help you stay close and maintain your friendship.\n\nHow do you think you'll feel if you meet new people who share your interest in hiking? Are you hoping to find a new hiking buddy or a group of friends to explore with?",
