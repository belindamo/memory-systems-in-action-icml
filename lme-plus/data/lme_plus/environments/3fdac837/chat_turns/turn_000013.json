Three months is a great milestone, and it's fantastic to hear that you've noticed an improvement in air quality. Orchids can be a great choice for beginners, but they do require some special care. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Choose the right type of orchid**: With over 30,000 species, orchids can be overwhelming. For beginners, look for Phalaenopsis (moth orchids) or Dendrobium, which are relatively easy to care for and forgiving.\n2. **Lighting**: Orchids generally prefer bright, indirect light. Placing them near an east- or west-facing window is ideal. Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause leaves to become scorched.\n3. **Watering**: Over-watering is the most common cause of death for orchids. Water your orchid once a week in the summer and once every 10-14 days in the winter. Make sure the pot has good drainage holes to prevent waterlogged roots.\n4. **Humidity**: Orchids thrive in humid environments (50-70% relative humidity). You can increase humidity around your plant by placing it on a tray filled with water and pebbles or using a humidifier.\n5. **Temperature**: Most orchids prefer daytime temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C), and nighttime temperatures 5-10\u00b0F (3-6\u00b0C) lower.\n6. **Fertilizing**: Feed your orchid with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) once a month. Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n7. **Potting mix**: Use a well-draining orchid potting mix that contains bark, sphagnum moss, or perlite. Avoid using regular potting soil, as it can retain too much water and cause root rot.\n8. **Repotting**: Orchids typically need to be repotted every 1-3 years as their potting mix breaks down. Choose a pot that is slightly larger than the previous one, and gently remove the plant from its pot, taking care not to damage the roots.\n9. **Pruning**: After an orchid finishes blooming, you can cut back the flower spike about an inch above the node from which it emerged. This will encourage a new bloom to grow.\n10. **Monitor and adjust**: Pay attention to your orchid's leaves, stems, and flowers. If you notice any signs of disease, pests, or nutrient deficiencies, research and adjust your care routine accordingly.\n\nSome additional tips for indoor plants in general:\n\n* Rotate your plants regularly to ensure even growth and prevent leaning.\n* Dust can accumulate on leaves, so gently wipe them with a damp cloth from time to time.\n* Keep an eye out for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, and scale.\n\nYou're off to a great start, and with these tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming an orchid expert!",
