They have a \"Flexi\" option, which allows you to change your plans or skip certain activities if you want to explore something else.\n2. **G Adventures**: G Adventures has a \"Independent Style\" travel option, which provides a mix of guided activities and free time. They also offer a \"Spontaneous\" travel style, which allows you to change your plans on the fly.\n3. **Contiki**: Contiki has a \"Free Time\" policy, which gives you the flexibility to opt out of certain activities or explore on your own. They also offer a \"Flexi\" option on some trips, allowing you to change your plans or skip certain activities.\n4. **Busabout**: Busabout offers a hop-on hop-off bus network in Europe, which allows you to create your own itinerary and change your plans as you go.

You can also contact them directly to ask about their flexibility policies and how they accommodate changes in plans.\n\nRemember, even with flexible tour operators, it's essential to research and understand their policies, cancellation fees, and any restrictions before booking.\n\nNow, imagine having the freedom to explore Europe on your own terms, with the ability to change your plans as you please.
