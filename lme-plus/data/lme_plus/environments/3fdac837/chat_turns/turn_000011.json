I'm just here to provide information and assist with questions to the best of my abilities.\n\nBut I must say, I'm impressed by your detective skills! If you're trying to figure out the date of your own first cooking class, I hope you're able to recall the correct date. If you need any more help or have any other questions, feel free to ask!",
