Do you have a recipe I could follow, and do I need any special ingredients or equipment? Also, by the way, I've been keeping track of all the recipes I've tried and cooking classes I've attended in a spreadsheet - it's become my go-to resource for meal planning. Speaking of cooking classes, do you think I could find a class that focuses on Korean BBQ? I've been wanting to learn more about working with ingredients like tofu and tempeh."

      "content": "I'm thrilled you're excited about the Fried Zucchini Flowers! They're a delightful Italian treat that's perfect for summer. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Fried Zucchini Flowers (Fiori di Zucchina Fritti) Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 12-15 zucchini flowers (male flowers work best, as they have a longer stem and are less bitter)\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1 cup whole milk\n* Vegetable oil for frying\n* Mozzarella cheese, sliced (optional)\n* Anchovies, chopped (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the filling: In a bowl, mix together Parmesan, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper.\n2. Prepare the zucchini flowers: Gently rinse the flowers and remove the stamens. Pat them dry with paper towels.\n3. Fill the flowers: Stuff each flower with about 1-2 teaspoons of the filling, depending on their size.\n4. Prepare the batter: In a separate bowl, whisk together flour and milk until smooth. The batter should still be slightly lumpy.\n5. Fry the flowers: Heat about 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Dip each stuffed flower into the batter, making sure it's fully coated, then gently place it in the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.\n6. Serve: Serve the fried zucchini flowers hot, garnished with additional parsley and a dollop of whipped ricotta or a slice of mozzarella cheese, if desired. Anchovies can be added on top for a salty kick.\n\nSpecial equipment needed:\n\n* Deep frying pan or a deep fryer\n* Thermometer (optional, but recommended to ensure the oil reaches 350\u00b0F/175\u00b0C)\n\nTips:\n\n* Use fresh and dry zucchini flowers for the best results.\n* Don't overfill the flowers, as the filling can make them burst during frying.\n* If you want to get fancy, you can add a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top of the fried flowers for a sweet and savory contrast.\n\nNow, about your spreadsheet \u2013 that's an amazing way to keep track of your cooking journey! I'm sure it's a valuable resource for meal planning and reflecting on your progress.\n\nRegarding Korean BBQ classes, you should be able to find one in your area or online. Korean cuisine is incredibly diverse and delicious, and working with ingredients like tofu and tempeh can be very rewarding. Look for classes that focus on Korean BBQ, fermentation, or vegan/vegetarian Korean cooking. Some popular Korean dishes you might want to explore include:\n\n* Bulgogi (marinated beef)\n* Japchae (stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables)\n* Bibimbap (mixed rice bowl with vegetables and meat or tofu)\n* Kimchi (spicy fermented Korean cabbage)\n* Tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes in a sweet and savory sauce)\n\nYou can search for cooking classes in your area through online platforms like Cookpad, Sur La Table, or local cooking schools. Many online cooking platforms, such as Masterclass or Udemy, also offer Korean cooking classes.\n\nBuon appetito, and I hope you enjoy your Korean culinary adventure!"
