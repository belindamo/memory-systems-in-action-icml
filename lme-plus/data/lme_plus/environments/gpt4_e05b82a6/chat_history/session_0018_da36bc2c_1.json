Here are some quick and easy ways to add protein to your leftovers:\n\n**1. Add a Protein Source You Already Have:**\nIf you have leftover chicken, turkey, beef, or tofu from your Sunday meal prep, simply slice or chop it up and toss it with the quinoa and veggies.\n\n**2. Canned Goods:**\nAdd canned black beans, chickpeas, or cannellini beans for a plant-based protein boost. Drain and rinse the beans, then toss with the quinoa and veggies.\n\n**3. Eggs:**\nScramble an egg or two and mix it with the quinoa and veggies. The protein and healthy fats from the eggs will complement the complex carbs and fiber from the quinoa and veggies.\n\n**4. Greek Yogurt or Cottage Cheese:**\nAdd a dollop of Greek yogurt or cottage cheese on top of your quinoa and veggies. This will not only add protein but also a tangy flavor and creamy texture.\n\n**5. Nuts or Seeds:**\nSprinkle some chopped nuts like almonds, cashews, or pistachios on top of your quinoa and veggies. You can also try adding chia seeds, hemp seeds, or pumpkin seeds for added protein and crunch.\n\n**6. Tofu or Tempeh:**\nIf you have some extra tofu or tempeh in your fridge, crumble it into small pieces and saut\u00e9 it with some spices and herbs. Then, mix it with your quinoa and veggies.\n\n**7. Protein Powder:**\nIf you're in a hurry and don't have any other protein sources available, you can mix some protein powder with water or Greek yogurt and add it to your quinoa and veggies. Look for an unflavored or lightly flavored protein powder to avoid altering the taste of your meal.\n\nChoose one or combine a few of these options to add protein to your quinoa and roasted veggies. Enjoy your satisfying and nutritious meal!"

      "content": "Tofu is an excellent protein source that can be incredibly versatile and delicious when prepared correctly. Marinating and baking tofu is a great way to add flavor and texture, and I'm happy to share some tips to get you started!\n\n**Marinating Tofu:**\n\n1. **Press the tofu:** Remove excess moisture from the tofu by wrapping it in a clean dishcloth or paper towels and pressing it between two plates. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes to an hour.\n2. **Choose a marinade:** Select a marinade that complements the flavors you want to achieve. Some popular options include:\n\t* Soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for an Asian-inspired flavor\n\t* Olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs like thyme and rosemary for a Mediterranean twist\n\t* Indian-inspired flavors like cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper\n3. **Marinate the tofu:** Place the pressed tofu in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Make sure the tofu is coated evenly, then cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight (up to 24 hours).\n\n**Baking Tofu:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven:** Set your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. **Line a baking sheet:** Place a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat on a baking sheet to prevent the tofu from sticking.\n3. **Arrange the tofu:** Remove the tofu from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off. Place the tofu on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.\n4. **Bake the tofu:** Bake the tofu for 20-25 minutes, flipping it halfway through. You can also broil the tofu for an additional 2-3 minutes to get a crispy exterior.\n5. **Serve and enjoy:** Once the tofu is baked, let it cool slightly before slicing and serving. You can use it in salads, wraps, bowls, or as a protein-rich snack.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Extra crispy tofu:** Try baking the tofu at a higher temperature (425\u00b0F/220\u00b0C) for a crisper exterior. Keep an eye on it to prevent burning.\n* **Glazing:** Brush the tofu with a glaze made from soy sauce, maple syrup, and rice vinegar during the last 10 minutes of baking for a sweet and savory flavor.\n* **Spicy kick:** Add some heat to your tofu by sprinkling cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes on top before baking.\n* **Get creative with seasonings:** Experiment with different herbs, spices, and seasonings to give your tofu a unique flavor profile.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating delicious, protein-rich tofu dishes that will become a staple in your meal prep routine!"
