Voice actors use a range of techniques, such as adjusting their tone, pitch, and accent, to create distinct characters. Some voice actors also use physical movements, facial expressions, or even props to help them get into character. Switching back and forth between characters can be challenging, but many voice actors have developed the ability to quickly transition between characters to keep the scenes flowing smoothly. It's an unique talent that requires practice, patience, and creativity."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, voice actors do sometimes get recognized in public for their work, particularly if they have a distinctive or well-known voice. However, because voice acting is typically done behind the scenes, voice actors tend to have a lower public profile than onscreen actors. Many voice actors enjoy interacting with fans and attending conventions or other events where they can meet people who appreciate their work. However, they also value their privacy, and not all voice actors are comfortable with being recognized or approached in public. Ultimately, each voice actor has their own preferences about how they like to engage with their fan base."
