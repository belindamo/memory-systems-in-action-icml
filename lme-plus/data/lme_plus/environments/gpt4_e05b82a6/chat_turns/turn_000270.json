OLED panels offer better contrast, wider viewing angles, and faster response times, but are generally more expensive. QLED panels, on the other hand, offer improved color accuracy and brightness.\n2. **HDR Support**: High Dynamic Range (HDR) technology enhances picture quality by offering better contrast, color, and brightness. There are different types of HDR, including HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma). Look for a TV that supports multiple HDR formats.\n3. **Smart TV Platform**: The smart TV platform determines the user interface, app selection, and overall streaming experience. Popular options include Android TV, Tizen (Samsung), webOS (LG), and Roku TV. Consider which streaming services you use most and choose a TV with a platform that supports them.\n4. **Refresh Rate**: A higher refresh rate, such as 120Hz or 240Hz, provides a smoother viewing experience, especially for fast-paced content like sports and action movies.\n5. **Color Gamut**: A wider color gamut means the TV can display more vivid and accurate colors. Look for a TV that supports a wide color gamut, such as DCI-P3 or Rec. 2020.\n6. **Connectivity**: Ensure the TV has enough HDMI ports to connect all your devices, such as a Blu-ray player, gaming console, and soundbar. Also, consider USB ports, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi connectivity.\n7. **Sound Quality**: If you don't plan to use a separate sound system, look for a TV with good built-in speakers or consider a model with advanced audio features like Dolby Atmos or DTS:X.\n8. **Gaming Features**: If you're a gamer, look for a TV with low input lag, high refresh rates, and support for AMD's FreeSync or NVIDIA's G-Sync technology.\n9. **Voice Control**: Many modern TVs come with voice control capabilities, either through a remote or built-in assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.\n10. **Budget and Size**: Determine your budget and the ideal screen size for your room. Keep in mind that larger screens often require more expensive TVs.\n11. **Brand and Warranty**: Research different brands, their customer support, and warranty options. Some brands offer better warranties or more comprehensive customer support than others.\n12. **Reviews and Ratings**: Read reviews from multiple sources, such as CNET, Rtings, or Wirecutter, to get a sense of the TV's performance, pros, and cons.\n\nWhen shopping for a 4K smart TV, consider your specific needs and prioritize the features that matter most to you. Happy shopping!",
