  "content": "I'd be happy to help you find a replacement lens cap for your old kit lens.\n\nTo get started, could you please provide me with some details about your kit lens? Here are a few questions to help me narrow down the search:\n\n1. What is the make and model of your camera and kit lens?\n2. What is the diameter of the lens (usually measured in millimeters, e.g., 52mm, 58mm, 67mm, etc.)?\n3. Do you know the type of lens mount your camera uses (e.g., Canon EF, Nikon F, Sony E, etc.)?\n4. Do you have a preference for a specific material or design for the lens cap (e.g., plastic, metal, snap-on, center-pinch, etc.)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some options for a replacement lens cap that fits your kit lens.",
