Create an account, and you can add movies to your watchlist, rate and review them, and even follow friends to see what they're watching.\n2. **IMDb Watchlist:** If you're already using IMDb, you can create a watchlist and add movies to it. You can also prioritize them, add notes, and mark them as watched.\n3. **Spreadsheet or Google Sheets:** Create a spreadsheet with columns for movie title, genre, release year, and any other relevant details. You can also use filters and sorting to organize your list.\n4. **Note-taking app:** Use a note-taking app like Evernote, OneNote, or Simplenote to keep a list of movies you want to watch.
