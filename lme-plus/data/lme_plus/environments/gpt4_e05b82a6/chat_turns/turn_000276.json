  "content": "That helps narrow it down a bit! Doorbuster deals are often on popular models, and Samsung and LG are both well-known brands that offer a range of TVs.\n\nGiven the price point and the fact that it was a doorbuster deal, it's likely that your TV is a budget-friendly or mid-range model from one of these brands.\n\nHere are a few possibilities:\n\n* Samsung: Samsung's budget-friendly 4K smart TVs from 2020 or 2021 might fit the bill. Models like the UN55TU8000 or UN55TU7000 could be possibilities. These TVs offer decent picture quality, smart TV features, and 4K resolution, but might not have all the bells and whistles of higher-end models.\n* LG: LG's budget-friendly 4K smart TVs, such as the 55UM7300 or 55UM730A, could also be contenders. These TVs offer similar features to Samsung's budget options, including 4K resolution, smart TV capabilities, and decent picture quality.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just educated guesses, and without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact model.\n\nIf you're curious about your TV's specifications, you can try checking the user manual or the manufacturer's website for more information. You can also look for a model number on the TV itself, usually found on the back or bottom of the set.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with!",
