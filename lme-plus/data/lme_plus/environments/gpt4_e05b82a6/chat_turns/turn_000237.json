  "content": "Yes, I believe that virtual reality technology will become more widely adopted in the future, particularly in medical education. With the benefits of this technology, such as increased engagement, cost-effectiveness, and improved outcomes, it is only a matter of time before other medical schools and institutions start incorporating virtual reality into their curriculum. \n\nAdditionally, as the technology continues to develop and improve, it will become more accessible and easier to use, making it even more attractive for medical schools. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of virtual reality for remote learning and simulations has increased, making it a more practical option than traditional in-person training. \n\nOverall, the potential of virtual reality technology in the medical field is immense, and I expect to see significant progress and adoption of this technology in medical education in the coming years.",
