I'm happy to help you with information on Disneyland's Halloween events.\n\nEvery year, Disneyland Resort in California celebrates Halloween Time, which typically runs from mid-September to November 1st. During this time, the park is transformed with spooky decorations, themed attractions, and special events.\n\nMickey's Halloween Party is a separate-ticket event that takes place on select nights, usually from mid-September to October 31st. The party offers exclusive experiences, such as:\n\n1. Trick-or-treating at designated locations throughout the park.\n2. Special Halloween-themed fireworks and projections on the castle.\n3. Character meet-and-greets in costume.\n4. Exclusive entertainment, like the \"Frightfully Fun Parade\" and \"Mickey's Trick & Treat\" stage show.\n5. Access to Haunted Mansion Holiday and Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy, which are transformed with Halloween-themed overlays.\n\nAs for this year's events, Disneyland has not officially announced the dates and details for Mickey's Halloween Party.
