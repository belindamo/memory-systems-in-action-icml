That's a great accomplishment, and it's wonderful that you're seeing the positive impact it's having on your space.\n\nNow, let's dive into maximizing your closet storage and keeping it tidy. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your closet space:\n\n1. **Purge and categorize**: Since you've already started decluttering, you're off to a great start. Continue to sort items into categories (e.g., tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, accessories). This will help you see what you have and make decisions about what to keep, donate, or discard.\n2. **Use a closet organizer system**: Invest in a closet organizer system that includes shelves, rods, and bins. This will help you make the most of your closet's vertical space and keep items off the floor. You can find pre-made systems or DIY your own using shelves and storage bins.\n3. **Double-hang rods**: Installing double-hang rods can double your hanging space, allowing you to store more items without overcrowding the closet.\n4. **Utilize shelves**: Shelves are perfect for storing folded items like sweaters, jeans, and blankets. Consider using stackable shelves or ones with built-in bins to keep items organized.\n5. **Store out-of-season items**: Consider storing out-of-season clothing in bins or containers and keeping them on high shelves or underbed storage. This will free up space in your main closet area.\n6. **Implement a \"one in, one out\" policy**: To maintain your newly organized closet, adopt a policy where you get rid of an old item every time you bring a new one into your closet.\n7. **Use baskets and bins**: Baskets and bins can help keep items like accessories, scarves, and hats organized and out of sight. Label each bin so you can easily find what you need.\n8. **Hang clothes by type**: Organize your clothes by type (e.g., all dresses together, all tops together). This makes it easier to find what you need and prevents a jumbled mess.\n9. **Keep shoes in order**: Store your shoes in a designated area, such as on a shoe rack or in a shoe organizer. This keeps them organized and prevents them from getting scattered throughout the closet.\n10. **Maintain your space**: Set aside time each week to maintain your closet's organization. Go through your clothes and make sure everything is still organized and tidy.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* Consider a closet divider to separate different sections of your closet.\n* Use hooks for belts, hats, and bags to keep them organized and easy to access.\n* Store items you use frequently in easy-to-reach areas, and less frequently used items towards the back or on higher shelves.\n* Keep a donation bin in your closet to encourage yourself to regularly purge items that no longer fit or suit your style.\n\nRemember, the key to maintaining a tidy closet is to create a system that works for you and your lifestyle. Experiment with different layouts and storage solutions until you find what works best for you. Good luck, and enjoy your newly organized closet!",
