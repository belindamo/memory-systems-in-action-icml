  "content": "I think I'll start with the modified HIIT intervals and see how my body adapts. I'm also going to focus on progressive overload and increase the weight or reps as I get stronger. By the way, I've been doing three sets of 10 push-ups with a 30-second break in between sets every morning, and I'm planning to increase the number of reps soon. Do you think I should also incorporate different types of push-ups, like diamond push-ups or decline push-ups, to target different muscle groups?",
