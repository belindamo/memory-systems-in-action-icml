  "content": "Many Inuit people still maintain some of these traditional ways of life today, while others have adopted more modern lifestyles. In many parts of the Arctic, hunting, fishing, and gathering remain an important part of the economy and cultural identity. However, some Inuit have adopted new technologies and ways of making a living, such as working in the oil and gas industry or in tourism. Despite changes in the way of life, many Inuit continue to practice their traditional activities, and efforts are being made to preserve their language, culture, and way of life for future generations.",
