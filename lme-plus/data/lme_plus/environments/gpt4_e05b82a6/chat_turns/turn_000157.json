This will help you avoid overspending and make more thoughtful purchases.\n2. **Track your spending:** Continue to keep a mental or written record of your online purchases, including the date, retailer, product, and price. This will help you identify patterns and areas for improvement.\n3. **Ask yourself questions:** Before making a purchase, ask:\n\t* Do I really need this item?\n\t* Will it add value to my life?\n\t* Can I afford it?\n\t* Is there a cheaper alternative?\n\t* Can I wait 24 hours before buying it? (This can help you avoid impulse purchases)\n4. **Implement the 30-day rule:** When you see something you want to buy, wait 30 days before making the purchase. This can help you determine if the item is something you truly need or if the desire was just an impulsive want.\n5. **Use cashback apps strategically:** Instead of using cashback apps as an excuse to buy more, use them to earn rewards on purchases you were already planning to make. This way, you'll still earn rewards without overspending.\n6. **Avoid temptation:** Unsubscribe from promotional emails and avoid browsing online stores when you're bored or feeling emotional. This can help you avoid impulse purchases and reduce the temptation to overspend.\n7. **Practice mindfulness:** Be more mindful of your emotions and thoughts when shopping online. Recognize when you're shopping out of boredom, anxiety, or stress, and take a step back to reassess your motivations.\n8. **Set shopping goals:** Identify specific shopping goals, such as saving for a big purchase or reducing your overall spending. This can help you stay focused and motivated to make intentional purchasing decisions.\n9. **Use technology to your advantage:** Consider using website blockers or browser extensions like Freedom, SelfControl, or StayFocusd to limit your access to online shopping sites during certain times of the day or for a set period.\n10. **Review and adjust:** Regularly review your online shopping history and spending habits to identify areas for improvement. Adjust your strategies as needed to stay on track and make more intentional purchasing decisions.\n\nRemember, developing healthy shopping habits takes time and practice. Be patient, stay consistent, and celebrate your small victories along the way!\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these strategies? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you or anything you'd like to add?",
