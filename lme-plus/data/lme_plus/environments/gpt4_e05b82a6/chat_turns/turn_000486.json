We can use a table format to keep everything organized and easy to read.\n\nHere's a suggested template to get us started:\n\n**Loyalty Program Tracker**\n\n| **Program Name** | **Current Balance** | **Rewards Earned** | **Rewards Redeemed** | **Expiration Date** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\nLet's add your Fetch Rewards program to the list with the redeemed reward:\n\n| **Program Name** | **Current Balance** | **Rewards Earned** | **Rewards Redeemed** | **Expiration Date** |\n| Fetch Rewards | ? | ? | 1,000 points = $10 Target gift card | N/A |\n\nPlease fill in the following information:\n\n1. Current Balance: How many points or rewards do you currently have in your Fetch Rewards account?\n2. Rewards Earned: Are there any other rewards you've earned but haven't redeemed yet?\n\nNow, let's add other loyalty programs you're a part of. For each program, please provide the following information:\n\n1. Program Name\n2. Current Balance (points, miles, or rewards)\n3. Rewards Earned (if any)\n4. Rewards Redeemed (if any)\n5. Expiration Date (if applicable)\n\nYou can add each program as a new row in the table. For example:\n\n| **Program Name** | **Current Balance** | **Rewards Earned** | **Rewards Redeemed** | **Expiration Date** |\n| Fetch Rewards | ? | ? | 1,000 points = $10 Target gift card | N/A |\n| Program 2 | ? | ? | ? | ? |\n| Program 3 | ? | ? | ? | ? |\n\nFeel free to add as many rows as you need for each loyalty program you're a part of. I'll help you keep track of them!",
