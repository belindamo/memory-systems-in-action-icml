Avoid direct sunlight, as it can cause the liqueur to degrade over time.\n2. **Away from heat sources:** Keep the liqueur away from heat sources like ovens, radiators, or heaters, as heat can cause the flavors to mellow or become unbalanced.\n3. **Upright storage:** Store the liqueur upright, rather than on its side. This helps prevent the cork or cap from coming into contact with the liqueur, which can cause oxidation and affect the flavor.\n4. **Tight seal:** Make sure the cap or cork is tightly sealed after each use to prevent air from entering the bottle and spoiling the liqueur.\n5. **Room temperature:** Store the liqueur at room temperature (around 68\u00b0F to 72\u00b0F or 20\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C). Avoid refrigerating the liqueur, as the cold temperature can cause the flavors to become muted.\n6. **Avoid strong-smelling areas:** Store the liqueur away from strong-smelling areas, like near cleaning supplies or spices, as the liqueur can absorb odors from its surroundings.\n\n**Shelf life:**\n\nElderflower liqueur typically has a long shelf life, but it's best consumed within 2 to 3 years of opening. If stored properly, it can last for up to 5 years. After opening, you may notice a slight change in color or flavor over time, but the liqueur should remain safe to consume.\n\n**Signs of spoilage:**\n\nCheck your elderflower liqueur regularly for signs of spoilage, such as:\n\n* Off flavors or aromas\n* Sediment or particles at the bottom of the bottle\n* Cloudiness or discoloration\n* Mold or yeast growth\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, it's best to err on the side of caution and discard the liqueur.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you'll be able to enjoy your St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur (and any other elderflower liqueur) for a long time, and it will remain fresh and flavorful.",
