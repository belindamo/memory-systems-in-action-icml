A project charter is a critical document that outlines the project's objectives, scope, stakeholders, and overall approach. Reviewing it during the kick-off meeting ensures that everyone is aligned and has a shared understanding of the project's goals and constraints.\n\nHere's an updated schedule with the project charter review added and some minor timing adjustments:\n\n**Updated Meeting Schedule:**\n\n**Time**: 2 hours (e.g., 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM)\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n**Part 1: Introduction and Project Overview (25 minutes)**\n\n* Welcome and introductions (5 minutes)\n* Review of project charter (10 minutes)\n* Project objectives, scope, and goals (5 minutes)\n* Review of project scope and goals (5 minutes)\n\n**Part 2: Roles and Responsibilities (20 minutes)**\n\n* Review of team roles and responsibilities (10 minutes)\n* Expectations and dependencies (5 minutes)\n* Q&A and clarifications (5 minutes)\n\n**Part 3: Timeline and Milestones (20 minutes)**\n\n* Review of project timeline and key milestones (10 minutes)\n* Discussion of critical path activities and dependencies (5 minutes)\n* Review of project phases and stages (5 minutes)\n\n**Part 4: Sprint Planning (35 minutes)**\n\n* Introduction to sprint planning and Agile principles (5 minutes)\n* Review of sprint goals and objectives (10 minutes)\n* Task assignment and estimation (15 minutes)\n* Q&A and finalization of sprint plan (5 minutes)\n\n**Part 5: Wrap-up and Next Steps (10 minutes)**\n\n* Review of action items and decisions (5 minutes)\n* Next steps and expectations (3 minutes)\n* Final Q&A and closing remarks (2 minutes)\n\nI've added 10 minutes to the project overview section to accommodate the review of the project charter. I've also shaved off 5 minutes from the sprint planning section to keep the meeting within the 2-hour time frame.\n\nHow does this updated schedule look to you? Are there any other adjustments you'd like to make?",
