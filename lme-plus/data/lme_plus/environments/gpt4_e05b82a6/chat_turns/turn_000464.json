It's a state-of-the-art habitat that provides a naturalistic environment for the zoo's Sumatran tigers.\n\nThe Tiger Trail exhibit is designed to mimic the tigers' native habitat in the forests of Sumatra, with lush vegetation, water features, and plenty of space for the tigers to roam. The exhibit also features large viewing areas, including a tunnel that allows visitors to get up close and personal with the tigers.\n\nOne of the most impressive features of the exhibit is the use of technology to enhance the visitor experience. The zoo has installed cameras and sensors that allow visitors to track the tigers' movements and behavior in real-time, providing a more immersive and educational experience.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo is also using the Tiger Trail exhibit as an opportunity to raise awareness about the critically endangered Sumatran tiger and the threats they face in the wild. The zoo is involved in conservation efforts to protect the species and its habitat, and the exhibit provides a platform to educate visitors about the importance of conservation.\n\nOverall, the Tiger Trail exhibit is a must-see attraction at the San Diego Zoo, and I'm sure you'll be impressed by the zoo's commitment to providing a world-class habitat for these magnificent animals.",
