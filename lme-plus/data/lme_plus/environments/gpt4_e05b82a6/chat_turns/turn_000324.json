  "content": "Billie Eilish is a great choice! She's an incredible performer, and seeing her in a more intimate setting would be an amazing experience.\n\nAs for her touring schedule, Billie Eilish is currently on her \"Happier Than Ever\" tour, which is scheduled to run until September 2022. She's got a bunch of dates lined up in North America, Europe, and Australia.\n\nYou can check her official website or social media accounts for the most up-to-date tour schedule and ticket information. I recommend keeping an eye on her website, as she often announces new dates or special shows.\n\nIf you're looking for a more intimate setting, you might want to keep an eye out for any special one-off shows or festival appearances she might announce. Sometimes, these types of shows can be a great way to see an artist in a smaller venue or with a more unique setup.\n\nAdditionally, you can also sign up for her email newsletter or follow her on social media to get notified about any new tour dates or special announcements.\n\nFingers crossed you'll be able to catch her on tour again soon!",
