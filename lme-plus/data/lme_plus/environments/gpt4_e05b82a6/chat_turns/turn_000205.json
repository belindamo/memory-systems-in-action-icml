Marinating and baking tofu is a great way to add flavor and texture, and I'm happy to share some tips to get you started!\n\n**Marinating Tofu:**\n\n1. **Press the tofu:** Remove excess moisture from the tofu by wrapping it in a clean dishcloth or paper towels and pressing it between two plates. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes to an hour.\n2. **Choose a marinade:** Select a marinade that complements the flavors you want to achieve. Some popular options include:\n\t* Soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for an Asian-inspired flavor\n\t* Olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs like thyme and rosemary for a Mediterranean twist\n\t* Indian-inspired flavors like cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper\n3. **Marinate the tofu:** Place the pressed tofu in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Make sure the tofu is coated evenly, then cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight (up to 24 hours).\n\n**Baking Tofu:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven:** Set your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. **Line a baking sheet:** Place a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat on a baking sheet to prevent the tofu from sticking.\n3. **Arrange the tofu:** Remove the tofu from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off. Place the tofu on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.\n4. **Bake the tofu:** Bake the tofu for 20-25 minutes, flipping it halfway through. You can also broil the tofu for an additional 2-3 minutes to get a crispy exterior.\n5. **Serve and enjoy:** Once the tofu is baked, let it cool slightly before slicing and serving. You can use it in salads, wraps, bowls, or as a protein-rich snack.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Extra crispy tofu:** Try baking the tofu at a higher temperature (425\u00b0F/220\u00b0C) for a crisper exterior. Keep an eye on it to prevent burning.\n* **Glazing:** Brush the tofu with a glaze made from soy sauce, maple syrup, and rice vinegar during the last 10 minutes of baking for a sweet and savory flavor.\n* **Spicy kick:** Add some heat to your tofu by sprinkling cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes on top before baking.\n* **Get creative with seasonings:** Experiment with different herbs, spices, and seasonings to give your tofu a unique flavor profile.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating delicious, protein-rich tofu dishes that will become a staple in your meal prep routine!",
