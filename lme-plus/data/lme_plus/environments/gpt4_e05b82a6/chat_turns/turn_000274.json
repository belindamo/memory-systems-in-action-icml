  "content": "That's okay! Best Buy offers a wide range of TVs from various brands, so it's a bit tricky to pinpoint the exact model without more information. However, I can try to help you narrow down the possibilities.\n\nBased on your description, it's likely that your TV is a mid-range or budget-friendly option from a brand like TCL, Vizio, or Insignia. These brands are known for offering affordable 4K smart TVs with decent picture quality.\n\nIf you can recall any other details about your TV, such as:\n\n* The brand name or logo on the TV\n* The design or style of the TV (e.g., slim, curved, etc.)\n* Any specific features you remember (e.g., HDR, smart TV platform, etc.)\n* When you purchased it (was it during a specific sale or promotion?)\n\nI might be able to help you identify the model or at least give you a better idea of what to expect from your TV.\n\nFeel free to share any additional details you can remember, and I'll do my best to help you out!",
