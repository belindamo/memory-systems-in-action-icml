The theming and attention to detail are supposed to be top-notch, and the scareactors are reportedly doing an amazing job of bringing the Upside Down to life.\n\nAnd yes, the \"Walking Dead\" scare zone is notorious for being one of the most intense areas of the event. The walkers are always a highlight of HHN, and this year's iteration is supposed to be particularly terrifying. Be prepared for a horde of walkers to swarm you as you make your way through the scare zone!\n\nMake sure to plan your night strategically, though. With the crowds and long lines, it's essential to prioritize the mazes and attractions you want to experience the most. Consider using the Universal Studios Hollywood app to reserve a virtual spot in line for some of the more popular mazes, and take advantage of the event's crowd calendar to hit up some of the less busy areas during peak hours.\n\nAlso, don't forget to take breaks and recharge throughout the night. HHN can be overwhelming, especially with the intense scares and crowds. Grab some food, catch a show, or take a breather in the designated \"safe zones\" to regroup and refuel for the rest of the night.\n\nHave an amazing time at HHN with your friends, and I hope you all survive the night!",
