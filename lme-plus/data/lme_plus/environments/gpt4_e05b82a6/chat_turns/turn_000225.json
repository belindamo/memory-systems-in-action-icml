  "content": "Halloween Horror Nights (HHN) at Universal Studios Hollywood is a completely different beast compared to Knott's Spooky Farm. HHN is a separately ticketed event that takes place on select nights in September and October, and it's designed for a more mature audience (16+ recommended).\n\nHHN is a highly immersive and terrifying experience that transforms the Universal Studios Hollywood park into a horror fan's playground. The event features:\n\n1. **Mazes**: Highly themed and detailed walk-through attractions based on popular horror franchises, original concepts, and terrifying myths. These mazes are designed to scare and disorient you, with state-of-the-art special effects, atmospheric sound design, and live scareactors.\n2. **Scare Zones**: Designated areas throughout the park where scareactors roam free, creating an unsettling atmosphere and jump scares.\n3. **Live Shows**: Special events and performances, such as the Terror Tram, which takes you on a terrifying journey through the Universal backlot.\n\nSome of the highlights of this year's event include mazes based on popular franchises like The Walking Dead, Stranger Things, and Ghostbusters, as well as original concepts like \"The Curse of Pandora's Box\" and \"Creepshow.\"\n\nIf you're planning to meet up with your friends at HHN, be prepared for:\n\n* Large crowds and long lines, especially on weekends and near the event's closing dates\n* A more intense, horror-focused atmosphere, with plenty of jump scares and terrifying moments\n* A separately ticketed event, which means you'll need to purchase a ticket specifically for HHN (note that regular Universal Studios Hollywood admission does not grant access to HHN)\n\nIf you're a horror fan or enjoy a good scare, HHN is an excellent event to experience. Just be sure to plan ahead, arrive early, and be prepared for a thrilling and terrifying night!\n\nWill you be attending HHN with your friends, or just meeting up with them after the event?",
