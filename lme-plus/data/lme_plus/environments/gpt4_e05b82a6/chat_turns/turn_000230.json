  "content": "I actually won an award for \"Best Adult Costume\" at the Mickey's Halloween Party event at Disneyland on September 24th, and I was thinking of incorporating some of those elements into my HHN costume. Do you think that's a good idea?\nassistant: Congratulations on winning the award! That's awesome! Incorporating elements from your winning costume into your HHN costume is a great idea. Since you won for \"Best Adult Costume\" at a Disney event, I'm guessing your costume was probably more family-friendly and whimsical. To adapt it for HHN, you could add some darker, edgier elements to give it a more horror-themed twist. Consider adding some fake blood, torn or distressed fabrics, or prosthetics to give your costume a more sinister look. This will help your costume fit in with the HHN atmosphere while still showcasing your creative skills. What was your winning costume, by the way?",
