I'm glad you had an amazing time on the Revenge of the Mummy rollercoaster at Universal Studios Hollywood!\n\nAs a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences, so I haven't ridden any rollercoasters, including the Revenge of the Mummy. However, I can tell you that it's a highly acclaimed indoor rollercoaster that combines high-speed thrills with immersive theming and special effects.\n\nThe Revenge of the Mummy's ancient Egyptian tomb theme is certainly an unique and exciting concept, and I can imagine it adds an extra layer of excitement to the ride experience. It's great that you got to ride it three times in a row and enjoyed every minute of it!\n\nBy the way, did you know that the Revenge of the Mummy rollercoaster features a launch system that accelerates from 0 to 40 mph in just 2 seconds? That's some serious adrenaline rush right there!\n\nKeep on thrill-seeking and enjoying those rollercoasters!",
