Here are some tips to help you find deals without getting too tempted:\n\n1. **Specific shopping lists:** Before searching for deals, make a list of specific items you need to purchase. Stick to your list and avoid browsing through entire websites or stores.\n2. **Deal-focused websites and apps:** Use websites and apps that aggregate deals, like Slickdeals, RetailMeNot, or Coupons.com, to find discounts on specific products or categories. This way, you're not exposed to a wide range of tempting products.\n3. **Filter and sort:** When browsing deal sites or online stores, use filters and sorting options to narrow down your search to specific brands, prices, or categories. This helps you focus on what you need and avoid distractions.\n4. **Price comparison tools:** Utilize price comparison tools like CamelCamelCamel, Keepa, or PriceZombie to track price history and find the best deals on specific products. This helps you make informed purchasing decisions without getting caught up in impulse buys.\n5. **Deal alerts:** Set up deal alerts for specific products or categories on platforms like Amazon, eBay, or Google Express. This way, you'll receive notifications when the item you need goes on sale, reducing the temptation to browse and impulse buy.\n6. **Discount codes and cashback:** Focus on finding discount codes, cashback offers, or rewards on products you already need, rather than browsing for random deals. This way, you're saving money on intended purchases rather than buying unnecessary items.\n7. **Avoid browsing during peak shopping seasons:** Try to avoid browsing online stores during peak shopping seasons like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or holiday sales. The constant stream of deals and promotions can be overwhelming and tempting.\n8. **Use the 10-minute rule:** When you find a deal, wait 10 minutes before making the purchase. This brief delay can help you reassess whether the item is truly necessary and if you're making an impulsive decision.\n9. **Remove temptations:** Consider removing shopping apps or bookmarks from your phone or browser to reduce the temptation to browse and impulse buy.\n10. **Mindful shopping mindset:** Remember that finding deals is not about scoring the most discounts or buying the most items. Focus on making intentional purchasing decisions that align with your needs and budget.\n\nBy following these tips, you can find deals and discounts without getting caught up in the temptation to overspend. Stay focused, and happy deal-hunting!",
