  "content": "That sounds like an amazing experience! Interacting with dolphins up close can be a truly unforgettable experience. SeaWorld San Diego's Summer Nights event sounds like a great way to enjoy the park in a unique way. It's wonderful that you've had such a great experience with animal encounters in the past.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo's animal encounters are also a great way to get up close and personal with the animals. They offer various interactive experiences, such as the Animal Encounters program, which allows you to interact with animals like koalas, giraffes, and rhinos. They also have a variety of animal feedings and demonstrations throughout the day, which can be a great way to learn more about the animals and their habitats.\n\nIf you're interested in interacting with animals, I would definitely recommend checking out the San Diego Zoo's website to see what types of experiences are available during your visit. They often have special events and activities, like the Nighttime Zoo, that can enhance your overall experience.\n\nIt's great that you're excited to visit the San Diego Zoo! With its beautiful gardens, diverse animal collection, and interactive experiences, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time.",
