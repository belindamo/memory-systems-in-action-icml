  "content": "Quinoa and roasted veggies make for a nutritious and filling base, and adding protein will help keep you satisfied until your next meal. Here are some quick and easy ways to add protein to your leftovers:\n\n**1. Add a Protein Source You Already Have:**\nIf you have leftover chicken, turkey, beef, or tofu from your Sunday meal prep, simply slice or chop it up and toss it with the quinoa and veggies.\n\n**2. Canned Goods:**\nAdd canned black beans, chickpeas, or cannellini beans for a plant-based protein boost. Drain and rinse the beans, then toss with the quinoa and veggies.\n\n**3. Eggs:**\nScramble an egg or two and mix it with the quinoa and veggies. The protein and healthy fats from the eggs will complement the complex carbs and fiber from the quinoa and veggies.\n\n**4. Greek Yogurt or Cottage Cheese:**\nAdd a dollop of Greek yogurt or cottage cheese on top of your quinoa and veggies. This will not only add protein but also a tangy flavor and creamy texture.\n\n**5. Nuts or Seeds:**\nSprinkle some chopped nuts like almonds, cashews, or pistachios on top of your quinoa and veggies. You can also try adding chia seeds, hemp seeds, or pumpkin seeds for added protein and crunch.\n\n**6. Tofu or Tempeh:**\nIf you have some extra tofu or tempeh in your fridge, crumble it into small pieces and saut\u00e9 it with some spices and herbs. Then, mix it with your quinoa and veggies.\n\n**7. Protein Powder:**\nIf you're in a hurry and don't have any other protein sources available, you can mix some protein powder with water or Greek yogurt and add it to your quinoa and veggies. Look for an unflavored or lightly flavored protein powder to avoid altering the taste of your meal.\n\nChoose one or combine a few of these options to add protein to your quinoa and roasted veggies. Enjoy your satisfying and nutritious meal!",
