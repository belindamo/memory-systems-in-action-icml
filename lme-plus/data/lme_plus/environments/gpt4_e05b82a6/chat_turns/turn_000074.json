  "content": "The knight of infinite resignation is a concept introduced by Kierkegaard to describe a person who has given up on their deepest desires and dreams and accepted that they will never be fulfilled. This person may still live a noble life, but they do so without hope or expectation of a better future. They are resigned to their fate and accept it as the will of God or the universe. The knight of infinite resignation is often contrasted with the knight of faith, who takes a leap of faith and believes that their deepest desires can still be fulfilled, even if there is no rational reason to believe this.",
