  "content": "I'm trying to lose 10 pounds in the next two months, so I guess my goal is to improve my overall fitness. I'd say my current fitness level is intermediate - I've been going to the gym regularly for three weeks now. My weightlifting routine is pretty standard, focusing on upper body on Mondays, yoga on Wednesdays, and legs on Fridays. I can dedicate three days a week to working out, and I prefer morning sessions. I don't have any injuries or physical limitations. As for my diet, I've been trying to eat more protein-rich foods like chicken, fish, and eggs to support my muscle growth.",
