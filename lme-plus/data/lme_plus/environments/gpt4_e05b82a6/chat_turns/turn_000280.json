  "content": "When choosing a soundbar to complement your 4K smart TV, consider the following features to ensure a great viewing experience:\n\n1. **4K Passthrough**: Look for a soundbar with 4K passthrough capability, which allows it to pass 4K resolution from your TV to your soundbar without downscaling. This ensures you get the best possible picture quality.\n2. **HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel)**: HDMI ARC allows the soundbar to receive audio signals from your TV, eliminating the need for a separate audio cable. This feature is essential for a streamlined setup and easy control.\n3. **Dolby Atmos and DTS:X Support**: If your 4K smart TV supports Dolby Atmos or DTS:X, look for a soundbar that can decode these audio formats. This will enhance your immersive viewing experience with 3D audio.\n4. **HDR Support**: Some soundbars can pass HDR (High Dynamic Range) signals from your TV, ensuring you get the best possible picture quality.\n5. **Wireless Connectivity**: Consider a soundbar with wireless connectivity options like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or proprietary wireless technology (e.g., Sonos' Wi-Fi) for easy music streaming and connectivity to your TV.\n6. **Multi-HDMI Inputs**: If you have multiple devices connected to your TV (e.g., Blu-ray player, gaming console, streaming devices), look for a soundbar with multiple HDMI inputs to connect them directly.\n7. **Voice Enhancement**: If you struggle to hear dialogue, look for a soundbar with voice enhancement features, which can amplify and clarify dialogue.\n8. **Compact Design**: Consider a soundbar that's designed to fit neatly under your TV or on a shelf, ensuring a sleek and compact setup.\n9. **Smart Features**: If you want to control your soundbar with your TV's remote or use voice commands, look for soundbars with smart features like HDMI-CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) or integration with popular voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.\n10. **Brand Compatibility**: If you have a specific TV brand, check if the soundbar is compatible with that brand's features and technologies (e.g., Samsung's HW-Q90R soundbar is optimized for Samsung QLED TVs).\n\nBy considering these features, you'll find a soundbar that complements your 4K smart TV and enhances your overall viewing experience.",
