However, the comfort level of traditional baggy clothing often depends on factors such as the climate, the materials used to make the garment, and the wearer's personal preferences. For instance, a lightweight cotton or silk boubou might be comfortable to wear in hot weather, while a thicker wool djellaba might be better suited to colder climates. Similarly, some people might find loose-fitting pants like harem pants or salwar to be more comfortable than a long, flowing robe like the kimono or boubou. Ultimately, it's up to the individual to decide which traditional baggy clothing they find most comfortable to wear.",
