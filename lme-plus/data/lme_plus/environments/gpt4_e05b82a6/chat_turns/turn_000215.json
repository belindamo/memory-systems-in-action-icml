For instance, the popularity of the kimono has inspired designers to create modern, stripped-down versions of the garment that can be worn as dresses or jackets. Similarly, the comfortable fit of harem pants has inspired designers to create new styles, such as drop-crotch pants, that offer a relaxed, baggy fit. In addition, some designers are creating new clothing that blends elements of traditional baggy clothing with modern fashion aesthetics, such as streetwear or haute couture.
