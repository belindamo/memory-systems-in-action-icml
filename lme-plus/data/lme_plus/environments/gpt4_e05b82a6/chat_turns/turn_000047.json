Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan with butter and line it with parchment paper.\n2. Melt the butter and sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.\n3. Remove from heat and stir in the peanut butter until smooth. Let cool slightly.\n4. Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.\n5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Add to the peanut butter mixture and stir until just combined.\n6. Stir in the chocolate chips.\n7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.\n8. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.\n9. Let cool completely in the pan before cutting into bat wing shapes.\n\n**Bat Wing Shape:**\n\nTo achieve the bat wing shape, you'll need a cookie cutter or a knife. Here's how:\n\n1. Once the brownies are completely cool, use a bat-shaped cookie cutter to cut out the brownies. You can find bat-shaped cookie cutters online or in party supply stores.\n2. If you don't have a bat-shaped cookie cutter, you can use a knife to cut out the brownies. Cut the brownies into rectangles, then use a knife to cut out a curved shape on one side of each rectangle, creating the bat wing shape.\n3. Use a small amount of chocolate ganache or melted chocolate to attach a chocolate chip or a chopped peanut to the top of each brownie, creating the \"eye\" of the bat.\n\nTips:\n\n* To make the brownies more fudgy, bake for 23-25 minutes. For a chewier texture, bake for 25-27 minutes.\n* If you want a more intense peanut butter flavor, use natural peanut butter or add a teaspoon of peanut butter extract to the batter.\n* You can also add chopped peanuts or peanut butter chips to the batter for extra texture and flavor.\n\nNow, go forth and create your Bat Wing Brownies!",
