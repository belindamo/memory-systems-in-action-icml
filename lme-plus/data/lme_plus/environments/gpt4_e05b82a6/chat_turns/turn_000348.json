  "content": "Handling franchise movies can be a bit tricky, but there are a few approaches you can take:\n\n**Option 1: Franchise Section**\n\nCreate a separate section or shelf dedicated to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies, including all the Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and other related films. This approach is great if you have a large collection of franchise movies and want to showcase them together. You can still organize them alphabetically within the franchise section.\n\n**Option 2: Genre + Franchise Sub-Section**\n\nKeep the MCU movies within their respective genres (e.g., Action/Adventure, Science Fiction), but create a sub-section or divider within that genre for the franchise. For example, in the Action/Adventure section, you could have a sub-section titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\" that includes all the MCU movies. This approach helps maintain the overall genre organization while still grouping related franchise movies together.\n\n**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**\n\nUse a combination of both options above. Create a separate franchise section for the MCU movies, but also include them in their respective genres. This way, you can find the movies in both places, depending on how you're browsing your collection.\n\n**Digital Copies: Franchise Playlists**\n\nFor your digital copies, you can create playlists or folders specifically for franchises like the MCU. This way, you can easily access all the related movies in one place, regardless of their genre.\n\nChoose the approach that works best for you and your collection. If you're still unsure, you can experiment with a hybrid approach and see how it feels.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to create a system that makes sense to you and is easy to maintain. Happy organizing!",
