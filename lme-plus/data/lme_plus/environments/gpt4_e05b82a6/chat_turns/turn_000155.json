However, I can suggest a few ways to help you keep track of your online shopping history:\n\n1. **Browser Extensions:** You can use browser extensions like **camelcamelcamel** or **Keepa** that track price history and alert you to price drops on products you're interested in. They might not give you a comprehensive view of your online shopping history, but they can help you keep tabs on specific products.\n2. **Cashback Apps:** Many cashback apps, like Rakuten, Ebates, or TopCashback, provide a dashboard or account history that shows your past purchases and earnings. You can use this data to get an idea of your online shopping habits.\n3. **Bank or Credit Card Statements:** You can review your bank or credit card statements to see a record of your online purchases. This might not give you a detailed view of individual products, but it'll show you the frequency and total amount spent online.\n4. **Spreadsheets:** You can create a spreadsheet to manually track your online purchases. Set up columns for date, retailer, product, price, and any other relevant details. This will require some effort, but it'll give you a customizable and detailed view of your online shopping history.\n5. **Digital Receipts:** Some retailers, like Amazon, offer digital receipts that can be accessed through your account dashboard. You can use these receipts to track your purchases and create a rough estimate of your online shopping history.\n6. **Shopping Apps:** Some shopping apps, like **ShopSavvy** or **ScanLife**, allow you to track your purchases and create a shopping history. These apps are primarily designed for in-store shopping, but they might also work for online purchases.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, or combine a few to get a more comprehensive view of your online shopping habits.\n\nRemember to always review your privacy settings and terms of service for any apps or extensions you use to track your online shopping history.",
