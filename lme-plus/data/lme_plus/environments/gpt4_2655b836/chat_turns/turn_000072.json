I'm a text-based AI assistant and don't have the ability to know your location or the specific development you're referring to.\n\nBut I can offer some suggestions on how you can find the information you're looking for:\n\n1. **Check online real estate websites**: Websites like Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com often have information about neighborhoods, including demographics, crime rates, schools, and amenities.\n2. **Contact the developer or real estate agent**: Reach out to the developer or real estate agent who showed you the development and ask them for more information about the neighborhood. They may be able to provide you with a packet of information or direct you to resources.\n3. **Check with local government websites**: Visit the website of the city or county where the development is located to find information about the area, including zoning laws, transportation options, and community resources.\n4. **Drive around the neighborhood**: Take a drive around the neighborhood to get a feel for the area. Look for local amenities like parks, schools, grocery stores, and restaurants.\n5. **Talk to locals**: Strike up a conversation with people who live or work in the area to get their perspective on the neighborhood.\n6. **Check social media and online forums**: Look for social media groups or online forums where people discuss the neighborhood and ask questions.\n\nRemember to do your due diligence and research the neighborhood thoroughly before making a decision. Good luck in your home search!",
