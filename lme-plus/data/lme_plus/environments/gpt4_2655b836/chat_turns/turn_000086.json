  "content": "The conflicts and controversies within the Anglican Church have led to division and fragmentation. In some cases, entire provinces have broken away from the wider Anglican communion due to disagreements over fundamental beliefs and practices.\n\nFor example, The Episcopal Church in the United States of America (TEC) has faced backlash from some Anglican provinces for their decision to ordain openly gay clergy and to perform same-sex marriages. This led to some African Anglican provinces to form their own breakaway churches or alliances.\n\nThe conflicts have also caused the church to re-evaluate its power structure and decision-making processes. Some have called for a more centralized authority, while others have emphasized the importance of preserving the autonomy of individual provinces.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Anglican Church remains a global institution with a diverse group of followers. The Anglican Communion continues to seek ways to address these conflicts while promoting unity and inclusivity.",
