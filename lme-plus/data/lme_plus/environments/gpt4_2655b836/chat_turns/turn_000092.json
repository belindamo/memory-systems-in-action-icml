  "content": "Yes, there are some religious institutions that have embraced progressive values more fully or are actively working to do so. These institutions are often referred to as \"progressive religions\" or \"progressive faith communities\".\n\nFor example, some Unitarian Universalist churches have been at the forefront of progressive movements for LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights, and racial justice. The Unitarian Universalist Association has long been known for its commitment to social justice, and many of their principles are explicitly inclusive of all people regardless of race, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\n\nThe Metropolitical Community Church is another example of a progressive Christian church that explicitly welcomes LGBTQ+ individuals and promotes social justice issues. Similarly, the Reformed Judaism movement has been at the forefront of promoting LGBTQ+ rights and acceptance, with many synagogues openly welcoming LGBTQ+ members.\n\nOverall, these progressive faith communities tend to prioritize inclusivity, social justice, and activism, and are often more attuned to changing cultural norms than more traditional religious institutions. However, it's important to note that not all progressive faith communities embrace the same values or beliefs, and there is a wide range of diversity within these communities.",
