  "content": "I'm going to create a few macrame plant hangers to complement my upcycled home decor items at the Artisan's Fair. I'll make sure to use sturdy knots and hooks to attach the planters, and I'll choose planters that are proportional to the size of the macrame hanger and the plant. I think ceramic or terracotta planters will work well with my macrame hangers, and I'll make sure to add a stabilizer to prevent the planter from swinging or tilting. Thanks for the tips!",
