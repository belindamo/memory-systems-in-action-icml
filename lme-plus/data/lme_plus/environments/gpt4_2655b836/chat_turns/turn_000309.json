  "content": "Pairing a healthy side with your pizza can help balance out the meal and add some extra nutrients. Here are some healthy side options you can consider:\n\n**Salads:**\n\n1. **Garden Salad**: A classic choice, a garden salad with mixed greens, veggies, and a light vinaigrette dressing is a refreshing and healthy option.\n2. **Wedge Salad**: A wedge salad with crisp lettuce, cherry tomatoes, and a light blue cheese dressing is a satisfying side that pairs well with pizza.\n3. **Greek Salad**: A Greek salad with mixed greens, feta cheese, olives, and a drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice is a flavorful and nutritious option.\n\n**Other Healthy Sides:**\n\n1. **Veggie Sticks**: A side of carrot, celery, and cucumber sticks with hummus or a low-fat ranch dressing makes for a crunchy and healthy snack.\n2. **Baked Wings**: If you're craving something a bit more indulgent, baked wings can be a healthier alternative to fried wings. Just be mindful of the sauce and seasonings.\n3. **Garlic Knots (in moderation)**: While not the healthiest option, garlic knots can be a tasty side in moderation. Look for whole wheat or multigrain options and be mindful of the portion size.\n\n**Tips for Customizing Your Salad:**\n\n1. **Go easy on the dressing**: Opt for a light vinaigrette or ask for the dressing on the side to control the amount used.\n2. **Add protein**: Throw some grilled chicken, turkey, or tofu on top of your salad for an extra boost of protein.\n3. **Load up on veggies**: Add extra veggies like bell peppers, cucumbers, and cherry tomatoes to increase the nutrient density of your salad.\n\nWhen ordering, you can say something like:\n\n\"I'd like to order a Veggie Lovers' Pizza with a whole wheat crust, extra mushrooms, extra onions, and a lighter layer of part-skim mozzarella cheese. Can I also get a side of the Garden Salad with a light vinaigrette dressing, and can you add some grilled chicken on top?\"\n\nBy pairing a healthy side with your pizza, you'll be able to enjoy a more balanced meal that satisfies your cravings while keeping your nutritional goals in mind.",
