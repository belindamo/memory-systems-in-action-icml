In your case, since you've already been earning points through Shell's rewards program, it's definitely worth considering filling up at Shell stations along the way to maximize your rewards.\n\nHere are some pros and cons to help you decide:\n\n**Pros of filling up at Shell stations:**\n\n1. **Maximize rewards**: By continuing to fill up at Shell stations, you'll earn more points and get closer to redeeming rewards, such as discounts on fuel, merchandise, or even cashback.\n2. **Consistency**: You're already familiar with Shell's rewards program, so it's easy to stick with what you know and continue earning points.\n3. **Convenience**: Shell has a large network of stations, so you're likely to find one near your route.\n\n**Cons of filling up at Shell stations:**\n\n1. **Potential higher prices**: Shell prices might be higher than those at other stations, which could offset the benefits of earning rewards.\n2. **Limited flexibility**: If you're only looking for Shell stations, you might miss out on cheaper options or more convenient locations.\n\n**Alternatives to consider:**\n\n1. **Gas price comparison apps**: Use apps like GasBuddy, Waze, or Google Maps to find the cheapest gas prices along your route. This way, you can compare prices and make informed decisions.\n2. **Other loyalty programs**: If you find a station with a better price, consider joining their loyalty program. You might earn rewards or discounts that outweigh the benefits of sticking with Shell.\n3. **Discount stations**: Look for stations that offer discounts for cash payments, military personnel, or other groups. These can be a great way to save money, even if you're not earning rewards.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on your priorities. If you value the rewards and convenience of Shell's program, it might be worth sticking with them. However, if you're looking to save money on gas prices, exploring other options could be a better choice.\n\nYou could also consider a hybrid approach:\n\n* Fill up at Shell stations when they're convenient and the prices are competitive.\n* Use gas price comparison apps to find cheaper options when Shell prices are high.\n* Take advantage of other loyalty programs or discounts when available.\n\nBy being flexible and aware of your options, you can make the most of your road trip and your rewards program.",
