Please provide me with the recipe and the gram measurements, and I'll do my best to convert them to cups for you.\n\nKeep in mind that it's generally recommended to use a digital kitchen scale to measure ingredients by weight (in grams) when baking, as it's a more accurate method than measuring by volume (in cups). However, I understand that not everyone has a scale, and cup measurements can be a good approximation.\n\nPlease go ahead and share the recipe, and I'll get started on the conversions!",
