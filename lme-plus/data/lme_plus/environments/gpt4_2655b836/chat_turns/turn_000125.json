  "content": "Fuel efficiency is a great concern, especially on long road trips. I'm happy to help you optimize your Honda Civic's fuel efficiency on the highway.\n\nThe Honda Civic is known for its excellent fuel economy, and with some simple tips, you can maximize its fuel efficiency on the highway. Here are some tips to help you get the best mileage:\n\n1. **Maintain a consistent speed**: Try to maintain a steady speed, as frequent acceleration and braking can lower your fuel efficiency. Use cruise control on the highway to help you maintain a constant speed.\n2. **Drive at moderate speeds**: The ideal speed for fuel efficiency varies, but generally, it's between 60-70 mph. Avoid speeding, as it can decrease your fuel efficiency significantly.\n3. **Use the correct gear**: Make sure you're in the correct gear for the speed you're driving. Shifting into higher gears at lower speeds can help improve fuel efficiency.\n4. **Avoid idling**: If you're going to be stopped for more than 30 seconds, turn off your engine. Idling can waste a significant amount of fuel.\n5. **Use air conditioning wisely**: While using the air conditioning can be comfortable on hot days, it can decrease your fuel efficiency. Try rolling down your windows at lower speeds to get some fresh air and reduce AC usage.\n6. **Check your tire pressure**: Properly inflated tires can improve your fuel efficiency. Underinflated tires can increase rolling resistance, which can decrease fuel efficiency.\n7. **Remove extra weight**: The more weight your car is carrying, the more fuel it'll consume. Remove any unnecessary items from your trunk or back seat to improve fuel efficiency.\n8. **Use fuel-efficient driving modes**: Many modern cars, including the Honda Civic, come with fuel-efficient driving modes. Enable this mode to optimize your car's engine performance, transmission, and other systems for better fuel efficiency.\n9. **Monitor your fuel efficiency**: Keep an eye on your fuel efficiency using your car's trip computer or a fuel log app. This will help you identify areas for improvement and develop good driving habits.\n10. **Regular maintenance**: Regular tune-ups, oil changes, and filter replacements can help maintain your car's fuel efficiency.\n\nAs for your specific question, the Honda Civic's fuel efficiency on the highway varies depending on the trim level and transmission type. However, according to the EPA, the 2022 Honda Civic sedan with a CVT transmission gets an estimated:\n\n* 32 mpg city\n* 42 mpg highway\n* 36 mpg combined\n\nBased on these estimates, you can expect to get around 38-40 mpg on the highway, assuming you're driving moderately and following the tips above. However, this can vary depending on your specific driving habits, road conditions, and weather.\n\nRemember, every little bit helps, and by following these tips, you can optimize your Honda Civic's fuel efficiency and enjoy a more cost-effective road trip to Yellowstone!",
