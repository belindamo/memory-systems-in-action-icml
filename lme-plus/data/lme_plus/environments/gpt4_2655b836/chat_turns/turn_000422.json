They're indeed known for their excellent service.\n\nNow, about using your Emirates miles to book a Turkish Airlines flight with a layover in Istanbul... **it's possible, but with some restrictions**.\n\nAs a Skywards member, you can redeem your miles for Turkish Airlines flights, but there are some rules to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Route restrictions**: Emirates has a limited number of routes available for redemption on Turkish Airlines. You can check the Emirates website or contact their customer service to see if your desired route is available.\n2. **Layover restrictions**: Emirates allows layovers on Turkish Airlines, but there might be limitations on the duration of the layover. Typically, layovers are allowed for up to 24 hours, but this can vary depending on the route and fare rules.\n3. **Award availability**: As I mentioned earlier, award availability can be scarce, especially during peak travel seasons. You might need to be flexible with your travel dates or consider alternative routes.\n4. **Redemption rates**: Emirates uses a dynamic award chart, which means the number of miles required for a redemption can vary depending on the route, travel dates, and availability. You can expect to pay more miles for peak season travel or popular routes.\n5. **Fees and surcharges**: Be aware that Turkish Airlines might charge additional fees for things like seat selection, baggage, or meals, even if you're redeeming miles.\n\nTo book a Turkish Airlines flight with a layover in Istanbul using your Emirates miles, follow these steps:\n\n1.
