After a few moments of silence, he began to speak. \"I never knew my dad like that,\" he said. \"I never knew he had to go through all of that.\"\n\nMark remained quiet, listening to his friend's words.\n\n\"I always thought of him as this strong, confident guy,\" Tommy continued. \"But he was just a kid, like us. He had to deal with all of the same crap we do.\"\n\nMark nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, it's crazy to think about,\" he said. \"But at least now we have a better understanding of where we come from.\"\n\nTommy sat up, looking at Mark. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"But what does it all mean? What do we do with this knowledge?\"\n\nMark shrugged. \"I don't know,\" he admitted. \"But I do know that it's important. Maybe we can use what we learned to make things better in the future.\"\n\nTommy nodded, deep in thought. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Maybe we can. But for now, I just need some time to process all of this.\"\n\nMark patted Tommy on the back. \"Take all the time you need,\" he said. \"We'll figure it out together.\"\n\nThe two boys sat in silence for a few more moments, lost in their own thoughts. Finally, Tommy stood up. \"We should probably figure out how to get back to the present,\" he said.\n\nMark nodded. \"Yeah, let's do it,\" he said, getting to his feet as well.\n\nTommy remembered the watch he had been wearing throughout their time in the past. \"Wait,\" he said, holding up his wrist. \"I think this is the key.\"\n\nMark looked at him, confused. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I think this watch is what brought us here,\" Tommy explained. \"And I think it can take us back too.\"\n\nMark's eyes widened. \"That's crazy,\" he said.\n\nTommy shrugged. \"It's the only thing we've got,\" he said. \"Let's see if it works.\"\n\nThe two boys held the watch between them, staring at it intently. Suddenly, there was a bright flash of light, and they were transported back to their own time.\n\nThey looked at each other, both of them grinning from ear to ear. \"We did it,\" Mark said.\n\nTommy nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"We did.\"",
