  "content": "There are several challenges that are preventing Lesotho from achieving better literacy rates. These include:\n\n1. Poverty: Poverty is a significant challenge in Lesotho, particularly in rural areas, and affects access to education. Families living in poverty may lack the resources to send children to school, and some children may work instead of attending school.\n\n2. Limited resources: The government of Lesotho faces limited resources to invest in education due to the country's small economy. This has led to a lack of investment in infrastructure, materials, and teacher training.\n\n3. Teacher shortages: Lesotho has a shortage of trained teachers, particularly in rural areas, which affects the quality of education that children receive.\n\n4. High dropout rates: While free primary education has increased enrolment rates, the country still has high dropout rates, particularly among girls. Social and cultural factors, such as early marriage and poverty, contribute to these high dropout rates.\n\n5. Limited access to quality education: Quality education is lacking in many parts of Lesotho, particularly in rural areas. This is due to insufficient infrastructure, low teacher morale, and limited resources.\n\n6. Limited access to technology and resources: While the government of Lesotho has made efforts to provide access to technology and resources, many students still lack access to these resources that can aid in learning.\n\nAddressing these challenges will require sustained investment in education, particularly in rural areas, the training and recruiting of quality teachers, and the provision of resources and technology to support student learning. Additionally, improving access to basic needs such as healthcare, water, and electricity could also contribute to improving literacy rates in Lesotho.",
