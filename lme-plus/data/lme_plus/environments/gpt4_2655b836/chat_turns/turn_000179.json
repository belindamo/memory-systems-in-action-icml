Use relevant hashtags and tag the location or business.\n2. **Instagram Story with \"swipe-up\" link**: Share a photo or video in your Story, and add a \"swipe-up\" link to a blog post, website, or review about your recommended spot. This way, interested followers can easily access more information.\n3. **Reels**: Create a short, engaging video (up to 60 seconds) showcasing your recommendation. You can add music, text overlays, and other effects to make it visually appealing.\n4. **IGTV**: If you have more to share, create a longer-form video (up to 60 minutes) about your recommendation.
