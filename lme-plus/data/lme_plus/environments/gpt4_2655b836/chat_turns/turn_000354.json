Maybe it was just some kind of hallucination or something.\"\n\nMark shook his head. \"No way, dude,\" he said. \"That was too real. And we saw Davey, remember? There's no way we could have made that up.\"\n\nTommy nodded. \"Yeah, I know,\" he said. \"But it's still weird. And we don't want to tell anyone what happened, right?\"\n\nMark nodded. \"Definitely not,\" he said. \"No one would believe us anyway.\"\n\nTommy smiled. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"It's our little secret.\"\n\nThey both laughed, then settled back down on the floor. For a few moments, they were silent, lost in thought. Then Tommy spoke up again.\n\n\"I never realized how hard it was for my dad,\" he said, his voice soft. \"I mean, I knew he had a tough childhood, but I never really understood. And now I do. It's like I can see him in a whole new light.\"\n\nMark nodded. \"I know what you mean,\" he said. \"It's like we got to know him as a kid. And he's not just our friend's dad anymore. He's a real person with real feelings and real struggles.\"\n\nTommy smiled. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Exactly. And I'm going to be a better son to him from now on. I'm going to try to understand him better, and really listen when he talks to me.\"\n\nMark grinned. \"That's awesome, man,\" he said. \"I'm proud of you.\"\n\nTommy shrugged. \"It's the least I can do,\" he said. \"He's always been there for me, even when I was being a brat. And now I know how hard that must have been for him.\"\n\nThey fell silent again, lost in thought. Then Mark spoke up.\n\n\"So, what do we do now?\" he asked. \"I mean, we can't just pretend like nothing happened.\"\n\nTommy nodded. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I know. We have to figure out how to get back to the present. But how?\"\n\nMark shrugged. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Maybe the watch has some kind of time travel function. Maybe if we press a certain button or something, it'll take us back.\"\n\nTommy's eyes widened. \"The watch!\" he said. \"I completely forgot about it. You're a genius, man.\"\n\nMark grinned. \"I try,\" he said.\n\nTommy quickly pulled the watch off his wrist and examined it closely. It was an old analog watch, with a metal band and a simple face. But there was something different about it. Something he couldn't quite put his finger on.\n\n\"Look at this,\" he said, pointing to a small button on the side of the watch. \"I've never seen that before.\"\n\nMark leaned in for a closer look. \"Yeah, me neither,\" he said. \"What do you think it does?\"\n\nTommy shrugged. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"But there's only one way to find out.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, then pressed the button.\n\nFor a moment, nothing happened. Then there was a sudden flash of light, and the room around them seemed to shift and twist. They both felt a sudden",
