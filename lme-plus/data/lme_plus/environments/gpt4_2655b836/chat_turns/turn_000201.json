  "content": "Many species of albatross have been observed eating plastic, including the Laysan albatross, Black-browed albatross, and Grey-headed albatross. The ingestion of plastic has a significant impact on their diet as it fills up their stomachs, leading to a feeling of fullness, and reduces the amount of space available for food. This results in a lack of nutrient uptake and malnutrition, which ultimately causes health problems and may lead to death. Additionally, plastic can also cause blockages in their digestive tracts, leading to starvation.",
