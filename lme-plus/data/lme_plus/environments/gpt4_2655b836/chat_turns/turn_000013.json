  "content": "Yes, many free mental health clinics now offer teletherapy options for those who can't make it in-person. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health clinics have moved to offering teletherapy as a way to provide services to those who may not be able to come in-person or prefer to receive therapy from the comfort of their own homes. It's important to check with the specific clinic to see if they offer teletherapy and what platforms they use for communication. Many clinics may use platforms such as Zoom, Skype, or video conferencing software to provide teletherapy.
