However, I can provide you with the following significant controversies/conflicts that have taken place within the Anglican Church relating to its power structure.\n\n1. The ordination of women: The Anglican Church has struggled with the issue of ordaining women as priests and bishops. While many provinces have embraced this change, others have vehemently opposed it, citing biblical and traditional reasons.\n\n2. The role of LGBTQ+ individuals: The Anglican Church has also grappled with the issue of the role of LGBTQ+ individuals in the church. Some provinces have opened up to the idea of welcoming and accepting LGBTQ+ individuals, while others have rejected it, leading to division within the church.\n\n3. The role of provincial autonomy: The Anglican Communion comprises autonomous provinces, which allow each province to govern itself. However, this decentralization of power has led to conflicts, as some provinces disagree on matters of doctrine and practice. \n\n4. The Lambeth Conference: The Lambeth Conference is a gathering of Anglican bishops from around the world. However, the conference has sometimes been a source of controversy, as some bishops have boycotted it or have boycotted parts of it due to disagreements with the power structure of the church.\n\n5. The Anglican Covenant: In 2004, a proposed Anglican Covenant aimed to establish a system of accountability and unity within the church. However, this proposal was met with controversy, as some saw it as a move towards centralization and as a threat to the autonomy of individual provinces within the Anglican Communion.",
