  "content": "I don't know the reason behind how albatross eat plastic, but i can tell you that albatrosses do not have the ability to distinguish between plastic and food. since plastic particles floating in the ocean look and smell like food, albatrosses and other marine animals may mistake them for prey and ingest them. additionally, albatrosses rely heavily on squid and fish, which often feed on plastic particles themselves. as a result, plastic can end up becoming a part of the food chain and may ultimately be consumed by albatrosses.",
