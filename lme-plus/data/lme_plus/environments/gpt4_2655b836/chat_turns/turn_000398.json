Watching it twice in one week is a great way to absorb the music, lyrics, and story, and I'm sure your family appreciated the second viewing with you.\n\nAs for new musicals and productions, there are always exciting projects in development, and I'd be happy to keep you informed! Here are a few upcoming musicals and productions that have caught my attention:\n\n1. **The Prom**: A new musical comedy by Bob Martin and Chad Beguelin, with music by Matthew Sklar.

It's a story about three friends who experiment with LSD in the 1950s and explore the boundaries of their relationships.\n5. **The Devil Wears Prada**: A new musical adaptation of the bestselling novel and film, with a book by Kate Wetherhead, music by Elton John, and lyrics by Paul Rudnick.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many more musicals in development, and I'm sure we'll see some exciting announcements in the coming months.\n\nIf you're interested in staying up-to-date on the latest musical theatre news, I recommend following reputable sources like Playbill, Broadway.com, or The New York Times' theatre section.
