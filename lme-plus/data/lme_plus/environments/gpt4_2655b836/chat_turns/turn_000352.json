Tommy spoke up first, \"I can't believe it. I never knew him like this. I never knew he had to go through all of that.\"\n\nMark nodded in agreement, \"It really puts things into perspective, doesn't it?\"\n\nTommy continued, \"All this time, I thought I was the only one. But he went through the same thing I did. It's like we're connected, even across time.\"\n\nMark smiled, \"Yeah, and it's not just about bullies. We all have struggles and insecurities, and sometimes it feels like nobody understands. But now, we know that we're not alone.\"\n\nTommy sat up, \"But what about going back? How do we figure out how long we've been gone? What time and day is it?\"\n\nMark sat up next to him, \"Good question. We need to make sure we don't raise suspicion or do anything that would mess up the timeline.\"\n\nTommy nodded in agreement, \"Right. We have to be careful. But we need to find out, so we can make sure we get back without anyone noticing.\"\n\nThey sat in silence for a moment, before Tommy spoke up again, \"I wonder if this is what my dad was trying to tell me. I always thought he was distant, but maybe he just didn't know how to express it.\"\n\nMark patted him on the back, \"Maybe. But now, we can help each other. And who knows, maybe someday we'll be able to tell him everything.\"\n\nTommy smiled, \"Yeah. Thanks, Mark. I'm glad we did this.\"\n\nMark grinned back, \"Me too, buddy. Me too.\"\n\nThey got up from the floor and began to figure out how to get back to their own time.",
