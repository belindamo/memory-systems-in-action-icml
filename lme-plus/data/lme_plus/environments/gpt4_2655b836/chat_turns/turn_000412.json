  "content": "The policy of free primary education in Lesotho has had a significant impact on access to education for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups in the country. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the net enrolment rate for primary school in Lesotho increased from 69% in 1999 to 87% in 2019, indicating an improvement in access to education.\n\nHowever, the impact of this policy on literacy rates is not as straightforward. While the introduction of free primary education has led to an increase in access to education, there are still challenges related to quality education, including insufficient infrastructure, low teacher morale, and limited teaching materials. These challenges have contributed to low literacy rates among children, particularly in rural areas.\n\nAccording to the UNDP Human Development Report, the literacy rate for adults in Lesotho was approximately 79% in 2018, which is relatively low compared to other African countries. The literacy rate for youth aged 15-24 years was estimated to be around 89%, indicating a slight improvement, but still lower than the average for middle-income countries in the region.\n\nDespite these challenges, the policy of free primary education is still seen as a positive step towards improving access to education in Lesotho. However, there is still a need for further investment in education to address the quality of education and ensure that children receive the necessary skills to become literate and productive citizens.",
