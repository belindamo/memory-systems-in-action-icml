      "content": "You can definitely modify the template to fit your schedule and workout routine. Here are some suggestions for tracking progress with a mix of gym and home workouts:\n\n**Option 1: Separate logs for gym and home workouts**\n\n* Create two separate logs: one for gym workouts and one for home workouts.\n* Use the same format for both logs, but adjust the \"Workout Type\" column to specify \"Gym\" or \"Home\".\n* This way, you can track your progress separately for each type of workout.\n\n**Option 2: Use a hybrid log with notes**\n\n* Use a single log for all workouts, with an additional \"Location\" column to specify whether the workout was done at the gym or at home.\n* Add a \"Notes\" column to include any additional details, such as the equipment used, any modifications made, or how you felt during the workout.\n* This way, you can track your overall progress and see how your workouts are varying between the gym and home.\n\n**Option 3: Focus on exercises rather than location**\n\n* Instead of separating logs by location, focus on tracking progress for individual exercises.\n* Create a log with columns for \"Exercise\", \"Sets\", \"Reps\", \"Weight/Resistance\", and \"Date\".\n* This way, you can track your progress for specific exercises, regardless of where you're doing them.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Take progress photos or measurements to track visual changes.\n* Use a mobile app or online platform to track your workouts and progress, such as MyFitnessPal, Strava, or Fitbit.\n* Set reminders or schedule workouts in your calendar to stay consistent.\n* Review your logs regularly to adjust your workouts, set new goals, and celebrate your progress!\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and that you enjoy using. Experiment with different methods until you find one that fits your lifestyle and helps you stay motivated."
