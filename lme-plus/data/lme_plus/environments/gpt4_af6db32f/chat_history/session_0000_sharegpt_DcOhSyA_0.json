Over the centuries, the library has been expanded and many more texts have been added to its collection.\n\nDuring the rule of Steward Denethor II, the library was used as a place of study for his sons Boromir and Faramir, both of whom were well-versed in the history and lore of Gondor.\n\nIn the time of war and conflict, the library was also a place of refuge for scholars and scribes, who sought to preserve knowledge and culture during the difficult times.\n\nIn the end, the library was also a place where Gandalf the White, helped Faramir to understand the true meaning of the palantir and the threat of Sauron.\n\nThe library of Minas Tirith continues to be an important cultural and historical institution in the city, and it remains a place of study and research for scholars and historians to this day."

The tree is a sapling of the tree Nimloth, which was a gift to the people of Numenor by the Elves of Tol Eressea.\n\nIn the early days of Gondor, the tree was planted in the court of the fountain in the Citadel of Minas Tirith and was highly revered by the people of Gondor, who saw it as a symbol of their connection to the ancient kingdom of Numenor.\n\nThe tree was believed to have special powers, and it was said that as long as the tree remained healthy, Gondor would flourish. But during the Stewardship of Denethor II, the tree began to wither and die, and it was seen as a sign that the kingdom of Gondor was in peril.\n\nIn the time of war, Gandalf the White, brought a sapling of the tree from the seedling that was guarded by the Dunedain of the North and planted it in Minas Tirith, signifying the re-birth of Gondor and the hope for the future.\n\nThe White Tree of Gondor continues to be a powerful symbol of the city and the kingdom of Gondor, and it is an important part of the city's history and culture. It's a symbol of the continuity and resilience of the people of Gondor."
