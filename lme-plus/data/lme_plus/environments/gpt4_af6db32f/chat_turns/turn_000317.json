  "content": "You quickly throw the candle in your hand at one of the hooded figures, hoping to distract them and buy some time. The candle hits one of the figures, momentarily blinding them and causing them to stumble backwards. You take advantage of the distraction and run out of the room, slamming the door shut behind you.\n\nHeart pounding, you look around the corridor for a door to escape through. You can hear the sound of footsteps and muffled voices coming from behind the door you just left. You don't know if the hooded figures will pursue you, so you choose a nearby door at random and burst through it.\n\nAs you enter the new room, you realize that it is a small storeroom, filled with dusty crates and barrels. You can hear the sound of footsteps echoing down the hallway, but they seem to be fading away. You take a deep breath and try to calm down, taking stock of your situation. You've narrowly escaped danger, but you're still lost and uncertain of where to go next. What will you do now?",
