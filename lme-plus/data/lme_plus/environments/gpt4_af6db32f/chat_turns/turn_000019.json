It's also where the stables are located, and it's where the cavalry of Gondor is stationed.\n\nAdditionally, on this level, you can find the forges of Minas Tirith, where the weapons and armor for the soldiers of Gondor are made and repaired. It's an impressive sight to see the blacksmiths and armorers at work, crafting the tools of war.\n\nYou can also find the Great Smithy, where the famous sword of Elendil, Narsil was reforged into Anduril by the order of the Istari and given to Aragorn son of Arathorn, who used it to defeat Sauron and reclaimed the throne of Gondor.\n\nAlso on this level, you can find the Houses of the craftsmen, where the different artisans of the city reside, and where they produce the different goods that are sold in the market square.\n\nIs there anything specific you would like to see or know about this level?",
