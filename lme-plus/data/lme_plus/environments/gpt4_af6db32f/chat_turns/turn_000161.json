  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to current or ongoing initiatives in Benin. However, I can tell you that several African countries, including Benin, are exploring the use of blockchain technology in various industries, including supply chain management. In fact, the West African nation launched its digital currency known as eCFA based on blockchain technology, and it is exploring further possibilities of using the technology in various sectors.\n\nMoreover, many international organizations such as the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have initiated blockchain projects in Africa, including Benin, to improve supply chain management and facilitate trade. For example, WFP piloted a blockchain program in Benin in collaboration with the government to help smallholder farmers sell their produce more efficiently by connecting them directly to buyers, reducing transaction costs in the supply chain process. \n\nIn conclusion, while there might not be any specific pilot programs or initiatives in Benin for the traditional industries, there are ongoing blockchain and IoT projects in the country, and more are expected as the technology continues to gain widespread adoption in Africa.",
