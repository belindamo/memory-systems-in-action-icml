Freeing up space by deleting unnecessary files and emptying the Recycle Bin is a great first step.\n\n10% free space is a good threshold to aim for, but it's generally recommended to have at least 20-30% free space on your C drive to ensure optimal performance. So, try to free up as much space as possible.\n\nSome other tips to help you free up space:\n\n* Check your Downloads folder and delete any files you no longer need.\n* Consider uninstalling any software or apps you no longer use.\n* Look for large files or folders taking up space and consider deleting or moving them to an external drive.\n* If you have a lot of photos or videos, consider moving them to an external hard drive or cloud storage service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.\n\nOnce you've freed up some space, see if your laptop's performance improves. If you're still experiencing issues, we can move on to the next troubleshooting steps.\n\nAlso, don't forget to defragment your hard drive after you've freed up space. This will help your laptop to run more efficiently.",
