  "content": "The history of the library of Minas Tirith is a long and rich one. The library was built during the rule of the Steward Ecthelion II, who reigned during the Third Age. He was a great patron of learning and culture, and he saw the need for a library in the city to preserve the knowledge and history of Gondor.\n\nThe library was built with the assistance of the order of the Istari, who helped to gather and preserve many ancient texts and scrolls. Over the centuries, the library has been expanded and many more texts have been added to its collection.\n\nDuring the rule of Steward Denethor II, the library was used as a place of study for his sons Boromir and Faramir, both of whom were well-versed in the history and lore of Gondor.\n\nIn the time of war and conflict, the library was also a place of refuge for scholars and scribes, who sought to preserve knowledge and culture during the difficult times.\n\nIn the end, the library was also a place where Gandalf the White, helped Faramir to understand the true meaning of the palantir and the threat of Sauron.\n\nThe library of Minas Tirith continues to be an important cultural and historical institution in the city, and it remains a place of study and research for scholars and historians to this day.",
