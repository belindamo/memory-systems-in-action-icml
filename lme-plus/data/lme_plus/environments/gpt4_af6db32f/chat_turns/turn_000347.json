Calf Raises**:\n\t* Stand on a flat surface or a step with your heels hanging off the edge.\n\t* Slowly raise up onto your tiptoes, then lower back down.\n\t* Aim for 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\t* variation: Single-Leg Calf Raise (stand on one leg, raise up, and lower down)\n\n**2. Seated Calf Raise**:\n\t* Sit on a calf raise machine or a chair with your legs extended in front of you.\n\t* Lift your heels as high as possible, then lower them back down.\n\t* Aim for 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**3. Calf Press**:\n\t* Stand on a leg press machine with your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform.\n\t* Press the platform away from you, extending your legs.\n\t* Focus on squeezing your calf muscles as you press.\n\t* Aim for 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**4. Donkey Calf Raise**:\n\t* Start on all fours, with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips.\n\t* Lift one heel towards your glutes, keeping your knee straight.\n\t* Lower your heel back down and repeat with the other leg.\n\t* Aim for 3 sets of 12-15 reps per leg.\n\n**5.
