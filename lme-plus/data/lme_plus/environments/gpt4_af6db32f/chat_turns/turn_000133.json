As for your question, I'm not directly affiliated with the Community Art Center, so I don't have direct access to their current class offerings. However, I can suggest a few options to help you find out more about their programs:\n\n1. **Check their website**: Visit the Community Art Center's website to see if they have a list of current or upcoming classes, workshops, or programs. You can often find this information under a \"Classes\" or \"Workshops\" tab.\n2. **Contact the center directly**: Reach out to the Community Art Center via phone or email to ask about their current or upcoming classes and workshops. They may be able to provide you with a brochure or schedule of their programs.\n3. **Visit the center in person**: Stop by the Community Art Center and ask about their programs in person. This can give you a chance to see the facilities, meet the staff, and get a sense of the types of classes they offer.\n4. **Social media**: Check the Community Art Center's social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) to see if they post about upcoming classes or workshops.\n\nSome potential classes or workshops they might offer could include:\n\n* Life drawing or figure drawing\n* Watercolor or acrylic painting\n* Sculpture or ceramics\n* Printmaking or photography\n* Mixed media or collage\n* Art history or appreciation classes\n* Children's or youth art programs\n\nRemember to ask about the level of experience required for each class, as well as any materials or supplies you might need to bring.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you continued enjoyment and growth in your artistic pursuits!",
