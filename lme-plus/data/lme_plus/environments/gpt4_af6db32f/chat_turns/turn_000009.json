  "content": "Of course, the library of Minas Tirith is a great place to visit. The library is home to many ancient texts, scrolls, and books that contain knowledge about the history of Gondor, Middle-earth and other realms. It's a place where scholars, scribes, and historians come to study and research.\n\nAs we enter the library, you will notice that it is a grand and spacious room, with high ceilings and tall windows that let in plenty of natural light. The walls are lined with shelves that are filled with books, scrolls, and other texts.\n\nThe library is also home to many ancient maps, that shows the different realms and territories of Middle-earth, as well as many other historical documents, that can give us an insight of the history of Gondor and the events that took place in Middle-earth.\n\nMany of the texts in the library are written in the ancient tongue of Sindarin and the Black speech, but there are also texts that are written in the common tongue, so anyone can read them.\n\nDo you have any specific questions or would you like to know more about a particular text or document?",
