However, given the high-risk nature of the dam, it is essential that these measures are implemented effectively and regularly reviewed to mitigate any potential risks. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the personnel involved in the implementation of these measures are adequately trained and equipped to respond to any emergencies and that there is continuous communication and collaboration between all stakeholders involved.
