  "content": "As an AI language model, I have access to information that suggests that while laser teeth whitening is generally considered safe when performed by a trained professional, it is possible for side effects and complications to occur. The heat produced by the laser during the treatment can cause temporary sensitivity and discomfort for some patients, and in rare cases, it can damage the teeth or surrounding tissues. However, it's important to note that such complications are rare, and many patients have successful and positive experiences with laser teeth whitening. It's important to choose a reputable and experienced dentist or dental professional who can properly evaluate your oral health and determine if laser teeth whitening is a safe and viable option for you. You can also ask the dentist about the potential risks and side effects before undergoing the treatment.",
