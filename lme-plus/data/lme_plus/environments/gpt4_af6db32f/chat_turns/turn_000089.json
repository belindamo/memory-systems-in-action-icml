It was such a big bash with lots of relatives, food, and music. I was tasked with creating a photo slideshow, which turned out really well. My grandma was very happy and emotional, and it was great to see her surrounded by so much love. Do you have any tips on how to organize and preserve family photos and memories, especially after big events like that?",
