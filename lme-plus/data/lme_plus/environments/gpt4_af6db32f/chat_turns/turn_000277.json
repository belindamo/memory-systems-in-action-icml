  "content": "Thank you for providing more information about your laptop and the issues you're experiencing.\n\nGiven that the performance issues started before the RAM upgrade, it's likely that the additional RAM will help, but it might not be the sole solution to the problem. Let's explore some potential causes and troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Disk Space and Fragmentation**: Low disk space and fragmentation can slow down your laptop. Check your available disk space by going to File Explorer, right-clicking on the C: drive, and selecting Properties. If your free space is below 20%, consider deleting unnecessary files, emptying the Recycle Bin, or expanding your storage. You can also defragment your hard drive using the built-in Disk Defragmenter tool in Windows 10.\n2. **Startup Programs**: Some programs might be running in the background and slowing down your startup. Press the Windows key + R, type \"msconfig,\" and press Enter. In the Startup tab, look for any unnecessary programs and disable them. You can also use the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) to see which programs are consuming resources at startup.\n3. **Resource-Intensive Programs**: As you mentioned, Adobe Photoshop is a resource-hungry application. Try closing it or other resource-intensive programs when not in use to free up resources. You can also consider upgrading to a more efficient version of Photoshop or optimizing your workflow to reduce the load on your laptop.\n4. **Windows Updates**: Ensure your Windows 10 installation is up-to-date, as updates often include performance improvements and bug fixes. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update to check for available updates.\n5. **Disk Cleanup**: Over time, temporary files and system logs can occupy a significant amount of space. Run the built-in Disk Cleanup tool to remove unnecessary files and free up disk space. To do this, go to Settings > System > Storage > This PC > Temporary files.\n6. **Malware and Viruses**: Malware can slow down your laptop. Run a full scan with your antivirus software to detect and remove any potential threats.\n7. **Driver Updates**: Outdated drivers can cause performance issues. Go to the Device Manager (Press the Windows key + X and select Device Manager), expand each category, and look for devices with a yellow exclamation mark or a red X. Right-click these devices and select Update driver to search for and install updates.\n8. **System File Checker**: Corrupted system files can cause performance issues. Run the System File Checker tool to scan and repair corrupted system files. To do this, open Command Prompt as an administrator and run the command \"sfc /scannow\".\n9. **Consider Upgrading Your Hard Drive**: If your laptop has a traditional hard drive (HD), it might be slowing down your system. Consider upgrading to a Solid-State Drive (SSD), which can significantly improve performance.\n\nPerform these troubleshooting steps and see if they improve your laptop's performance. If the issues persist, feel free to provide more details, and we can explore further solutions.",
