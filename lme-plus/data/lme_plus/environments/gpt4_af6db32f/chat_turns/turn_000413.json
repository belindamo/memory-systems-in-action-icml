  "content": "You're putting together a solid trade package!\n\nWith the added rare Pok\u00e9mon card, your trade offer is starting to look more appealing to Michael. However, it's essential to remember that a holographic Charizard from the Base Set is an extremely rare and valuable card.\n\n**Trade Breakdown:**\n\nLet's break down the trade offer:\n\n* Spider-Man action figure from the Marvel Legends collection (worth $10-$50)\n* Limited edition Funko Pop (worth $50-$500)\n* Rare Pok\u00e9mon card from your collection (worth $10-$100)\n\nThe total value of your trade offer is around $70-$650. While this is a respectable offer, it's still a bit short of the holographic Charizard's value (worth $2,000-$5,000).\n\n**Negotiation Time:**\n\nWhen you present the trade offer to Michael, be prepared to negotiate. He might be willing to consider your offer, but he might also want to add more value to the trade or ask for something else in return.\n\nHere are some potential responses from Michael:\n\n* \"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a few more rare Pok\u00e9mon cards or a higher-value collectible item.\"\n* \"I'm interested, but I need something more to sweeten the deal. Can you add another item or increase the value of the trade?\"\n* \"I'm not sure... I've had offers of $1,500 for the Charizard alone. Can you meet me halfway?\"\n\nBe open to negotiation and willing to compromise. You might need to add more value to the trade or find a middle ground that works for both of you.\n\nGood luck, and may the trade be with you!",
