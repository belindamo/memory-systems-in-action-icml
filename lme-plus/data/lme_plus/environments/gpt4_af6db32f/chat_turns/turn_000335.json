  "content": "The Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula) is a fantastic bird to spot, and with some knowledge of its distinctive features, you'll be more likely to identify it correctly.\n\nHere are some key characteristics to look for when trying to ID a Ruby-crowned Kinglet:\n\n1. **Size and shape**: Ruby-crowned Kinglets are small birds, measuring about 4-4.5 inches (10-11 cm) in length. They have a round body, a short tail, and a distinctive crest on top of their head.\n2. **Plumage**: They have a olive-green back, wings, and tail, with a grayish-white underside. The wings have two white wing bars, which are often visible when the bird is perched or in flight.\n3. **Crown and face**: The most distinctive feature of the Ruby-crowned Kinglet is the ruby-red crown patch on top of its head. However, this patch is often not visible, as it's only displayed during courtship or when the bird is excited or alarmed. When not visible, the crown appears as a grayish-white area. The face is grayish-white with a white eye ring and a dark stripe through the eye.\n4. **Behavior**: Ruby-crowned Kinglets are active birds, constantly moving and flitting between branches. They often hover in mid-air as they forage for insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates.\n5. **Song**: The Ruby-crowned Kinglet's song is a series of high-pitched, descending whistles, often described as a \"zee-zee-zee\" or \"ti-ti-ti\" sound. They also make a distinctive \"tsee\" call note.\n6. **Habitat**: Ruby-crowned Kinglets can be found in a variety of habitats, including coniferous and deciduous forests, shrublands, and backyards with trees and shrubs. They tend to prefer areas with dense vegetation.\n\nWhen trying to ID a Ruby-crowned Kinglet, look for the combination of its small size, olive-green back, grayish-white underside, and distinctive white wing bars. If you're lucky, you might catch a glimpse of the ruby-red crown patch!\n\nKeep in mind that the Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa) is a similar species, but it has a yellow crown patch instead of ruby-red. Golden-crowned Kinglets are more commonly found in coniferous forests, whereas Ruby-crowned Kinglets tend to prefer deciduous or mixed forests.\n\nI hope this helps you spot a Ruby-crowned Kinglet during your next birding adventure!",
