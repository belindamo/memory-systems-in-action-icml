Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Finishing the book before the course:**\n\nPros:\n\n* You'll have a more comprehensive understanding of the book's content and can focus on the course without feeling like you're missing context.\n* You can absorb the book's ideas and themes without the course influencing your interpretation.\n\nCons:\n\n* You might lose momentum or forget some of the book's details by the time you start the course.\n* The course might cover some material that's not in the book, or vice versa, which could lead to duplication of effort.\n\n**Doing both simultaneously:**\n\nPros:\n\n* You can reinforce your understanding of the book's concepts by seeing them presented in a different format (video lectures, discussions, etc.).\n* You'll have a more interactive and engaging learning experience, which can help keep you motivated.\n\nCons:\n\n* You might feel overwhelmed by the amount of information or struggle to keep track of both the book and the course.\n* You might find that the course spoils some of the surprises or reveals in the book, or vice versa.\n\nIf you decide to do both simultaneously, here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. Read a chapter or two of the book, then complete the corresponding module in the course.\n2. Take notes on both the book and the course, highlighting key points and questions that arise.\n3. Reflect on how the course material is enhancing or challenging your understanding of the book.\n\nBy doing so, you'll be able to:\n\n* Reinforce your understanding of the book's concepts\n* Gain new insights and perspectives from the course\n* Develop a deeper appreciation for the subject matter\n\nUltimately, the choice is yours. If you're concerned about spoilers or prefer to focus on one thing at a time, you can finish the book before starting the course. If you're comfortable with the potential overlap and want to maximize your learning, you can do both simultaneously.\n\nHow do you think you'll approach this?",
