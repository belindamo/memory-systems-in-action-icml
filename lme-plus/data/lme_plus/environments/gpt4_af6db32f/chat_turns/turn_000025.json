  "content": "It is my duty to inform you of the potential risks of \"winging it\" when it comes to hikes that require permits or advanced planning. the wave is not just a popular destination but also a delicate one, with limited access to protect the unique geological feature. only 20 permits are given out each day via an online lottery system, and hiking without one is not only illegal but can also result in hefty fines. furthermore, the hike is in the middle of the desert with no access to water, so proper preparation and precautions are necessary to ensure a safe trip. i recommend planning ahead to make the most of your experience and avoid any potential legal or safety issues.",
