Here's a step-by-step guide to help you remove the stain:\n\n1. **Act quickly**: The sooner you treat the stain, the better. Tomato sauce can permanently bind to fabric if it's allowed to sit for too long.\n2. **Blot, don't rub**: Gently blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to remove any excess sauce. Avoid rubbing the stain as it can push it deeper into the fabric.\n3. **Cold water**: Run cold water over the back of the stain to flush out as much of the sauce as possible.\n4. **Pre-treat with a stain remover**: Apply a stain remover like Shout, OxiClean, or a laundry detergent specifically designed for removing tough stains. Follow the product's instructions and make sure to test a small, inconspicuous area of the shirt first.\n5. **Hydrogen peroxide**: Apply hydrogen peroxide to the stain, let it sit for about 10-15 minutes, and then rinse with cold water. The oxidizing properties of hydrogen peroxide can help break down the tannins in the tomato sauce.\n6. **Baking soda and water**: Make a paste by mixing 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of cold water. Apply the paste to the stain and let it sit for about an hour. Then, rinse the garment with cold water and blot it dry.\n7. **Laundry detergent boosters**: If the above methods don't work, you can try using laundry detergent boosters like OxiClean or Shout Advanced Stain Remover. Follow the product's instructions and apply the product directly to the stain before washing.\n8. **Wash and repeat**: Wash the shirt in cold water using a mild laundry detergent. If the stain is still visible after the first wash, repeat the pre-treatment and washing process until the stain is removed.\n9. **Soak**: If the stain is still present after repeated washing, try soaking the shirt in cold water with a laundry detergent specifically designed for removing tough stains. Let it soak for several hours or overnight before washing again.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Avoid using hot water, as it can set the stain or damage the fabric.\n* Don't use bleach, as it can weaken or discolor certain fabrics.\n* If the stain is particularly stubborn, you can try applying a stain-removing product like Stain Devils or Goo Gone to the area before washing.\n* Consider taking the shirt to a professional cleaner if the stain is particularly tough or you're unsure about the best removal method.\n\nI hope these tips help you remove the tomato sauce stain from your favorite white shirt!",
