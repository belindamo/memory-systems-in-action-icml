However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location, so I can't recommend specific sports bars in your area.\n\nBut I can suggest a few ways to find great sports bars near you that show NFL games:\n\n1. **Google Search**: Type in \"sports bars near me\" or \"NFL bars near me\" and Google will show you the nearest options along with their addresses, phone numbers, and reviews.\n2. **Yelp**: Yelp is a great platform to find sports bars in your area. You can filter your search by rating, distance, and hours of operation.\n3. **NFL Website**: The NFL website has a \"Bar Finder\" feature that allows you to enter your zip code and find official NFL bars in your area.\n4. **Facebook**: Check Facebook for local sports bars in your area and see if they have events or posts about showing NFL games.\n5. **Ask Around**: Ask your friends, colleagues, or coworkers for recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge on the best sports bars in the area.\n\nOnce you have a list of potential sports bars, you can check their websites or call them to confirm that they'll be showing the games you're interested in. Some popular sports bar chains that usually show NFL games include:\n\n* Buffalo Wild Wings\n* Hooters\n* Dave & Buster's\n* Fox Sports Grill\n* Sports Column\n\nMake sure to check the bar's schedule and availability in advance, especially if you're planning to meet up with a large group. Have fun!",
