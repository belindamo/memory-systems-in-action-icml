Removing tough stains like coffee can be a challenge, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you out.\n\nBefore we dive into stain removal, let's talk about the importance of pre-treating the stain. The sooner you treat the stain, the better. Since the stain has had time to set, we'll need to use a combination of methods to remove it.\n\nHere are some steps to help you remove the coffee stain from your denim jacket:\n\n1. **Blot, don't rub**: Gently blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to remove any excess coffee residue. Avoid rubbing the stain as it can push it deeper into the fabric.\n2. **Pre-treat with a stain remover**: Apply a stain remover like Shout, OxiClean, or a laundry detergent specifically designed for removing tough stains. Follow the product's instructions and make sure to test a small, inconspicuous area of the jacket first.\n3. **Baking soda and water**: Make a paste by mixing 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of cold water. Apply the paste to the stain and let it sit for about an hour. Then, rinse the garment with cold water and blot it dry.\n4. **White vinegar**: Dilute white vinegar with water (1 part vinegar to 2 parts water), and apply it to the stain. Let it sit for about an hour before rinsing and blotting dry. The acid in the vinegar can help break down the tannins in the coffee.\n5. **Laundry detergent boosters**: If the above methods don't work, you can try using laundry detergent boosters like OxiClean or Shout Advanced Stain Remover. Follow the product's instructions and apply the product directly to the stain before washing.\n6. **Wash and repeat**: Wash the jacket in cold water using a mild laundry detergent. If the stain is still visible after the first wash, repeat the pre-treatment and washing process until the stain is removed.\n\nRemember to always check the care label of your denim jacket before attempting any stain removal methods, and test any new products or techniques on an inconspicuous area first.\n\nAs for your new sneakers, it's great to hear they're comfortable! Enjoy wearing them, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any tips on cleaning or maintaining them.\n\nGood luck with the stain removal, and I hope you're able to revive your trusty denim jacket!",
