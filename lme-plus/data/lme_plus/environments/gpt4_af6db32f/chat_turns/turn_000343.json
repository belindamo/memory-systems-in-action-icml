  "content": "Wonderful! Incorporating new yoga poses into your morning routine can be a great way to challenge yourself and boost your practice. Here are some intermediate-level yoga poses that target core strength:\n\n1. **Boat Pose (Paripurna Navasana)**: This pose engages your entire core, including your abs, obliques, and lower back. Sit with your legs crossed, engage your core, and balance on your seat bones. Hold for 30 seconds to start, and gradually increase as you build strength.\n2. **Side Plank (Vasisthasana)**: This pose targets the obliques and helps improve balance and stability. Start in a high plank position, then lift your right arm and left leg off the ground, stacking your feet. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch sides.\n3. **Crow Pose (Bakasana)**: This pose requires engagement of the core, arms, and legs. Squat down with your hands on the ground, then lift your feet off the ground and balance on your hands. Hold for 30 seconds to start, and gradually increase as you build strength.\n4. **Eagle Pose (Garudasana)**: This pose targets the core, hips, and legs. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, then bend your knees slightly. Cross your right knee over your left, and wrap your arms around your legs. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch sides.\n5. **Peacock Pose (Mayurasana)**: This pose engages the entire core, including the abs, obliques, and lower back. Start in a high plank position, then lift your right leg and left arm off the ground, balancing on your hands and one leg. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch sides.\n6. **Plank Jacks**: This pose targets the entire core, including the abs, obliques, and lower back. Start in a high plank position, then jump your feet between different positions (e.g., shoulder-width apart, wide apart, or together). Hold for 30 seconds to start, and gradually increase as you build strength.\n7. **Eight-Angle Pose (Astavakrasana)**: This pose targets the core, hips, and legs. Start in a high plank position, then bend your knees slightly and cross your right knee over your left. Place your right hand on the ground outside your left knee, and lift your left arm up towards the ceiling. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch sides.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Warm up before attempting these poses, and cool down afterwards to prevent injury.\n* Listen to your body and modify or come out of the pose if you experience any discomfort or pain.\n* Engage your core by drawing your navel towards your spine and maintaining a strong, steady breath.\n* Practice regularly to build strength and control in these poses.\n\nI hope these poses help you challenge your core strength and enhance your morning yoga routine!",
