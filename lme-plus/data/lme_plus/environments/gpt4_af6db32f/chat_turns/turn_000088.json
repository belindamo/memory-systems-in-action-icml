  "content": "I'm thrilled that you found the idea inspiring! Starting a tradition like taking a group photo and sharing wishes or goals can add a wonderful layer of depth and meaning to your game nights. It's a great way to create a sense of ritual and anticipation, and it will be lovely to look back on those photos and memories in the years to come.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to make the tradition your own and tailor it to your family's unique personality and style. Don't be afraid to experiment and try out different ideas until you find the one that feels just right.\n\nI'm so happy to have been a part of helping you plan your family game night, and I hope you have an absolute blast! If you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask.\n\nHappy gaming, and I wish you a wonderful time with your family!",
