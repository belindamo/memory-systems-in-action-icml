  "content": "I'm looking for some inspiration for my next art project. I recently attended the \"Women in Art\" exhibition at the Modern Art Museum and was blown away by the large-scale installations. Speaking of art, I've been getting back into painting lately - I actually participate in a painting workshop at the Community Art Center, where we create our own pieces inspired by the Impressionist era. Do you have any recommendations for art books or online resources that could help me improve my skills?",
