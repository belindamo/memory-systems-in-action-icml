However, it is reasonable to assume that the pandemic has had a significant effect on the development of young players within Liga I, just as it has for football clubs worldwide. With matches and tournaments cancelled or postponed, training sessions heavily restricted, and travel severely limited, young players have had limited opportunities to gain experience and improve their skills.\n\nIt is possible that the Liga I organization has implemented measures to support these young players during this challenging time, such as organizing virtual training sessions or providing financial assistance to clubs and players. However, the specifics of these measures and their effectiveness may vary depending on the country and circumstances.",
