  "content": "The next level of Minas Tirith is known as the fourth circle. This level is home to the Houses of the Lords of Gondor, which are the residences of the noble families of Gondor. This level is also where you can find the Hall of Feasts, which is the main banquet hall of the city, and it is used for important state occasions and ceremonies.\n\nAdditionally, on this level you can find the tombs of the Stewards of Gondor. It's an impressive underground chamber where the Stewards of Gondor are buried. It's a place of great reverence for the people of Minas Tirith and Gondor, and it's where the tombs of the Stewards of Gondor are located, including the tomb of Denethor II and his sons Faramir and Boromir.\n\nAlso on this level, there is the great fountain courtyard, that's the place where the White Tree of Gondor used to be planted before it died, and where the new sapling was planted by Gandalf.\n\nIs there anything specific you would like to see or know about this level?",
