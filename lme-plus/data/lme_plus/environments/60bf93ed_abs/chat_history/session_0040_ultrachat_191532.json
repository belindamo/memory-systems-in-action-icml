It provided much-needed medical care to patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, allowing local hospitals to focus on treating COVID-19 patients.\n\nIn addition, during the same year, the USNS Comfort was deployed to New York City to provide assistance with COVID-19 response efforts. The ship provided a wide range of medical services, including surgeries, ICU care, radiology, and lab services. It treated thousands of patients during its mission and was a critical asset in the city's response to the pandemic.\n\nBoth the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort have also been deployed to provide humanitarian assistance in other parts of the world, such as South America, Africa, and Asia. They have treated patients with a wide range of illnesses and injuries, including trauma, infectious diseases, and chronic health conditions."
