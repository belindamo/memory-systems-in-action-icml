And that you have also begun to identify the \u201cdumb\u201d things that you\u2019ve been doing to wreck your back, and that you have stopped doing them. Good. Now it is time to start the healing, and that is a matter of immobilizing your lower back or lumbar spine so it can heal, after all those years of doing things that hurt it. \nThe analogy is not perfect, but think of your tortured back as being like a broken arm or leg. When you break an arm, say, the doc puts it in a stiff cast so you can\u2019t bang it or twist it and to give it time and rest to heal. The same with your back, except we can\u2019t do anything quite as dramatic as put you in a whole-body cast for your damaged back. What we can do is show you how to carry yourself so that you effectively immobilize your lower back. It\u2019s not totally easy, but it will work. And bear in mind, if you do not immobilize your back, it will not heal\u2014simple as that. Indeed, it may get worse. \nWhat do I mean by \u201cimmobilizing\u201d your lumbar spine? I do not mean that you can\u2019t sit or walk or have a more or less normal life. What I do mean is that you have to be really serious about maintaining a neutral spine, all the time. Maintaining a neutral spine is at the heart of your cure, and will be at the heart of your life after your cure. This is the time to learn how to achieve a neutral spine and how to maintain it all the time, even when doing various movements. \nThe spine is a meticulously engineered piece of machinery, but it has a lot of redundancy built in. By this I mean that unlike the knee or shoulder, in the spine when you have a bad joint, the surrounding structures can \u201chelp\u201d bear the loads, and you can function more or less normally and without pain. Take the pressure of bad posture\u2014and dumb movement patterns\u2014off, and there is very likely enough \u201croom\u201d in this spine for the sufferer to have a normal life. For example, the \u201choles\u201d where the nerves come out of the spine (the foramina) are still big enough for the nerves to exit, pain-free, if you\u2019re not squeezing the area with lousy posture. In the same vein, there is probably still enough cushion in the flattened disc to support a correctly aligned spine (but not a bent or misshapen one). And so on. \n\u201cNeutral\u201d means the position in which the least amount of problem loads occur, all up and down the spine. The \u201cproblem loads\u201d in some pictures we\u2019ve shown are extreme, but even those inflamed joints and nerve roots will likely calm down if you leave them alone for a while. Which is to say, if you keep your spine in neutral. As bad as those injuries are (and as long as it took someone to create them) there is a strong chance that that sufferer can go about his or her life, with a neutral spine, in little or no pain. \nLearning to keep a neutral spine is not totally easy. And learning to maintain it all the time is harder. But this is the \u201ccast\u201d that lets your body heal. It is worth going to a lot of trouble to get this right. And it is a lesson that you will use for the rest of your life, long after the problem area has \u201chealed.\u201d \nOkay, step one is understanding the concept of neutral spine. Step two is learning to find it and lock it in place, and keep it in place forever (which we will teach you in Chapter 9).\nThe neutral spine is the position that allows your spine to do its job with the least amount of stress and load. And\u2014if you have already damaged your back\u2014it is the position that results in the least amount of new damage or pain.\nFor most people, the picture on the left is the neutral spine. The other two are not.\nNeutral Spine \n\nGOOD BAD\nNote the gentle curve of the lower back in the \u201cgood\u201d spine. For the majority of you, this is how your neutral spine will look. If you have developed significant degenerative changes or were born with significant abnormalities (it happens, but not a lot), your neutral spine may look a bit different. For now assume that your neutral spine looks like one on the guy on the left. Spines vary, and you may have your own unique neutral spine that is a little different from this. Whatever your own neutral spine, that is the position you want to maintain as you go about your daily life. It is also the position in which you feel the least pain. Again, maintaining a neutral spine is a fundamental behavioral change for most people. And it is readily doable. In a few months\u2019 time, I predict that it will be natural and you will scarcely need to think about it. One of the near-magic presences in our lives is \u201cmuscle memory.\u201d Maintain your spine correctly for a while and muscle memory takes over. Then it is just a question of seeing to it that your muscles are strong enough to do their job. \nHow do you keep your spine neutral and still be a dynamic, moving, active human being? By learning to brace your neutral spine with your core (Chapter 9) and maximizing movement in your hips (as opposed to your lower back). As Chris mentioned in Chapter 6, one of our cardinal rules is \u201cThou shalt not bend or twist with thy lower back.\u201d And you don\u2019t need to. You can rotate from side to side and bend forward and back using your hips. You do not need to flex or twist your lower back. \nYou may ask: Isn\u2019t range of motion important for the lumbar spine? Answer: Not really. At least, it is usually the least important factor for someone who has had significant back pain, and should be reintroduced only after pain has stopped. Most people who have experienced regular, serious back pain have already sustained significant wear and tear on the spine. The general pattern I see is a combination of two things: first, worn-down vertebral joints that are hypomobile (stiff), secondary to arthritic changes and degeneration; second, lumbar vertebral joints that are hypermobilie (loose), due to overstretched ligaments and atrophied muscles. These problems are best resolved when we protect the spine by bracing and \u201clocking down\u201d the lumbar spine and moving in a manner that completely changes the axis of motion from the lumbar spine to the hips and shoulder girdle. You can eventually introduce some gentle lumbar range-of-motion exercises in non-loaded ways. This is what the \u201cCat/Camel\u201d exercise that we introduce later is for. Small, gentle lumbar range-of-motion exercise is necessary for things like synovial joint lubrication, the reduction of friction between vertebral segments and discs, and disc nutrition, among other things. For example, walking requires a few degrees of freedom between the lumbar vertebral joints (3 or 4 degrees rotation) with coordinated muscle contractions to enhance stabilization and supply necessary lubrication and nutrition to discs and joints. For our purposes, we recommend keeping lumbar motion to a minimum, especially until your pain is gone. Once that occurs, you should make only healthy, non-loaded, non-repetitive lumbar movements, such as those necessary for walking and the cat and camel exercise. Spinal stability, core endurance, hip mobility, and core and gluteal strength are far more important for maintaining a healthy spine once you\u2019ve had back pain. You can do just fine in life with almost no rotation or excessive movement in your lower back. Let your hips do the work, and your risk of recurring back pain is sharply reduced. \nFinding Your Neutral Spine \nFinding your neutral spine can be a bit tricky for some but you can do it. Here\u2019s what you do. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Try to relax everything in your body, and just breathe. Then let\u2019s start by performing a pelvic tilt. \nTo do that, flatten your lower back into the floor (see top drawing), and curl your tailbone upward. This is a \u201cposterior pelvic tilt,\u201d if you want to put a name to it. Now, arch your back so that your lower back comes off of the floor (middle drawing), and point your tailbone toward the ground (an \u201canterior pelvic tilt\u201d). Now, slowly go back and forth between those two motions a few times (bottom drawing). Find the position of your lower back between these two extremes (flattening your back or arching it) that feels the most comfortable to you, and stop there. This is your neutral spine. It may take a few tries but it\u2019s not hard.\nFinding Your Neutral Spine\n\nStop here for a second. You have just reached an important point, and you don\u2019t want to \u201close\u201d it. Everyone\u2019s neutral spine is a bit different depending on the anatomical condition of their lumbar spine. For most people, there will be a gentle curve in the lower back. For those who already have some kind of a disc bulge, their neutral spine might be more arched (butt more extended). For those with spinal stenosis, their neutral spine may be a little more flattened than the one in the picture on the previous page. Don\u2019t worry about it. Whatever feels the most comfortable for you is your neutral spine for now. In time, your neutral spine will likely become more like the \u201cnormal\u201d picture as pain and inflammation subside.\nThink about your neutral spine and assume that position all the time until it becomes second nature\u2014until \u201cmuscle memory\u201d takes over. \nNext, we move on to a discussion of techniques to help you maintain a neutral spine. But first, Chris is going to tell you why it is very likely you haven\u2019t heard of these concepts before."
