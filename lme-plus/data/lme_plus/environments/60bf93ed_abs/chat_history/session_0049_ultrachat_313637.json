      "content": "Ramakrishna achieved his states of ecstasy through intense devotion and rigorous spiritual practice. He was influenced by various spiritual traditions, including Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity, and he practiced techniques from each of these religions. \n\nRamakrishna's primary practice was Bhakti Yoga, which involves the cultivation of intense devotional love for the divine. He believed that this love could be expressed through various means, such as chanting, prayer, and meditation. He also practiced Japa (the repetition of a mantra or name of God), meditation, and self-inquiry.\n\nIn addition to these practices, Ramakrishna also sought out various spiritual teachers and gurus to learn from their teachings and experiences. He underwent various forms of asceticism and fasting, and he also experimented with different spiritual techniques such as Tantra.\n\nRamakrishna's states of ecstasy were not just a result of his devotion or practice, but were also believed to be a mystical gift directly from the divine. He believed that his experiences of Samadhi (deep meditative absorption) and other ecstatic states were a result of the grace of his chosen deity, the Divine Mother Kali."

He believed that these experiences were the ultimate goal of spiritual practice and emphasized the importance of pursuing them.\n\nRamakrishna's experiences of Samadhi and other ecstatic states heavily influenced his teachings, which emphasized the importance of direct experience over intellectual understanding. He believed that true knowledge of the divine could only be attained through direct experience, and that intellectual understanding alone was not enough.\n\nRamakrishna's experiences also informed his inclusive approach to religious practice and his belief in the ultimate unity of all religions.
