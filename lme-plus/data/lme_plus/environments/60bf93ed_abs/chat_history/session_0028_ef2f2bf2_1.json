      "content": "Using a mix of niche-specific hashtags like #summerFashion and more general ones like #summerVibes is a great strategy to reach a wider audience. This approach is called the \"hashtag pyramid\" or \"hashtag ladder\" strategy.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Niche-specific hashtags** (e.g., #summerFashion, #summerBeauty, #summerAccessories): These hashtags attract people who are specifically interested in your content's topic. They're more targeted and likely to engage with your post.\n2. **Mid-tier hashtags** (e.g., #summerStyle, #summerTrends, #summerInspo): These hashtags are still related to your niche, but slightly broader. They can attract people who are interested in the general topic, but might not be as specific as your niche-specific hashtags.\n3. **General hashtags** (e.g., #summerVibes, #summerFun, #summerLove): These hashtags are very broad and can attract a large audience. They're often more popular and might have more competition, but can still drive traffic to your post.\n\nBy using a mix of these hashtags, you can:\n\n* Attract a targeted audience with niche-specific hashtags\n* Reach a slightly broader audience with mid-tier hashtags\n* Cast a wider net with general hashtags to attract new followers and increase visibility\n\nThis strategy can help you:\n\n* Increase your post's discoverability\n* Reach new audiences and attract new followers\n* Drive more engagement and interactions on your post\n\nJust remember to keep your hashtags relevant to your content, and don't overdo it. Using 5-10 hashtags per post is still a good rule of thumb.\n\nI'm excited to see how this strategy works out for you!"

      "content": "Using hashtags related to sunglasses, like #sunglasses or #shades, can be a great way to attract an audience interested in eyewear and fashion accessories. Since your featured post was about your new sunglasses, it's highly relevant to include these hashtags.\n\nIn fact, using hashtags that are closely related to the specific product or topic of your post can help you attract a highly targeted audience. This is especially true for niche products like sunglasses, where people may be searching for specific styles, brands, or features.\n\nHere's an updated hashtag strategy you could use for your post:\n\n* **Niche-specific hashtags**: #sunglasses, #shades, #sunglasseslover, #eyewear\n* **Mid-tier hashtags**: #summerFashion, #fashionAccessories, #summerStyle\n* **General hashtags**: #summerVibes, #summerFun, #summerLove\n\nBy including hashtags related to sunglasses, you can attract an audience that's interested in eyewear and fashion accessories, which can help drive engagement and attract new followers. Just remember to keep your hashtags relevant to your content and don't overdo it.\n\nAdditionally, you could also consider using hashtags related to specific features of your sunglasses, such as #polarized, #aviators, #roundframes, or #mirrored lenses, depending on the style and features of your sunglasses. This can help you attract an even more targeted audience that's interested in specific types of sunglasses.\n\nI hope this helps!
