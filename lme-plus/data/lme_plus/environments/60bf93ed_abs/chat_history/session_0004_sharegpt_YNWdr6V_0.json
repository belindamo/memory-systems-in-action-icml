Divide the set of receivers into non-overlapping subsets such that each subset contains receivers that are only visible to a single transmitter.\n3. For each subset, determine the optimal charging time for each receiver based on its current power level and the power delivery rate of the transmitter.\n4. Schedule the charging times for each receiver in each subset to minimize the overall charging time for all receivers.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each subset.\n6. Activate each transmitter in sequence, and have it charge the receivers in its corresponding subset according to the pre-determined charging times.\n7. Repeat the charging process for each subset until all receivers have been charged.\n\nBy dividing the set of receivers into non-overlapping subsets, we can avoid situations where multiple transmitters try to charge the same receiver at the same time, which would lead to inefficiencies and waste of power. By optimizing the charging times for each receiver, we can ensure that each receiver is charged as quickly as possible while also avoiding overcharging, which could damage the battery or reduce its lifespan. By scheduling the charging times for each subset, we can minimize the overall charging time for all receivers, which would improve the efficiency of the wireless power delivery system."

Repeat the charging process for each subset until all receivers have been charged.\n\nThe key difference between this algorithm and the previous one is that we schedule the charging times to maximize the overall charging time for all receivers, rather than to minimize it. This means that we prioritize charging the receivers that need the most power first, even if it means that some receivers are charged later than they would be in the previous algorithm. By maximizing the overall charging time for all receivers, we can ensure that the wireless power delivery system is used as efficiently as possible, and that all receivers receive as much power as possible within the given time constraints."

Repeat steps 1-5 until all receivers have been charged.\n\nThe key difference between this algorithm and the previous ones is that each transmitter operates independently, without knowledge of what receivers other transmitters see.

If a receiver is already being charged by another transmitter, we skip it and move on to the next one to avoid wasting power. By calculating the charging time for each transmitter based on the power levels of the receivers it can see, we can optimize the power delivery for each transmitter individually, without any coordination between transmitters.
