Here's a simple system you can follow:\n\n1. **Type of garment**: Divide your clothes into categories like tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, and accessories.\n2. **Occasion**: Within each category, separate items into sub-groups based on occasion, such as:\n\t* Work/professional\n\t* Casual everyday\n\t* Formal events\n\t* Activewear\n\t* Loungewear\n3. **Season**: Consider storing out-of-season clothes separately to free up space and reduce clutter.\n4. **Frequency of use**: Hang or store frequently worn items in an easily accessible area, and less frequently worn items towards the back or on higher/lower shelves.\n\nFor storing your clothes, here are some tips:\n\n1. **Use a color-coded system**: Organize clothes within each category by color to create a visually pleasing and easy-to-navigate space.\n2. **Utilize vertical space**: Maximize your closet's vertical space with stackable shelves, hanging rods, or storage units.\n3. **Invest in storage containers**: Use bins, baskets, or drawers to store items like socks, underwear, and accessories.\n4. **Hang clothes by type**: Group similar items together, such as all dresses or all button-down shirts.\n5. **Implement a \"one in, one out\" policy**: To maintain your newly organized closet, get rid of an item every time you bring a new one into your wardrobe.\n\nAs for your navy blue blazer, don't forget to pick it up from the dry cleaners! You might consider setting a reminder or putting it in your calendar to ensure you don't forget.\n\nHow does this system sound? Do you have any specific concerns or questions about organizing your closet?",
