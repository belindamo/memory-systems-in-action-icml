Since your featured post was about your new sunglasses, it's highly relevant to include these hashtags.\n\nIn fact, using hashtags that are closely related to the specific product or topic of your post can help you attract a highly targeted audience. This is especially true for niche products like sunglasses, where people may be searching for specific styles, brands, or features.\n\nHere's an updated hashtag strategy you could use for your post:\n\n* **Niche-specific hashtags**: #sunglasses, #shades, #sunglasseslover, #eyewear\n* **Mid-tier hashtags**: #summerFashion, #fashionAccessories, #summerStyle\n* **General hashtags**: #summerVibes, #summerFun, #summerLove\n\nBy including hashtags related to sunglasses, you can attract an audience that's interested in eyewear and fashion accessories, which can help drive engagement and attract new followers. Just remember to keep your hashtags relevant to your content and don't overdo it.\n\nAdditionally, you could also consider using hashtags related to specific features of your sunglasses, such as #polarized, #aviators, #roundframes, or #mirrored lenses, depending on the style and features of your sunglasses. This can help you attract an even more targeted audience that's interested in specific types of sunglasses.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance.",
