  "content": "Yes, absolutely! The conservation of teak forests is not only important for the species that directly rely on them but also for the broader ecosystem, including the local communities and the global climate. Trees provide countless ecosystem services that benefit humans, such as air and water purification, soil health, and carbon sequestration.
