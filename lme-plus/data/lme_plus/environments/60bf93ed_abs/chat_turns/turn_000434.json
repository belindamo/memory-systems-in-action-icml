Monitoring water consumption can help you identify potential health issues early on. Here are a few ways to track Luna's water intake:\n\n1. **Pet water bowls with built-in sensors**: There are smart water bowls available that come equipped with sensors to track your pet's water intake. These bowls can be connected to mobile apps, providing you with real-time data on Luna's water consumption. Some popular options include Petnet's SmartFeeder and SmartWater, as well as the Petfirst Smart Water Bowl.\n2. **Manual tracking**: You can use a measuring cup or a marked water bottle to track Luna's daily water intake. Simply measure the amount of water in the bowl at the start and end of each day, and record the difference. You can then log this data in a pet care app or a spreadsheet.\n3. **Weight-based tracking**: While not as precise, you can track Luna's water intake by monitoring her weight. If you notice a significant increase in her weight, it could be an indication that she's drinking more water. This method is less accurate, but it can provide a general idea of her hydration level.\n\nSome pet care apps, like Petnet and PetMD, allow you to track your pet's water intake manually. You can log the amount of water consumed each day, and the app will provide you with a summary of Luna's hydration levels.\n\nWhen it comes to Petnet and PetMD, both apps offer water tracking features:\n\n* Petnet: Allows you to track water intake, including setting goals and receiving alerts when Luna's water consumption is above or below the set goal.\n* PetMD: Enables you to log your pet's water intake, and the app will provide a hydration score based on the data. You can also set reminders to check the water bowl and receive notifications when it's time to refill.\n\nIf you decide to use a pet care app, make sure to explore the water tracking features and set up reminders to log Luna's water intake regularly. This will help you stay on top of her hydration and identify any potential issues early on.\n\nHow do you think you'll track Luna's water intake? Will you opt for a smart water bowl, manual tracking, or use a pet care app?",
