  "content": "It is not recommended to use scissors to trim your long haired rabbit's fur as it can be difficult to control, and you risk hurting your rabbit with the blades. You also risk accidentally cutting off more fur than intended and leaving patches that may take a long time to grow back. It's best to use specific rabbit trimmers with a guard to help prevent any accidental cuts. Scissors can also pull and cut fur unevenly, which can be very painful for your rabbit. If you're unsure of how to trim your rabbit's fur, it's best to consult with a professional groomer or veterinarian for guidance.",
