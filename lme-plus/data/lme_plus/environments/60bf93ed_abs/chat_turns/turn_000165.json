Fetal Development\n=====================\n\nDuring the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy, the fetus is approximately the size of an ear of corn and weighs around 1.3 pounds. The fetus is continuing to develop and mature, and many of its major organs are now fully formed. Here's a breakdown of what's happening during fetal development at this stage:\n\n* **Organ Development:** The lungs are continuing to mature, and the fetus is practicing breathing movements. The digestive system is also maturing, and the fetus is swallowing amniotic fluid and producing meconium, which is the first stool that the baby will pass after birth. The brain is developing rapidly, and the fetus can now hear and respond to sounds outside the womb.\n* **Movement:** The fetus is now active and moving around inside the uterus. This movement is important for proper muscle and bone development, as well as the development of the nervous system. Expectant mothers may feel kicks and movements from the baby, and these movements can provide a sense of connection and reassurance.\n* **Healthy Fetus Signs:** One of the most important signs of a healthy fetus is frequent movement. Expectant mothers should feel their baby move at least ten times per day, although every baby has its own pattern of movement. In addition, a healthy fetus will have a strong and regular heartbeat.\n* **Proper Nutrition:** Proper nutrition is essential for fetal development during this stage of pregnancy. Expectant mothers should consume a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. They should also take prenatal vitamins, which contain important nutrients like folic acid, iron, and calcium.\n\nIn the next section, we will explore the physical and emotional changes that women may experience during the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy.",
