  "content": "The research gap that your study is addressing is the lack of a systematic and quantitative method to evaluate finger function in rehabilitation. While current methods for evaluating finger function rely on the experience of physiotherapists or clinicians, your study uses a wearable prototype to collect and analyze active range of motion and fingertip force data. This allows for a more personalized and objective approach to evaluating finger function, which can improve rehabilitation outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, your study addresses a gap in the literature by establishing typical active range of motion and fingertip force data for different categories of population, such as gender, handedness, age, and exercise frequency. This information can be used to develop more personalized rehabilitation programs that take into account the individual characteristics of each patient, leading to more effective and efficient rehabilitation outcomes.",
