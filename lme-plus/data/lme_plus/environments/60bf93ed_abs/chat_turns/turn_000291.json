This approach is called the \"hashtag pyramid\" or \"hashtag ladder\" strategy.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Niche-specific hashtags** (e.g., #summerFashion, #summerBeauty, #summerAccessories): These hashtags attract people who are specifically interested in your content's topic. They're more targeted and likely to engage with your post.\n2. **Mid-tier hashtags** (e.g., #summerStyle, #summerTrends, #summerInspo): These hashtags are still related to your niche, but slightly broader. They can attract people who are interested in the general topic, but might not be as specific as your niche-specific hashtags.\n3. **General hashtags** (e.g., #summerVibes, #summerFun, #summerLove): These hashtags are very broad and can attract a large audience. They're often more popular and might have more competition, but can still drive traffic to your post.\n\nBy using a mix of these hashtags, you can:\n\n* Attract a targeted audience with niche-specific hashtags\n* Reach a slightly broader audience with mid-tier hashtags\n* Cast a wider net with general hashtags to attract new followers and increase visibility\n\nThis strategy can help you:\n\n* Increase your post's discoverability\n* Reach new audiences and attract new followers\n* Drive more engagement and interactions on your post\n\nJust remember to keep your hashtags relevant to your content, and don't overdo it. Using 5-10 hashtags per post is still a good rule of thumb.\n\nI'm excited to see how this strategy works out for you!",
