  "content": "Yes, it is true that large corporations and governments do have a lot of power to effect change, and individuals often feel powerless to make a difference. However, individuals can still take action to pressure these entities to take action. Here are some potential steps:\n\n1. Use the power of your voice: Individuals can use their voices to raise awareness and pressure corporations and governments to take action. This can include writing to elected representatives, participating in protests, and using social media to spread awareness and mobilize others.\n\n2. Support advocacy groups: There are many advocacy groups working to pressure corporations and governments to take action on environmental issues such as deforestation. Supporting these groups through donations or volunteering can help amplify their message and increase their impact.\n\n3. Vote with your wallet: Individuals can vote with their wallets by choosing to support companies that prioritize sustainability and responsible sourcing of wood products. This can involve purchasing products certified by schemes such as FSC or avoiding products from companies with a poor track record on sustainability.\n\n4. Push for policy change: Individuals can push for policy change on the local, national, and international levels by lobbying elected representatives, signing petitions, and participating in public consultations. Policy changes can include measures to prevent deforestation, promote sustainable forestry practices, and incentivize responsible corporate behavior.\n\n5. Participate in shareholder action: If you own stocks in a company that contributes to deforestation or other environmental damage, you can participate in shareholder action to pressure the company to change its practices.\n\nBy taking these steps, individuals can use their power to put pressure on larger entities and bring about positive change for our planet and its ecosystems.",
