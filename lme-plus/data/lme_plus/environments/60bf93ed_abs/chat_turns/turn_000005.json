  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the most recent studies, but there may be studies that have compared the recidivism rate of inmates released from The Tombs with those released from other facilities. However, it is essential to note that specific data on The Tombs may be challenging to obtain as it is a facility located in New York City and may have its unique characteristics.\n\nNational studies often use a large sample size across various state correctional facilities in different regions, each having its protocols, population demographics, and other factors that could impact the recidivism rate. Nonetheless, the sources I mentioned earlier, such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Institute of Justice, and the Pew Charitable Trusts, could provide insights into the broader trends and patterns related to recidivism in the United States.",
