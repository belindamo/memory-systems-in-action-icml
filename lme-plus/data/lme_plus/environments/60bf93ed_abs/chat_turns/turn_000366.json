  "content": "It is not recommended to shave off the fur on your long haired rabbit\u2019s bottom to prevent mats, as the fur serves an important function to protect your rabbit's skin. The fur helps to prevent moisture and dirt from irritating your rabbit's skin and tailless breeds, especially rely on the fur to keep their skin protected from urine and fecal mats. Shaving it off can leave your rabbit's skin exposed and increase the risk of skin damage, sunburn, and infection. \n\nInstead, you can use blunt-tipped scissors to carefully trim the fur around the area. Alternatively, you can use a professional pet groomer to help keep your rabbit's backside tidy through regular grooming to avoid any matting. If your rabbit has constant trouble with the matting of their fur, it could indicate some underlying health issues, and it is important to consult a veterinarian to address the issue.",
