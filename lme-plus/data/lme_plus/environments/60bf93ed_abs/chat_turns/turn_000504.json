  "content": "Ramakrishna achieved his states of ecstasy through intense devotion and rigorous spiritual practice. He was influenced by various spiritual traditions, including Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity, and he practiced techniques from each of these religions. \n\nRamakrishna's primary practice was Bhakti Yoga, which involves the cultivation of intense devotional love for the divine. He believed that this love could be expressed through various means, such as chanting, prayer, and meditation. He also practiced Japa (the repetition of a mantra or name of God), meditation, and self-inquiry.\n\nIn addition to these practices, Ramakrishna also sought out various spiritual teachers and gurus to learn from their teachings and experiences. He underwent various forms of asceticism and fasting, and he also experimented with different spiritual techniques such as Tantra.\n\nRamakrishna's states of ecstasy were not just a result of his devotion or practice, but were also believed to be a mystical gift directly from the divine. He believed that his experiences of Samadhi (deep meditative absorption) and other ecstatic states were a result of the grace of his chosen deity, the Divine Mother Kali.",
