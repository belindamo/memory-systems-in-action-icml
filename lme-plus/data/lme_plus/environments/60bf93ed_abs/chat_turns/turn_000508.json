  "content": "During his states of Samadhi and other ecstatic states, Ramakrishna would experience intense feelings of oneness with the divine. He described experiencing a complete dissolution of his ego, as if his individual self had merged with the infinite reality of the divine. During these states, he would feel a deep sense of joy and freedom, and would often be unresponsive to external stimuli.\n\nRamakrishna believed that these states of Samadhi and other ecstatic states were the highest experiences possible for a human being, and that they offered a direct experience of the divine reality beyond conceptualizations and constructs. He believed that these experiences were the ultimate goal of spiritual practice and emphasized the importance of pursuing them.\n\nRamakrishna's experiences of Samadhi and other ecstatic states heavily influenced his teachings, which emphasized the importance of direct experience over intellectual understanding. He believed that true knowledge of the divine could only be attained through direct experience, and that intellectual understanding alone was not enough.\n\nRamakrishna's experiences also informed his inclusive approach to religious practice and his belief in the ultimate unity of all religions. He believed that these ecstatic experiences transcended the limitations of religion and culture, and that they offered a direct experience of the underlying unity and interconnectedness of all things.\n\nOverall, Ramakrishna's experiences of Samadhi and other ecstatic states were a central aspect of his teachings and his approach to spiritual practice. They continue to inspire and guide spiritual seekers today, and have had a significant impact on the development of modern spirituality.",
