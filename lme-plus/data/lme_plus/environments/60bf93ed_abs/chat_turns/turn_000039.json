  "content": "One possible control algorithm for the transmitter to optimize power delivery overall is as follows:\n\n1. Determine which receivers are within the range of each transmitter.\n2. Divide the set of receivers into non-overlapping subsets such that each subset contains receivers that are only visible to a single transmitter.\n3. For each subset, determine the optimal charging time for each receiver based on its current power level and the power delivery rate of the transmitter.\n4. Schedule the charging times for each receiver in each subset to minimize the overall charging time for all receivers.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each subset.\n6. Activate each transmitter in sequence, and have it charge the receivers in its corresponding subset according to the pre-determined charging times.\n7. Repeat the charging process for each subset until all receivers have been charged.\n\nBy dividing the set of receivers into non-overlapping subsets, we can avoid situations where multiple transmitters try to charge the same receiver at the same time, which would lead to inefficiencies and waste of power. By optimizing the charging times for each receiver, we can ensure that each receiver is charged as quickly as possible while also avoiding overcharging, which could damage the battery or reduce its lifespan. By scheduling the charging times for each subset, we can minimize the overall charging time for all receivers, which would improve the efficiency of the wireless power delivery system.",
