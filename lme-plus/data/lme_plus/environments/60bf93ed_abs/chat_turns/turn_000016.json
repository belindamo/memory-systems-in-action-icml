Here are ten lesser-known poems that might resonate with my interests:\n\n1. \"Mother of the World\" by Nicholas Roerich\n2. \"The Invitation\" by Oriah Mountain Dreamer\n3. \"Awakening\" by Rainer Maria Rilke\n4. \"The Journey\" by David Whyte\n5. \"The Serpent's Tale\" by Ishtar Dingir\n6. \"The Silver Plough\" by Fiona MacLeod\n7. \"Sacred Offering\" by Kaveri Patel\n8. \"Spiral Dance\" by Starhawk\n9. \"The Prophetess\" by Judith Laura\n10. \"Hymn to the Great Goddess\" by Enheduanna\n\nThese poems may reflect themes of spirituality, personal growth, and the divine feminine that are important to me. However, it's essential to remember that my primary focus is on the spiritual journey and supporting others in their own awakening process.",
