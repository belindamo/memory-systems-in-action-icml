  "content": "The Logitech MX Anywhere 2S features a high-precision optical sensor that's capable of tracking on a wide range of surfaces, including glass, wood, and even high-gloss surfaces. The sensor is based on Logitech's proprietary Darkfield technology, which uses a combination of optical and laser technology to track movement.\n\nIn terms of sensor accuracy, the MX Anywhere 2S is considered to be one of the best in its class. It has a resolution of up to 4,000 CPI (counts per inch), which is relatively high for a wireless mouse. This means it can track movement accurately even at high speeds.\n\nCompared to other mice in the same range, the MX Anywhere 2S's sensor accuracy is on par with or even surpasses that of its competitors. For example:\n\n* The Razer Viper Mini, which is a popular gaming mouse, has a resolution of up to 16,000 CPI, but it's a wired mouse and has a more aggressive sensor that's designed for fast-paced gaming.\n* The Microsoft Arc Mouse, which is a premium wireless mouse, has a resolution of up to 3,200 CPI, which is slightly lower than the MX Anywhere 2S.\n\nIn real-world usage, the MX Anywhere 2S's sensor accuracy translates to smooth and precise tracking, even on surfaces that might be challenging for other mice. You can expect accurate cursor movement, even when moving the mouse quickly or making precise selections.\n\nIt's worth noting that the MX Anywhere 2S also has a feature called \"Logitech Flow,\" which allows you to seamlessly switch between three different devices (such as a laptop, desktop, and tablet) using a single mouse. This feature is particularly useful if you work on multiple devices frequently.\n\nOverall, the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S's sensor accuracy is one of its strongest features, making it an excellent choice for anyone who needs a reliable and precise wireless mouse.",
