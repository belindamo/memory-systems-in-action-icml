  "content": "Mic'ing the piano from underneath is not a myth, and it can be a fascinating technique to explore! This method is often referred to as \"under-piano\" or \"sub-piano\" mic'ing. While it may not be the most conventional approach, it can yield some unique and interesting results.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\n**Why try under-piano mic'ing?**\n\n1. **Unique tone**: Placing a microphone under the piano can capture a distinct, warm, and rich tone that's different from traditional mic'ing techniques. This is because the sound waves bounce off the floor and resonate through the piano's body, producing a unique sonic character.\n2. **Added depth**: Under-piano mic'ing can add depth and dimensionality to your piano sound, making it more interesting and engaging.\n3. **Less room ambiance**: By positioning the microphone under the piano, you can reduce the amount of room ambiance and focus more on the instrument's natural tone.\n\n**Challenges and considerations**\n\n1. **Accessibility**: Depending on your piano's design, accessing the underside might be difficult or even impossible. You may need to remove panels or use specialized equipment to reach the area.\n2. **Noise and vibrations**: The underside of the piano can be prone to mechanical noise, vibrations, and resonance, which can affect the sound quality.\n3. **Mic selection and placement**: Choosing the right microphone and placing it correctly under the piano is crucial. You may need to experiment with different mic types, positions, and angles to find the sweet spot.\n\n**Tips for under-piano mic'ing**\n\n1. **Use a dynamic microphone**: Dynamic microphones like the Shure SM57 or Sennheiser MD421 are often preferred for under-piano mic'ing due to their ability to handle high sound pressure levels and reject ambient noise.\n2. **Experiment with mic placement**: Try placing the microphone near the center of the piano, or closer to the pedals for a more resonant sound. You can also experiment with mic angles and positions to find the best spot.\n3. **Combine with traditional mic'ing**: Consider combining under-piano mic'ing with traditional mic'ing techniques to create a more balanced and interesting sound.\n\nRemember, under-piano mic'ing is an unconventional technique, and the results may vary depending on your piano, room, and mic selection. Be prepared to experiment and adjust your approach to achieve the desired sound.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous and want to try something new, go for it! You might be surprised by the unique tone and character you can capture by mic'ing your piano from underneath.",
