These materials are typically soft, smooth, and gentle on the screen, allowing you to safely store your laptop without worrying about scratches or damage.\n\nThere isn't a specific type of fabric or treatment that's universally used, but rather a range of materials and designs that achieve this goal. Here are some common approaches:\n\n1. **Microfiber-lined interiors**: Some sleeves feature a microfiber-lined interior, which is a soft, synthetic material that's gentle on touchscreens. Microfiber is often used in cleaning cloths, and its softness makes it an excellent choice for protecting screens.\n2. **Fleece-lined interiors**: Fleece is another soft, plush material that's often used in laptop sleeves. It provides a gentle, scratch-free surface for your touchscreen.\n3. **Velvet-lined interiors**: Velvet is a soft, smooth fabric that's gentle on touchscreens. It's often used in premium laptop sleeves to provide an extra layer of protection and luxury.\n4. **Screen-safe nylon or polyester**: Some sleeves feature a special type of nylon or polyester fabric that's designed to be screen-safe. These materials are often treated with a scratch-resistant coating or woven in a way that minimizes the risk of scratching.\n5. **Soft-touch PU or PVC**: Some sleeves use a soft-touch polyurethane (PU) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material that's gentle on touchscreens. These materials are often used in combination with other materials, like microfiber or fleece, to create a scratch-free interior.\n\nWhen shopping for a touchscreen-friendly sleeve, look for phrases like:\n\n* \"Touchscreen-safe interior\"\n* \"Microfiber-lined interior\"\n* \"Soft-touch material\"\n* \"Screen-safe fabric\"\n* \"Scratch-resistant interior\"\n\nThese phrases indicate that the sleeve is designed to protect your touchscreen from scratches and damage. However, it's always a good idea to read reviews and check the manufacturer's warranty or guarantee to ensure the sleeve meets your expectations.",
