  "content": "Yes, here are some examples of threatened and endangered species that rely on teak forests for habitat:\n\n1. Tigers: The teak forests of India and Southeast Asia are home to several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal tiger, Indochinese tiger, and Sumatran tiger. These majestic big cats are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.\n\n2. Elephants: Asian elephants also depend on teak forests for habitat. They use the dense vegetation to hide, forage, and socialize. As forests are lost to logging and agriculture, elephant populations are threatened.\n\n3. Hornbills: These large, colorful birds are important seed dispersers in teak forests. They are also a key indicator species of forest health, as they require large, undisturbed areas to thrive. Many hornbill species are threatened due to habitat loss and hunting.\n\n4. Langurs: Several species of leaf-eating langurs, including the gray langur and the Hanuman langur, rely on teak forests for habitat. They are arboreal primates that require large trees with dense foliage to avoid predators and find food.\n\n5. Flying squirrels: Several species of flying squirrels, including the Indian giant flying squirrel and the red giant flying squirrel, are found in teak forests. They use their flaps of skin between their limbs to glide from tree to tree. However, habitat fragmentation and deforestation threaten these unique mammals.\n\nOverall, teak forests are critical for the survival of many species, and their conservation is essential for biodiversity conservation.",
