  "content": "Long haired rabbits require regular grooming to prevent matting and tangling of their fur. This includes:\n\n1. Daily brushing: Use a soft-bristled brush to gently brush your rabbit\u2019s fur every day to remove any loose or tangled fur.\n\n2. Bathing: It is not recommended to bathe your rabbit too often as it can strip the natural oils from their fur. However, if your rabbit\u2019s fur becomes excessively dirty or matted, a bath may be necessary. Use a gentle rabbit shampoo and make sure to rinse thoroughly.\n\n3. Trimming: Long haired rabbits may develop fur around their bottom that can become matted with feces. You should trim this fur regularly to prevent matting and keep your rabbit clean.\n\n4. Check for mites: Long haired rabbits are more prone to getting mites, which can cause skin irritation and hair loss. Check your rabbit\u2019s skin regularly for any signs of mites and treat if necessary.\n\n5. Diet: Feeding your rabbit a healthy diet with plenty of fiber can help prevent hairballs and promote healthy fur growth. Make sure they eat plenty of hay and fresh vegetables.",
