To estimate how long the 12 packets of Whiskas food will last Luna, we'll need to know a few more details.\n\nCan you please tell me:\n\n1. How much food does Luna eat per day? Is it a specific amount (e.g., 1 cup, 2 cups), or do you free-feed her?\n2. What is Luna's age, weight, and activity level (e.g., indoor, outdoor, playful, lazy)? This will help us estimate her daily caloric needs.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you calculate how long the 12 packets of 2kg each will last Luna.",
