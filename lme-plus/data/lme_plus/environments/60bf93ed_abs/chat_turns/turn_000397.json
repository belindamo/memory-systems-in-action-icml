  "content": "I've been thinking of upgrading my music skills, and I want to get a guitar that will inspire me to practice more. By the way, speaking of practice, I've been doing pretty well with my piano lessons - I've been taking them for three months now and just started learning Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, which is a big deal for me. Anyway, back to guitars, do you think any of these brands you mentioned would be suitable for someone who wants to play jazz and folk music?",
