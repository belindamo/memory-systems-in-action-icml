Good job remembering those details!\n\nWhat about other expenses? Have you paid any bills, like rent/mortgage, utilities, or insurance premiums? Have you gone out to eat or ordered takeout recently?\n\nAlso, do you remember how much you spent on gas? Was it a full tank, and do you have an estimate of how much that usually costs you?",
