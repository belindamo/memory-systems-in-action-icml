For example, under \"Clothing,\" you could have subcategories like \"Tops,\" \"Bottoms,\" \"Dresses,\" and \"Outerwear.\"\n\nRemember, these categories are just a starting point. You can adjust them or add new ones to fit your specific gift-giving needs and preferences.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be consistent in your categorization to ensure accurate tracking and analysis.\n* Consider creating a \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Other\" category for gifts that don't fit neatly into another category.\n* If you find that a particular category is becoming too broad, break it down into subcategories to gain more insight into your spending.\n* Use your categories to set budgets and track expenses for specific areas of gift-giving, helping you make more intentional purchasing decisions.",
