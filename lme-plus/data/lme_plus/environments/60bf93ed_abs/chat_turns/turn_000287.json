  "content": "\"Regularization and punishment are both ways of making sure that someone or something doesn't do something bad or make mistakes. Regularization is like a punishment for a model that is too complicated. It makes the model simpler, so it can do a better job of predicting things. Punishment is like a punishment for people who do something bad. It makes them stop doing the bad thing and maybe do something good instead. Both regularization and punishment are ways of helping someone or something be better and do better.\"",
