For example, \"Winter 2022-2023 Sweaters\" or \"Summer 2023 Dresses.\" That way, I can easily find what I need when the seasons change. I also like the idea of adding a contents list to each bin, especially if I have multiple bins for the same season.\n\nBy the way, I just remembered that I need to pick up my new sandals from the store. I exchanged the ones I got on February 5th for a larger size, and I haven't picked them up yet. I'm excited to wear them to the wedding with my yellow sundress.",
