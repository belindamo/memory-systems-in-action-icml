Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate the fact that you've made it to your yoga practice, even if it's just for a few minutes. This will help you build confidence and reinforce the habit.\n\n**2. Mix it up**: Vary your yoga routine every few days or weeks to avoid boredom. Try different styles, such as Hatha, Vinyasa, or Yin, or focus on specific areas like core strength or flexibility.\n\n**3. Find a yoga buddy**: Having someone to hold you accountable and share the experience with can be a great motivator. Ask a friend, family member, or colleague to join you for yoga or find an online yoga community.\n\n**4. Set achievable goals**: Break down your yoga goals into smaller, manageable chunks. For example, aim to practice yoga for 10-15 minutes on Fridays and Mondays, and gradually increase the duration as you build energy and momentum.\n\n**5. Reward yourself**: After your yoga practice, treat yourself to something you enjoy, like a warm bath, a favorite snack, or some relaxing music. This will help associate yoga with positive feelings and reinforce the habit.\n\n**6. Focus on how you feel**: Instead of focusing on the physical aspects of yoga, remember how it makes you feel. Yoga can help reduce stress, improve mood, and increase energy levels. Focus on these benefits to motivate yourself, especially on tired days.\n\n**7. Be kind to yourself**: Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Life happens, and it's okay to take a break. Simply acknowledge the setback and gently get back on track.\n\n**8. Create a pre-yoga ritual**: Develop a calming pre-yoga routine, such as lighting a candle, sipping herbal tea, or reading a motivational quote. This will help signal to your brain that it's time for yoga and create a sense of calm.\n\n**9. Track your progress**: Keep a yoga journal or use a habit-tracking app to monitor your progress. Seeing your streaks and accomplishments can be a great motivator.\n\n**10. Make it a habit**: Consistency is key. Aim to make yoga a non-negotiable part of your daily routine, just like brushing your teeth or taking a shower.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to listen to your body and honor its needs. If you need to take a break or modify your practice, that's okay. With time and consistency, you'll find that yoga becomes an essential part of your daily routine, even on Fridays and Mondays.",
