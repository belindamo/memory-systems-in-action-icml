Here are some suggestions to help you track your gift expenses better:\n\n1. **Spreadsheets:** Create a spreadsheet specifically for gift expenses. Set up columns for the recipient's name, occasion, date, gift description, and cost. This will help you visualize your spending and easily total up your expenses.\n2. **Digital Notes:** Use digital note-taking apps like Evernote, OneNote, or Simplenote to keep track of your gift expenses. Create a separate note for each gift, including the details mentioned above.\n3. **Budgeting Apps:** Utilize budgeting apps like Mint, Personal Capital, or YNAB (You Need a Budget) to track your gift expenses. These apps allow you to categorize your expenses, set budgets, and receive alerts when you go over budget.\n4. **Envelope System:** Divide your expenses into categories (e.g., birthdays, holidays, weddings) and place the corresponding receipts in labeled envelopes. This visual system helps you see how much you've spent in each category.\n5. **Gift Tracking Apps:** Explore gift tracking apps like Giftster, GiftTracker, or GiftLog.
