  "content": "Yes, Ramakrishna's teachings have had a significant impact on spirituality beyond India, especially in the West. His message of the unity of all religions, the importance of direct experience, and the values of selfless service and spiritual development resonated with many Westerners who were seeking new approaches to spirituality in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nOne of Ramakrishna's most famous disciples, Swami Vivekananda, was instrumental in spreading his teachings to the West. Vivekananda traveled to the United States in 1893 and gave a famous speech at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he introduced Ramakrishna's teachings of the unity of all religions to a Western audience. Vivekananda's teachings, which were heavily influenced by Ramakrishna, also emphasized the importance of direct experience and experiential spirituality, which resonated with many seekers in the West.\n\nThe Ramakrishna Order, which was founded by Vivekananda, established centers and ashrams in various parts of the world, spreading Ramakrishna's teachings beyond India. The Order's focus on service and social upliftment, as well as its inclusive approach to religion, has resonated with many people around the world and has inspired them to work for the betterment of their communities and the world at large.\n\nOverall, Ramakrishna's teachings have had a significant impact on spirituality beyond India, and continue to inspire spiritual seekers around the world. His message of universalism, direct experience, and selfless service has resonated with people of various religious and cultural backgrounds, and has helped to promote greater understanding and harmony among people of different faiths.",
