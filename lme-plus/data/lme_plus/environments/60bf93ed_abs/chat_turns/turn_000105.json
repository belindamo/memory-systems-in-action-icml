Here are a few keyboards that might interest you:\n\n**Korg Options:**\n\n1. **Korg B1**: A digital piano with weighted hammer action keys, built-in lessons, and recording capabilities. It has a more traditional piano sound, but also offers some synth sounds. ($499)\n2. **Korg Grandstage**: A stage piano with weighted keys, a wide range of sounds (including pianos, synths, and organs), and recording capabilities. It's a bit more expensive, but offers more features and sounds. ($799)\n3. **Korg D1**: A compact digital piano with weighted keys, a focus on piano sounds, and recording capabilities. It's a great option if you want a more portable weighted-key keyboard. ($699)\n\n**Roland Options:**\n\n1. **Roland FP-10**: A digital piano with weighted keys, a wide range of sounds, and recording capabilities. It's a great all-around keyboard with a focus on piano sounds. ($799)\n2. **Roland FP-30**: A digital piano with weighted keys, a more extensive sound library (including synths and organs), and recording capabilities. It's a step up from the FP-10, with more features and sounds. ($999)\n3. **Roland GO:KEYS**: A compact keyboard with weighted keys, a focus on synth sounds, and recording capabilities. It's a great option if you want a more portable keyboard with a focus on synth sounds. ($499)\n\nAll of these keyboards have USB connectivity, so you can connect them to your computer and use them as a MIDI controller or record audio directly into your DAW.\n\nBased on your preferences, I think the Korg Grandstage or Roland FP-30 might be great options. Both offer a wide range of sounds, weighted keys, and recording capabilities. However, if you're looking for something more portable, the Korg D1 or Roland GO:KEYS might be worth considering.\n\nI hope this helps you narrow down your options! Do you have any other questions about these keyboards or would you like more information on any specific model?",
