  "content": "I got a high-end NVIDIA graphics card, and I've been playing a lot of FPS games like Call of Duty and Halo. The new card has definitely made a huge difference in terms of frame rates and overall performance.\n\nAs for other benefits, I've also noticed that my computer feels a lot snappier overall, even when I'm not gaming. I think it's because the new card is helping to handle some of the graphical tasks that my CPU used to handle, so it's taking some of the load off.\n\nBy the way, speaking of computer maintenance, I also cleaned my desktop computer on February 1st and removed all the dust and dirt that had accumulated on the fans and vents. It seems to have improved its performance as well.\n\nDo you have any tips on how to keep my computer clean and well-maintained?",
