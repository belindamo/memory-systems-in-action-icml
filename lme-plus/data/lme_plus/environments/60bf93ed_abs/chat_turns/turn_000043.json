  "content": "Sure, here's a revised version of the algorithm that takes into account the assumption that transmitters do not communicate with each other and do not know what receivers other transmitters see:\n\n1. For each transmitter, determine the set of receivers that are within its range and record their current power levels.\n2. For each transmitter, sort the set of receivers in descending order of their power levels.\n3. For each transmitter, iterate through the sorted set of receivers and attempt to charge each receiver in turn, starting from the most depleted one. If a receiver is already being charged by another transmitter, skip it and move on to the next one.\n4. For each transmitter, calculate the amount of time it needs to charge all the receivers it can see, based on their power levels and the power delivery rate of the transmitter.\n5. Activate each transmitter in sequence, and have it charge the receivers it can see for the calculated amount of time.\n6. Repeat steps 1-5 until all receivers have been charged.\n\nThe key difference between this algorithm and the previous ones is that each transmitter operates independently, without knowledge of what receivers other transmitters see. By sorting the set of receivers by their power levels and attempting to charge them in order, we prioritize charging the receivers that need the most power first, regardless of whether they are visible to other transmitters or not. If a receiver is already being charged by another transmitter, we skip it and move on to the next one to avoid wasting power. By calculating the charging time for each transmitter based on the power levels of the receivers it can see, we can optimize the power delivery for each transmitter individually, without any coordination between transmitters. This algorithm can be used to maximize the overall charging time for all receivers while operating in a decentralized, independent manner.",
