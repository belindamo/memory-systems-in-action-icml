You can label the alarm \"Yoga Time!\"\n\n**Option 3: Habit-Tracking App**\n\n* Download a habit-tracking app like Habitica, HabitBull, or Loop Habit Tracker. Create a habit for \"Yoga\" and set the reminder for 6:30 pm, Monday to Friday.\n\n**Option 4: Physical Reminder**\n\n* Place a sticky note or a reminder card on your fridge, desk, or near your yoga mat to remind you to practice yoga at 6:30 pm.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Try to establish a pre-yoga routine to signal to your brain that it's time to practice. This could be as simple as making a cup of tea, changing into comfortable clothes, or doing some light stretching.\n* Consider setting a reminder 15-30 minutes before your yoga practice to give yourself time to wind down and prepare.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and don't hesitate to mix and match if needed!",
