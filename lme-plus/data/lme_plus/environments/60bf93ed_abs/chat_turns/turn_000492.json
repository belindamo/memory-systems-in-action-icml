  "content": "Yes, these technologies are being used in new construction projects and can also be applied to existing buildings. Retrofitting an existing building with seismic-resistant elements and technologies is a cost-effective way to make the structure more resilient to natural disasters. Engineers assess the condition of the building and recommend retrofitting measures based on the structure's needs. This can include adding steel braces or other energy dissipation devices, strengthening the existing foundation, or implementing base isolation technology. Retrofitting a building can improve its safety and extend its lifespan, providing added protection against natural disasters.",
