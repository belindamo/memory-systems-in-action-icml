Having a master sheet that provides a bird's-eye view of all your coupons and discounts, along with separate category-specific sheets, will give you the best of both worlds. You'll be able to:\n\n1. **Quickly scan** your master sheet to see what coupons and discounts are available across all categories.\n2. **Drill down** into specific categories to focus on the coupons and discounts that matter most to you.\n\nBy having separate sheets for each category, you can also:\n\n1. **Tailor your columns** to the specific needs of each category. For example, your grocery sheet might have columns for store, expiration date, and coupon type (e.g., digital, paper, or loyalty card), while your retail sheet might have columns for online codes, in-store promotions, and cashback offers.\n2. **Analyze category-specific trends** and patterns, helping you optimize your shopping habits and maximize your savings within each category.\n\nThe **Source Date** column will indeed help you refine your coupon hunting strategy by:\n\n1. **Identifying reliable sources**: You'll be able to see which websites, apps, or newsletters consistently provide the most valuable coupons and discounts.\n2. **Timing your searches**: By tracking when you find coupons and discounts, you can plan your searches around peak deal periods, like holidays or special events.\n3. **Optimizing your routine**: You might discover that certain days of the week or times of the month are better for finding deals, allowing you to adjust your coupon hunting schedule accordingly.\n\nRemember to regularly review and update your master sheet and category-specific sheets to ensure they remain relevant and effective in helping you save money.\n\nHow do you plan to organize your master sheet? Will you use filters, pivot tables, or conditional formatting to make it easy to scan and analyze your data?",
