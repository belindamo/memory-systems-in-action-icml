  "content": "That sounds like a wonderful setup! Yes, absolutely, it's a great idea to provide general care instructions for the zinnias. This will help your guests take good care of their new plants and ensure they thrive. Here are some suggestions on what to include in the care instructions:\n\n**Care Instructions for Zinnias:**\n\n1. **Watering:** Water your zinnia seedling when the top 1-2 inches of soil feels dry to the touch. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot. Water at the base of the plant to avoid getting water on the leaves.\n2. **Sunlight:** Zinnias love full sun to partial shade. Place your zinnia in a spot that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.\n3. **Soil:** Use a well-draining potting soil to prevent waterlogged soil. You can also fertilize your zinnia with a balanced fertilizer once a month.\n4. **Temperature:** Zinnias prefer warm temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C).\n5. **Pruning:** Pinch off the top set of leaves to encourage bushy growth. Remove any dead or dying flowers to promote more blooming.\n6. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.\n\nYou can print out these instructions on small cards or sheets and place them near the potting station. You could also consider creating a small handout with fun facts about zinnias, like their origin, growth habits, and benefits for pollinators.\n\nRemember to keep the instructions concise and easy to understand, so your guests can quickly absorb the information. You could also have a few examples of well-cared-for zinnias on display to inspire your guests and show them what their plants can look like with proper care.\n\nI think you're all set for a wonderful potting station! Your guests will appreciate the thought and care you've put into creating a fun and educational experience.",
