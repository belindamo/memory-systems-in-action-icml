  "content": "1. The chapter discusses previous work in the field of visual assistive technology, specifically focusing on head wear and smart cane devices.\n2. One head wear device described is a wearable travel aid for environment perception and navigation, which uses a consumer RGB-D camera, an IMU, a smartphone, and an earphone for commands and feedback. It can be used both indoors and outdoors, but has limitations in detecting small obstacles and does not have staircase detection capabilities.\n3. Another head wear device discussed is a real-time visual recognition system that converts results to 3D audio, using a portable camera, a server for image recognition processing, and wireless earphones for output. The system is able to conduct precise real-time object detection, but is limited in its detection range and can be blocked by surrounding ambient noise when using earbuds.\n4. Smart cane devices discussed include an electronic stick with ultrasonic sensors, GPS navigation, and cloud vision API capabilities, as well as a smart cane called WeWalk that has a touchpad for navigation, an ultrasound sensor for obstacle detection, and a built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Both smart cane devices have limitations, such as short coverage for obstacle detection or only being suitable for indoor use.",
