Easy to learn, but with enough depth for strategy. (2-5 players, 30-60 minutes)\n2. **Sushi Go!**: A fast-paced card game where players pick and pass cards to collect sets of sushi dishes. Simple to learn, but with a good level of strategy. (2-5 players, 15-30 minutes)\n3. **Qwirkle**: A tile-matching game where players try to create lines of matching colors and shapes. Easy to learn, but with a good level of challenge. (2-4 players, 30-45 minutes)\n4. **Codenames: Pictures**: If your cousins enjoyed Scrabble, they might enjoy this word-guessing game with a twist. Players try to identify words based on one-word clues given by their teammate. (4-8 players, 30-45 minutes)\n5. **Forbidden Island/Forbidden Desert**: A cooperative game where players work together to retrieve four treasures from an island/desert before it sinks/gets buried in sand. Exciting and challenging! (2-4 players, 20-30 minutes)\n\nAll of these games are great options for a family gathering, and they're easy to learn and teach. You can't go wrong with any of them!\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a game that you and your cousins will enjoy playing together. Have fun!",
