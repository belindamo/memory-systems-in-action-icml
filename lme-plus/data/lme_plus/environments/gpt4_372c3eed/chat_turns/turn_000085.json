Renting out the farm property can be a great way to generate income, but it's essential to understand the expenses involved. Here are some costs you should expect to incur, aside from property taxes:\n\n1. **Insurance**: You'll need to maintain liability insurance, property insurance, and potentially, rent loss insurance. Premiums will vary depending on the property's value, location, and other factors.\n2. **Maintenance and repairs**: As a landlord, you'll be responsible for maintaining the property, including the farmhouse, outbuildings, and equipment. Budget for regular repairs, replacements, and upkeep to keep the property in good condition.\n3. **Utilities**: You may need to pay for utilities such as electricity, water, and gas, depending on the rental agreement and the type of rental (e.g., full-time residence or vacation rental).\n4. **Property management fees**: If you hire a property management company to handle day-to-day tasks, such as finding tenants, collecting rent, and handling maintenance, you'll need to pay a management fee, typically a percentage of the monthly rent.\n5. **Advertising and marketing**: You may need to advertise the property to attract tenants, which can include costs for online listings, signage, and other promotional expenses.\n6. **Legal and accounting fees**: You may need to consult with an attorney to review rental agreements, handle disputes, or navigate local regulations. You may also need to hire an accountant to help with tax preparation and financial record-keeping.\n7. **Vacancy and turnover costs**: When the property is vacant, you'll still need to pay utilities, insurance, and other expenses. Additionally, you may need to budget for costs associated with preparing the property for new tenants, such as cleaning, painting, and minor repairs.\n8. **Equipment and tool maintenance**: If the property comes with equipment or tools, you'll need to budget for maintenance, repairs, or replacement costs to keep them in good working order.\n9. **Seasonal or specialized expenses**: Depending on the farm's specific needs, you may need to budget for seasonal expenses like snow removal, pest control, or specialized services like irrigation system maintenance.\n10. **Reserve fund**: It's a good idea to set aside a portion of the rental income for unexpected expenses, such as major repairs or replacements.\n\nThese expenses will vary depending on the specifics of your grandparents' farm, the type of rental agreement, and the local market. It's essential to create a detailed budget and regularly review your expenses to ensure you're accurately accounting for all the costs involved.\n\nAs for the storage unit costs, you're right that they're not zero! You may want to factor those expenses into your overall budget, especially if you plan to store items that are not essential to the farm's operation.",
