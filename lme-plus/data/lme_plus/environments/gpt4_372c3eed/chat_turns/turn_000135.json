For example:\n```\nTable name: PrimaryDrivers\n\nPrimary key: \n    VIN (string) - the VIN of the car associated with the primary driver\n\nSort key: \n    Timestamp (string) - the timestamp when the primary driver was registered or updated\n\nAttributes:\n    PolestarID (string) - the Polestar ID of the primary driver\n    System (string) - the system that made the update (POMS, PolestarID auth API, M2M auth API)\n    SystemName (string) - the name of the system that initiated the change (if applicable)\n    UserID (string) - the user ID of the person who made the update (if the change was made using Polestar ID auth API)\n    ClientID (string) - the client ID of the service that made the change (if the change was made using M2M auth API)\n    EventID (string) - the event ID that caused the change (if the update was based on an event)\n    EventTimestamp (string) - the timestamp when the event was emitted (if the update was based on an event)\n    OrderID (string) - the order ID from the event (if the primary driver was registered based on an event from POMS)\n    EndTimestamp (string) - the timestamp when the primary driver was removed (if applicable)\n```\nIn this updated model, the `SystemName` attribute stores the name of the system that initiated the change. This allows for tracking and recording of the source of the change, whether it was an event or an API request.",
