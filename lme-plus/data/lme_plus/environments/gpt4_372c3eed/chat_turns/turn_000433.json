I'll set up filters to quickly sort and narrow down the list by category, expiration date, or source, and then use conditional formatting to highlight important information like upcoming expiration dates or high-value discounts. That way, I can quickly identify the most valuable coupons and discounts and plan my shopping trips accordingly.\n\nBy the way, I just remembered that I used a 20% off coupon on a purchase of $50 or more at Target last week, which helped me save around $12 on a bunch of household essentials. I should add that to my master sheet so I can track my savings over time!",
