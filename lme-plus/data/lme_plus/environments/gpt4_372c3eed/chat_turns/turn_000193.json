  "content": "I've been thinking a lot about the themes of family dynamics and relationships, and I think I want to explore the idea of how our past experiences shape us and affect our current relationships. I've been inspired by the way the play \"The Glass Menagerie\" by Tennessee Williams uses memory and nostalgia to explore the complexities of family relationships. Do you think it would be helpful for me to read more plays that use non-linear storytelling or explore the power of memory and nostalgia?",
