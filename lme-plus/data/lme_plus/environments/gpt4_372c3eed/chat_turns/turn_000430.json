It's much easier to manage and review your coupons when they're grouped by category.\n\nAdding a **Received Date** column is an excellent idea as well. This will help you:\n\n1. **Track the age of the coupon**: You'll be able to see how long you've had the coupon and prioritize using the older ones before they expire.\n2. **Identify patterns**: You might notice patterns in when you receive certain types of coupons or discounts, helping you plan your shopping trips and budget accordingly.\n3. **Monitor coupon frequency**: By tracking the received date, you'll have a better understanding of how often you receive coupons from a particular vendor or category, which can influence your shopping decisions.\n\nSome other benefits of adding a **Received Date** column include:\n\n* You can set reminders or notifications when a coupon is approaching its expiration date or when it's been a certain amount of time since you received it.\n* You can analyze your coupon receipt patterns to identify opportunities to optimize your shopping habits and maximize your savings.\n* You'll have a better understanding of which coupons are consistently available and which ones are more rare or seasonal.\n\nConsider adding a **Source Date** column as well, which would track the date you found the coupon or discount, rather than the date you received it. This can help you identify the best sources for finding coupons and discounts.\n\nRemember to keep your column headers consistent across sheets, so it's easy to switch between categories and compare data. You can also use filters and sorting to make it easy to view and analyze your data.\n\nHow do you plan to set up your separate sheets? Will you have a master sheet that summarizes all your coupons, or will you focus on one category at a time?",
