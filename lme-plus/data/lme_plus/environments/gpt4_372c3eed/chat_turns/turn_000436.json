  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! Creating a separate sheet to track your savings over time will give you a clear picture of your progress and help you identify patterns or trends in your savings. The table with columns for date, coupon/discount, savings amount, and total savings will provide a detailed breakdown of your savings, and you can easily calculate metrics like total savings, average savings per month, and percentage of purchases made with coupons.\n\nA dashboard or summary sheet with charts and graphs will be a great way to visualize your savings progress and make it easy to track your goals. You can use conditional formatting to highlight milestones or achievements, like reaching a certain savings threshold or completing a certain number of coupon-redemption cycles.\n\nBy including cashback apps like Ibotta and Fetch Rewards in your master sheet, you'll be able to track your earnings from these sources and see how they contribute to your overall savings. You might consider adding columns to track the cashback amount, redemption date, and total earnings from each app.\n\nRemember to also consider tracking other sources of savings, such as:\n\n* Sales tax saved\n* Price matches or price adjustments\n* Store loyalty rewards\n* Manufacturer rebates\n\nBy tracking all these sources of savings, you'll get a comprehensive view of your overall savings and be able to optimize your shopping strategy to maximize your returns.\n\nHow do you plan to organize your cashback app tracking? Will you create separate sheets for each app, or integrate them into your master sheet with separate columns or tabs?",
