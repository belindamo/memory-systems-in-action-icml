  "content": "That's a great plan! Using filters and conditional formatting will make it easy to scan and analyze your data on the master sheet. By setting up filters, you'll be able to quickly sort and narrow down the list to focus on specific categories, expiration dates, or sources. And with conditional formatting, you can highlight important information like upcoming expiration dates or high-value discounts, making it easy to identify the most valuable coupons and discounts.\n\nIt's great that you're thinking about tracking your savings over time! Adding the 20% off coupon you used at Target to your master sheet is a great idea. You can create a separate column to track the savings amount or percentage, and then calculate the total savings over time. This will help you see the impact of your couponing efforts and stay motivated to continue finding and using coupons.\n\nRemember to also consider tracking other metrics, such as:\n\n* The total number of coupons used\n* The average savings per coupon\n* The total amount saved over a specific period (e.g., monthly, quarterly)\n* The percentage of purchases made with coupons\n\nBy tracking these metrics, you'll be able to see the bigger picture of your couponing efforts and make adjustments to optimize your strategy.\n\nIt's also a good idea to set reminders or notifications for when you need to restock or replenish your coupons, so you can plan ahead and avoid missing out on potential savings.\n\nHow do you plan to track your savings over time? Will you use a separate sheet or a dashboard to visualize your progress?",
