To do this, you can use the information that the user inputs, such as their income, credit score, and monthly expenses, to calculate their debt-to-income ratio and determine if they are eligible for a mortgage loan.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can add this feature to your real estate portal:\n\n1. Debt-to-Income Ratio Calculation: You can use the user's inputs to calculate their debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. The DTI ratio is a measure of how much of a person's income is going towards debt payments. To calculate the DTI ratio, you'll need to know the user's total monthly income, total monthly debt payments, and the maximum DTI ratio that is allowed for mortgage eligibility.\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python to calculate the DTI ratio:\n```python\ndef calculate_dti_ratio(monthly_income, monthly_debt, max_dti_ratio):\n    dti_ratio = monthly_debt / monthly_income\n    if dti_ratio > max_dti_ratio:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return True\n\nmonthly_income = 5000\nmonthly_debt = 1000\nmax_dti_ratio = 0.43\n\nis_eligible = calculate_dti_ratio(monthly_income, monthly_debt, max_dti_ratio)\nif is_eligible:\n    print(\"You are eligible for a mortgage loan.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are not eligible for a mortgage loan.\")\n```\n2. Loan Term Calculation: If the user is eligible for a mortgage loan, you can use the loan amount and interest rate to calculate the loan term, which is the number of years it will take to pay off the loan.\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python to calculate the loan term:\n```scss\ndef calculate_loan_term(loan_amount, interest_rate, monthly_payment):\n    r = interest_rate / 12\n    n = log(monthly_payment / (monthly_payment - r * loan_amount)) / log(1 + r)\n    loan_term = n / 12\n    return loan_term\n\nloan_amount = 100000\ninterest_rate = 0.05\nmonthly_payment = 500\n\nloan_term = calculate_loan_term(loan_amount, interest_rate, monthly_payment)\nprint(\"Loan Term:\", loan_term, \"years\")\n```\nThis is just a simple example, but you can use similar techniques to create a feature in your real estate portal that allows users to determine if they qualify for a mortgage and the length of payment.",
