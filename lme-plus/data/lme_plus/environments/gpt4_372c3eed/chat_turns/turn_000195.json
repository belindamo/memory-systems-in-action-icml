  "content": "I'm thinking of using a non-linear structure to explore the complexities of my characters' relationships. I want to jump back and forth between different moments in their past, showing how their experiences have shaped them and influenced their current relationships. I'm also considering using memory as a way to reveal character backstory and motivations, similar to how Tennessee Williams did in \"The Glass Menagerie\". I'm still figuring out the specifics, but I think this approach will help me create a more nuanced and emotionally resonant play.",
