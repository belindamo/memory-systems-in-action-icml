I'll make sure to print out the instructions on small cards and place them near the potting station. I might also consider adding a few fun facts about zinnias to make it more engaging. Thanks for the suggestion!\n\nBy the way, I was thinking of setting up a small photography area near the potting station where guests can take pictures of their potted zinnias. Do you think that's a good idea?",
