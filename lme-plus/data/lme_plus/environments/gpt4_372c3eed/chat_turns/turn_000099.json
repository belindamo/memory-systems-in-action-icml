The Donut Falls Trail has pit toilets available at the trailhead. The Silver Lake Trail has restrooms at the trailhead as well as parking and picnic areas nearby. The Mill Creek Canyon Trail has restrooms and picnic areas available at the starting point, as well as picnic tables and benches along the way. The Big Cottonwood Canyon Trail has a restroom and picnic area nearby, but it may require some walking to access them.
