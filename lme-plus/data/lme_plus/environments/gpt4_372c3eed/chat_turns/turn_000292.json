Could you please tell me:\n\n1. What time do you need to start your workday?\n2. How many meetings do you have scheduled for this afternoon, and what are their start and end times?\n3. Do you have any other tasks or work that you need to complete today, aside from the meetings?\n4. Are there any specific time slots when you're most productive or focused?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a schedule that fits in your walk, meetings, and other tasks, while also ensuring you get a good night's sleep.",
