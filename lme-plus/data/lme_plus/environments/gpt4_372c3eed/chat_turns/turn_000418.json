To resolve this error, you need to make sure that the \"eval\\_lambdas\" function is defined and in the current workspace. You can either define the function in the same script file where you're calling it, or you can call the function from another file in your project, by including the file with the function definition using the \"addpath\" command. Once you've added the function definition to the workspace, try running the code again.",
