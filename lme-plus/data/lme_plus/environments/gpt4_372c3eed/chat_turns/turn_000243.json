David was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"I'm sorry for not understanding you, Tommy,\" he said. \"I know I've been hard on you lately.\"\n\nTommy looked at his father with surprise. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nDavid hesitated for a moment before answering. \"I know I haven't been the best father. I've been so caught up in my own struggles that I haven't been there for you the way I should have.\"\n\nTommy felt a lump form in his throat. \"It's okay, Dad. I understand. It's not like I've been the easiest kid to deal with.\"\n\nDavid shook his head. \"No, Tommy. It's not okay. I should have been there for you. I should have been more understanding.\"\n\nThey walked in silence for a few more moments before David spoke again. \"Do you remember the time when you were in third grade and you came home crying because the other kids were making fun of you?\"\n\nTommy nodded. \"Yeah, I remember.\"\n\nDavid's voice was thick with emotion. \"I remember feeling so helpless. I didn't know how to help you. All I could do was hug you and tell you that everything would be okay. But I knew it wasn't enough.\"\n\nTommy put a hand on his father's shoulder. \"I know you did your best, Dad. And I appreciate it.\"\n\nDavid's eyes filled with tears. \"But it wasn't enough, Tommy. I should have done more. I should have been there for you.\"\n\nTommy felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes. \"It's okay, Dad. Really. I know you love me and you did what you could.\"\n\nDavid wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. \"I hope you know that I'm always here for you, Tommy. No matter what.\"\n\nTommy smiled at his father. \"I know, Dad. And I'm here for you, too.\"\n\nThey walked the rest of the way in silence, both lost in thought. Tommy realized that he and his dad were more alike than he had ever thought possible. They both had struggles and fears, and they both needed each other's support.\n\nAs they reached the house, David turned to Tommy. \"Thanks for walking with me, Tommy. It means a lot to me.\"\n\nTommy hugged his father. \"Anytime, Dad. I'm always here for you.\"",
