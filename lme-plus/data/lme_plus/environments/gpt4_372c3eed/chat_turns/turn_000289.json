I might even write a separate post about my favorite Vampire Weekend tracks now.\n\nAnd yeah, I'll definitely consider sharing my playlist on my blog or social media channels. That's a great idea! Do you think I should also share some behind-the-scenes stories or photos from the festival to make the review more engaging?",
