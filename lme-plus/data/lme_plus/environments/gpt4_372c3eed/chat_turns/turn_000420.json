  "content": "The error message suggests that the output of the `eval_lambdas` function is not a scalar logical value, which is what the `||` and `&&` operators expect. The output of the `eval_lambdas` function should be a scalar value, and it is unclear from the code snippet you provided what might be causing this error.\n\nOne potential source of the error is the calculation of `Jt`, which has several terms that involve `log` and `exp` functions. If any of these terms result in NaN (not a number) or Inf (infinity) values, then the overall result of `eval_lambdas` would not be a scalar. To address this issue, you may want to include checks for such values and handle them appropriately, for example by returning NaN or Inf for cases where the input is outside of the domain for which the function is defined.\n\nIt may also be helpful to examine the input values for `lambda`, `cc`, `wbar`, `fc`, `r`, and `y` to ensure that they are all within reasonable ranges and that there are no NaN or Inf values.",
