However, as an AI language model, I can provide you with some information on some of the most impressive graffiti works around the world.\n\nOne of the most famous graffiti works is probably the Berlin Wall, which was covered with graffiti art after its fall in 1989. The East Side Gallery, a 1.3 kilometer stretch of the original Berlin Wall, is now a major tourist attraction that showcases over 100 colorful murals by graffiti artists from all over the world.\n\nIn New York City, the former industrial neighborhood of Bushwick in Brooklyn has become an open-air gallery that showcases an impressive collection of street art and graffiti. Bushwick is now widely regarded as one of the most significant centers for street art in the world, with murals ranging from political statements to colorful abstract designs.\n\nIn Australia, the artist Matt Adnate has gained recognition for his impressive portraits of indigenous Australians that adorn building walls in many cities across the country.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many impressive and inspiring graffiti works that can be found in cities around the world.",
