  "content": "The Primary Driver module sounds like it is a useful tool for tracking and managing the primary drivers of cars in the Polestar system. By listening to events from the Order Management System and storing relevant information, the service can provide an up-to-date and comprehensive view of primary drivers and their associated cars.\n\nThe ability to authenticate using both M2M and Polestar ID authentication methods also adds flexibility and security to the service. The inclusion of a history for primary drivers allows for tracking of changes and provides useful information for replay purposes.\n\nOverall, the Primary Driver module seems like a well-designed and useful component of the Vehicle Owner and User Management service.",
