I've got just the thing for you - a classic recipe that uses common pantry staples: **Peanut Butter Cookies**!\n\nThese chewy, nutty cookies are a crowd-pleaser, and you likely have most of the ingredients already in your pantry. Here's what you'll need:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon baking soda\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 cup peanut butter (creamy or crunchy, whichever you prefer)\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/4 cup brown sugar\n* 2 large eggs\n* Optional: chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or sea salt for added flavor\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.\n3. In a large bowl, cream together the peanut butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth.\n4. Beat in the eggs until well combined.\n5. Gradually mix in the flour mixture until a dough forms.\n6. If desired, stir in chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or a sprinkle of sea salt for added flavor.\n7. Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie.\n8. Flatten the dough balls slightly with a fork or your fingers.\n9. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden.\n10. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nThat's it! You'll have a batch of delicious peanut butter cookies in no time. You can store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.\n\nThese cookies are perfect for a quick dessert, and they pair well with a variety of pasta dishes, including your Spaghetti Aglio e Olio.
