Look for experience: Look for a real estate agent who has several years of experience and a history of successful sales in the area where you're looking to buy or sell. 2. Check credentials: Make sure the agent is licensed, accredited, and has no history of disciplinary actions or complaints. 3. Ask for referrals: Ask friends, family, and colleagues who have recently bought or sold a property for their recommendations. They may have worked with an agent they trust and who is a good fit for you as well. 4. Research online reviews: Online reviews can be a great way to get insights into an agent's professionalism, communication skills, and negotiation abilities. 5. Interview potential agents: Schedule meetings or phone calls with the agents you are considering to get a better sense of their communication style, approach, and expertise. Remember, finding a trustworthy real estate agent is crucial in any transaction involving large sums of money. Take the time to research and choose an agent who you feel confident will represent your interests and help you achieve your real estate goals.",
