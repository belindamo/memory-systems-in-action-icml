But now, after going back in time and seeing what his dad went through, he realizes that they share a lot of the same struggles.\n\nDavid nods, a small smile forming on his lips. \"I always knew you were a special kid, Tommy. I'm glad you're starting to see it too.\"\n\nTommy smiles back, feeling a warmth in his chest. \"Thanks, Dad,\" he says. \"I really appreciate you sharing your story with me. It means a lot.\"\n\nThey walk a little further in silence, both lost in thought. Eventually, David speaks up. \"You know, Tommy, it's okay to not have it all figured out. I don't either.\"\n\nTommy looks at his dad, surprised. \"What do you mean?\" he asks.\n\nDavid chuckles. \"I may be successful in some areas, but I'm still figuring things out in others. It's a process, and it takes time. Just don't be too hard on yourself.\"\n\nTommy nods, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. He had always felt like he had to have everything figured out, but now he realizes that it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nAs they walk, they continue to talk about their shared experiences and struggles. Tommy feels a sense of closeness and connection with his dad that he never thought was possible. He realizes that while their experiences may be different, they both understand what it's like to feel alone and misunderstood.\n\nAs they head back home, Tommy feels a newfound sense of empathy and appreciation for his dad. He knows that they still have their own struggles to face, but he also knows that they can face them together.",
