  "content": "Taboo and Deception are both excellent choices for a coworker game night. Here's more information on gameplay time and suitability for a large group:\n\n**Taboo**\n\n* **Playtime:** 30-60 minutes\n* **Number of players:** 4-12 players (best with 6-8 players)\n* **Ease of learning:** Very easy to learn, even for non-gamers\n* **Gameplay:** Divide players into two teams. One player from each team describes a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases. Their teammates try to guess the word. The team that guesses the most words correctly wins.\n\nTaboo is a classic party game that's perfect for a large group. You can easily divide your group of 8-10 coworkers into two teams and have a blast playing together. The game is easy to learn, and the gameplay is fast-paced and engaging.\n\n**Deception**\n\n* **Playtime:** 20-40 minutes\n* **Number of players:** 4-12 players (best with 6-8 players)\n* **Ease of learning:** Easy to learn, but requires some strategic thinking\n* **Gameplay:** One player takes on the role of the Investigator, while the others play as Witnesses. The Witnesses know the identity of the Culprit, but the Investigator doesn't. The Witnesses give clues to help the Investigator figure out who the Culprit is, but the Culprit tries to mislead the Investigator.\n\nDeception is a great game for a large group, and it's easy to learn, but it does require some strategic thinking. You can divide your group into two teams, with one team playing as the Witnesses and the other as the Investigator. The game is relatively short, and you can play multiple rounds to keep things exciting.\n\nFor a group of 8-10 coworkers, I'd recommend dividing into two teams of 4-5 players each. This will ensure everyone gets to participate and have fun.\n\nBoth games are great choices for a coworker game night, and they're easy to learn and play. You can't go wrong with either one! If you want to mix things up, you could also consider playing a few rounds of Taboo, followed by a few rounds of Deception, or vice versa. This will give your coworkers a chance to experience both games and have a blast together.",
