Allocating more time to work on the report in the morning can help you make more progress and reduce the pressure in the evening.\n\nHere's an updated schedule:\n\n**9:00 am - 12:30 pm**: Work on the report (3.5 hours)\nUse the morning to focus on the report and make significant progress.\n\n**12:30 pm - 2:00 pm**: Lunch break and 30-minute walk\nTake a longer lunch break to fit in your 30-minute walk and grab a bite to eat.\n\n**2:00 pm - 3:00 pm**: Break and preparation for meetings (1 hour)\nTake some time to relax, recharge, and prepare for your meetings.\n\n**3:00 pm - 4:00 pm**: Meeting 1\nAttend your first meeting, and take notes or follow up on any tasks.\n\n**4:00 pm - 5:00 pm**: Break and report work (1 hour)\nUse this time to review your report progress and make any necessary adjustments.\n\n**5:00 pm - 6:00 pm**: Meeting 2\nAttend your second meeting, and again, take notes or follow up on any tasks.\n\n**6:00 pm - 7:00 pm**: Finish report and wrap up work (1 hour)\nUse this final hour to complete the report and tie up any loose ends.\n\n**7:00 pm - 11:30 pm**: Free time and relaxation\nYou've earned it! Take some time to unwind, have dinner, and relax before getting a good night's sleep.\n\nThis revised schedule allows you to allocate more time to the report in the morning, fit in your walk during lunch, and still have a manageable amount of time to complete the report in the evening.",
