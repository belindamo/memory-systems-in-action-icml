Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**14k Gold:**\n\n1. **Durability**: 14k gold is a more durable option, making it suitable for everyday wear. It's less prone to scratches and corrosion.\n2. **Affordability**: 14k gold is generally less expensive than 18k gold, making it a more budget-friendly option.\n3. **Strength**: 14k gold is stronger and more resistant to bending or warping.\n\n**18k Gold:**\n\n1. **Purity**: 18k gold is a higher-karat gold, meaning it contains a higher percentage of pure gold (75% vs 58.3% in 14k gold).\n2. **Appearance**: 18k gold has a richer, warmer tone and a more luxurious feel.\n3. **Hypoallergenic**: 18k gold is considered hypoallergenic, making it a great option for those with sensitive skin.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n1. Do you prefer a stronger, more durable gold or a higher-karat gold with a richer tone?\n2. Are you looking for a more affordable option or are you willing to invest in a higher-quality gold?\n3. Do you have sensitive skin, or are you looking for a hypoallergenic option?\n\nIf you want a stronger, more durable gold that's suitable for everyday wear, 14k gold might be the better choice. However, if you prefer a higher-karat gold with a richer tone and are willing to invest in a higher-quality material, 18k gold could be the way to go.\n\nBoth Mejuri and Aurate offer beautiful gold bar necklaces in both 14k and 18k gold, so you can't go wrong either way!",
