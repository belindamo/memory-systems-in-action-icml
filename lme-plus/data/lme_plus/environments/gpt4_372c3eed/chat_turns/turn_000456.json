  "content": "I think that music streaming services could do more to promote lesser-known artists and give them greater exposure. here are some possible ways they could achieve this:\n\n1. algorithms: streaming services could tailor their algorithms to recommend more new and emerging artists to listeners. this could give lesser-known artists more opportunities for exposure and help boost their visibility, without accommodating established artists or generic popular music.\n\n2. featured playlists: curated playlists are a popular feature of music streaming services. streaming services could create more playlists that highlight lesser-known artists, alongside the playlists featuring mainstream or established artists.\n\n3. brand collaborations: streaming services could collaborate with upcoming brands and incline new artists to offer content, including playlists and guest spots on podcasts. these collaborations could work to bring together exclusive artist performances, video releases or featured music for a limited time to promote lesser-known artists to new audiences.\n\n4. fostering community: streaming services could create communities and give more tools and resources to promote indie and underground artists in this community, making it easier for listeners to discover new, up-and-coming artists.\n\nby offering more opportunities for exposure and highlighting lesser-known artists, music streaming services can create a more diverse and vibrant music scene, which ultimately benefits the artists as well as the listeners.",
