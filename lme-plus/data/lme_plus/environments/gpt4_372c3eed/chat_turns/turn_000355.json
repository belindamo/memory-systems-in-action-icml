  "content": "Absolutely. While gene editing offers tremendous potential for improving human health and well-being, it should always be done in an ethical and responsible manner. We need to ensure that its potential benefits are equitably distributed and that it does not create new social or genetic inequalities, that it is safe, and that it respects basic human rights and values. Therefore, we must continue to have thoughtful discussion, engage with stakeholders, and establish appropriate governance systems to ensure that gene editing technologies are developed and used ethically and effectively.",
