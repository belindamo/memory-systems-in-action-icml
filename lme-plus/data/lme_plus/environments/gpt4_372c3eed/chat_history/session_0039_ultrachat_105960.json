      "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide the following information on this topic.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that parental involvement and mediation can reduce sibling rivalry in families with multiple children of the same gender. Studies have shown that when parents actively seek to understand and address the root causes of sibling rivalry, they can help their children learn to get along better.\n\nOne effective strategy is for parents to encourage their children to talk openly and honestly about their feelings and concerns. This can help to defuse tensions and facilitate better communication between siblings. Parents can also promote positive interactions and teamwork by providing opportunities for their children to engage in joint activities and projects.\n\nAdditionally, parents can help to prevent sibling rivalry by treating their children equally, refraining from favoritism, and avoiding comparisons between siblings. They can also work to establish clear family rules and consequences for negative behaviors, and help their children learn conflict resolution skills.\n\nWhile there are no guarantees that parental involvement and mediation will completely eliminate sibling rivalry in families with multiple children of the same gender, research suggests that these strategies can help to reduce it and create a more harmonious family environment."

Give them some time to gather their thoughts.\n\n5. Respect their privacy: Allow your kids to share their thoughts or feelings with you when they are ready. Respect that they might not want to discuss everything with you and give them privacy.\n\n6. Model sharing: Share your own experiences, frustrations, and emotions with your kids.

      "content": "The time it takes for these strategies to have an effect on reducing sibling rivalry will depend on your children's age, personalities, and the intensity of their conflicts. These strategies are practical but require patience, consistency, and time to show significant changes in sibling rivalry. Implementing these strategies can set a positive tone for communication and interactions, but it is not a quick fix. \n\nIt is vital to remember that children gradually learn to work with each other and manage rivalries. But as they mature, parents can provide them with the tools necessary to communicate more effectively and handle conflicts positively. \n\nIt is essential to remain consistent, enforce family rules, and show unconditional love and support no matter what happens. The goal is to support a supportive environment that encourages healthy interactions and positive sharing between siblings. Don't expect immediate results but be patient and persistent, and the reward will be a network of loving and supportive siblings."
