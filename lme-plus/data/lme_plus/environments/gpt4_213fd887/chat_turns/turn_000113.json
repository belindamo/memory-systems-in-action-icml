  "content": "To create a suitable schema for storing the data in a normalized form, we need to first analyze the spreadsheet data and identify the functional dependencies among the attributes. Based on this analysis, we can decompose the data into tables, each table representing a single entity or relationship, and ensuring that each table is in 2NF or 3NF.\n\nAfter analyzing the given data, we can identify the following entities and relationships:\n\n* Patient\n* Doctor\n* Appointment\n* Condition\n* Medication\n* Allergy\n\nThe following schema shows the tables, fields, primary keys, foreign keys, and any additional assumptions made or fields added to the design:\n\n1. Patient Table\n* PatientID (Primary Key)\n* Name\n* Address\n* DateOfBirth\n* PhoneNumber\n2. Doctor Table\n* DoctorID (Primary Key)\n* Name\n* Specialization\n3. Appointment Table\n* AppointmentID (Primary Key)\n* AppointmentDate\n* PatientID (Foreign Key references Patient Table)\n* DoctorID (Foreign Key references Doctor Table)\n4. Condition Table\n* ConditionID (Primary Key)\n* ConditionName\n5. Medication Table\n* MedicationID (Primary Key)\n* MedicationName\n6. Allergy Table\n* AllergyID (Primary Key)\n* AllergyName\n7. PatientCondition Table (Association Table between Patient and Condition)\n* PatientID (Foreign Key references Patient Table)\n* ConditionID (Foreign Key references Condition Table)\n* DateDiagnosed\n8. PatientMedication Table (Association Table between Patient and Medication)\n* PatientID (Foreign Key references Patient Table)\n* MedicationID (Foreign Key references Medication Table)\n* PrescriptionDate\n9. PatientAllergy Table (Association Table between Patient and Allergy)\n* PatientID (Foreign Key references Patient Table)\n* AllergyID (Foreign Key references Allergy Table)\n\nAssumptions Made:\n\n* Each patient has only one phone number.\n* Each doctor has only one specialization.\n* A patient can have multiple conditions, medications, and allergies.\n* A patient can be prescribed multiple medications for different conditions.\n* An appointment can only be associated with one patient and one doctor.\n* Each condition, medication, and allergy has a unique name.\n\nThe schema diagram for the designed database is shown below:\n\n![Doctor's Surgery Schema Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/vaLDMYP.png)\n\nOverall, this schema design is in 3NF because each table contains only non-transitive dependencies, and all the attributes in each table depend only on the primary key.",
