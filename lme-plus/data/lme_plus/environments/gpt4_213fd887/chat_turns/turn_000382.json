  "content": "Yeah, I think my favorite Q&A session was with the cast of \"Minari\". They were all so down-to-earth and passionate about the film, and it was great to hear their thoughts on the making of the film and the themes they explored. As for themes, I think what struck me most was the focus on identity and community in many of the films I watched. It's something that I think is really relevant right now, and it was interesting to see how different filmmakers approached the topic in their own unique ways.",
