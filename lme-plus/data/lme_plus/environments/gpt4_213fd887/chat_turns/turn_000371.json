  "content": "That sounds like a great event! Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have have access to real-time information about specific books or authors, especially if they are local or debut authors. I'm not aware of a book called \"The Art of Falling\" by a specific author. However, I'm happy to help you generate questions or discussion topics to ask the author during the Q&A session!\n\nSince you're attending the book launch, you might want to prepare some questions to ask the author. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n* What inspired you to write \"The Art of Falling\", and what do you hope readers take away from the story?\n* Can you tell us about your writing process, and how you approached crafting the characters and plot?\n* What was the most challenging part of writing your debut novel, and how did you overcome any obstacles?\n* How does the book's setting influence the story, and what role does the local community play in the narrative?\n* What's next for you as an author? Are you working on a new project, and can you give us a sneak peek?\n\nFeel free to modify or add to these questions based on your interests and the book's subject matter. Enjoy the event, and I hope you get to ask some great questions!",
