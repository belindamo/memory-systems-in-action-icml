  "content": "Integrating a 2-dimensional function using Monte Carlo integration is similar to integrating a 1-dimensional function. The main difference is that instead of generating a single random number within the integration bounds, two random numbers are generated to represent the x and y coordinates of the points within the region of integration.\n\nHere's an example of how this could be implemented in Python:\n```\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, y):\n    # function to integrate\n    return math.exp(-x*x/2 - y*y/2)\n\ndef monte_carlo_integration(a, b, c, d, n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        x = random.uniform(a, b)\n        y = random.uniform(c, d)\n        total += f(x, y)\n    estimate = total / n * (b - a) * (d - c)\n    return estimate\n\na = -3 # lower bound of x\nb = 3 # upper bound of x\nc = -3 # lower bound of y\nd = 3 # upper bound of y\nn = 10000 # number of random points\nestimate = monte_carlo_integration(a, b, c, d, n)\nprint(\"Estimate of the definite integral of f(x, y) from \", a, \" to \", b,\" and \",c,\" to \",d,\": \", estimate)\n```\nThis code will approximate the definite integral of f(x, y) = e^(-x^2/2 - y^2/2) from -3 to 3 in x and from -3 to 3 in y using 10000 random points. The function `monte_carlo_integration` takes 5 arguments: the lower bound of integration for x and y, upper bound of integration for x and y and number of random points. It returns the estimated value of the definite integral.\n\nAs with the 1-dimensional case, keep in mind that this is just an approximation, and the error in the approximation will decrease as the number of samples increases.\n\nAlso, you can use the same approach to estimate the uncertainty in the integral as in the 1D case, by keeping track of the total and total square of the function values and calculate variance and standard deviation.",
