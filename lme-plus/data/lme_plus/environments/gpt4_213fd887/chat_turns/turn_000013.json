Here are some methods you can try:\n\n**Immediate Action**\n\n1. **Act fast**: The sooner you treat the stain, the better. Coffee can permanently bond with fabric if it's left to sit, making it harder to remove.\n2. **Blot, don't rub**: Gently blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to remove excess coffee. Avoid rubbing, as this can push the stain deeper into the fabric.\n\n**Removal Methods**\n\n1. **Cold water**: Run cold water over the back of the stain to flush out as much of the coffee as possible.\n2. **White vinegar**: Dilute white vinegar with water (1 part vinegar to 2 parts water), and apply it to the stain. Let it sit for about 10 minutes, then rinse with cold water and blot dry.\n3. **Baking soda**: Make a paste with 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of cold water. Apply the paste to the stain, let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour, then rinse with cold water and blot dry.\n4. **Hydrogen peroxide**: Apply hydrogen peroxide directly to the stain, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then rinse with cold water and blot dry.\n5. **Stain remover**: If the above methods don't work, try using a commercial stain remover like OxiClean, Shout, or Clorox 2. Follow the product instructions and test a small area of the fabric first.\n6. **Laundry detergent**: Apply a small amount of laundry detergent directly to the stain, rub gently, and then wash the shirt in cold water.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* If the stain has already set, try soaking the shirt in cold water with a laundry detergent specifically designed for removing protein-based stains (like coffee).\n* Avoid using hot water, as it can set the stain and make it harder to remove.\n* Don't use bleach, as it can damage or discolor certain fabrics.\n* If the stain is particularly stubborn, repeat the removal method a few times before washing the shirt.\n\nI hope these tips help you remove the coffee stain from your shirt!",
