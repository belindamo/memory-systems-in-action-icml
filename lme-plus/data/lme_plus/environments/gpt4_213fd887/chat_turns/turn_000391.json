  "content": "One example of how psychology has influenced public policies related to mental health is through the passage of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) in the United States. This law requires insurance companies to provide equal coverage for mental health and addiction treatment as they do for physical health issues.\n\nPsychological research played a significant role in showing that mental health and substance abuse treatment are critical components of overall health, and that providing services for these issues can improve individuals' overall health outcomes.\n\nAs a result, policymakers recognized the need to address the disparities in coverage for these issues and created the MHPAEA to ensure equal access to mental health and addiction treatment services. This law has helped to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health concerns and has made it easier for individuals struggling with mental illness and addiction to access the care they need.",
