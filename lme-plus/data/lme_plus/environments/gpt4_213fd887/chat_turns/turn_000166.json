Here are some exercises to help you enhance your serve:\n\n**Upper Body Strength:**\n\n1. **Shoulder Rotations:** Hold a light weight (2-3 lbs) or a resistance band in both hands. Rotate your shoulders in a circular motion, first clockwise and then counterclockwise. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n2. **Lateral Raises:** Hold dumbbells or a resistance band at shoulder height. Raise the weights out to the sides until they're at shoulder level. Lower them back down and repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n3. **Tricep Dips:** Using a chair, bench, or tricep dip machine, lower your body by bending your elbows until your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n\n**Core Strength:**\n\n1. **Plank:** Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds.
