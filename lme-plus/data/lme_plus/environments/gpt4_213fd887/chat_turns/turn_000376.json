  "content": "I'm looking for some recommendations on cinematographers to follow on social media. I recently watched \"Minari\" during the Sundance Film Festival's online program, which I participated in from January 20th to 30th, and I was really impressed by the cinematography. By the way, I also watched 5 documentaries and 3 feature films, and attended two online Q&A sessions during the festival. Do you have any suggestions?",
