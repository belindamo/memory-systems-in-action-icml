  "content": "Having a separate sheet for each event is a great way to organize your data. To calculate the total profit for all events, you can use a summary sheet that consolidates the profit data from each event sheet.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n**Event Sheets:**\n\n* Create a separate sheet for each event, e.g., \"Spring Fling Market\", \"Summer Fest\", \"Holiday Bazaar\", etc.\n* In each event sheet, set up columns for Sales, Expenses, and Profit, as I mentioned earlier.\n* Calculate the Profit for each event by subtracting the Total Expenses from the Total Sales.\n\n**Summary Sheet:**\n\n* Create a new sheet, e.g., \"Event Summary\" or \"Profit Summary\".\n* In this sheet, create a table with the following columns:\n\t+ Event Name\n\t+ Profit\n* Use formulas to link to the Profit column in each event sheet, e.g.:\n\t=Spring Fling Market!D2 (assuming the Profit column is in column D)\n\t=Summer Fest!D2\n\t=Holiday Bazaar!D2\n* In the next column, calculate the Total Profit by summing up the profit from each event, e.g.:\n\t=SUM(B2:B4) (assuming the profit values are in cells B2, B3, and B4)\n\nThis way, you can easily see the profit for each event and the total profit for all events.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more dynamic approach using named ranges or tables. For example:\n\n**Event Sheets:**\n\n* Create a named range or table for the Profit column in each event sheet, e.g., \"SpringFlingProfit\", \"SummerFestProfit\", etc.\n* Use these named ranges in your Summary sheet to calculate the Total Profit, e.g.:\n\t=SUM(SpringFlingProfit, SummerFestProfit, HolidayBazaarProfit)\n\nThis approach makes it easy to add or remove events without having to update the formulas.\n\nRemember to update your formulas accordingly based on the structure of your spreadsheet and the location of your data.",
