  "content": "Yes, here is a recommendation for a kaszanka-making cooking class in Pomerania:\n\n1. The Ethnographic Museum in Pomerania offers a workshop on making kaszanka, a traditional Polish sausage made with pork blood and buckwheat groats. During the workshop, you will learn about the history and cultural significance of kaszanka, as well as the preparation and cooking process. \n\nThe workshop takes about 3.5 hours and costs around 160 PLN per person. You can register for the workshop on their website or by contacting them directly. \n\nAlternatively, you may also want to check with other cooking schools or community centers in the area to see if they offer classes on kaszanka-making or traditional Pomeranian cuisine as well.",
