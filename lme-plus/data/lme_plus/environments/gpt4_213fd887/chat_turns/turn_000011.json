  "content": "The Lemon-Herb Marinade will pair beautifully with the roasted sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts.\n\nAdding crunch to your quinoa bowl is a great idea, and nuts or seeds are perfect for the job. Here are some suggestions that will complement your flavors:\n\n1. **Toasted Pumpkin Seeds**: Pumpkin seeds have a nutty flavor and a satisfying crunch. Simply toast them in a dry pan over medium heat for a few minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned.\n2. **Chopped Almonds**: Sliced or slivered almonds add a nice crunch and a touch of nutty flavor. You can toast them lightly in a dry pan or oven to enhance their flavor.\n3. **Roasted Chickpeas**: Rinse and dry a can of chickpeas, then toss with olive oil and your favorite spices (e.g., cumin, paprika, salt). Roast in the oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for about 30-40 minutes, or until crispy.\n4. **Sesame Seeds**: Sesame seeds have a nutty flavor and a satisfying crunch. Sprinkle them over your quinoa bowl for added texture and flavor.\n5. **Crunchy Fried Shallots**: Thinly slice shallots and separate them into rings. Dredge in flour, shaking off excess, then fry in hot oil until crispy and golden. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle over your quinoa bowl.\n\nThese crunchy elements will add texture and interest to your quinoa bowl, complementing the flavors of the Lemon-Herb chicken, roasted sweet potatoes, and Brussels sprouts.\n\nRemember, you can always adjust the amount of crunch to your liking, and feel free to mix and match different nuts, seeds, or crunchy elements to create the perfect combination for your taste buds!",
