I'll search for appraisers who specialize in sports memorabilia or figurines and see what they have to say. Thanks for the advice! By the way, I'm really proud of my Funko Pop collection, I have 15 of them displayed on a shelf I got from IKEA for $30, which has separate compartments to arrange them by series.",
