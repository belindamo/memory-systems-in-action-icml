  "content": "To improve the management of patient information, the doctor's surgery in Newtown is considering moving their appointments details from a spreadsheet-based system to a relational database. Currently, the surgery maintains a spreadsheet containing the patient's name, address, date of birth, phone number, registered doctors, recent condition, known allergies, current medication, and appointment details.\n\nIn the existing system, each doctor can be registered to more than one patient, and each patient can have more than one registered doctor. Moreover, a patient can be seen by a doctor who is not their registered doctor. The known allergies and current medication columns are empty unless the doctor fills them. An appointment cannot exist without a patient or doctor.\n\nBy moving to a relational database, the surgery can improve the organization, accuracy, and accessibility of patient information. They can also simplify the process of managing appointments, medication, and allergies. In the next sections, we will explore the benefits of using a relational database and discuss the database schema for the doctor's surgery in Newtown.",
