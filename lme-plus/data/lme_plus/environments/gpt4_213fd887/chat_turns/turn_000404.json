  "content": "I'm so excited to get started on planning my party! I think I'll create a mix of easy and challenging trivia questions to cater to different levels of financial knowledge. And for the Vision Board Scavenger Hunt, I'll make sure to create clues that are clever and related to financial freedom, like \"Find the board that's 'invested' in a bright future\" or \"Discover the vision board that's 'budgeting' for a dream vacation.\"\n\nI'll also consider dividing the guests into teams to make it more collaborative and fun. This will definitely encourage people to mingle and interact with each other, which is perfect for a celebratory party like this. Thanks again for all your help and ideas!",
