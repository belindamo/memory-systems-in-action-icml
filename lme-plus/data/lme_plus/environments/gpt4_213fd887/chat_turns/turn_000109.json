I'm impressed! \n\nAs a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or a physical garden, but I can certainly provide information on companion planting with tomatoes.\n\nCompanion planting is a fantastic way to create a harmonious and balanced garden ecosystem. By planting certain vegetables, herbs, or flowers alongside tomatoes, you can:\n\n1. **Repel pests**: Certain plants, like basil, mint, and marigolds, have natural oils that repel pests that target tomatoes, such as whiteflies, aphids, and nematodes.\n2. **Improve growth**: Some plants, like borage and nasturtium, release chemicals that promote healthy growth, increase fruit production, and enhance flavor.\n3. **Enhance soil health**: Legumes, like beans and peas, fix nitrogen in the soil, making it available to tomatoes and other plants.\n4. **Provide shade**: Larger plants, like sunflowers, can provide shade for tomato plants, reducing soil temperature and retaining moisture.\n5. **Attract beneficial insects**: Flowers like calendula and cosmos attract beneficial insects, like bees and butterflies, which pollinate tomatoes.\n\nSome popular companion plants for tomatoes include:\n\n* Basil: Repels pests, improves flavor, and adds nutrients to the soil.\n* Marigolds: Repels nematodes, whiteflies, and other pests.\n* Borage: Attracts beneficial insects, improves growth, and adds nutrients.\n* Chives: Repels aphids and other pests, adds nutrients to the soil.\n* Oregano: Repels pests, improves growth, and adds antioxidants to the soil.\n\nRemember to plant companion plants according to their growing requirements and space needs. Also, keep in mind that some plants, like members of the Brassica family (broccoli, kale, etc.), can inhibit tomato growth, so it's essential to research compatible companions.\n\nYou're doing great with your gardening journey! Keep up the good work, and happy gardening!",
