It's always exciting to explore the value of your collectibles, and I'm sure you'll find an appraiser who can help you determine the value of your NBA figurines.\n\nAnd, ah, your Funko Pop collection sounds amazing! 15 Funko Pops displayed on a shelf with separate compartments is a great way to showcase your collection. IKEA is a great resource for affordable and functional display solutions. It's awesome that you're proud of your collection, and you should be! Collecting is all about enjoying the thrill of the hunt, the joy of ownership, and the sense of community with fellow collectors.\n\nRemember to handle your Funko Pops with care, as they can be delicate. You might consider dusting them gently with a soft cloth and avoiding direct sunlight to preserve their condition. And, of course, keep an eye out for any rare or limited edition Funko Pops to add to your collection!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance on appraising your collectibles, feel free to ask. I'm always here to help. Happy collecting, and I hope you continue to enjoy your Sgt. Pepper's album, NBA figurines, and Funko Pop collection!",
