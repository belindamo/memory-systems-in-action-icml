You can create a \"Wholesale Leads\" or \"Potential Partners\" sheet to keep track of:\n\n* Contact information: name, email, phone number, store name, etc.\n* Initial contact date and method (e.g., Spring Fling Market)\n* Notes on conversations or meetings, including dates and topics discussed\n* Follow-up tasks and deadlines (e.g., sending product samples or proposals)\n* Status updates (e.g., interested, pending, declined)\n\nThis sheet can help you:\n\n* Keep track of multiple leads and conversations simultaneously\n* Remember important details and follow-up tasks\n* Analyze the progress and potential of each lead\n* Identify patterns or areas for improvement in your outreach efforts\n\nYou can also consider adding columns to track:\n\n* Product interest: which specific products they're interested in, and in what quantities\n* Pricing and terms: any discussions or agreements on wholesale pricing, payment terms, or other logistical details\n* Next steps: what you need to do to move the conversation forward (e.g., send a contract, provide product samples)\n\nHaving a dedicated sheet for wholesale leads will help you stay organized, focused, and proactive in building relationships with potential partners. Good luck with your follow-up with the boutique owner, and I hope it leads to a successful partnership!",
