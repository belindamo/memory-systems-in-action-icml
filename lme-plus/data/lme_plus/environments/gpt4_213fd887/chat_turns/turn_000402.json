  "content": "I think I'll go with the Financial Freedom Trivia and the Vision Board Scavenger Hunt. Those sound like a lot of fun and really tie in with the theme. For the trivia game, I can create questions that are challenging but not too difficult, and offer small prizes for the winners. And for the scavenger hunt, I can hide the vision boards in creative spots around the restaurant and give clues that are related to financial freedom. That way, guests will have to think creatively and work together to find all the boards. Thanks for the ideas!",
