I'd be happy to help you get started.\n\nTo set up your spreadsheet, let's break down the different sections and columns you might need:\n\n**Sales Tracking:**\n\n* **Date**: The date of the event or sale\n* **Item**: The type of item sold (e.g., necklace, earrings, candle, etc.)\n* **Quantity**: The number of items sold\n* **Price**: The sale price of each item\n* **Total**: The total amount earned from each sale (Quantity x Price)\n* **Category**: A category for the item (e.g., jewelry, candles, etc.)\n\n**Expenses:**\n\n* **Date**: The date the expense was incurred\n* **Category**: The type of expense (e.g., materials, booth rental, marketing, etc.)\n* **Description**: A brief description of the expense\n* **Cost**: The amount of the expense\n* **Total**: The total amount of expenses for each category\n\n**Event Summary:**\n\n* **Event Name**: The name of the event (e.g., Spring Fling Market)\n* **Date**: The date of the event\n* **Total Sales**: The total amount earned from sales during the event\n* **Total Expenses**: The total amount of expenses incurred for the event\n* **Profit**: The profit earned from the event (Total Sales - Total Expenses)\n\nYou can set up your spreadsheet with separate sheets for Sales, Expenses, and Event Summary.
