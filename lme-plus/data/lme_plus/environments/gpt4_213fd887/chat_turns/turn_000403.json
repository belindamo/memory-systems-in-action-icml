  "content": "You're welcome! I'm thrilled that you found some ideas that fit perfectly with your party theme. Financial Freedom Trivia and Vision Board Scavenger Hunt are great choices to keep your guests engaged and entertained. By offering small prizes for the trivia game, you'll add an extra layer of excitement and motivation. And, by hiding the vision boards in creative spots, you'll encourage guests to work together, think creatively, and have fun while exploring the restaurant.\n\nRemember to keep the trivia questions challenging but not too difficult, so that everyone can participate and have a good time. You can also consider having a few \"wildcard\" questions that are a bit more difficult, but offer bigger prizes for those who get them correct.\n\nFor the Vision Board Scavenger Hunt, be sure to give clear instructions and provide enough clues to guide the guests. You can also consider dividing the guests into teams to make it more collaborative and fun. This will also encourage guests to mingle and interact with each other, which is perfect for a celebratory party like this.\n\nI hope everything goes smoothly, and you have an amazing time celebrating your financial freedom with your friends and family. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more ideas or advice. Congratulations again on this incredible achievement, and I wish you all the best for your future financial endeavors!",
