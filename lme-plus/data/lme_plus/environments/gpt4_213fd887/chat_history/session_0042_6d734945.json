That's a fantastic idea for a fusion dish! Korean BBQ and tacos are a match made in heaven. Here's a recipe to get you started:\n\n**Korean-Style BBQ Beef Tacos Recipe**\n\n**For the beef:**\n\n* 1 lb beef (such as ribeye or sirloin), sliced into thin strips\n* 2 tbsp Gochujang (Korean chili paste)\n* 2 tbsp soy sauce\n* 2 tbsp brown sugar\n* 2 tbsp garlic, minced\n* 1 tsp ground black pepper\n* 1 tsp Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)\n* 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n\n**For the tacos:**\n\n* 8-10 corn tortillas\n* Sliced green onions, for garnish\n* Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish\n* Kimchi slaw (store-bought or homemade)\n* Cilantro, for garnish\n* Lime wedges, for serving\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large bowl, whisk together Gochujang, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, black pepper, and chili flakes. Add the sliced beef and marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.\n2. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the beef from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Grill the beef for 3-4 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired level of doneness. Transfer the beef to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes.\n3. Slice the beef into thin strips against the grain.\n4. Warm the tortillas by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 20-30 seconds.\n5. Assemble the tacos by placing a few slices of the beef onto a tortilla, followed by a spoonful of kimchi slaw, some sliced green onions, and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds. Serve with a lime wedge on the side.\n\n**Kimchi Slaw Recipe (optional):**\n\n* 2 cups kimchi, chopped\n* 1 cup shredded napa cabbage\n* 1/4 cup chopped cilantro\n* 2 tbsp lime juice\n* 1 tsp honey\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nMix all the ingredients together in a bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.\n\nThis recipe combines the bold flavors of Korean BBQ with the convenience and fun of tacos. The Gochujang marinade gives the beef a sweet and spicy flavor, while the kimchi slaw adds a tangy and crunchy element to the dish. Feel free to customize the recipe to your taste and experiment with different toppings!\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe and your Japchae noodles turn out delicious as well!"
