Since it's happening on your phone connected to Wi-Fi, here are some possible causes and solutions:\n\n1. **Weak Wi-Fi signal**: Move closer to your Wi-Fi router to ensure a strong signal. You can also try restarting your router to see if that improves the connection.\n2. **Internet speed**: Check your internet speed using an app like Speedtest.net.

You can also try uninstalling and reinstalling the app.\n5. **Cache and data**: Clear the YouTube app's cache and data to remove any temporary files that might be causing issues. Go to your phone's settings, then Apps, then YouTube, and select Clear cache and Clear data.\n6. **Video quality settings**: Check your YouTube app settings to ensure you're not set to a lower video quality. Go to the YouTube app, tap your profile picture, then Settings, and select Video quality.
