But those are widely considered as some of the most popular works focused on the Renaissance period. However, I can provide you some information about them. \"The Swerve\" by Stephen Greenblatt deals with the story of a papal scribe named Poggio Bracciolini in the 15th century who discovered a classical Roman manuscript that changed the course of history. It shows how this discovery of an ancient epic poem, \"On the Nature of Things\" by Lucretius, transformed the world\u2019s understanding of science, philosophy and religion. \"The Agony and the Ecstasy\" is a biopic film based on a novel of the same name by Irving Stone. It explores the life and works of Michelangelo, one of the most prominent artists of the Renaissance era, and his struggles to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The film stars Charlton Heston as Michelangelo and portrays the artist's relationship with Pope Julius II, who commissioned the Sistine Chapel ceiling. I hope you enjoy reading the book and watching the movie!",
