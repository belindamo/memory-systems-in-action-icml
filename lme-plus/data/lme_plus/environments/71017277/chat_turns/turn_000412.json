I'm glad I could help clarify the case compatibility for you.\n\nNow, about transferring your data from your old iPhone 11 to your new S22 Ultra...\n\nTransferring data between different ecosystems (iOS to Android) can be a bit more challenging than between devices of the same brand. However, Samsung and Apple provide some tools to make the process smoother. Here are some tips to help you transfer your data:\n\n**Method 1: Smart Switch**\n\n1. Download and install the **Smart Switch** app on your iPhone 11 from the App Store.\n2. Open the app and select \"iOS\" as the device type.\n3. On your S22 Ultra, go to **Settings** > **Connections** > **Smart Switch**.\n4. On your iPhone, select \"Continue\" and then \"Next\" to start the transfer process.\n5. Wait for the devices to connect via Wi-Fi Direct.\n6. Select the data you want to transfer (contacts, messages, photos, music, etc.).\n7. The data will be transferred wirelessly to your S22 Ultra.\n\n**Method 2: Move to Android**\n\n1. On your iPhone 11, open the **Move to Android** app (pre-installed on your S22 Ultra).\n2. Tap \"Continue\" and then \"Next\" on both devices.\n3. On your iPhone, enter the code displayed on your S22 Ultra.\n4. Select the data you want to transfer (contacts, message history, camera photos and videos, web bookmarks, and more).\n5. Wait for the data to transfer wirelessly.\n\n**Method 3: iCloud and Google Drive**\n\n1. On your iPhone 11, go to **Settings** > [your name] > **iCloud** > **iCloud Backup**.\n2. Turn on **iCloud Backup** and select \"Back Up Now\".\n3. On your S22 Ultra, download and install the **Google Drive** app.\n4. Sign in with your Google account and upload your iCloud backup data to Google Drive.\n5. On your S22 Ultra, go to **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Add account** > **Google**.\n6. Sign in with your Google account to access your transferred data.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\n* If you're using a cable, ensure it's a USB-C to Lightning cable (for Method 1).\n* You may need to reset your iPhone 11 after the transfer process is complete.\n* Some data, like iMessage history, may not be transferable. You can try using third-party apps like iMazing or Dr. Fone to transfer iMessage history.\n* Take this opportunity to organize your data and declutter your new device!\n\nRemember to also transfer your SIM card or set up your new phone's cellular plan, and don't forget to activate any necessary features, like Find My Device or Remote Erase, on your S22 Ultra.\n\nI hope this helps!
