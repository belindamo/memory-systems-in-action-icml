They had some real missed opportunities out there, and it ultimately cost them the championship.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the offense. They really struggled to produce runs against the Royals' pitching staff. Now, I know the Royals had a strong bullpen, but the Mets should have been able to get more than seven runs in five games. It seemed like they just couldn't get anything going, especially with runners in scoring position. They left a lot of men on base, and that really hurt them.\n\nNow, on the defensive side, there were some real miscues. I mean, that misplayed fly ball by Lagares in Game 1 was a killer. It changed the whole complexion of the game and gave the Royals momentum. And then there was the error by David Wright in Game 5. That was a tough one. Wright's usually a solid defender, but he just couldn't come up with that ball. Those kinds of mistakes are tough to overcome, especially in a tight series like that.\n\nBut I think the biggest issue for the Mets was their bullpen. They just couldn't get it done when it mattered most. Familia, who had been so dominant in the postseason up to that point, had a rough outing in Game 1, and then the whole bullpen fell apart in Game 4. You just can't give up five runs in the eighth inning of a World Series game and expect to come out on top. The Mets' bullpen was a real liability in that series.\n\nAnd then you have to give credit to the Royals. They were a tough opponent. They had a deep lineup, a shutdown bullpen, and they just seemed to know how to win in the postseason. They played with a lot of confidence and never seemed to panic, even when they were down. They were a tough team to beat, and the Mets just weren't able to get it done.\n\nSo there you have it, Gary. The Mets had some missed opportunities, some defensive miscues, and a bullpen that struggled at times. And you have to give credit to the Royals. It was a tough series, but ultimately the better team won.",
