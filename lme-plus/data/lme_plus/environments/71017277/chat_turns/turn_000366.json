  "content": "The long-term sustainability of Santa Cruz del Islote remains uncertain due to the island's limited resources and environmental challenges. Living conditions on the island are extremely basic, and access to basic necessities such as clean water, electricity, and medical care is limited. Additionally, the island's small size and isolation make it vulnerable to environmental factors such as rising sea levels and erosion.\n\nDespite these challenges, many residents of Santa Cruz del Islote are deeply connected to their island community and take pride in their unique way of life. While some residents may choose to leave the island for economic or personal reasons, many others remain committed to sustaining their population on Santa Cruz del Islote.\n\nEfforts have been made to improve living conditions on the island, such as the installation of solar panels and the building of rainwater collection systems. Additionally, the Colombian government has made some investments in infrastructure on the island, including the construction of a new school and the provision of some basic services.\n\nOverall, the long-term sustainability of Santa Cruz del Islote remains uncertain, and the island's inhabitants face ongoing challenges in maintaining their way of life. However, many residents are committed to their community and are working to find solutions to these challenges.",
