  "content": "Santa Cruz del Islote is a small island located in the Archipelago of San Bernardo, off the coast of Colombia. It is considered to be one of the most densely populated islands in the world, with an estimated population of around 1200 people living on just 1.2 acres of land. \n\nThe living conditions on the island are very basic, and it lacks basic infrastructure such as paved roads, sewage systems, and access to clean water. Most of the houses on the island are constructed using wood, with metal roofs, and are built very close to each other. The island has only one store and one school, but residents must travel off-island to purchase more basic commodities such as medication and other basic supplies.\n\nThe island's main source of income is fishing, and most residents are involved in the local fishing industry. Some residents also work in other industries, including tourism and boat repair. \n\nDespite the challenges, residents of Santa Cruz del Islote have developed a close-knit community and take pride in their home. However, due to limited resources and environmental factors such as rising sea levels and erosion, there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of the island's population.",
