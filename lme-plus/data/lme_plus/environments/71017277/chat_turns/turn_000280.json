  "content": "DL2178 on Friday, March 17, is operated by an Airbus A321 aircraft. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Aircraft Configuration:**\n\nThe Airbus A321 is a single-aisle, narrow-body aircraft with a total of 191 seats. The Comfort+ cabin on this aircraft has 29 seats, configured in a 3-3 layout.\n\n**Comfort+ Seat Details:**\n\n* **Seat Pitch:** 34 inches (86 cm)\n* **Seat Width:** 18.5 inches (47 cm)\n* **Recline:** Up to 4 inches (10 cm)\n* **Legroom:** Up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) more legroom compared to Main Cabin seats\n\n**Amenities:**\n\n* **Priority Boarding:** Comfort+ passengers enjoy Zone 1 boarding, which means you'll be among the first to board the plane.\n* **Dedicated Overhead Bin Space:** Comfort+ passengers have access to dedicated overhead bin space, reducing the likelihood of having to gate-check your bag.\n* **Complimentary Drinks:** Enjoy complimentary beer, wine, and spirits, in addition to soft drinks and juice.\n* **Upgraded Snacks:** Comfort+ passengers receive upgraded snacks, such as nuts and pretzels, on flights over 900 miles.\n\n**Seat Selection:**\n\nWhen booking your Comfort+ ticket, you'll have the opportunity to select your seat from the available options. Keep in mind that Comfort+ seats are not lie-flat beds, but rather premium economy seats with more legroom and amenities.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* **Seat Selection:** If you prefer a window seat, opt for seats A or F. If you prefer an aisle seat, choose seats C or D.\n* **Noise:** The aircraft's engines are located at the rear, so seats near the front of the plane (rows 10-12) may be quieter.\n* **Exit Rows:** Be aware that exit row seats (rows 13-14) have limited recline and may have additional responsibilities in case of an emergency.\n\nPlease note that seat configurations and amenities are subject to change. I recommend checking Delta's website or mobile app for the most up-to-date information.",
