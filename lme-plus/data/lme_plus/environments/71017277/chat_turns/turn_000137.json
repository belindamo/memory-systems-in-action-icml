  "content": "The research method used in the paper \"The relationship between work engagement and workaholism: a systematic review and meta-analysis\" is a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic review is a comprehensive and structured overview of the existing research on a specific topic. It aims to identify all relevant studies, assess their quality, and synthesize the results in a way that provides a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nThe meta-analysis component of the study involved pooling and analyzing the data from the studies included in the systematic review to quantify the strength of the relationship between work engagement and workaholism. The authors used statistical methods to calculate the effect size of the relationship, which was expressed as a correlation coefficient. The meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, which assumes that the effect size may vary across studies.\n\nThe systematic review component of the study involved conducting a comprehensive search of relevant databases, including PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science, for studies published in English between January 2000 and August 2018. The authors used specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify studies that were relevant to their research question and that included data on both work engagement and workaholism. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies.\n\nOverall, the research method used in the study \"The relationship between work engagement and workaholism: a systematic review and meta-analysis\" provided a comprehensive and rigorous approach to synthesizing the existing research on the relationship between work engagement and workaholism.",
