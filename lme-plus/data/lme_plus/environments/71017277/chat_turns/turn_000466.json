  "content": "Yes, several governments have implemented specific measures to promote domestic travel in response to the pandemic. \n\nFor example, some countries have introduced travel vouchers or subsidies for citizens to encourage travel within their own country. The governments of Japan and Malta, for instance, offered subsidies covering a portion of travel and accommodation expenses for individuals who choose to travel domestically.\n\nOther measures include waiving entrance fees to cultural sites and tourist attractions, creating new tourism packages or promoting existing ones, organizing events and festivals, and conducting advertising campaigns to promote local tourism.\n\nGovernments have also introduced initiatives to support local tourism businesses, such as loans, grants, and tax breaks. These measures aim to support economic recovery in the tourism industry and encourage people to choose domestic travel instead of international travel.\n\nOverall, the promotion of domestic travel recognizes that domestic tourists can help sustain the tourism industry in the absence of international tourists, and can contribute to the revival of local economies during these challenging times.",
