  "content": "If the client requires the AGV to deliver goods back and forth 2-3 times per hour, a lattice AGV is likely to be a better choice than a forklift AGV. Lattice AGVs are generally faster and more precise than forklift AGVs, which makes them well-suited for high-speed operations. The guidance systems used in lattice AGVs enable precise movement and positioning, which can increase productivity and efficiency. Additionally, lattice AGVs can handle a wide range of load sizes and weights, making them suitable for diverse product handling requirements.\n\nHowever, the final decision will depend on other factors such as the layout of the factory, the size and weight of the products being transported, and any specific requirements the client may have. It may be helpful to conduct a thorough assessment of the client's needs and operations to determine which type of AGV will best meet their requirements.",
