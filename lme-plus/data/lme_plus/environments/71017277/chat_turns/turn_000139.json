  "content": "Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Andes Mountains in modern-day Peru. It was built in the mid-1400s during the reign of the Inca emperor Pachacuti as a royal estate for himself and his family. The site was abandoned in the 16th century during the Spanish conquest of Peru but remained hidden and unknown to the outside world until its rediscovery in 1911 by American explorer Hiram Bingham.\n\nThe purpose of Machu Picchu is not entirely known, but it is believed to have served as a royal retreat, religious site, and astronomical observatory. The site features intricate stone structures and terraces built without the use of mortar, highlighting the advanced engineering and stonework skills of the Inca people.\n\nThe exact reasons for the abandonment of Machu Picchu are unknown, but it is believed that the Spanish invasion and ensuing epidemics may have played a role. Today, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage site, attracting millions of visitors annually.",
