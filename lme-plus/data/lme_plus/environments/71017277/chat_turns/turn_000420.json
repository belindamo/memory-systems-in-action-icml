  "content": "Congratulations on selling your old iPhone 11 for $400! That's a great way to offset the cost of your new S22 Ultra. It's always a good idea to sell or trade in your old devices to reduce electronic waste and make some extra cash.\n\nSo, if I understand correctly, you sold your iPhone 11 for $400 and used that money to help pay for your new S22 Ultra, which cost $1,200. That means you effectively paid $800 out of pocket for your new phone.\n\nI'm glad I could help you with your questions about your new phone, and I hope you're enjoying your S22 Ultra! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance.",
