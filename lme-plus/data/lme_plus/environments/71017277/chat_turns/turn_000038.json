Having twins can be double the joy, but also double the work, so a thoughtful gift can go a long way in making their lives easier.\n\nHere are some ideas for a thoughtful gift for the twin babies:\n\n1. **Twin-themed gift basket**: Create a gift basket filled with two of everything, such as onesies, sleepers, and burp cloths, all in matching or coordinating colors. You could also include some twin-specific items like a twin nursing pillow or a twin baby monitor.\n2. **Personalized twin blankets**: A set of two personalized blankets with the babies' names or initials can make a lovely gift. You could choose soft, cozy blankets that they can use for years to come.\n3. **Diaper cake or diaper subscription**: Diapers are always appreciated, and a diaper cake or a diaper subscription service can be a lifesaver for new parents of twins. You could also include a few extra goodies like baby wipes or a diaper bag.\n4. **Twin baby carriers**: A baby carrier can be a game-changer for parents of twins, allowing them to hold both babies close while keeping their hands free. Look for a twin baby carrier that can accommodate both babies at once.\n5. **Meal delivery or gift card**: Raising twins can be exhausting, and meal prep can take a backseat. Consider gifting a meal delivery service or a gift card to a local restaurant or grocery store to help them out.\n6. **Baby books or journals**: A set of twin baby books or journals can be a thoughtful gift, allowing the parents to document milestones, memories, and special moments for each baby.\n7. **Twin-friendly toys**: As the babies grow, they'll love playing with toys designed for twins, such as twin-friendly playmats, stacking toys, or musical instruments.\n8. **Self-care gift basket**: Create a gift basket filled with self-care goodies like scented candles, bath bombs, and cozy socks to help the parents relax and recharge.\n9. **Twin stroller or accessories**: If you want to splurge, consider gifting a twin stroller or stroller accessories like a stroller organizer or rain cover.\n10. **Gift card to a baby store**: A gift card to a baby store can be incredibly practical, allowing the parents to choose what they need or want for their twins.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your love and support for the new family. Whatever gift you choose, I'm sure they'll appreciate the thought and love behind it.\n\nAs for Oliver, I'm sure you'll get to hold him in your arms soon!",
