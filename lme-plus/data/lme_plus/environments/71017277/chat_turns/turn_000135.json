  "content": "The study \"The relationship between work engagement and workaholism: a systematic review and meta-analysis\" is a comprehensive review of the existing research on the relationship between work engagement and workaholism. The authors conducted a systematic search of relevant studies published in English between January 2000 and August 2018. They found a total of 36 studies that met their inclusion criteria and included data on both work engagement and workaholism.\n\nThe meta-analysis conducted as part of the study found a moderate, negative relationship between work engagement and workaholism. This suggests that as work engagement increases, workaholism decreases and vice versa. The results were consistent across different samples, including employees from various countries and industries, and across different measures of work engagement and workaholism.\n\nOverall, the findings of the study suggest that work engagement and workaholism are distinct constructs that are negatively related. The authors suggest that promoting work engagement may be an effective way to prevent or reduce workaholism, which is associated with negative outcomes such as burnout and impaired well-being.",
