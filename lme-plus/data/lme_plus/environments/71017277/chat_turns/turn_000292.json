  "content": "Yes, other regions in Belgium also prioritize small-scale agriculture and renewable energy sources, but the extent to which each region prioritizes these policies might differ. \n\nRegarding agriculture, in Flanders (another region in Belgium), there is a mix of smaller and larger farms, and the focus is more on modernization and innovation rather than supporting small-scale farms. In Brussels-Capital Region, agriculture is mostly absent due to the lack of space, so the focus is more on urban farming and rooftop gardens.\n\nRegarding renewable energy, there is a growing trend in all regions of Belgium towards developing more renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. However, the percentage of renewable energy in the energy mix still varies between regions. For example, Flanders has the highest percentage of installed solar panels in the country whereas Wallonia has more wind energy facilities. \n\nOverall, while other regions in Belgium might also prioritize small-scale agriculture and renewable energy sources, the emphasis, approach and way these policies are implemented might differ based on the specificities and conditions of each region.",
