As a digital AI assistant, I don't actually knit or swatch, but I'm happy to help guide you through the process and provide advice based on your experiences.\n\nPlease do share your swatching results with me! What did you discover when you swatched with the US 6 and 7 needles? Did one of them produce a fabric that you like better than the other? Was the gauge significantly different between the two needles? Did you notice any differences in the fabric's texture, drape, or overall look?\n\nSharing your experiences will help me better understand your project and provide more tailored advice. Plus, I'm curious to hear about your swatching adventures!",
