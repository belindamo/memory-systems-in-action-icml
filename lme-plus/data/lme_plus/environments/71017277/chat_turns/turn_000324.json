  "content": "The suitability of fork type AGV or lattice type AGV for delivering goods and materials inside a pharmaceutical factory depends on various factors, including:\n\n1. Factory layout and product handling requirements: Lattice AGVs are better suited for factories with tight spaces and a need for precise positioning, while fork type AGVs are better for transporting heavy loads over long distances.\n2. Product dimensions and weight: If the products are heavy and bulky, a fork type AGV is more suitable, while lattice AGVs are better for lighter loads.\n3. Required speed and accuracy of delivery: Lattice AGVs are generally faster and more precise than fork type AGVs, making them better suited for applications where speed and accuracy are critical.\n\nUltimately, the choice between a fork type AGV and a lattice type AGV will depend on the specific needs of the pharmaceutical factory, including the type and size of products being transported, the layout of the factory, and the desired speed and accuracy of delivery.",
