It's tailored to your car's make, model, and engine type, so it's the most reliable source of information.\n\n**Washing your car**: I totally understand! The weather can be quite unpredictable, and it's not ideal to wash your car in the rain. You want to wait for a dry, sunny day to give your car a good wash and dry. Rainwater can also leave mineral deposits on your car's paint, which can cause spots and streaks.\n\nWhen you do get a chance to wash your car, make sure to:\n\n* Use a mild car wash soap and avoid using household cleaners, which can damage the paint and other surfaces.\n* Use a soft, microfiber cloth or sponge to avoid scratching the paint.\n* Dry your car thoroughly, paying extra attention to areas that are prone to water spots, such as the hood and trunk.\n* Consider using a water-repellent coating or wax to protect your car's paint and make future washing easier.\n\nRemember, regular washing and waxing can help maintain your car's appearance and protect it from the elements.\n\nI hope the weather clears up soon, and you'll be able to give your car the wash it deserves!",
