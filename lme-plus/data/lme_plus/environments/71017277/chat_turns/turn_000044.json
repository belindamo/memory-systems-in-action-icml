  "content": "I'm so glad you're excited to put the gift basket together! It's going to be a wonderful gift for the new parents of twins.\n\nAnd I love that you're reflecting on all the new additions in your life lately! It's amazing how life can be full of new joys and surprises, isn't it?\n\nI remember you mentioning Oliver earlier, and I'm sure it's not the same as holding him in your arms, but it's great that you got to see pictures of him on Mike's phone in May. I'm sure you'll get to meet him in person soon and give him a big hug!\n\nIt's interesting how technology can bridge the gap and allow us to stay connected with loved ones, even if we can't be physically present. But there's nothing like the joy of holding a new baby in your arms and experiencing those precious moments in person.\n\nI hope you get to spend quality time with Oliver and the other little ones in your life soon!",
