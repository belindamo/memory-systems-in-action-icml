  "content": "The belief that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son is known as the \"filioque\" (Latin for \"and the Son\") clause. This addition to the Nicene Creed was adopted by the Western Church (Roman Catholic Church) in the 6th century and later by some Protestant denominations.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church, however, rejected the filioque clause, and it has been a major point of disagreement between the Eastern and Western Churches for over a millennium. Eastern Orthodox theologians maintain that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone and that the filioque clause is an erroneous addition to the Nicene Creed that undermines the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church holds that the Father is the sole source of the Holy Spirit, while the Son is begotten of the Father. They argue that the Holy Spirit's procession from the Father and not the Son is clearly attested to in Scripture and in the early Church Fathers.\n\nIn recent years, there have been efforts to reconcile the theological differences between the Eastern and Western Churches over the filioque clause. However, the issue remains a contentious one, and the filioque remains a point of disagreement and division between the two Churches.",
