Here's my attempt:\n\nGary: Welcome back to Citi Field, folks, where the Mets are just three outs away from their first World Series title since 1986. And it looks like we have a new second baseman for the Mets, Keith.\n\nKeith: That's right, Gary. We just got word that veteran infielder Robinson Cano had to leave the game due to an injury, and in his place, we have a young player making his World Series debut. His name is Carnage, and he's been making waves in the Mets' minor league system for his quick reflexes and lightning-quick turns.\n\nRon: And if the Mets are going to win this thing, they're going to need all the help they can get. They're facing a tough Royals lineup, and they're counting on their ace, Jacob deGrom, to shut things down in the ninth inning.\n\nGary: Speaking of deGrom, here he comes with the first pitch of the inning. And it's a fastball, clocked at 99 miles per hour!\n\nKeith: Wow, deGrom is still bringing the heat even in the ninth inning of Game 7. This is what you live for, folks.\n\nRon: Okay, here comes the first batter for the Royals. It's their speedy leadoff hitter, Whit Merrifield.\n\nGary: And Merrifield swings at the first pitch! It's a ground ball to the right side of the infield, and it's headed straight for Carnage at second base!\n\nKeith: This is it, folks. The ball is hit right at Carnage, and he's got to make a quick decision. He's got the speed to make a play, but can he handle the pressure?\n\nRon: And Carnage gets to the ball and scoops it up cleanly! He turns and fires to shortstop Francisco Lindor, who's covering second base!\n\nGary: Lindor takes the throw and quickly pivots to throw to first base! It's a double play!\n\nKeith: Unbelievable! Carnage has just turned a game-ending double play in the World Series! The Mets are the champions of the world!\n\nRon: That was an incredible play by Carnage, folks. He had to move quickly and make a perfect throw to get that double play. And what a way to end the World Series!\n\nGary: And look at the celebration on the field, Keith. The players are mobbing each other, and Carnage is right in the middle of it all. What a moment for this young player.\n\nKeith: Absolutely, Gary. This is the stuff of legends. Carnage, the West Villain, has just etched his name into Mets history forever.",
