Including a set of nice notecards or stationery in the gift basket is a thoughtful addition that will make the gift even more special.\n\nNew parents often appreciate gestures of kindness and support, and a set of notecards or stationery can be a practical and heartwarming way to encourage them to stay connected with loved ones, share updates, and express gratitude. Here are a few reasons why this is a great idea:\n\n1. **Stay connected**: New parents may not have the time or energy to write long letters, but a set of notecards or stationery can make it easy for them to send quick updates, thank-you notes, or just a simple \"hello\" to loved ones.\n2. **Share milestones**: As the twins grow, the parents can use the notecards or stationery to share milestones, achievements, and special moments with family and friends.\n3. **Express gratitude**: A set of notecards or stationery can be a thoughtful way for the parents to express gratitude to those who have supported them during this journey, whether it's a kind neighbor, a helpful friend, or a supportive family member.\n4. **Personal touch**: A set of nice notecards or stationery can add a personal touch to the gift basket, making it feel more thoughtful and considerate.\n\nWhen selecting the notecards or stationery, consider the following:\n\n* Choose a set that is neutral or twin-themed, so it can be used for either baby or both.\n* Opt for high-quality, beautifully designed notecards or stationery that will make a lovely impression.\n* Consider a set that includes a mix of blank cards, thank-you cards, and milestone cards (e.g., \"First Birthday\" or \"First Tooth\") to cover a range of occasions.\n* If you want to make it an extra-special gift, consider adding a few handwritten notes or a heartfelt message to the notecards or stationery.\n\nBy including a set of nice notecards or stationery in the gift basket, you'll be giving the parents a thoughtful way to stay connected, share milestones, and express gratitude. It's a beautiful way to support them during this special time!",
