  "content": "I'm so glad to hear that! Using leftover wood scraps is a great way to reduce waste, declutter your craft room, and get creative with your project. It's also a fantastic opportunity to practice your problem-solving skills and think outside the box.\n\nRemember to inspect the scraps carefully, choose the right pieces, and dry them out if necessary. With a little patience and creativity, you can turn those scraps into beautiful, functional coasters that will complement your refurbished rocking chair perfectly.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance. I'll be here, cheering you on as you work on your project.\n\nHave fun getting creative with your coasters, and I hope you'll share your finished project with me!",
