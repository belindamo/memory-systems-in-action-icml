A retro-futuristic theme is a great choice, and it can be a lot of fun to create a display that combines vintage cameras and action figures in a way that feels cohesive and visually appealing.\n\nRemember to have fun with the process, and don't be afraid to experiment and try out different arrangements until you find one that feels right. And if you need any more tips or advice, feel free to ask.\n\nAlso, I'd love to see how your display turns out! If you're willing, share some photos of your finished display, and I'd be happy to provide feedback and suggestions.\n\nGood luck, and happy displaying!",
