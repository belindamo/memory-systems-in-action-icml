As a large language model, I don't have real-time access to Delta's award calendar, but I can guide you on how to search for available award seats on Delta's website. Here's a step-by-step example:\n\n**Searching for Award Seats on Delta's Website:**\n\n1. Log in to your Delta SkyMiles account on delta.com.\n2. Click on \"Book\" and then \"Award Travel\" at the top of the page.\n3. Enter your travel dates, departure city (LAX), and destination (LAS) in the search bar.\n4. Select \"Flexible Dates\" to search for availability across multiple days.\n5. Choose your preferred cabin: Main Cabin (Economy) or Comfort+ (Premium Economy).\n6. Click \"Search\" to view available award flights.\n\n**Example Search Results:**\n\nHere are some sample search results for LAX to LAS on Delta with available award seats:\n\n**Friday, March 17**\n\n* **Main Cabin**:\n\t+ DL2154: LAX to LAS, departing 8:30 AM, arriving 9:35 AM (10,000 miles + $5.60 in taxes and fees)\n\t+ DL2174: LAX to LAS, departing 12:30 PM, arriving 1:35 PM (10,000 miles + $5.60 in taxes and fees)\n* **Comfort+**:\n\t+ DL2154: LAX to LAS, departing 8:30 AM, arriving 9:35 AM (15,000 miles + $5.60 in taxes and fees)\n\t+ DL2178: LAX to LAS, departing 3:30 PM, arriving 4:35 PM (15,000 miles + $5.60 in taxes and fees)\n\n**Saturday, March 18**\n\n* **Main Cabin**:\n\t+ DL2162: LAX to LAS, departing 9:30 AM, arriving 10:35 AM (10,000 miles + $5.60 in taxes and fees)\n\t+ DL2192: LAX to LAS, departing 2:30 PM, arriving 3:35 PM (10,000 miles + $5.60 in taxes and fees)\n* **Comfort+**:\n\t+ DL2162: LAX to LAS, departing 9:30 AM, arriving 10:35 AM (15,000 miles + $5.60 in taxes and fees)\n\t+ DL2194: LAX to LAS, departing 5:30 PM, arriving 6:35 PM (15,000 miles + $5.60 in taxes and fees)\n\nPlease note that award availability can change rapidly, and these examples may not reflect current availability. I recommend searching on Delta's website for the most up-to-date options.\n\n**Book Your Award Ticket:**\n\nOnce you find available award seats, book your ticket as soon as possible to secure your travel dates. You can do this online or by calling Delta's customer service. Remember to factor in any additional fees, such as taxes, and be prepared to pay with your Delta miles and any applicable fees. Happy travels to Las Vegas!",
