  "content": "If you are promoting a lattice AGV to a client who is considering a fork type AGV, you can emphasize the following advantages of lattice AGVs:\n\n1. Precision: Lattice AGVs are equipped with guidance systems that allow for precise movement and positioning, making them ideal for operations that require high accuracy and speed.\n2. Flexibility: Lattice AGVs can navigate through tight spaces and navigate around obstacles, making them well-suited for factories with complex layouts.\n3. Load versatility: Lattice AGVs can handle a wide range of load sizes and weights, making them suitable for diverse product handling requirements.\n4. Energy efficiency: Lattice AGVs often use less energy than fork type AGVs, making them a cost-effective solution for operations that require a lot of transport.\n5. Customizability: Lattice AGVs can be customized to meet the specific needs of a factory, including load capacity, speed, and navigation.\n\nBy highlighting the precision, flexibility, versatility, energy efficiency, and customizability of lattice AGVs, you can demonstrate to the client how this type of AGV can meet their needs and provide a better solution than a fork type AGV.",
