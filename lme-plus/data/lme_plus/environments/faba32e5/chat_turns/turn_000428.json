Forgetting something essential can be frustrating, but it's a great opportunity to learn and improve for your next trip.\n\nPacking for a 3-day conference can be a challenge, but with some strategic planning, you can ensure you have everything you need while minimizing luggage space. Here are some general tips to help you pack efficiently:\n\n1. **Plan your outfits**: Think about the conference schedule, dress code, and activities you'll be attending. Plan out your outfits for each day, considering the dress code, weather, and any specific requirements (like your belt!).\n2. **Make a packing list**: Write down all the essentials you need to pack, including clothing, toiletries, electronics, and documents. Check the conference website for any specific items you might need, such as a laptop or power adapter.\n3. **Pack multipurpose items**: Choose items that can serve multiple purposes, like a scarf that can be used as a blanket on the plane or a dressy accessory for the evening.\n4. **Roll your clothes**: Rolling your clothes instead of folding them can help reduce wrinkles and save space in your luggage.\n5. **Use packing cubes**: Packing cubes are great for keeping your clothes organized and making the most of your luggage space. They can also help you compress your clothes to fit more in.\n6. **Pack essentials in carry-on**: Pack essential items like your laptop, phone charger, and any important documents in your carry-on luggage in case your checked bag is delayed or lost.\n7. **Wear bulky items**: Consider wearing your bulkiest items, like your coat or boots, on the plane to save space in your luggage.\n8. **Pack a portable charger**: A portable charger can be a lifesaver, especially if you're attending a conference with limited power outlets.\n9. **Check the weather**: Check the weather forecast for your destination and pack accordingly. You don't want to be caught off guard with unexpected rain or cold temperatures.\n10. **Leave some extra space**: Don't overpack! Leave some extra space in your luggage for any items you might purchase or receive during the conference.\n\nFor your specific situation, since you forgot a belt last time, make sure to add it to your packing list and consider packing a spare in case the one you have breaks or gets lost.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider packing:\n\n* A portable power bank for your phone or laptop\n* A water bottle to stay hydrated\n* Snacks, like energy bars or nuts, to keep you fueled throughout the day\n* A small first-aid kit with pain relievers, band-aids, and any medications you might need\n* A small notebook and pen for taking notes during sessions\n* Business cards and any other networking materials you might need\n\nRemember to check with the conference organizers for any specific items they recommend bringing or avoiding. Safe travels, and I hope you have a successful and enjoyable conference!",
