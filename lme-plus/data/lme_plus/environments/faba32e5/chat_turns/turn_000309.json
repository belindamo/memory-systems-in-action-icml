  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to the current status of the construction project of the new Metro lines. However, construction timelines can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as the length of the new Metro line, the complexity of the project, the availability of funding, and the number of workers involved in the project. Generally, large-scale infrastructure projects like a new Metro line can take several years to complete, and unexpected delays may prolong the construction timeline. Therefore, it would be best to check the official sources for updates on the status and estimated completion time of the new Metro lines.",
