  "content": "Rising sea levels can have a significant impact on the underground pipe structure of a coastal city. As sea levels rise, the water table also rises, which can lead to increased flooding and erosion. This can cause damage to underground pipes, particularly those that are buried at a shallower depth. Flooding can cause pipes to burst or become clogged with debris, leading to water shortages and costly repairs. Additionally, saltwater intrusion can cause corrosion of metal pipes, further weakening their structural integrity. As a result, coastal cities must constantly monitor and upgrade their underground pipe structures to adapt to the rising sea levels. This can include installing larger pipes or elevating them to higher ground, as well as implementing new technologies and materials to protect against corrosion. The cost of these efforts can be significant, and it is important for cities to plan and budget accordingly to ensure the long-term sustainability of their water infrastructure.",
