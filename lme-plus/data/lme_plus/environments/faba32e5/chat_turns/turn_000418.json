  "content": "Certainly! An example of societal expectations influencing the characters' actions is seen in the character of Blanche. Blanche's desire is to live a life free from judgment and criticism, but societal expectations surrounding women's behavior during the 1950s constrain her. She is expected to behave in a manner that is proper and decorous, specifically as a Southern belle. However, Blanche consistently goes against these expectations. For example, she drinks heavily, engages in promiscuous behavior, and speaks her mind freely. She does not conform to the societal expectations of a \"proper\" woman, and this is seen as a major reason why she is ostracized and ultimately driven to madness by those around her. Stanley uses her non-conformity as evidence that she is mentally unstable, and he works to expose her deviations from societal norms. In this way, the societal expectations of women and gender roles exemplify the way in which larger external factors impact the characters' actions in the play.",
