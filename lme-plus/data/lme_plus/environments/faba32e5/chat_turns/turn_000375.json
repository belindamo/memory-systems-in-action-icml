  "content": "How would a world without nukes would be safer? We've seen few conflicts or wars after nuclear weapons. In contrast, the world constantly engaged in conflicts before then. And it was one of the major reasons why cold war remained cold. Talking about moral perspective, we need to understand that we live in the real world, and suggesting utopian solutions can be equally dangerous for world peace. As Hobbes put it, international politics is a war of all against all. It is extremely relevant presently in a world of weakening multilateralism, and growing multipolarity. And this stable polity for decades has to a large extent ensured peace and prosperity of all.",
