Blending washes with acrylic paints requires some technique, but with practice, you can achieve a seamless integration. Here are some specific tips to help you blend Vallejo Model Air paints with enamel washes:\n\n1. **Choose the right wash**: Select an enamel wash that complements the Vallejo Model Air paint colors you're using. Look for washes with a similar color tone or undertone to ensure a harmonious blend. You can also mix washes to create custom shades.\n2. **Thin your washes**: Enamel washes can be quite thick, so thin them with a solvent like turpentine, mineral spirits, or even Vallejo's own Thinner for Washes. This will help you achieve a more subtle, nuanced effect.\n3. **Apply washes to recesses**: Use a small brush to apply the thinned wash to recessed areas, such as panel lines, rivets, and crevices. This will help create depth and shading.\n4. **Use a \"glaze\" technique**: Mix a small amount of wash with a Vallejo Model Air paint that's close to the base color. Apply this mixture to raised areas using a soft brush. This creates a subtle, blended transition between the wash and the base color.\n5. **Blend with a wet brush**: Dip a soft brush in water, then pick up some of the Vallejo Model Air paint. Gently blend the paint into the wash, feathering it out towards the edges. This helps merge the two mediums.\n6. **Work in small areas**: Focus on one area at a time, blending the wash and paint in small sections. This prevents the wash from spreading or bleeding excessively.\n7. **Build up gradually**: Apply multiple thin layers of wash and paint, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next. This helps prevent overpowering the model with too much wash.\n8. **Use a hairdryer (carefully)**: Gently use a hairdryer on a low setting to speed up the drying process. Be cautious not to overheat the model or cause the wash to pool in unwanted areas.\n9. **Fix mistakes with a damp brush**: If you notice the wash bleeding or spreading too much, use a damp brush to gently remove excess wash and blend the area.\n10. **Seal with a matte coat**: Once you're satisfied with the blended look, apply a matte coat to protect the model and reduce the sheen.\n\nSome additional tips specific to the F-15E:\n\n* The F-15E's camouflage scheme features a mix of grays and tans, which can be challenging to weather. Start with a subtle wash and build up gradually to avoid overpowering the model.\n* Focus on weathering the areas around the engines, air intakes, and landing gear, as these are prone to heavy wear and tear.\n* The F-15E's radome and leading edges may exhibit a more pronounced wear pattern due to the friction and heat generated during flight.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a beautifully blended, worn look on your F-15E Strike Eagle using Vallejo Model Air paints and enamel washes. Good luck, and have fun!",
