  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific information regarding the new Metro lines or any planned road closures. However, it is common for major road closures and temporary changes to traffic patterns to occur during large-scale construction projects like a new Metro line. These closures and changes are typically necessary to accommodate construction vehicles and workers, ensure public safety, and minimize disruption to traffic flow.\n\nTo find up-to-date information on any planned road closures or changes in traffic patterns, you can check the official website of the Metro transit authority in your area or the city where the new Metro lines are being constructed. Additionally, local news outlets and social media accounts may provide updates on the construction progress and any potential disruptions to traffic. It is also a good idea to plan alternative routes and allow for extra travel time, especially if you commute through an area that is close to the construction site.",
