  "content": "Yes, the cowboy mythos did neglect the contributions of women, indigenous peoples, and African Americans in cowboy culture. The traditional cowboy image in popular culture often depicted white men as the primary figure, with little attention paid to the fact that women, indigenous peoples, and African Americans played a significant role in shaping cowboy culture. For example, women were often involved in ranch work, including herding, cooking, and managing the household, while indigenous peoples and African Americans contributed to various aspects of the cattle industry, such as driving cattle, horse breaking, and providing general labor. However, these contributions are often overlooked or dismissed in popular portrayals of cowboy culture.",
