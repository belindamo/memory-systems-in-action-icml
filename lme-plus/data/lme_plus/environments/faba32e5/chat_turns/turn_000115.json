  "content": "Growing up, I was a huge fan of Bob the Builder, a beloved children's TV show. However, in stark contrast to the show's protagonist, my childhood was riddled with mishaps, from broken household items to my brother's painstakingly assembled LEGO starships. My family, consisting of engineers, jokingly referred to my knack for destruction as the \"reverse Midas touch.\" While I may not have inherited their mechanical prowess, Bob the Builder instilled in me a passion for constructing things in different ways, such as building communities and using innovation to tackle real-world challenges.\n\nEdtech is one field that has particularly piqued my interest. The isolation brought on by recent global events inspired me to create YAPA Kids, an organization of high school volunteers who teach and inspire young students. This initiative, initially intended for a handful of students, rapidly expanded its reach, demonstrating technology's potential to not only provide educational access but also ignite curiosity. Currently, I am collaborating with the Collins Institute to develop personalized, AI-enhanced educational experiences.\n\nMy innate tendency to tinker, even at the risk of breaking things, has led me to explore the world of AI. I have developed independent projects using NLP for email topic and sentiment classification and employed computer vision and CNNs to analyze 3D MRI scans. Last summer, I interned at Grata, a fintech startup utilizing deep learning and NLP to make financial information accessible and searchable. This experience exposed me to the rapid scaling of impact that innovation can offer and sparked my interest in developing business expertise.\n\nRecognizing the importance of policy and government perspectives on technology, I am currently enrolled in a disruptive technologies and international relations seminar and have initiated a white paper on large language models. Additionally, I applied for the Harvard Yun Fellows for Revolutionary Thinking program, where I investigated the effects of AI on the workforce and economy.\n\nCommitted to fostering dialogue around AI, I co-founded the Harvard AI Group, an affiliate of HCS, which now boasts 160+ members participating in discussions about AI's societal, governmental, and technological ramifications. We are also working to provide the Harvard community with free access to GPT-4 as part of our ongoing efforts.\n\nThe Undergraduate Technology Innovation Fellows program offers a unique opportunity to join a diverse community of builders and innovators, all driven by a shared passion for pushing the boundaries of imagination. Having spent years learning about technology and its applications, I am eager to delve deeper into entrepreneurship, education, and policy through this program.\n\nI hope to contribute my experiences and insights to the Technology Innovation Fellows program, while also discovering ways to harness the power of AI and other emerging technologies for the greater good. As an engaged member of Harvard's ongoing dialogue on technology, I am excited to continue my journey of building communities, inspiring innovation, and exploring the vast potential that technology offers in shaping the world for the better.",
