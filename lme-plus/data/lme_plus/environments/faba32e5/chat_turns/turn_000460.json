  "content": "FIR (Finite Impulse Response) and IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters are two types of digital filters used in signal processing.\n\nFIR filters have a finite response to an impulse input, hence their name. They are characterized by a set of coefficients that determine the filter's transfer function and they can be easily designed to have linear phase response, which is important in many applications. FIR filters are generally stable, easy to design and implement, and are well suited for a wide range of applications such as filtering, decimation, and interpolation.\n\nIIR filters, on the other hand, have an infinite response to an impulse input and are characterized by a transfer function that includes both poles and zeros. This means that the output of an IIR filter is dependent on both the current and previous input values, which can result in a more complex frequency response. IIR filters are often used in applications where a more selective frequency response is required, such as filtering and equalization. However, the design of IIR filters can be more difficult than that of FIR filters, and they are more susceptible to instability, so care must be taken in their design and implementation.\n\nIn summary, both FIR and IIR filters have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the application.",
