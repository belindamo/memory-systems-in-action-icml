  "content": "Sure, here's some more code for the Smart Village OS:\n\nNew Feature: Smart Agriculture Management\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Smart Village OS can now manage smart agriculture in the village. This includes monitoring soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and plant growth, and automatically adjusting irrigation and fertilization systems as needed. Farmers can also access this information through a mobile app and receive notifications on their crops' status.\n```python\nclass AgricultureManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.soil_moisture_level = 0\n        self.weather_pattern = \"\"\n        self.plant_growth_status = \"\"\n\n    def monitor_soil_moisture_level(self):\n        # Monitor soil moisture level and update self.soil_moisture_level\n        pass\n\n    def monitor_weather_pattern(self):\n        # Monitor weather pattern and update self.weather_pattern\n        pass\n\n    def monitor_plant_growth(self):\n        # Monitor plant growth and update self.plant_growth_status\n        pass\n\n    def adjust_irrigation_system(self):\n        # Automatically adjust irrigation system based on self.soil_moisture_level\n        pass\n\n    def adjust_fertilization_system(self):\n        # Automatically adjust fertilization system based on self.plant_growth_status\n        pass\n\nclass Farmer:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.mobile_app = None\n        self.notifications = []\n\n    def connect_to_mobile_app(self, mobile_app):\n        self.mobile_app = mobile_app\n\n    def receive_notification(self, notification):\n        self.notifications.append(notification)\n```\nNew Feature: Smart Waste Management\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Smart Village OS can now manage smart waste management in the village. This includes monitoring waste levels, collecting waste on a regular schedule, and sorting recyclables. The system can also send notifications to residents when their waste is collected, reminding them to properly sort their waste.\n```python\nclass WasteManagement:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.waste_levels = {}\n        self.collection_schedule = {}\n        self.recyclables = []\n\n    def monitor_waste_levels(self):\n        # Monitor waste levels and update self.waste_levels\n        pass\n\n    def set_collection_schedule(self, schedule):\n        # Set the waste collection schedule\n        self.collection_schedule = schedule\n\n    def collect_waste(self):\n        # Collect waste based on self.collection_schedule and update self.waste_levels\n        pass\n\n    def sort_recyclables(self):\n        # Sort recyclables from non-recyclables\n        pass\n\n    def send_notification(self, resident):\n        # Send a notification to a resident when their waste is collected\n        pass\n\nclass Resident:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.notifications = []\n\n    def receive_notification(self, notification):\n        self.notifications.append(notification)\n```\nNew Feature: Smart Energy Management\n------------------------------------\n\nThe Smart Village OS can now manage smart energy in the village. This includes monitoring energy usage, optimizing energy consumption, and incorporating renewable energy sources. Residents can also monitor their energy usage and receive notifications when they are consuming more energy than usual.\n```python\nclass EnergyManagement:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.energy_usage = 0\n        self.renewable_energy_sources = []\n\n    def monitor_energy_usage(self):\n        # Monitor energy usage and update self.energy_usage\n        pass\n\n    def optimize_energy_consumption(self):\n        # Optimize energy consumption to reduce waste\n        pass\n\n    def incorporate_renewable_energy_sources(self):\n        # Incorporate renewable energy sources into the energy grid\n        pass\n\nclass Resident:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.energy_usage = 0\n        self.mobile_app = None\n        self.notifications = []\n\n    def connect_to_mobile_app(self, mobile_app):\n        self.mobile_app = mobile_app\n\n    def monitor_energy_usage(self):\n        # Monitor energy usage\n```",
