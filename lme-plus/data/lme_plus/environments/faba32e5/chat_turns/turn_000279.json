  "content": "Baked beans and potato salad are both classic BBQ sides that will complement your ribs and brisket perfectly.\n\nFor the ice, it's always better to have a little extra, but here's a rough estimate of how much ice you might need:\n\n* **Cooler size**: How big are your coolers? If you have small coolers, you'll need less ice. If you have large coolers, you'll need more.\n* **Number of guests**: How many guests are you expecting? More guests means more drinks, which means more ice.\n* **Duration of the party**: How long do you expect the party to last? If it's a short gathering, you might not need as much ice. If it's an all-day affair, you'll want to have more ice on hand.\n\nAs a rough estimate, here are some ice amounts for different cooler sizes:\n\n* Small cooler (20-30 quarts): 10-20 pounds of ice\n* Medium cooler (40-60 quarts): 20-40 pounds of ice\n* Large cooler (80-100 quarts): 40-60 pounds of ice\n\nRemember, this is just a rough estimate. If you're unsure, it's always better to err on the side of caution and get a little extra ice. You can always use it for future gatherings or store it in a freezer for later.\n\nAlso, don't forget to have plenty of cold drinks on hand to keep your guests hydrated and happy!\n\nI hope that helps, and I'm sure your BBQ party will be a huge success!",
