He used his influence over the German film industry to produce movies that promoted Nazi ideology and told a distorted history that suited his political agenda.\n\nAt first, Hitler's film career was perceived positively by the German public. Many of his films were successful, and Germans found them entertaining and engaging. However, as Hitler's political views became more extreme, the public began to view his films with suspicion and skepticism.\n\nBy the late 1930s, many Germans began to criticize Hitler's film propaganda for being too heavy-handed and lacking artistic merit. Some even began to question the factual basis of his films.\n\nDespite this, Hitler's use of film as a political tool was crucial to his rise to power. Through propaganda films, he was able to manipulate the public's perception of him and his political party, portraying them as the saviors of German culture and as heroic freedom fighters.\n\nIn conclusion, the public's perception of Hitler's film career evolved over time, with early successes gradually leading to suspicion and criticism. Nevertheless, the use of propaganda films remained a significant part of Hitler's political strategy, and it was instrumental in his rise to power.",
