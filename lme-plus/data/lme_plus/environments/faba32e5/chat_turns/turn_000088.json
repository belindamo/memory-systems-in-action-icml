  "content": "That's a great plan! Having a light snack like an apple or nuts will give you a gentle energy boost without making you feel too full or uncomfortable during the class. And don't forget to drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.\n\nYou've got this! You're well-prepared for your first yoga class. Remember to listen to your body, breathe deeply, and have fun. It's okay to modify or take breaks whenever you need to. The most important thing is to show up, be present, and enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you a wonderful first yoga class at Sahara Yoga Studio! May you find peace, calm, and flexibility on your yoga journey!",
