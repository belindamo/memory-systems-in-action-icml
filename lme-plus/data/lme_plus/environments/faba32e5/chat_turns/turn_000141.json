It's great that you're feeling motivated to get back to your desert diorama project, and I'm confident that breaking it down into smaller tasks and setting deadlines will help you make progress.\n\nAnd congratulations on your F-15E project! Three weeks is a great pace, and it's fantastic that you're enjoying the build process. Working in short sessions can be a great way to stay focused and maintain momentum.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the journey. Don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks or make mistakes \u2013 they're all part of the learning process. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need any advice or guidance along the way.\n\nKeep me updated on your progress, and I'd love to see some photos of your F-15E and desert diorama when they're complete!\n\nNow, go get 'em, and happy modeling!",
