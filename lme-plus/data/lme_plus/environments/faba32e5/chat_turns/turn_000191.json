  "content": "While the artists I mentioned earlier are known for their innovative and often immersive works, not all of them typically create interactive installations like the one you saw at the Modern Art Gallery. However, some of them have experimented with interactive or immersive elements in their practice. Here are a few examples:\n\n* **Takashi Murakami**: While not typically known for interactive installations, Murakami has created immersive environments and sculptures that blur the lines between art and entertainment. His works often feature bright colors, playful characters, and a sense of wonder.\n* **Cao Fei**: As a multimedia artist, Cao Fei has created interactive installations that incorporate virtual reality, video games, and other digital elements. Her works often explore the intersection of technology and the human experience.\n* **Anicka Yi**: Yi has created installations that incorporate sensory elements, such as scent and sound, to create immersive experiences. While not typically interactive in the sense of responding to movement, her works often invite viewers to engage with the space in a more tactile way.\n\nThat being said, there are other contemporary artists who specialize in interactive installations and might be of interest to you. Some examples include:\n\n* **Rafael Lozano-Hemmer**: A Mexican-Canadian artist known for his interactive installations that use biometrics, robotics, and other technologies to create immersive experiences.\n* **Random International** (as I mentioned earlier): A collective that creates interactive installations that respond to sound, movement, and other environmental factors.\n* **Anthony McCall**: A British artist who creates immersive installations that use light, fog, and other materials to create interactive environments.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many other artists exploring interactive installations and immersive experiences in their work. I hope this helps!",
