It can range from a light, golden oak to a darker, richer brown.\n2. **Grain:** Oak has a prominent, coarse grain pattern that adds texture and character to the wood.\n3. **Durability:** Oak is a hardwood that's known for its strength and durability. It's resistant to scratches and dents, making it a great choice for a coffee table.\n4. **Style:** Oak is a classic, timeless choice that works well with traditional, rustic, or country-style decor.\n\n**Walnut:**\n\n1. **Color:** Walnut has a rich, dark brown color with a slightly purplish or reddish undertone. It can range from a light, brownish walnut to a very dark, almost black walnut.\n2. **Grain:** Walnut has a fine, straight grain pattern that's often less prominent than oak.\n3. **Durability:** Walnut is also a hardwood that's known for its strength and durability. It's slightly softer than oak, but still resistant to scratches and dents.\n4. **Style:** Walnut is a sophisticated, elegant choice that works well with modern, contemporary, or luxurious decor.\n\nConsidering your rug's color and the cozy, intimate feel of your living room, I think either oak or walnut could work well. However, here are some factors to consider:\n\n* If your rug has a lighter, more golden tone, oak might be a better fit. Oak's warm, honey-brown color will complement the rug's color and add a sense of coziness to the room.\n* If your rug has a darker, richer tone, walnut might be a better fit. Walnut's dark, luxurious color will create a sophisticated, dramatic look that complements the rug's color.\n\nUltimately, the decision comes down to your personal style and the overall aesthetic you want to achieve in your living room. You might also consider factors like the color of your walls, furniture, and decor to ensure the coffee table fits in harmoniously.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could consider the following:\n\n* Look for online images of oak and walnut coffee tables to get a better sense of how each wood type looks in a living room setting.\n* Read reviews and product descriptions to learn more about the durability and maintenance requirements of each wood type.\n* Visit a furniture store or showroom to see oak and walnut coffee tables in person and get a feel for the wood's texture and grain pattern.\n\nI hope this helps you make a decision!",
