  "content": "Yes, the first scheduled commercial airline flight was on January 1, 1914. It was operated by St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line in Florida, USA, and traveled 21 miles across the Tampa Bay to St. Petersburg. The flight took about 23 minutes, and the plane used for the flight was a Benoist XIV biplane. The airline charged $5 for a one-way ticket, which is equivalent to about $130 today. The inaugural flight was a success, and the airline continued to operate until 1917 when it halted due to several incidents, including a crash that destroyed their only plane. The airline industry continued to grow, with airlines offering more routes, larger planes, and more amenities to their passengers. Today, millions of people around the world travel on commercial airline flights daily.",
