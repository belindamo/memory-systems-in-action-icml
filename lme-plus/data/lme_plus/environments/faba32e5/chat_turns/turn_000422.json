  "content": "Yes, I believe the play's focus on societal expectations and the impact they have on individuals is still very relevant today. Even in modern times, we continue to see people being judged and discriminated against for going against gender norms, cultural norms, and religious norms. In many ways, the play's emphasis on the societal struggle between individuality and conformity is even more relevant and important today in many societies. The play serves as a warning that adhering to societal expectations can lead to someone's downfall, as well as a call to recognize and address the negative impact of societal expectations on individuals.
