  "content": "Considering my audience demographics, I think it's a great idea to share my own experiences and challenges in STEM fields. As you mentioned, it can help build trust and authenticity with my audience, and showcase my expertise in the field. Since 320 out of my 500 followers are women, I believe sharing my own story can help create a sense of relatability and inspire them to pursue careers in STEM. I'll make sure to keep it relevant, balanced, and respectful of my audience's boundaries. Thanks for the advice!",
