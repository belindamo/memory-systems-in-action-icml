  "content": "Coin collecting is a fascinating hobby! I'm happy to help.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on finding a 1879 Morgan Dollar at a great price! However, I have to clarify that the 1879 Morgan Dollar is not particularly rare. In fact, it's one of the most common Morgan Dollar dates. According to the NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation), over 14 million 1879 Morgan Dollars were minted, making it a relatively abundant coin.\n\nThat being said, the value of a coin depends on its condition, rarity, and demand. If your coin is in excellent condition, with minimal wear and tear, it could be worth more than its face value. But without more information, it's difficult to determine its exact value.\n\nFor coin collecting resources, I recommend the following:\n\n**Websites:**\n\n1. **NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation)**: A leading third-party coin grading service that provides coin pricing, population reports, and coin information.\n2. **PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service)**: Another reputable coin grading service that offers coin pricing, population reports, and coin information.\n3. **CoinWeek**: A comprehensive online resource for coin news, articles, and market analysis.\n4. **Coin Collecting News**: A website dedicated to coin collecting news, reviews, and resources.\n\n**Books:**\n\n1. **\"A Guide Book of Morgan Silver Dollars\" by Q. David Bowers**: A comprehensive guide to Morgan Dollars, covering history, mintages, and values.\n2. **\"The Red Book: A Guide Book of United States Coins\" by R.S. Yeoman**: A classic reference book for U.S. coins, covering history, mintages, and values.\n\n**Online Forums and Communities:**\n\n1. **CoinTalk**: A popular online forum for coin collectors, with discussion boards, market analysis, and resources.\n2. **Reddit's r/coincollecting**: A subreddit dedicated to coin collecting, with a community of enthusiasts and experts.\n\n**Local Coin Shops and Dealers:**\n\n1. **Visit local coin shops**: Build relationships with reputable coin dealers and learn from their expertise.\n2. **Attend coin shows and auctions**: Network with other collectors, dealers, and experts to learn more about the hobby.\n\nRemember to always research and due diligence when buying or selling coins, and be cautious of counterfeits or misattributed coins.\n\nI hope you find these resources helpful in your coin collecting journey!",
