  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific information regarding the new Metro lines or the surrounding areas of each station. However, in general, the construction of new Metro lines and stations can have both positive and negative effects on traffic patterns on surface streets. \n\nOn one hand, the addition of new Metro stations can potentially reduce traffic congestion by encouraging people to use public transportation instead of driving. This could lead to fewer cars on the road, which could result in improved traffic flow and reduced travel times on surface streets. \n\nOn the other hand, the construction of new Metro lines and stations can also disrupt traffic patterns during construction. Road closures, detours, and other temporary changes to traffic patterns may be necessary to accommodate construction vehicles and workers. Additionally, if the Metro stations are located in densely populated areas that are already prone to traffic congestion, the construction of the new lines could potentially worsen traffic conditions on surface streets. \n\nUltimately, the impact of the new Metro lines on traffic patterns will depend on a variety of factors, including the location of the stations, the volume of people using the new lines, and the infrastructure and road network surrounding each station.",
