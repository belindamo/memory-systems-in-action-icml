  "content": "I've been experimenting with stevia in my sugar-free mojitos, and I've found that it works really well with mint flavors. I've also been trying to reduce my sugar intake, so I'm excited to try out more stevia-based cocktails. By the way, have you heard about that new craft distillery in town that's making some unique flavored vodkas? I heard their grapefruit and rosemary flavor is amazing.",
