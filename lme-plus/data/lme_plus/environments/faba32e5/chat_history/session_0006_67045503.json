Here are some suggestions to help you collect the photos without giving away the surprise:\n\n1. **Ask family members for help**: Reach out to your dad, siblings, aunts, uncles, or grandparents and ask them to contribute photos from their collections. They might have some great shots that your mom hasn't seen in years.\n2. **Raid the family photo albums**: Sneak into your parents' home when your mom is out and browse through their photo albums, scrapbooks, or boxes. You might find some hidden gems that you can scan or copy.\n3. **Dig through old digital files**: If your family has a shared computer or cloud storage, search for old digital photos. You might find some forgotten files or albums that your mom hasn't looked at in a while.\n4. **Check social media and online platforms**: Look through your mom's social media profiles, Google Photos, or other online platforms where she might have uploaded photos. You can download or screenshot the ones you like.\n5. **Ask friends and neighbors**: If your mom has close friends or neighbors who have known her for a long time, they might have some great photos of her from various occasions. Just make sure to ask them to keep the surprise a secret!\n6. **Scan old prints**: If you find old prints or negatives, consider scanning them to digitize the photos. You can use a scanner or take them to a local photo printing shop.\n\nRemember to be respectful of your mom's privacy and only take photos that you're sure she won't mind you using. Also, be careful not to leave any digital trails or clues that might give away the surprise.\n\nOnce you've gathered the photos, you can upload them to Shutterfly and create the personalized album. Make sure to keep the album hidden until the big reveal on your mom's birthday!\n\nHow do you plan to present the album to your mom on her birthday? Do you have any special plans or ideas?"
