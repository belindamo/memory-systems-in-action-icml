She also drew inspiration from Mexican folk art, which she incorporated into her paintings through vivid colors and intricate patterns. Kahlo's work was deeply personal and often depicted her physical and emotional pain, as well as her Mexican heritage and cultural identity. She was also heavily influenced by the Surrealist movement, which helped her explore her own inner consciousness and dreams. Overall, Kahlo's unique perspective was shaped by her personal struggles and cultural background, as well as her connection to Surrealist and folk art movements."
