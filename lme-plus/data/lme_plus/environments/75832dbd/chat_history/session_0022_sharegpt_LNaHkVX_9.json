The students in this case is still on the beginner curriculum. This clinic should be practical, collaborative, cover all key area of the beginner curriculum, and should provide the learner hands-on practical experience."

      "content": "Great idea! Here's a proposal for an online digital product design clinic for beginners:\n\nOverview:\nThe online digital product design clinic is designed to provide beginner learners with practical, hands-on experience in digital product design. The clinic will simulate real-world projects to enable students to learn by doing. Students will work in teams to design digital products for clients with specific needs, goals, and requirements.\n\nStructure:\nThe clinic will be structured into three phases: research, design, and testing. Each phase will last four weeks and will culminate in a deliverable that demonstrates the student's understanding and application of the beginner curriculum. At the end of the clinic, students will have completed a portfolio-worthy digital product design project.\n\nPhase 1: Research (4 weeks)\n\n* Students will be divided into teams and assigned a client with specific needs and requirements.\n* Students will conduct user research to gain a deep understanding of the target audience, market trends, and user needs.\n* Students will create user personas, user journey maps, and conduct a competitive analysis.\n* Students will present their research findings to the client and receive feedback.\n\nPhase 2: Design (4 weeks)\n\n* Students will use their research findings to ideate, sketch, and create wireframes for their digital product design.\n* Students will create user flows, sitemaps, and design mockups.\n* Students will present their design solutions to the client and receive feedback.\n* Students will iterate on their design solutions based on client feedback.\n\nPhase 3: Testing (4 weeks)\n\n* Students will conduct usability testing to validate their design solutions.\n* Students will create high-fidelity prototypes and conduct user testing.\n* Students will refine their design solutions based on user testing feedback.\n* Students will present their final design solutions to the client.\n\nDelivery:\nThe online digital product design clinic will be delivered through a learning management system (LMS) that includes instructional videos, readings, assignments, and quizzes. Each phase will include weekly team meetings with a mentor who will provide guidance, support, and feedback on students' work. The final deliverable will be a portfolio-worthy digital product design project that students can use to showcase their skills and experience.\n\nBenefits:\nThe online digital product design clinic offers a collaborative and practical learning environment that enables students to apply their beginner curriculum knowledge to real-world projects. By working on a project with a client, students will learn how to communicate with clients, manage project timelines, and work in a team. Additionally, students will have a portfolio-worthy project to showcase their skills to potential employers."
