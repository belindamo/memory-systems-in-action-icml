FNIs allow for communication between the nervous system and an external device by acting as a transducer. In essence, FNIs can take external signals, such as ultrasound or light, and convert them into electrical signals that can cause the neuron to fire. Examples of these types of FNIs can be seen in using piezo crystals to convert ultrasound into electricity and optogenetic technology to stimulate neurons in rodents [1,2]. Despite these revolutionary successes, many current FNIs are highly invasive, not feasible in humans, and can only record from, at most, one region of the brain. A system that allows for both modulation and observation of neurons while being minimally invasive is crucial for advancing both the fields of FNIs and neuroscience as a whole. Nanotransducers show great promise as a means of allowing for high-resolution, bidirectional communication with the brain. Unlike conventional brain-computer interfaces such as microelectrode arrays, nanotransducers would record and write to individual neurons. Due to their size, they could allow for targeted, minimally invasive implementation, such as by injection. The nanotranducers would be bound to a ligand. The three options for external stimulation are light, ultrasound, and magnetism. However, one of the main problems with external stimulation is the depth of stimulation. However, nanotransducers may solve this problem by acting as relays, carrying the external signal deeper into the brain. Given the potential of nanotransducers, I plan on conducting further research into them as a means of an FNI. My proposed study evaluates the properties of different nanotransducers and considers if the nanotransducers are suitable for such a system.\nRESEARCH PLAN: In a recent study, nano-functional interfaces were studied for their ability to improve electrodes, image neurons, and stimulate neurons[3]. For my research, I plan on building on their work by investigating further the nFNIs that showed the most potential in their study. Additionally, I plan on exploring which nFNI(s) would be optimal for a communication relay between other transducers. My current hypothesis is that a combination of specialized imaging transducers, specialized stimulation transducers, and specialized relay transducers would be needed for stable bidirectional communication with the brain. Using my experience with Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), I plan to use them as the model system in my investigation. Given the complete understanding of their genome and connectome, they are the ideal candidates to use in this study. The placement of the nanotransducers is another crucial aspect of this study that will need to be investigated. Ideally, the placement of the nanotransducers would be stable yet reversible. Still, their size would allow them to be transported into the neurons, which would hinder their removal from the system and potentially be toxic to the cell. My study\u2019s three objectives will be to find the optimal nanotransducers for imaging neurons, stimulating neurons, and relaying signals. \nOBJECTIVE 1:What is the optimal method for imaging individual neurons on an individual level? To best understand neural dynamics, it is essential to image individual neurons across the brain. Two of the prevailing methods of imaging neurons are microelectrode arrays and calcium imaging. As stated above, microelectrode arrays are highly invasive and would not allow for recording from a large region of the brain. Calcium imaging is the technique of tracking Ca2+ ions as a means to track neural activity. However, it is ineffective for accurate real-time tracking of electrical activity[4]. This experiment will investigate quantum dot imaging, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, and genetically encoded voltage indicators C. elegans. These imaging methods have shown promise, in recent studies, for biomedical imaging of neurons [5, 6, 7]. I hypothesize that genetically encoded voltage indicators will prove to be the most effective signaling neuronal activity method. The patch-clamp technique and calcium imaging will be utilized as controls to see if the signal shown is accurate. \nOBJECTIVE 2: What is the optimal method for minimally invasive stimulation of neurons?\nStandard neural stimulation techniques such as electrodes deliver electrical signals to the targeted area of stimulation of the nervous system targeted area. The most common example of this is deep brain stimulation devices. These devices are pulse generators connected to long electrodes that carry signals to the brain\u2019s targeted region. While these devices have proven successful in treating certain diseases [8], they are highly invasive and carry risks of infection, tissue damage, and other surgical complications [9]. To bypass this invasiveness, I propose the use of nFNIs as an alternative for electrode-based stimulation. The external signal would be received by the nFNI, which would then modulate the nearby neuron. I expect that, due to their size, it would take multiple nFNIs to receive the signal for the neuron to fire. Ideally, the neuron\u2019s modulation would be enough to make the neuron fire consistently without damaging the cell. In this experiment, I will compare magnetoelectric, piezoelectric, and optoelectric nanotransducers to test whether nFNIs is a suitable advancement in the field of neurostimulation[3]. The experiment would consist of using a giant squid axon as the recipient of stimulation. C. elegans will not be used in this experiment to control for potential discrepancies in behavior between trials. A microelectrode will serve as the baseline for this experiment to measure the nFNIs against conventional stimulation methods. \nOBJECTIVE 3: Is it possible to use nFNIs as signal relays? One of the most considerable problems with non-invasive stimulation and imaging of neurons is that signals are dispersed or attenuated as they pass through the skull and tissue matter. Typically, the trade-off for having a stable signal deeper into the brain is by being more invasive. However, I hypothesize that nFNIs can be used as a relay system to send and receive external devices\u2019 signals. The hypothesis is based on the neurons themselves. In the example of an imaging nFNI, it would receive the information of a neuron firing and transduce the signal. A nearby relay nFNI would then relay that signal until it reached the skull where the signal could be read. The process would function conversely for signals sent to the specific neuron. In this experiment, I will investigate if this system is feasible and accurate. C. elegans will be immobilized. To simulate human tissue and bone, a material embedded with the nFNI being tested will be placed on top of the C. elegans. Using the previous results from the other experiments, the optimal imaging method and stimulation method will be implemented in the model. The test would consist of attempting to image and stimulate the model\u2019s neurons through this material. The relayed signals would then be compared to the actual signals to see if this method is feasible. \nINTELLECTUAL MERIT: In this study, I aim to further the current state of the art of functional neural interfaces by introducing a potentially minimally invasive, biocompatible neural interface. The field of functional neural interfaces is beginning to come to the forefront of neuroscience. Programs such as DARPA\u2019s Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology are evidence of the field heading towards needing an improved method of bidirectional communication with neurons. With this study, I plan to shed light on a potential path that will move the field of neuroscience further.\nBROADER IMPACTS: The proposed study has many biomedical applications as well as societal applications. If such a system were proved feasible, medical imaging of the brain would increase drastically, which would help diagnose many neurological disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and epilepsy. Additionally, suppose single neurons could be stimulated on a whole-brain level. In that case, the system may prove to be used to treat those disorders more efficiently without the need for surgeries. The use of nFNIs as relays could also help with traditional non-invasive imaging methods such as electroencephalogram because it could bring signals from deeper within the brain towards the scalp. \nFUTURE DIRECTIONS: The long-term goal of this study is to build a bidirectional neural interface. To do this, more information is needed on neural dynamics to understand how modulating neurons may affect the system as a whole. A future study may entail the training of a neural decoder with the behavior of a model. Then, I would attempt to stimulate neurons in the model to repeat the observed behavior. Many insights into neural circuitry could be obtained from such a study. With a means of receiving input from the neurons and giving output to them, artificial intelligence could be utilized to build the optimal decoder. \n\"\n: Damian, here is an example of a application I wrote, please remember all of the details about me and my writing style.3 / 3"
