Here are some gin recommendations that pair well with Campari:\n\n1. **Plymouth Gin**: A classic pairing, Plymouth Gin's slightly sweeter and more subtle flavor profile complements the bitterness of Campari. The fruit and spice notes in Plymouth Gin will enhance the overall harmony of the Negroni.\n2. **Bombay Sapphire**: This popular London Dry Gin's crisp, citrusy flavor and moderate juniper presence work well with Campari's bold, bitter character. The citrus notes will help cut through the richness of the Campari.\n3. **Beefeater London Dry Gin**: Another classic London Dry Gin, Beefeater's bold juniper flavor and subtle fruit notes will stand up to the Campari's bitterness. The result is a well-balanced Negroni with a robust flavor profile.\n4. **G'Vine Floraison**: If you want to add a floral twist to your Negroni, try G'Vine Floraison. This French gin's grape-based spirit and floral notes (like grapeflower and jasmine) will add a unique dimension to the drink.\n5. **Sipsmith London Dry Gin**: Sipsmith's juniper-forward flavor profile, combined with a hint of sweetness and citrus, will create a well-rounded Negroni. The gin's boldness will stand up to the Campari without overpowering it.\n6. **The Botanist**: If you prefer a more complex, botanical-driven gin, The Botanist's 22-botanical blend will add depth and nuance to your Negroni. The subtle fruit and floral notes will complement the Campari nicely.\n7. **Death's Door Gin**: For a more modern take, try Death's Door Gin from Wisconsin. Its crisp, clean flavor profile, with notes of juniper, coriander, and citrus, will create a refreshing Negroni with a hint of sweetness.\n8. **Ransom Old Tom Gin**: If you want to experiment with a more historical take on the Negroni, try Ransom Old Tom Gin. Its sweeter, more botanical-driven flavor profile will add a fascinating twist to the classic cocktail.\n\nRemember, the key to a great Negroni is balance.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The ideal ratio of gin to Campari to sweet vermouth for a classic Negroni is a topic of much debate among bartenders and enthusiasts. However, the traditional and most widely accepted ratio is:\n\n* 1 part Gin\n* 1 part Campari\n* 1 part Sweet Vermouth\n\nThis 1:1:1 ratio is often referred to as the \"classic\" or \"traditional\" Negroni ratio. This balance allows each ingredient to shine while maintaining a harmonious balance of flavors.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of what this ratio looks like in terms of measurement:\n\n* 1 1/2 oz (45 ml) Gin\n* 1 1/2 oz (45 ml) Campari\n* 1 1/2 oz (45 ml) Sweet Vermouth\n\nStir all three ingredients with ice, then strain into a chilled coupe or rocks glass filled with ice. Garnish with an orange twist, and you have a classic Negroni.\n\nSome variations of the Negroni ratio include:\n\n* 2:1:1 (more gin-forward, with a stronger botanical presence)\n* 1:2:1 (more Campari-forward, with a bolder, bitter flavor)\n* 1:1:2 (more sweet vermouth-forward, with a richer, sweeter flavor)\n\nFeel free to experiment with different ratios to find your perfect Negroni. However, the traditional 1:1:1 ratio is a great starting point, and it's hard to go wrong with this classic combination."

      "content": "While bitters can add depth and complexity to a Negroni, their impact is relatively subtle compared to the gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth. In a classic Negroni, the bitters are often considered a \"seasoning\" or an \"accent\" rather than a primary flavor component.\n\nThat being said, the type of bitters you use can still make a difference, especially if you're looking to fine-tune the flavor profile of your Negroni. Here's how different bitters can influence your Negroni:\n\n* **Angostura bitters**: These are the most traditional and commonly used bitters in a Negroni. They add a warm, spicy, and slightly sweet flavor that complements the botanicals in the gin and the bitterness of the Campari.\n* **Orange bitters**: These bitters can enhance the citrus notes in the Negroni, particularly when paired with a citrus-forward gin. They can also add a subtle sweetness and a hint of orange peel flavor.\n* **Other bitter flavors**: If you want to experiment with different bitter flavors, you can try using bitters like chocolate mole, lavender, or cardamom. These can add unique and interesting twists to your Negroni, but be cautious not to overpower the other ingredients.\n\nWhen it comes to the quantity of bitters, a few dashes (about 2-3) are usually sufficient. You can adjust the amount to your taste, but remember that bitters are potent, and a little goes a long way.\n\nIn summary, while the type of bitters you use can make a difference, it's still the gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth that form the foundation of a great Negroni. Experiment with different bitters to find the flavor profile you enjoy the most, but don't be afraid to focus on the quality and balance of the main ingredients first."

Don't be afraid to combine different citrus peels or twists to create a unique flavor profile."
