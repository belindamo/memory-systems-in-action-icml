  "content": "Great idea! Here's a proposal for an online digital product design clinic for beginners:\n\nOverview:\nThe online digital product design clinic is designed to provide beginner learners with practical, hands-on experience in digital product design. The clinic will simulate real-world projects to enable students to learn by doing. Students will work in teams to design digital products for clients with specific needs, goals, and requirements.\n\nStructure:\nThe clinic will be structured into three phases: research, design, and testing. Each phase will last four weeks and will culminate in a deliverable that demonstrates the student's understanding and application of the beginner curriculum. At the end of the clinic, students will have completed a portfolio-worthy digital product design project.\n\nPhase 1: Research (4 weeks)\n\n* Students will be divided into teams and assigned a client with specific needs and requirements.\n* Students will conduct user research to gain a deep understanding of the target audience, market trends, and user needs.\n* Students will create user personas, user journey maps, and conduct a competitive analysis.\n* Students will present their research findings to the client and receive feedback.\n\nPhase 2: Design (4 weeks)\n\n* Students will use their research findings to ideate, sketch, and create wireframes for their digital product design.\n* Students will create user flows, sitemaps, and design mockups.\n* Students will present their design solutions to the client and receive feedback.\n* Students will iterate on their design solutions based on client feedback.\n\nPhase 3: Testing (4 weeks)\n\n* Students will conduct usability testing to validate their design solutions.\n* Students will create high-fidelity prototypes and conduct user testing.\n* Students will refine their design solutions based on user testing feedback.\n* Students will present their final design solutions to the client.\n\nDelivery:\nThe online digital product design clinic will be delivered through a learning management system (LMS) that includes instructional videos, readings, assignments, and quizzes. Each phase will include weekly team meetings with a mentor who will provide guidance, support, and feedback on students' work. The final deliverable will be a portfolio-worthy digital product design project that students can use to showcase their skills and experience.\n\nBenefits:\nThe online digital product design clinic offers a collaborative and practical learning environment that enables students to apply their beginner curriculum knowledge to real-world projects. By working on a project with a client, students will learn how to communicate with clients, manage project timelines, and work in a team. Additionally, students will have a portfolio-worthy project to showcase their skills to potential employers.",
