  "content": "I cannot offer personal opinions, but i can say that the idea of a divine ruler can indeed cause conflicts with more secular societies, especially when a divine ruler is seen as above the law or when their rule is authoritarian or oppressive. this can create tensions within a nation or between nations, as secular societies may view divine rulers as illegitimate or as obstacles to democratic governance or human rights. at the same time, religious groups may feel a strong attachment to their divine leader and may resist attempts to curtail their influence. balancing these tensions can be a delicate task for policymakers, as they must balance the desires of different groups within society while upholding the principles of democracy and human rights.",
