Here's an updated morning routine that incorporates your products:\n\n**Morning Routine:**\n\n1. **Cleanse**: Start with your favorite facial cleanser from Sephora. Make sure to massage it onto your face gently, then rinse with lukewarm water.\n2. **Tone**: Use a toner that helps balance your skin's pH, such as Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel or Pixi Glow Tonic. This will help remove any remaining impurities and prepare your skin for the next steps.\n3. **Essence**: Apply an essence that provides an extra layer of hydration, like Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence or SK-II PITERA Essence. This will help your skin absorb the subsequent products better.\n4. **Moisturize**: Apply your favorite moisturizer from Sephora. Since you want to use it in the morning, make sure it's a lightweight, oil-free formula that won't clog pores or feel heavy under makeup.\n5. **Eye Care**: Dot a small amount of your favorite eye cream from Sephora around your orbital bone, gently patting it in with your ring finger. This will help address any concerns specific to the delicate skin around your eyes.\n6. **Sunscreen**: Finish off with a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30, such as La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Sunscreen Milk or EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46. This is crucial for daily protection against UV damage.\n\nBy incorporating your favorite products, you'll be able to enjoy their benefits while still following a well-rounded morning routine. Remember to adjust the amounts and layering based on your individual skin type and concerns.\n\nHow does this revised routine sound?",
