  "content": "Pan-searing is a fantastic way to cook chicken breast. When it comes to seasonings and oils, the possibilities are endless, but here are some popular combinations to get you started:\n\n**Classic Seasonings:**\n\n1. **Salt, Pepper, and Garlic:** A timeless trio that's hard to beat. Mix minced garlic with salt and pepper for a savory flavor.\n2. **Italian-Style:** Combine dried oregano, basil, thyme, and rosemary for a herby flavor profile.\n3. **Lemon Pepper:** Mix lemon zest, black pepper, and a pinch of salt for a bright and citrusy flavor.\n\n**Oils:**\n\n1. **Olive Oil:** A classic choice for pan-searing, olive oil adds a rich, fruity flavor.\n2. **Avocado Oil:** Mild and buttery, avocado oil is perfect for delicate flavors.\n3. **Coconut Oil:** Adds a subtle coconut flavor and a high smoke point, making it ideal for high-heat cooking.\n\n**Marinades and Rubs:**\n\n1. **Balsamic Glaze:** A sweet and tangy glaze made by reducing balsamic vinegar. Brush it on during the last minute of cooking.\n2. **Chimichurri:** Mix parsley, oregano, garlic, red pepper flakes, red wine vinegar, and olive oil for a fresh and herby flavor.\n3. **Korean-Style:** Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil for a sweet and savory flavor.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n1. **Cajun Spice:** A blend of paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder adds a spicy kick.\n2. **Indian-Style:** Mix garam masala, cumin, coriander, and turmeric for a warm and aromatic flavor.\n3. **Mexican-Style:** Combine lime juice, cumin, chili powder, and paprika for a bold and zesty flavor.\n\nRemember, you can always mix and match seasonings, oils, and marinades to create your own unique flavor profiles. Don't be afraid to experiment and find what works best for you!\n\nFor pan-searing, I recommend using a medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C) and a small amount of oil in the pan. Cook the chicken breast for 5-7 minutes per side, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nGood luck, and I hope your chicken breast turns out juicy and delicious!",
