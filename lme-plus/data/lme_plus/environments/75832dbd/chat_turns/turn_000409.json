  "content": "Val noticed something different about Odyl immediately. They had always had an edge to their interactions, a sparring of sorts, but this time Odyl seemed different. There was a sadness and seriousness to them that Val had never seen before.\n\nAs they worked together on the mission, Val found herself drawn to Odyl's new demeanor. They spent more time together than they ever had before, and Val felt a connection with Odyl that she hadn't felt with anyone in a long time.\n\nOver time, Val found herself thinking about Odyl more and more, and those thoughts were accompanied by feelings that she hadn't allowed herself to experience in years. It was a strange mix of excitement, fear, and uncertainty that made Val both nervous and exhilarated.",
