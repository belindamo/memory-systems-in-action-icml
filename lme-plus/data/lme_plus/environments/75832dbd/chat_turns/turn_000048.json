You have overcome challenges before, and you will do so again. Take things one day at a time, and don't be afraid to reach out to loved ones for support. Remember that you are not alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to help. Take some time to focus on self-care and do things that bring you joy and comfort. And above all, remember that things will get better with time.",
