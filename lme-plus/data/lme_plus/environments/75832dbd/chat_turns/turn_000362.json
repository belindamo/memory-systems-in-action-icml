  "content": "Yes, spare parts are carried to the International Space Station for maintenance and repair purposes. In fact, NASA maintains an inventory of spare parts and equipment on Earth for the International Space Station. Spare parts and equipment are transported to the station via cargo vehicles, such as SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft. If a component or system on the station fails and is beyond repair, a new replacement component is sent to the station to be installed. However, sometimes astronauts can troubleshoot and repair a problem while still in space, avoiding the need for a new component to be sent up.",
