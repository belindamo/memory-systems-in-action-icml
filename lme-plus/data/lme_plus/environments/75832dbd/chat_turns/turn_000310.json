  "content": "Understood. Here is the modified synopsis:\n\nThe old woman enters her cramped apartment, exhausted and on the verge of tears. She is followed by her neighbor, who is carrying a bag of cooking utensils. As the old woman hands over the utensils, her husband discreetly hides a letter in his back pocket without her noticing. The old woman cracks jokes about her past life with the neighbor, who suggests that maybe she can become as good of a cook as the old woman. The old woman thanks the neighbor and, once she leaves, her husband brings up his lottery ticket and suggests that maybe their luck is about to change. The old woman, however, is fed up with his irresponsible behavior and the constant financial strain it puts on their lives. She lashes out at him, throwing him out of the apartment. As he walks the streets, the old woman's husband tears up the rejection letter from the cooking competition, a last ditch effort to try and make things right with his wife. He enters a gambling shop, then we see a jump cut to him and the old woman hugging with happiness in their apartment because she got in the cooking competition. The husband borrowed money and bribed people to get her in without her knowing it.\n\nThe old woman and her husband are overjoyed when she is accepted into the competition, but as she stands there at the competition, feeling defeated and alone after her dishes are rejected by the judges and her confidence shaken, her husband appears and comforts her, reminding her of the passion and talent that drove her to pursue her dreams in the first place. However, her reliance on ancient rituals and spells in her cooking begins to transform her, both physically and emotionally. She is haunted by the memories of her husband and driven by fear to seek out the forbidden knowledge of black magic in an attempt to find a way to bring him back.",
