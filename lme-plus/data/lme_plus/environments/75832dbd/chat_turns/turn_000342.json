I can only provide general information and assistance.\n\nYou might want to consider asking the director for their address or directions to their house, or checking with them to see if they can provide transportation or carpooling options. You could also use a mapping or GPS service like Google Maps or Waze to get directions from your house to the director's house once you have their address.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!",
