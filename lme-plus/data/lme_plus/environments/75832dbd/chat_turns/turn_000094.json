I'm glad to hear you're already using reusable containers from Thrive Market \u2013 that's a great step towards reducing waste.\n\nNow, let's dive into some tips on how to store your prepped meals to keep them fresh for a long time:\n\n**Cooling and Refrigeration:**\n\n1. **Cool meals quickly**: After cooking, cool your meals to room temperature within 2 hours to prevent bacterial growth.\n2. **Refrigerate promptly**: Refrigerate your cooled meals within 30 minutes of cooking. This will help prevent bacterial growth and keep your meals fresh.\n3. **Label and date containers**: Clearly label each container with the meal name, date, and any reheating instructions.\n\n**Container Tips:**\n\n1. **Airtight containers**: Use airtight, leak-proof containers to prevent air from entering and spoiling your meals.\n2. **Portion control**: Divide your meals into individual portions to maintain freshness and prevent cross-contamination.\n3. **Container size**: Choose containers that fit the portion size you're preparing to minimize empty space and prevent moisture buildup.\n\n**Storage and Organization:**\n\n1. **Store in the correct zone**: Place containers in the coldest part of the refrigerator, usually the bottom shelf, to maintain a consistent temperature.\n2. **Organize by meal type**: Group similar meals together (e.g., all lunches or all dinners) to make it easy to grab-and-go.\n3. **Freezer storage**: If you're meal prepping for an extended period, consider freezing meals in airtight containers or freezer bags. Label and date them, and store in the freezer for up to 3-4 months.\n\n**Reheating and Safety:**\n\n1. **Reheat safely**: Reheat meals to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n2. **Use within 3-5 days**: Consume refrigerated meals within 3-5 days of cooking. If you're unsure, it's always better to err on the side of caution and discard the meal.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep your meal preps fresh, safe, and ready to enjoy throughout the week!\n\nRemember to always check the specific storage instructions for the ingredients you're using, as some may have special requirements.
