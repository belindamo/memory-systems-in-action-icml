They have a slightly sweeter, more citrus-forward flavor profile than some other brands, which can work well in a Negroni.\n4. **Peychaud's Orange Bitters**: Peychaud's is a New Orleans-based brand that's been around since the 1800s. Their Orange Bitters have a unique flavor profile that's both citrusy and slightly sweet, with hints of spice and herbs.

You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess bitters from the drink.\n\nRemember, the key to a great Negroni is balance. Experiment with different citrus bitters to find the one that harmonizes best with your gin and Campari.",
