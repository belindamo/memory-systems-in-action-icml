First, kudos to you for taking the initiative to attend a social media workshop and learn new strategies!\n\nCommenting on other people's posts is an excellent way to start building relationships and establishing yourself as an active and engaged member of your online community. Here are some additional tips to help you improve your online engagement:\n\n1. **Be authentic and respectful**: Always maintain a respectful tone, even when disagreeing with someone. Avoid being confrontational or argumentative, as it can quickly escalate into an online brawl (like your Reddit experience).\n2. **Add value**: Instead of just saying \"Great post!\", try to add something meaningful to the conversation. Share your own experience, ask a question, or provide additional information related to the topic.\n3. **Use humor (carefully)**: Humor can be an effective way to connect with others online, but be mindful of your audience and the context. Avoid sarcasm or jokes that might be misinterpreted.\n4. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to what others are saying and show that you're interested in their thoughts and opinions. Ask follow-up questions or respond with a thoughtful comment.\n5. **Be consistent**: Regularly engage with others on social media to build relationships and establish your online presence. Try to set aside time each week to comment, share, and interact with others.\n6. **Use social listening**: Monitor hashtags and keywords related to your niche to stay informed about current topics and trends. This can help you join relevant conversations and provide valuable insights.\n7. **Keep it concise**: Online attention spans are short, so keep your comments brief and to the point. Aim for 1-2 sentences at most.\n8. **Avoid controversy**: Steer clear of sensitive or controversial topics that might attract negative attention or spark heated debates. Stick to topics that align with your values and expertise.\n9. **Engage with influencers**: Reach out to influencers in your niche and engage with their content. This can help you build relationships and potentially open up opportunities for collaborations or guest posts.\n10. **Track your engagement**: Monitor your online engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments, shares) to see what's working and what areas need improvement.\n\nRemember, online engagement is a two-way street. Be open to feedback, willing to learn, and patient with building relationships. Good luck, and I hope these tips help you improve your online engagement!",
