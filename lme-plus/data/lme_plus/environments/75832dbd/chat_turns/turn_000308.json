  "content": "Here is the revised synopsis:\n\nThe old woman enters her cramped apartment, cracking jokes about her past life with her neighbor, who is carrying a bag of cooking utensils. As the old woman hands over the utensils to the neighbor, her husband discreetly hides a letter in his back pocket without her noticing. The old woman thanks the neighbor, but doesn't acknowledge her husband. As the neighbor leaves, the old woman breaks down in tears.\n\nHer husband, trying to lighten the mood, brings up his lottery ticket and suggests that maybe their luck is about to change. The old woman, however, is fed up with his irresponsible behavior and the constant financial strain it puts on their lives. She lashes out at him, throwing him out of the apartment.\n\nAs he walks the streets, the old woman's husband tears up the rejection letter from the cooking competition, a last ditch effort to try and make things right with his wife. He enters a gambling shop and borrows money to bribe people to get his wife into the competition.\n\nThe old woman and her husband are overjoyed when she is accepted into the competition, but her reliance on ancient rituals and spells in her cooking begins to transform her, both physically and emotionally. She is haunted by the memories of her husband and driven by fear to seek out the forbidden knowledge of black magic in an attempt to find a way to bring him back.",
