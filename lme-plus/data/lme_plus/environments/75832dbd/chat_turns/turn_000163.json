  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the Batman franchise are two separate and distinct universes. Marvel is owned by Disney, while Batman is part of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) owned by Warner Bros.\n\nIf you're planning to re-watch the MCU, that's a great idea! However, it might not be directly related to the new Batman movie coming out in March. If you're interested in preparing for the new Batman film, I'd recommend re-watching some of the previous Batman movies or shows to get a better understanding of the character and the franchise.\n\nThat being said, if you're still interested in re-watching the MCU, I'd be happy to help you with a watch order that includes all the movies and shows, including the ones on Disney+. Just let me know, and I can provide you with a suggested watch order!",
