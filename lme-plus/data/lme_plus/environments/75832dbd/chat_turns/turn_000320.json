  "content": "There are many modern artists who have drawn inspiration from Frida Kahlo's work, both in terms of style and subject matter. She has become a major influence on contemporary art, particularly among feminist artists and artists of color. Some artists who have been inspired by her work include Kara Walker, Carrie Mae Weems, Yayoi Kusama, and Tracey Emin. Not only has her work had a tremendous impact on the art world, but it has also had an impact on popular culture, as her image has been used in fashion, advertising, and other forms of media.",
