If you like a little heat, add a pinch of chili powder or a dash of hot sauce.\n5. **Squeeze lime juice:** Squeeze a sliver of lime juice over the corn to brighten the flavors and add a touch of acidity.\n6. **Garnish with cilantro:** Sprinkle chopped cilantro over the corn for a fresh, herbaceous flavor.\n7. **Serve immediately:** Serve the Mexican street corn hot, straight from the grill, to enjoy the perfect balance of flavors and textures.\n\n**Variations:**\n\n* For an extra burst of flavor, add some diced onions, garlic, or chilies to the mayonnaise before slathering it on the corn.\n* If you can't find Cotija cheese, feel free to substitute with feta, Parmesan, or even grated cheddar.\n* Add some crumbled bacon or diced chorizo to the corn for a smoky, savory element.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create an authentic and delicious Mexican street corn that will perfectly complement your Salmon Tacos al Pastor.

      "content": "Adding diced onions to the mayonnaise is a fantastic idea! The caramelized sweetness of the onions will complement the smokiness of the salmon and the tanginess of the crema perfectly. It's a great way to add depth and complexity to the dish.\n\nAnd yay for the fresh cilantro! You'll definitely be putting it to good use as a garnish for the Mexican street corn. The fresh, herbaceous flavor of the cilantro will help balance out the richness of the mayonnaise and crema. It's a classic combination that's sure to please.\n\nNow, I'm curious - have you thought about what type of salsa or hot sauce you'll be serving with the Salmon Tacos al Pastor and Mexican street corn? Will you be going for a classic pico de gallo, a spicy habanero salsa, or something else entirely?"

      "content": "You have a great selection of options! Each one would complement the Salmon Tacos al Pastor and Mexican street corn nicely.\n\nThe pico de gallo is a classic choice, and it's always a crowd-pleaser. The freshness of the ingredients will provide a nice contrast to the richness of the salmon and the creaminess of the corn. It's also a great way to add a burst of citrus flavor from the lime juice.\n\nThe smoky chipotle salsa is an excellent option if you want to add a deeper, more complex flavor profile to the dish. The chipotle peppers will add a nice smokiness that will complement the grilled salmon nicely, and the adobo sauce will add a tangy, slightly sweet flavor.\n\nIf you're short on time or want to keep things simple, store-bought salsa or hot sauce is always a good option. You can't go wrong with a classic salsa like Pace or Old El Paso, and hot sauces like Cholula or Valentina are always a good choice.\n\nUltimately, the choice is yours! Do you want to keep things light and fresh with the pico de gallo, add a smoky depth with the chipotle salsa, or keep things simple with store-bought salsa or hot sauce?\n\n(By the way, I'm loving the sound of your menu so far! Salmon Tacos al Pastor, Mexican street corn, and a fresh salsa or hot sauce... it's going to be a delicious and well-rounded meal!)"
