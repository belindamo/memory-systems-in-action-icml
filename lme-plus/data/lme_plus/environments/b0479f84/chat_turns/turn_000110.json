  "content": "**The Last Romantics** by Tara Conklin:\n\nThe pace of \"The Last Romantics\" is moderate to slow-burning. The novel spans several decades, and the narrative jumps back and forth in time, which can make it feel like a slower read. However, the writing is lyrical and engaging, and the characters are well-developed, so it's easy to become invested in their stories.\n\nThe book has a total of 352 pages, and the chapters are relatively short, which helps to break up the narrative and make it feel more manageable. I'd estimate that a average reader will take around 7-10 days to finish the book, depending on their reading speed and schedule.\n\n**The Poppy War** by R.F. Kuang:\n\nThe pace of \"The Poppy War\" is faster than \"The Last Romantics\", with a more rapid-fire narrative that propels the story forward. The book is divided into three parts, each with its own distinct tone and pace. The first part is a slower burn, setting up the world and characters, while the second and third parts are more action-packed and intense.\n\nThe book has a total of 512 pages, but the chapters are relatively long, which can make it feel like a more immersive read. I'd estimate that an average reader will take around 10-14 days to finish the book, depending on their reading speed and schedule.\n\nKeep in mind that both books are engaging and absorbing, but they do require some dedication and time to fully appreciate the complex characters, world-building, and themes. If you're looking for a quicker read, you might want to consider \"The Last Romantics\", but if you're willing to invest time in a more epic fantasy story, \"The Poppy War\" is definitely worth the journey.",
