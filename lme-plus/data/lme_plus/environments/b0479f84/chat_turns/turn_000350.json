And yeah, I should ask my brother to take a look at the air filter, belts, and hoses. He's always been good about keeping an eye on those things.\n\nAnd actually, I was thinking about getting a car inspection soon, just to make sure everything is in good shape. I've been putting it off, but it's probably a good idea to get it done before winter sets in. Do you think I should get a full inspection or just a basic one?",
