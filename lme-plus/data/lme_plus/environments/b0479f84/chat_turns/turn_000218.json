  "content": "Fetch Rewards is a great app for earning rewards on your grocery purchases! I'm happy to help you with that, but as a text-based AI assistant, I don't have direct access to your Fetch Rewards account.\n\nHowever, I can suggest a few ways to find out how many points you need to reach the next reward level:\n\n1. **Check the Fetch Rewards app**: Open the Fetch Rewards app on your mobile device and log in to your account. You should be able to see your current point balance and the number of points needed to reach the next reward level.\n2. **Fetch Rewards website**: Visit the Fetch Rewards website and log in to your account. You can check your point balance and reward progress on the website as well.\n3. **Fetch Rewards support**: If you're unable to find the information in the app or on the website, you can reach out to Fetch Rewards' customer support team. They should be able to provide you with the information you need.\n\nRemember to redeem your points regularly to avoid expiration and to enjoy your rewards!\n\nBy the way, a $10 gift card sounds like a great reward! Keep scanning those receipts and earning those points!",
