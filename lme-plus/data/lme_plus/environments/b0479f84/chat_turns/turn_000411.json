  "content": "Mentioning the original price you paid for the guitar can be a double-edged sword. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros of mentioning the original price:**\n\n1. **Value perception**: By stating the original price, you can create a sense of value and justify your asking price. Potential buyers may perceive the guitar as a good deal if they know you're selling it for less than what you paid.\n2. **Transparency**: Being open about the original price can build trust with potential buyers. They may appreciate your honesty and be more likely to consider your guitar over others.\n\n**Cons of mentioning the original price:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect**: If you mention a high original price, potential buyers might anchor on that number and think your asking price is too high, even if it's a fair market value.\n2. **Unrealistic expectations**: If you paid a premium for the guitar when it was new, buyers might expect it to be in pristine condition or have unrealistic expectations about its quality.\n3. **Negotiation room**: By mentioning the original price, you may inadvertently give buyers an upper hand in negotiations. They might try to lowball you, thinking you're making a profit.\n\nUltimately, whether to mention the original price is up to you. If you do decide to include it, consider the following:\n\n* **Frame it positively**: Instead of saying \"I'm selling this guitar for a loss,\" say \"I'm offering this guitar at a discounted price compared to its original value.\"\n* **Keep it concise**: Simply state the original price and your asking price, without drawing too much attention to the difference.\n* **Focus on the guitar's value**: Emphasize the guitar's features, condition, and any maintenance or upgrades you've made to justify your asking price.\n\nIn your case, since you purchased the guitar for $700 in 2018, you might mention it in the listing like this:\n\n\"Originally purchased in 2018 for $700, I'm now offering this Taylor GS Mini at a competitive price of [Your Asking Price]. This guitar has been well-maintained and is in excellent condition, with [mention any upgrades or maintenance].\"\n\nRemember to prioritize showcasing the guitar's condition, features, and your asking price in the listing. The original price can be a secondary detail to provide context and build trust with potential buyers.",
