Use ergonomic furniture: Invest in a good quality chair with adjustable back support, armrests, and height. The chair should be comfortable and help you maintain the natural curves of your spine. You may also consider using a standing desk or an adjustable desk that allows you to switch between standing and sitting.\n2. Sit correctly: When sitting, make sure your feet are flat on the floor, and your hips are positioned at a 90-degree angle. Avoid crossing your legs or sitting on one leg. Your back should be straight, and your shoulders should be relaxed.\n3. Stand correctly: When standing, distribute your weight evenly on both feet. Keep your shoulders back and your chest forward. Make sure your ears are aligned with your shoulders, and your chin is tucked in slightly.\n4. Take breaks: If you have a sedentary job, take frequent breaks to stretch and move around. Sitting or standing in the same position for prolonged periods can cause back pain and stiffness.\n5. Use a lumbar roll: A lumbar roll is a small pillow that can be placed behind your lower back to support the natural curve of your spine. This can be especially helpful when sitting for long periods.\n6. Strengthen your core: A strong core can help you maintain good posture and reduce the risk of back pain. Incorporate exercises that target your core muscles, such as planks, crunches, and yoga poses like downward dog and plank.\n7. Be mindful: Pay attention to your posture throughout the day. Whenever you catch yourself slouching or hunching over, correct your posture by sitting or standing up straight.\n\nBy following these tips, you can maintain good posture throughout the day and reduce the risk of back pain. Remember, good posture is not just about looking good, it's about promoting overall spinal health and well-being.",
