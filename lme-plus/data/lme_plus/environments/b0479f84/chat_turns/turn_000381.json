The French and German armies suffered a combined total of over 700,000 casualties, with around 300,000 dead.\n\nThe ultimate result of the battle was a strategic victory for the Allies. Although the Germans made significant gains early on, the French were eventually able to hold their ground and prevent the German advance. This allowed the Allies to divert resources to other parts of the front, and helped to turn the tide of the war. However, the battle had a profound impact on both sides, and is remembered as one of the most brutal and costly battles in history.",
