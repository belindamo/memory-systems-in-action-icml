It's wonderful that you're taking the initiative to broaden your understanding and empathy.\n\nRemember, reading diversely is a lifelong journey, and it's okay to take your time.

The bookish community is always here to support and celebrate your love of reading.\n\nMost importantly, remember to be kind to yourself and approach these stories with an open heart and mind.
