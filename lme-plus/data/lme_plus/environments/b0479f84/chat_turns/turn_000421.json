Brush with the glaze during the last minute of grilling.\n3. **Salmon En Papillote with Fennel and Orange**: Place the salmon fillets on a bed of sliced fennel and orange slices, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of saffron.

Serve with a creamy remoulade sauce made with mayonnaise, ketchup, and herbs.\n5. **Salmon and Avocado Sushi Rolls**: Yes, you can make sushi at home! Slice the salmon into thin pieces and combine with diced avocado, cucumber, and rice. Roll up the ingredients in nori seaweed sheets and slice into bite-sized pieces.\n6. **Salmon and Quinoa Bowl with Roasted Vegetables**: Season the salmon fillets with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Roast in the oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 12-15 minutes or until cooked through.
