  "content": "Mentioning the original price can indeed add transparency to your listing.\n\nRegarding your question, it's a good idea to mention that you haven't played the acoustic guitar in months, but you might want to frame it in a way that's neutral or even positive. Here's why:\n\n**Why it's good to mention:**\n\n1. **Honesty is always best**: Being upfront about the guitar's usage can build trust with potential buyers. They might appreciate your honesty and be more likely to consider your guitar.\n2. **Condition accuracy**: By mentioning the guitar's idle time, you're providing an accurate representation of its condition. This can help set buyer expectations and avoid potential disputes.\n\n**How to mention it:**\n\n1. **Frame it positively**: Instead of saying \"I haven't touched it in months,\" say \"This guitar has been carefully stored and maintained, with minimal playtime in recent months.\" This emphasizes that the guitar has been well-cared for, even if it hasn't been played frequently.\n2. **Highlight the benefits**: You could mention that the guitar has had a \"break\" from regular playing, which means it's had time to rest and recover. This could be appealing to buyers who want a guitar that hasn't been heavily used.\n3. **Keep it brief**: Keep your mention of the guitar's idle time brief and to the point. You don't want to draw too much attention to it, as it might raise concerns about the guitar's condition.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\"This Taylor GS Mini has been well-maintained and carefully stored, with minimal playtime in recent months. As a result, it's had time to rest and recover, and is now ready for its next owner. The guitar is in excellent condition, with [mention any maintenance or upgrades you've made].\"\n\nBy mentioning the guitar's idle time in a neutral or positive light, you can address any potential concerns while also showcasing the guitar's condition and your commitment to transparency.",
