In a large bowl, whisk together lime juice, garlic, oregano, cumin, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using).\n2. Add the salmon fillets to the marinade and mix well to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n3. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.
