  "content": "Adding diced onions to the mayonnaise is a fantastic idea! The caramelized sweetness of the onions will complement the smokiness of the salmon and the tanginess of the crema perfectly. It's a great way to add depth and complexity to the dish.\n\nAnd yay for the fresh cilantro! You'll definitely be putting it to good use as a garnish for the Mexican street corn. The fresh, herbaceous flavor of the cilantro will help balance out the richness of the mayonnaise and crema. It's a classic combination that's sure to please.\n\nNow, I'm curious - have you thought about what type of salsa or hot sauce you'll be serving with the Salmon Tacos al Pastor and Mexican street corn? Will you be going for a classic pico de gallo, a spicy habanero salsa, or something else entirely?",
