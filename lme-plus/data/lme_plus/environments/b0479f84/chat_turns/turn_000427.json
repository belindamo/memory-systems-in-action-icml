It's a match made in heaven!\n\nMaking authentic Mexican street corn is relatively easy, and I'd be happy to share some tips to help you create a delicious and flavorful side dish:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4-6 ears of corn, husked and silked\n* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise\n* 1/4 cup Mexican crema (or substitute with sour cream or heavy cream)\n* 1/2 cup grated Cotija cheese (or substitute with feta or Parmesan)\n* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)\n* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 2 tablespoons lime juice\n* 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)\n* Chili powder or hot sauce, for serving (optional)\n\n**Tips for making authentic Mexican street corn:**\n\n1. **Grill the corn:** Grill the corn ears over medium-high heat, turning every 2-3 minutes, until slightly charred and tender. This will give the corn a nice smoky flavor.\n2. **Slather with mayonnaise:** Slather each ear of corn with a generous amount of mayonnaise. This might seem unusual, but trust me, it's a game-changer!\n3. **Add crema and cheese:** Sprinkle the crema and Cotija cheese over the mayonnaise-slathered corn. The crema adds a tangy, creamy element, while the Cotija cheese provides a salty, crumbly texture.\n4. **Add flavor with spices:** Sprinkle the smoked paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper over the corn. If you like a little heat, add a pinch of chili powder or a dash of hot sauce.\n5. **Squeeze lime juice:** Squeeze a sliver of lime juice over the corn to brighten the flavors and add a touch of acidity.\n6. **Garnish with cilantro:** Sprinkle chopped cilantro over the corn for a fresh, herbaceous flavor.\n7. **Serve immediately:** Serve the Mexican street corn hot, straight from the grill, to enjoy the perfect balance of flavors and textures.\n\n**Variations:**\n\n* For an extra burst of flavor, add some diced onions, garlic, or chilies to the mayonnaise before slathering it on the corn.\n* If you can't find Cotija cheese, feel free to substitute with feta, Parmesan, or even grated cheddar.\n* Add some crumbled bacon or diced chorizo to the corn for a smoky, savory element.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create an authentic and delicious Mexican street corn that will perfectly complement your Salmon Tacos al Pastor. Your taste buds (and your guests) will thank you!",
