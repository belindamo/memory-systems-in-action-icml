I was thinking of making a simple pico de gallo with some diced tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, and lime juice. I also have some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce that I could use to make a smoky chipotle salsa. Or, if I want to keep things simple, I could just serve it with some store-bought salsa or hot sauce. What do you think?",
