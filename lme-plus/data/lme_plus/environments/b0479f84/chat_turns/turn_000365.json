The discharge of toxic chemicals from mining, oil drilling, and manufacturing operations has led to severe contamination of the waterways. Polluted water affects the aquatic ecosystem by contaminating the food chain, destroying habitat, and reducing biodiversity. Additionally, toxic chemicals that seep into the water can also harm human populations that rely on these rivers for fishing, transportation, and drinking water. The pollution also causes economic damages that affect the livelihood of people who depend on these natural resources.",
