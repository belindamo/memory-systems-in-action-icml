The harsh weather conditions, the use of heavy artillery, and the proximity of the opposing armies all contributed to the high number of casualties. The battle was also significant in that it represented a new phase in the conflict, with both armies using increasingly advanced technology and tactics to gain the upper hand. The effects of the battle were felt not only by those who were involved in it directly, but also by the generations that followed, who grew up in a world changed forever by the horrors of the Great War.",
