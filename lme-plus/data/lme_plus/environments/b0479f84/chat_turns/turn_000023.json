I'll provide you with some recommendations for must-try dishes and restaurants in each city.\n\n**Tokyo:**\n\n1. **Sushi:** Sushi Saito (3-Michelin-starred) or Sushi Dai (famous for its traditional Edomae-style sushi)\n2. **Ramen:** Ichiran Shibuya (unique, rich tonkotsu broth) or Totto Ramen (classic, flavorful shoyu ramen)\n3. **Tempura:** Tempura Kondo (high-end, seasonal ingredients) or Tempura Tsunahachi (classic, affordable)\n4. **Yakitori:** Toriki (wide variety of skewers, lively atmosphere) or Yakitori Alley (Omoide Yokocho, a small alley with multiple yakitori shops)\n\n**Osaka:**\n\n1. **Ramen:** Ichiran Osaka (same chain as in Tokyo, but with a different broth recipe) or Ramen Kuroda (rich, savory tonkotsu ramen)\n2. **Okonomiyaki:** Okonomiyaki Mizuno (classic, savory okonomiyaki) or Okonomiyaki Chitanda (modern, creative variations)\n3. **Kushikatsu:** Kushikatsu Tanaka (wide variety of deep-fried skewers) or Kushikatsu Daruma (classic, affordable)\n4. **Udon:** Sanuki Udon (authentic, handmade udon noodles) or Tsurutontan (modern, creative udon dishes)\n\nGlad to hear you've already got a ramen recommendation in Osaka!
