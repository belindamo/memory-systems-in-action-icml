It's always better to be proactive and catch any potential issues before they become major problems.\n\nAs for the type of inspection, it depends on your car's age, mileage, and your personal preferences. Here are some options to consider:\n\n**Basic Inspection:**\n\n* A basic inspection typically includes a visual examination of the vehicle's major systems, such as the engine, transmission, brakes, suspension, and steering.\n* It may also include a check of the fluids, belts, hoses, and tires.\n* This type of inspection is usually less expensive (around $20-$50) and can give you a general idea of your car's condition.\n\n**Full Inspection:**\n\n* A full inspection is a more comprehensive examination of your vehicle's systems and components.\n* It may include a detailed inspection of the engine, transmission, brakes, suspension, steering, and electrical systems.\n* It may also include a test drive to identify any issues that may not be apparent during a visual inspection.\n* This type of inspection is usually more expensive (around $100-$200) but provides a more detailed report on your car's condition.\n\nConsidering your car's age and your desire to be proactive, a full inspection might be a good idea. It will give you a more comprehensive understanding of your car's condition and help you identify any potential issues before they become major problems.\n\nHowever, if you're on a tight budget, a basic inspection can still provide valuable insights and help you prioritize any necessary repairs or maintenance.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide what type of inspection is best for your car and your budget. Be sure to ask your brother for his input as well, since he's familiar with your car's history and maintenance.",
