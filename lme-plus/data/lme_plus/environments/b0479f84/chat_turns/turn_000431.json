  "content": "You have a great selection of options! Each one would complement the Salmon Tacos al Pastor and Mexican street corn nicely.\n\nThe pico de gallo is a classic choice, and it's always a crowd-pleaser. The freshness of the ingredients will provide a nice contrast to the richness of the salmon and the creaminess of the corn. It's also a great way to add a burst of citrus flavor from the lime juice.\n\nThe smoky chipotle salsa is an excellent option if you want to add a deeper, more complex flavor profile to the dish. The chipotle peppers will add a nice smokiness that will complement the grilled salmon nicely, and the adobo sauce will add a tangy, slightly sweet flavor.\n\nIf you're short on time or want to keep things simple, store-bought salsa or hot sauce is always a good option. You can't go wrong with a classic salsa like Pace or Old El Paso, and hot sauces like Cholula or Valentina are always a good choice.\n\nUltimately, the choice is yours! Do you want to keep things light and fresh with the pico de gallo, add a smoky depth with the chipotle salsa, or keep things simple with store-bought salsa or hot sauce?\n\n(By the way, I'm loving the sound of your menu so far! Salmon Tacos al Pastor, Mexican street corn, and a fresh salsa or hot sauce... it's going to be a delicious and well-rounded meal!)",
