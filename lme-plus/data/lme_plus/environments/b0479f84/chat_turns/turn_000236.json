This is achieved through the process of laminating the dough, where layers of butter and dough are rolled and folded together to create the flaky layers.\n2. Flavor: The flavor of a croissant should be buttery and slightly sweet, with a hint of saltiness.\n3. Aroma: A croissant should have a pleasant, baked aroma.\n4. Crumb structure: The crumb, or interior, of a croissant should be soft and tender, with a delicate, open structure.\n5. Appearance: A croissant should have a golden brown color and a uniform, attractive shape.\n6. Taste: The taste of a croissant should be well-balanced, with a good balance of sweetness and savory flavors. The croissant should also have a satisfying, buttery taste.",
