  "content": "Guppies, neon tetras, and harlequin rasboras are all popular freshwater aquarium fish that can make great additions to a community tank. Generally, they can be kept together, but it's essential to consider their specific needs and personalities to ensure a harmonious coexistence. Here's a brief rundown on each species and their compatibility:\n\n**Guppies (Poecilia reticulata)**\n\n* Origin: South America\n* Size: 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm)\n* Temperament: Peaceful, active, and curious\n* Water requirements: Soft, slightly acidic water (pH 6.8-7.8, 72-82\u00b0F/22-28\u00b0C)\n* Diet: Omnivorous, eats small invertebrates, algae, and commercial flakes/pellets\n\n**Neon Tetras (Paracheirodon innesi)**\n\n* Origin: South America\n* Size: 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm)\n* Temperament: Schooling, peaceful, and active\n* Water requirements: Soft, slightly acidic water (pH 6.0-7.0, 72-82\u00b0F/22-28\u00b0C)\n* Diet: Omnivorous, eats small invertebrates, algae, and commercial flakes/pellets\n\n**Harlequin Rasboras (Trigonostigma heteromorpha)**\n\n* Origin: Southeast Asia\n* Size: 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm)\n* Temperament: Peaceful, active, and schooling\n* Water requirements: Soft, slightly acidic water (pH 6.5-7.5, 72-82\u00b0F/22-28\u00b0C)\n* Diet: Omnivorous, eats small invertebrates, algae, and commercial flakes/pellets\n\nCompatibility considerations:\n\n* **Guppies and Neon Tetras:** Guppies are generally peaceful and can be kept with neon tetras. However, guppies are known to be fin-nippers, and may harass or eat the long, flowing fins of neon tetras. To minimize this risk, provide plenty of hiding places and plants for the neon tetras to retreat to.\n* **Guppies and Harlequin Rasboras:** Guppies and harlequin rasboras are compatible, as both are peaceful and active swimmers. They can be kept together without issues, as long as the tank is large enough to provide sufficient space and hiding places.\n* **Neon Tetras and Harlequin Rasboras:** These two species are excellent tankmates, as they are both schooling fish that thrive in similar water conditions. They will often swim together and create a beautiful, active display.\n\nTo ensure a harmonious community, make sure to:\n\n* Provide a large enough tank (at least 10-20 gallons) with plenty of hiding places, plants, and open swimming spaces.\n* Maintain good water quality and stable water parameters.\n* Introduce the fish gradually, starting with the most peaceful species (harlequin rasboras) and adding the more active species (guppies and neon tetras) later.\n* Monitor the tank's dynamics and be prepared to separate any fish that show signs of aggression or stress.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a thriving and peaceful community tank with guppies, neon tetras, and harlequin rasboras.",
