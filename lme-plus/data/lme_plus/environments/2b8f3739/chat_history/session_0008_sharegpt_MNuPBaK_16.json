This is a waste of county resources, and taxpayers would not be pleased that workers needed to take so much effort to do basic tasks. Furthermore, forcing workers to do needless, repetitive tasks is terrible for their morale.\n\nOlmsted was not saving its Laserfiche data in a permanent archival location. Instead, they were hosting the data in the city of Rochester\u2019s servers. In the face of a natural disaster, catastrophic server crash, or other emergencies, Olmsted would not have a reliable backup.\n\nCitizens were growing confused about which jurisdiction to designate during city planning processes. Unfortunately, two local governments were using one site.\n\nThe payment adapter was not accepting payments to Olmsted County and the city of Rochester. The situation only allowed payments to Rochester. Because of this, Olmsted could not serve its community with easy online payments.\n \nOlmsted County was not in control of automation for emails, reports, analytics dashboards, and training.\n\nThe county did not have complete access to users and licenses.\n\nWe determined that Olmsted required software integrations to the following systems:\nTyler Tax System/ iasWorld v2020.1.43 (address parcel owner information)\niNovah Cashier v2.60.189.6 (finance system)\nGIS XAPO (new address parcel owner system Laserfiche v10.4)\nThe system was overly complicated. It involved ten steps along with 14 sub-steps for processing paper and data, which were redundant and took up a great deal of staff time to complete. Sometimes, members of the Olmsted County staff would outright refuse to process this data, leaving all scanning to be done at the end for the administrative team.\nObjectives:\nOlmsted County needed to upgrade and streamline its computer and software systems to meet the public's needs better and allow government employees to work more efficiently and effectively. It needed professional assistance in planning and conducting software integrations.\n\nChief objectives for Olmsted were:\n\nProvide a single system for inputting data to save workers\u2019 time for more pressing tasks.\n\nIntegrate Laserfiche and Accela and the other various systems. Meanwhile, optimize the county\u2019s systems for Accela.\n\nReduce as much as possible the paper and data processing substeps in a cumbersome and overly complex system involving 24 steps and substeps.\n\nEnable citizens in Olmsted County to submit applications online instead of being forced to use surface mail or come into the county offices.\n\nMake a safe and straightforward way for citizens to make their payments online. This is especially of concern in the era of COVID-19. Local governments across the nation have to reinvent the way they interact with citizens, especially since the prospects of future global pandemics are always with us. \n\nDuring COVID-19 lockdowns and efforts to encourage individuals to remain socially distant, allowing people to do as much business as possible online with their government became more important than ever. \n\nAfter all, citizens are already quite familiar with submitting documents and online payments in other aspects of life. Their government should enter the 21st century with upgraded and integrated software systems.\n\nSolution:\nThe solution was to integrate the Laserfiche connector and Accela connector with the systems mentioned above to seamlessly work together to increase automation, employee productivity, and efficiency, and finally give Olmsted county the ability to offer online payments to its citizens. \n\nEffects on the plan review process following implementation and integration were as follows:\n\nWe reduced the time employees spent on file management by 90%. Workers no longer had to manually search for metadata from property records and save documents in as many as 3 to 4 locations.\n\nOur team optimized county systems to Accela.\n\nNow, there is no more need for staff to input the same data twice into different systems. Furthermore, the county does not need to worry about staff members missing or skipping steps in vital processes.\n\nWe resolved 12 of 24 sub-steps the county needed for paper and data processing. We accomplished this by setting up auto-populating information across connections. In this case, we resolved some 50% of process substeps with Accela - Laserfiche integration.\n\nOlmsted County citizens are now able to submit the following applications online:\n\nPlumbing and mechanical\nNew well\nNew septic\nOnline inspections\nWith the new integrations, citizens are now submitting 53% of trade permits online. Furthermore, 66% of new good permits are done online. The county is seeing these numbers grow each month, indicating its success and appeal in the community.\n\nCitizens in Olmsted can now make payments online with credit cards and Echeck. Approximately 46% of individuals who made online payments during the previous four months started their application process. This is an excellent indicator of how well the local community accepts the new online services.\n\nImproving How Local Governments Engage With Their Community\nThe case of Olmsted County illustrates how local governments can better serve their community by deploying state-of-the-art payment and document processing systems.\n\nLocal officials need to understand the benefits of improving their computational infrastructure when it comes to government software integrations. Streamlining processes saves government workers a great deal of time and effort. \n\nAnd it also benefits citizens since they will have an easier time submitting applications before doing new work, such as mechanical or plumbing or installing a new well. Since they can now make payments online, people can focus on their projects instead of dealing with additional paperwork or visits to the Olmsted County offices.\nPlease write in confident tone, technical writing style, English language."
