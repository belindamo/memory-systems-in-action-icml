  "content": "I'm happy to help you prioritize your tasks! Don't worry about running on low battery - we can work with that. Since you're not feeling fully energized, let's focus on tackling the most important tasks first, and then break them down into manageable chunks to help you stay focused.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me what tasks you need to accomplish today? Make a list of everything that comes to mind, no matter how big or small it seems. This will help us get a sense of what needs to be done.\n\nAlso, are there any tasks that have deadlines or time-sensitive requirements? For example, do you need to respond to an urgent email or make a phone call by a certain time?\n\nOnce we have your list, we can prioritize tasks based on their importance and feasibility, given your current energy levels.",
