  "content": "Yes, promoting alternative fuel options is a key component of many of the programs and initiatives that the EPA has implemented to reduce emissions from transportation. The EPA supports the growth and deployment of alternative fuels such as electric, hybrid, natural gas, propane, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. For instance, the Alternative Fuel Vehicles and Fueling Infrastructure Deployment program provides funding to support the installation of alternative fuel infrastructure, such as charging stations for electric vehicles and compressed natural gas refueling stations. The EPA also works to promote the use of biofuels, which can be blended with gasoline to reduce emissions from traditional vehicles. Additionally, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration set, require vehicle manufacturers to produce cars that meet a certain fuel efficiency standard, which encourages the use of alternative fuels.",
