Shankar and Zakir Hussain.\n\n**Indian Classical Musicians and Their Influence on Western Rock:**\n\n1. **Ravi Shankar**: The legendary Indian sitar player and composer collaborated with Western musicians like George Harrison, John McLaughlin, and Philip Glass, introducing Indian classical music to a wider audience.\n2. **Ali Akbar Khan**: The Indian sarod player and composer worked with Western musicians like the Grateful Dead and the Doors, influencing their music with Indian classical elements.\n3. **L.
