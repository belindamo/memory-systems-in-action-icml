  "content": "Title: Streamlining Local Government Processes with Software Integrations: A Case Study of Olmsted County, MN\n\nLocal governments across the nation have been facing the challenge of adapting to the new era of digital transformation, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case study, we explore how Olmsted County, MN, upgraded its computer and software systems to meet the public's needs better and allow government employees to work more efficiently and effectively.\n\nBefore integrating software, employees at the Olmsted County planning department were double-inputting information into various systems, resulting in wasted county resources and employee morale. The county also faced challenges such as hosting Laserfiche data in the city of Rochester\u2019s servers, leaving them without a reliable backup in the event of an emergency.\n\nTo address these issues, Olmsted County needed professional assistance in planning and conducting software integrations. The county's objectives included providing a single system for inputting data, integrating various systems, reducing paper and data processing substeps, enabling citizens to submit applications online, and allowing for safe and straightforward online payments.\n\nThe solution was to seamlessly integrate the Laserfiche connector and Accela connector with other systems to increase automation, employee productivity, and efficiency, and finally give Olmsted county the ability to offer online payments to its citizens. After the implementation of the integration, Olmsted County saw a significant reduction in the time employees spent on file management, improved citizen engagement, and more streamlined workflows.\n\nCitizens in Olmsted County can now submit applications online for plumbing, mechanical, new well, new septic, and online inspections, with trade permits and new good permits also being done online. The county is seeing these numbers grow each month, indicating its success and appeal in the community. Approximately 46% of individuals who made online payments during the previous four months started their application process, demonstrating how well the community has accepted the new online services.\n\nBy deploying state-of-the-art payment and document processing systems, local governments can better serve their community and streamline processes that save government workers a great deal of time and effort. With the integration of software systems, citizens can now focus on their projects instead of dealing with additional paperwork or visits to the Olmsted County offices.",
