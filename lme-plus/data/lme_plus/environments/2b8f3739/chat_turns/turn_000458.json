Let's assume that's $850 per month (10% of $8,500, which is your monthly gross income).\n* Adding your estimated mortgage payment ($370 to $550) to your existing debt payments, your total monthly debt payments would be around $1,220 to $1,400.\n* Your DTI ratio would be around 14% to 16%, which is relatively conservative and leaves room for other expenses.\n\n**Maximum condo price:**\n\n* Based on your income, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio, a comfortable mortgage payment for you would be around $450 to $500 per month.\n* With a 20% down payment, your maximum condo price would be around $250,000 to $280,000.\n\nConsidering your preferences and the condo prices in downtown Chicago, here are some options to consider:\n\n* A 1-bedroom condo in a newer building with modern amenities might cost around $250,000 to $300,000.\n* A 2-bedroom condo in a older building or one with fewer amenities might cost around $220,000 to $250,000.\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates are rough and may vary depending on factors like location, building age, and specific amenities. I recommend researching different neighborhoods and condo complexes to get a better sense of the prices and what you can afford.\n\nAdditionally, don't forget to factor in other costs associated with homeownership, such as:\n\n* Property taxes: around 1.25% to 1.5% of the condo's value per year\n* Homeowners insurance: around $800 to $1,200 per year\n* Condo fees: vary depending on the building and amenities, but expect around $200 to $500 per month\n* Maintenance and repairs: budget around 1% to 2% of the condo's value per year\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your condo search!",
