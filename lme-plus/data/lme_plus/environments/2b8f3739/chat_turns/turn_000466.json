  "content": "Both the West Loop and South Loop have excellent transportation options, making it easy to get around without a car. Here's a breakdown of the 'L' train lines, bus routes, and bikeability in each area:\n\n**West Loop:**\n\n* **'L' Train Lines:**\n\t+ Green Line: The Harlem/Lake station is located in the heart of the West Loop, providing easy access to the Loop, Oak Park, and other western suburbs.\n\t+ Pink Line: The Madison/Wabash station is also nearby, connecting to the Loop, Logan Square, and other northwest neighborhoods.\n* **Bus Routes:**\n\t+ Multiple bus routes run through the West Loop, including the 20 Madison, 126 Jackson, and 151 Sheridan routes, which connect to the Loop, North Avenue Beach, and other nearby neighborhoods.\n* **Bikeability:**\n\t+ The West Loop has several bike lanes, including the Madison Street bike lane, which runs east-west through the neighborhood.\n\t+ The 606 Trail, an elevated bike and pedestrian path, runs along the western edge of the West Loop, providing a car-free route to Humboldt Park and other west-side neighborhoods.\n\t+ Several Divvy bike-sharing stations are located throughout the West Loop, making it easy to grab a bike and go.\n\n**South Loop:**\n\n* **'L' Train Lines:**\n\t+ Red Line: The Harrison station is located in the South Loop, providing easy access to the Loop, North Avenue Beach, and other north-side neighborhoods.\n\t+ Green Line: The Roosevelt station is also nearby, connecting to the Loop, Oak Park, and other western suburbs.\n* **Bus Routes:**\n\t+ Multiple bus routes run through the South Loop, including the 1 Bronzeville/Union Station, 3 King Drive, and 12 Roosevelt routes, which connect to the Loop, Museum Campus, and other nearby neighborhoods.\n* **Bikeability:**\n\t+ The South Loop has several bike lanes, including the Michigan Avenue bike lane, which runs north-south through the neighborhood.\n\t+ The Lakefront Trail, a scenic bike and pedestrian path, runs along the shores of Lake Michigan, providing a car-free route to Museum Campus, Navy Pier, and other lakefront attractions.\n\t+ Several Divvy bike-sharing stations are located throughout the South Loop, making it easy to grab a bike and go.\n\nBoth neighborhoods offer excellent access to public transportation, making it easy to get around without a car. You can use the CTA's Trip Planner tool or the Transit app to plan your route and track buses and trains in real-time.\n\nKeep in mind that while both neighborhoods have good bikeability, the West Loop has more bike lanes and a more extensive network of bike infrastructure. However, the South Loop's Lakefront Trail is a unique asset, providing a scenic and car-free route to many lakefront attractions.",
