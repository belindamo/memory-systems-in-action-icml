Here are some tips and resources to help you get started:\n\n**Drying Fresh Herbs:**\n\n1. **Air Drying**: Tie herbs in small bunches and hang them upside down in a warm, dry, dark place with good air circulation. This method is ideal for delicate herbs like mint, basil, and lemon balm.\n2. **Dehydrator**: Use a dehydrator to dry herbs quickly and evenly. This method is suitable for most herbs, including thicker ones like rosemary and thyme.\n3. **Oven Drying**: Preheat your oven to its lowest temperature setting (usually around 150\u00b0F). Place herbs on a baking sheet in a single layer and dry for 1-2 hours. Check on them every 30 minutes to ensure they don't overdry.\n4. **Desiccant Method**: Place herbs in an airtight container with a desiccant like silica gel or borax to absorb moisture.\n\n**Tips for Drying Fresh Herbs:**\n\n* Harvest herbs in the morning, after the dew has dried but before the heat of the day.\n* Clean and pat dry herbs gently to remove excess moisture.\n* Dry herbs in small batches to prevent mold and spoilage.\n* Monitor herbs during the drying process to prevent overdrying, which can lead to loss of flavor and aroma.\n* Store dried herbs in airtight containers to preserve flavor and aroma.\n\n**Preserving Dried Herbs:**\n\n1. **Airtight Containers**: Store dried herbs in glass jars or airtight containers to protect them from moisture, light, and pests.\n2. **Cool, Dark Place**: Store containers in a cool, dark place, like a pantry or cupboard.\n3. **Label and Date**: Label containers with the herb type and date to ensure you use the oldest herbs first.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **USDA's Guide to Drying Herbs**: A comprehensive guide to drying herbs, including temperature and humidity guidelines.\n* **Penn State Extension's Herb Drying Guide**: A detailed guide to drying herbs, including methods and tips for specific herbs.\n* **The Herbal Academy's Drying and Storing Herbs**: A blog post covering the basics of drying and preserving herbs, including tips for preventing mold and spoilage.\n\n**Infusing Herbs in Oil:**\n\n1. **Choose the Right Oil**: Select a high-quality oil with a high smoke point, like grapeseed or sweet almond oil, to ensure it doesn't become rancid during the infusion process.\n2. **Use the Right Ratio**: Typically, use 1 part dried herb to 3 parts oil.\n3. **Infusion Time**: Allow the herbs to infuse in the oil for 2-6 weeks, shaking the container daily, before straining and bottling.\n4. **Store Infused Oils**: Store infused oils in dark glass bottles, away from direct sunlight and heat sources.\n\nRemember to research specific guidelines for each herb you plan to use, as some may require special handling or precautions.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with drying and preserving your fresh herbs for your herbal teas and infused oils!",
