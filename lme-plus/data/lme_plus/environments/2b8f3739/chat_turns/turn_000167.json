  "content": "brilliant. i was concerned with answers 1 and 2 that you were being too literal und unable to abstract out the mirror test into different modes (that's the wrong word, can't think of the right one at the moment). answer 3 is more where i was thinking, that we'd need to isolate the cognitive basis of the mirror test and then apply that. \nI have an idea in mind, being that sort of person, but i'm interested in what you can generate.\nWhat would be a good, if not great way, to implement 3, \"cognitive testing\". can you write out the experimental procedure and what it is actually testing for, and how?",
