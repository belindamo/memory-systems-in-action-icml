This way, customers will be incentivized to make larger purchases and reach those thresholds to earn more points.\n\nFor rewards, I'm thinking of offering discounts on future purchases, free shipping, or even free products. For example, customers could redeem 20 points for 10% off their next purchase, 50 points for free shipping on their next order, or 100 points for a free herbal tea blend.\n\nI also want to offer exclusive benefits to my loyalty program members, such as early access to new products, special promotions, and invitations to events. This will make them feel valued and appreciated, and encourage them to continue shopping with me.\n\nTo make it easy for customers to track their progress, I'll create a loyalty program dashboard on my website where they can view their point balance, redeem rewards, and access",
