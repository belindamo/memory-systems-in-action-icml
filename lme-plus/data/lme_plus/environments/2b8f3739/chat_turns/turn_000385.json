It's exciting to think that I'll be more mindful of my purchases and make more intentional decisions. I'm a bit worried that it might be a challenge to adjust to this new approach, especially when I'm used to splurging on luxury brands without thinking twice. But I'm willing to make the effort because I know it'll be worth it in the long run. Can you help me with some tips on how to stay motivated and on track with my new budgeting habits?",
