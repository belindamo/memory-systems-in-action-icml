By combining it with your existing morning routine, you can create a consistent morning routine that signals to your body that it's time to wake up and start the day.\n2. **Gradual wake-up**: The gradual wake-up process simulated by the Wake-Up Light can help you wake up feeling more refreshed and energized. This can make it easier to transition into your morning routine, which includes stretching and meditation.\n3. **Mindfulness**: Meditation is an excellent way to cultivate mindfulness and set intentions for the day.

This will help regulate your sleep-wake cycle and make it easier to establish a consistent morning routine.\n2. **Gradually adjust your wake-up time**: If you're not used to waking up at 6:30 AM, you may want to start by setting the Wake-Up Light to wake you up 15-30 minutes earlier or later and gradually adjust to your desired wake-up time.\n3. **Use the Wake-Up Light as a cue**: Use the Wake-Up Light as a cue to start your morning routine. When the light begins to simulate a sunrise, take a few deep breaths, stretch, and start your meditation practice.\n4. **Be consistent with your morning routine**: Stick to your morning routine, even on weekends or days off.
