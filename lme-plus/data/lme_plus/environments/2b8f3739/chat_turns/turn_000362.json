A small gift box or bag can add an extra touch of elegance and sophistication to the gift.\n\nYes, many vendors at craft fairs offer gift boxes or bags as an additional service or product. They may have a selection of boxes or bags that complement their jewelry pieces, or they may be able to recommend a specific one that would match the necklace.\n\nHere are some options you could consider:\n\n1. **Velvet pouch**: A soft, luxurious velvet pouch is a classic choice for jewelry gifts. It's gentle on the necklace and adds a touch of sophistication.\n2. **Gift box**: A small gift box with a satin or velvet interior can provide a beautiful presentation for the necklace. Look for one that's specifically designed for jewelry or has a removable tray to keep the necklace organized.\n3. **Organza bag**: A delicate organza bag with a ribbon tie is a lovely way to present the necklace. It adds a touch of whimsy and romance to the gift.\n4. **Muslin bag**: A simple muslin bag with a drawstring is a more rustic and earthy option. It's a great choice if you want to add a more bohemian or natural touch to the gift.\n\nWhen asking the vendor about gift boxes or bags, be sure to:\n\n1. **Check their options**: Ask the vendor if they offer gift boxes or bags, and what types they have available.\n2. **Get their recommendation**: Ask the vendor which gift box or bag they think would complement the necklace best. They may have some great suggestions based on their experience and knowledge of the piece.\n3. **Consider the style**: Think about your sister's personal style and preferences. Does she like classic and elegant, or bohemian and eclectic? Choose a gift box or bag that fits her taste.\n4. **Ask about pricing**: Be sure to ask about the additional cost of the gift box or bag, and factor it into your overall budget.\n\nBy including a gift box or bag with the necklace, you'll be creating a beautiful and thoughtful gift that your sister will appreciate.",
