  "content": "Yes, you can connect the infrared sensor to the analog input pins on the Arduino instead of the digital input pins. The analog input pins on the Arduino can be used to measure the voltage of an external signal and convert it to a digital value using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).\n\nTo connect the infrared sensor to an analog input pin on the Arduino, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. Connect the sensor array's GND pin to a ground pin on the Arduino.\n2. Connect the sensor array's 5V pin to a power pin on the Arduino (e.g. the 3.3V or 5V pin).\n3. Connect the sensor array's OUT1, OUT2, OUT3, OUT4, and OUT5 pins to analog input pins on the Arduino (e.g. A0, A1, A2, etc.).\n\nYou will need to use jumper wires to connect the sensor array to the Arduino. Depending on the number of available analog input pins on the Arduino and the number of pins being used by the L298N motor driver, you may need to use a breadboard to connect the sensor array and the Arduino.\n\nOnce you have connected the sensor array to the Arduino, you can use the Arduino's `analog",
