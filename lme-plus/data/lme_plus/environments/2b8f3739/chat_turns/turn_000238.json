  "content": "It sounds like you have an infrared sensor array with 5 separate sensors, each of which has an output pin. To connect this sensor array to the Arduino, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. Connect the sensor array's GND pin to a ground pin on the Arduino.\n2. Connect the sensor array's 5V pin to a power pin on the Arduino (e.g. the 3.3V or 5V pin).\n3. Connect the sensor array's OUT1, OUT2, OUT3, OUT4, and OUT5 pins to digital input pins on the Arduino.\n\nYou will need to use jumper wires to connect the sensor array to the Arduino. Depending on the number of available digital input pins on the Arduino and the number of pins being used by the L298N motor driver, you may need to use a breadboard to connect the sensor array and the Arduino.\n\nOnce you have connected the sensor array to the Arduino, you can use the Arduino's digital input pins to read the values from the sensors. You can use the Arduino's `digitalRead` function to read the values from the sensors. For example, to read the value from the OUT1 pin, you can use the following code:\n```\nint value = digitalRead(OUT1_pin);\n```\nThe `digitalRead` function returns a value of `HIGH` (1) or `LOW` (0), depending on the state of the input pin. You can use this value to determine whether the sensor is detecting an object or not.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
