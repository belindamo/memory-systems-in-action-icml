By the way, I've been tracking my theme park visits and event participations on a spreadsheet, and I've already reached a total of 12 visits this year. I'm aiming to hit 15 visits by the end of the year, so I'm planning more trips to other theme parks in the coming months. Do you have any recommendations for other theme parks in Europe that I should consider visiting?",
