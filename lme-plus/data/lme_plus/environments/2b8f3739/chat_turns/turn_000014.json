  "content": "I'd say Sarah Jones' writing style is a mix of adventure and mystery, with a strong focus on atmospheric setting. I enjoyed how she described the city in \"The Lost City\" and how it felt like a character itself. I'm open to trying out different styles, but if I had to choose, I'd say something similar to \"The Lost City\" would be great. By the way, I was really impressed by her during the book reading event - she was so witty and engaging, and getting the book signed by her afterwards was a nice bonus.",
