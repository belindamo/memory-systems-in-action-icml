However, I have to clarify that the bike is not actually stored in the trunk of your car, since you mentioned earlier that you have a Honda Civic, and it's not possible to store a bike in the trunk of a Civic.\n\nAssuming you mean to say that the bike is stored somewhere else, selling it on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace can be a good option. The demand for used bikes can be high, especially if your bike is in good condition.\n\nTo get a good price for your bike, make sure to:\n\n1. Take clear, well-lit, and high-quality photos of the bike from multiple angles.\n2. Provide detailed information about the bike, including its make, model, year, condition, and any unique features.\n3. Set a competitive price based on similar bikes being sold in your area. You can research prices on websites like eBay, Craigslist, or local bike shops to determine a fair price.\n4. Write a detailed and honest description of the bike's condition, including any flaws or repairs needed.\n5. Be prepared to respond promptly to inquiries and be flexible with pricing.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following tips:\n\n* Make sure the bike is clean and in good working condition before taking photos and listing it.\n* Be cautious when interacting with potential buyers, and consider meeting them in a public place for the transaction.\n* Keep in mind that Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist are platforms that don't offer buyer protection, so be sure to take necessary precautions to ensure a safe and smooth transaction.\n\nBy following these tips, you can increase your chances of selling your bike quickly and for a good price. Good luck!",
