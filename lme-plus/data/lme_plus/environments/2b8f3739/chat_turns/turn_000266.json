When do you think you'll be most alert and focused for the call? Would you prefer to make the call as soon as possible, or do you need some time to gather your thoughts and prepare?\n\n**Creative Block: Side Project (10 am - 12:30 pm)**\nYou've identified your most creative period between 10 am and 12:30 pm. Let's block that time for your side project. What specific tasks do you want to accomplish during this time? Break them down into smaller, manageable chunks to help you stay focused and make progress.\n\n**Emails**\nResponding to emails can be a great way to warm up your brain and get some momentum going. Why not tackle your emails during the time leading up to your creative block? You can respond to the most important ones first and then move on to less pressing ones.\n\nHere's a suggested plan for your morning:\n\n* 9:00 am - 9:30 am: Respond to urgent emails\n* 9:30 am - 10:00 am: Prepare for your phone call (review notes, gather materials, etc.)\n* 10:00 am - 12:30 pm: Work on your side project (creative block)\n* 12:30 pm - 1:30 pm: Take a break (grab lunch, stretch, recharge)\n* 1:30 pm - 2:00 pm: Make the phone call\n* 2:00 pm onwards: Respond to remaining emails or tackle other tasks\n\nFeel free to adjust this plan to suit your needs and energy levels. Remember to take breaks and pace yourself, especially since you're running on low battery today.",
