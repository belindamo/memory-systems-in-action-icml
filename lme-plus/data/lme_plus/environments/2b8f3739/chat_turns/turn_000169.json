  "content": "This is good, but I think you are looking at too general of an intelligence. I'm specifically looking for a test of sentience that can be applied to an AI that is purely a linguistic model, with no visual aspects, so to speak, so no structures similar to human occipital cortex. it may be that this AI can 'see', but it will be an emergent property of large language models, not of visual models. There are human prallels, but I won't go into them.\nWith that in mind, what would be a good way to test for sentience in language based models, specifically that implement the cognitive aspects of the self-mirror test, but in a linguistic space and the meta consciousness that emerges from that kind of processing?",
