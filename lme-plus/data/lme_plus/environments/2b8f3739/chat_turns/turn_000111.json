However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal information or vehicle history, so I don't have records of your oil change history.\n\nBut don't worry, there are a few ways you can find out when you last changed your oil:\n\n1. Check your owner's manual: The recommended oil change interval is usually listed in the maintenance schedule section of your owner's manual.\n2. Look for the oil change sticker: Many oil change shops and dealerships put a sticker on your windshield or inside the driver's side doorjamb with the date and mileage of the last oil change.\n3. Check your maintenance records: If you keep a record of your vehicle's maintenance, you can check your notes or receipts to see when you last changed your oil.\n4. Consult with a mechanic: If you're still unsure, you can take your car to a trusted mechanic or oil change shop, and they can check the condition of your oil and recommend when you should change it.\n\nOnce you determine when you last changed your oil, you can schedule an appointment for a new oil change according to the recommended interval for your vehicle.",
