  "content": "I've been trying to be more mindful of my language and behaviors, especially after speaking with my friend Rachel about their experience of feeling marginalized in the LGBTQ+ community. I've started making an effort to use gender-neutral language and respect people's preferred pronouns, but I'm still learning and want to make sure I'm doing it correctly. Can you recommend some resources or online courses that can help me improve my understanding of LGBTQ+ issues and allyship?",
