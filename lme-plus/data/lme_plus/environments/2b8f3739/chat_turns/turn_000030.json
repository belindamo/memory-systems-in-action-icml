By the way, I've been working on my thesis for a while now, and I've made some good progress. It's titled \"An Exploration of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare\" and it's been a really interesting topic to research. I've been looking at various AI applications in healthcare, from diagnosis to personalized medicine. Have you come across any interesting research or studies on AI in healthcare that I might find useful?",
