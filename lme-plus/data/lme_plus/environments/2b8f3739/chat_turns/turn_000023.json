  "content": "That's a great idea! Mentioning your experience with Sarah Jones' book reading event and the signed copy you got will definitely show your enthusiasm for books and authors. It's a great way to establish your credibility and show that you're not just starting a book club on a whim.\n\nBy sharing your personal experience, you'll also be able to connect with other book lovers in the Facebook group on a more personal level. It's likely that others in the group will be impressed by your dedication to reading and your interest in author events, which can help build trust and encourage them to join your book club.\n\nRemember to be genuine and enthusiastic in your post, and don't be afraid to share your passion for reading and discussing books. Good luck, and I hope you get a great response from the Facebook group!\n\n(And, just between you and me, I'm still curious about Sarah Jones and her book \"The Lost City\". If you don't mind me asking, what did you think of the book reading event and the book itself?)",
