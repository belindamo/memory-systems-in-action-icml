  "content": "With a large number of emails to tackle, it's essential to prioritize and manage your time wisely.\n\nConsidering your energy levels and the importance of your creative block for your side project, I recommend focusing on the most critical emails first. Allocate the 9:00 am - 9:30 am slot for responding to the most urgent and important emails. This will help you clear the most critical ones and free up mental space for your creative work.\n\nYou can then deal with the less pressing emails during your breaks or later in the day, when you've completed your phone call and side project tasks. Remember, it's not necessary to respond to every email immediately. You can batch similar emails together and tackle them in focused intervals.\n\nBy prioritizing your emails, you'll be able to:\n\n1. Clear the most critical emails that require your attention.\n2. Reduce feelings of overwhelm and stress.\n3. Focus on your creative work during your most productive period.\n4. Make progress on your side project without distractions.\n\nIf you find that you need more time for emails, you can always adjust your schedule later in the day. But for now, let's prioritize your most important emails and tackle the rest as you go.\n\nHow does that sound?",
