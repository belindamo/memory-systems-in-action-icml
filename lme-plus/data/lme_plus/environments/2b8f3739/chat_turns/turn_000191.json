I've actually already planned to attend the Halloween Party event at Alton Towers on October 27th, which will feature trick-or-treating, scare zones, and extended park hours until midnight. I'm really looking forward to experiencing the spooky atmosphere. But I'll definitely consider visiting the other parks you mentioned, especially Efteling and PortAventura World. Do you think I could fit in a visit to one of those parks before the end of the year, considering my schedule and the park's operating calendars?",
