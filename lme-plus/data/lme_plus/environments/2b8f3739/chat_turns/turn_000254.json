  "content": "The butterfly effect is a concept in chaos theory which posits that small, seemingly insignificant events can have large and unpredictable consequences over time. The name comes from the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world can ultimately cause a hurricane in another part of the world through a chain of cause and effect.\n\nAn example of the butterfly effect in action could be the following: imagine a person decides to take a different route to work one morning, which leads them to meet someone they would not have otherwise met. This person introduces them to someone else, who offers them a new job opportunity. This job takes them to a new city where they meet their future spouse and have children. The simple decision to take a different route to work had a massive impact on the course of this person's life and the lives of their family.",
