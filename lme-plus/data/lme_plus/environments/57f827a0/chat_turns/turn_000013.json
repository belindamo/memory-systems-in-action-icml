  "content": "The secondary characters in Breaking Bad play a significant role in the character development of the main characters, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.\n\nOne of the most important secondary characters is Jesse Pinkman. Jesse starts off as a small-time drug dealer who teams up with Walter to cook and sell methamphetamine. However, as the series progresses, Jesse becomes increasingly disillusioned with the drug trade, and his struggles with addiction and his traumatic past force Walter to confront the consequences of his actions.\n\nAnother significant secondary character is Hank Schrader, Walter's brother-in-law and a DEA agent. Hank's investigations into the meth trade in Albuquerque put him on a collision course with Walter, forcing Walter to cover his tracks and continually upping the ante in terms of his criminal activities. Ultimately, Hank's pursuit of Walter leads to his own downfall, as he becomes increasingly fixated on catching his brother-in-law.\n\nOther secondary characters, such as Skyler White, Gus Fring, and Mike Ehrmantraut, also play important roles in furthering the main characters' character arcs. Skyler's initial resistance to Walter's criminal activities eventually gives way to her own involvement in the drug trade, while Gus and Mike serve as foils to Walter's increasingly ruthless behavior.\n\nOverall, the secondary characters in Breaking Bad serve to challenge and test the main characters, forcing them to confront their moral choices and expose their weaknesses. This in turn drives the development of the main characters and propels the story forward.",
