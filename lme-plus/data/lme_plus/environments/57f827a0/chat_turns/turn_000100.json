  "content": "Breach of contract occurs when one party fails to perform or fulfill its obligations under a contract. It is a fundamental violation of the terms of the agreement and can result in legal consequences. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 recognizes two types of breaches of contract:\n\n1. Actual Breach:\nAn actual breach of contract occurs when a party fails to perform its obligations at the time specified in the contract. This is also known as an anticipatory breach of contract. For example, if a seller fails to deliver goods on the agreed-upon date, it is an actual breach of contract.\n2. Anticipatory Breach:\nAn anticipatory breach of contract occurs when one party indicates that it will not be able to fulfill its obligations under the contract before the time for performance arrives. This may occur when one party informs the other that it will not be able to perform its obligations, or when it becomes clear that it will not be able to do so. For example, if a buyer informs the seller that he will not be able to pay for goods on the agreed-upon date, it is an anticipatory breach of contract.\n\nTypes of Breach of Contract:\n\n1. Material Breach:\nA material breach of contract occurs when one party fails to perform a significant or essential part of the contract. It is a serious violation of the terms of the agreement and entitles the non-breaching party to terminate the contract and sue for damages.\n2. Minor Breach:\nA minor breach of contract occurs when one party fails to perform a non-essential or minor part of the contract. It does not affect the overall purpose of the contract and entitles the non-breaching party to sue for damages but not to terminate the contract.\n3. Fundamental Breach:\nA fundamental breach of contract occurs when one party fails to perform a vital part of the contract that goes to the root of the agreement. It is a serious violation of the contract that allows the non-breaching party to terminate the contract and sue for damages.\n4. Repudiatory Breach:\nA repudiatory breach of contract occurs when one party refuses to perform its obligations under the contract or indicates that it will not perform them in the future. It is a serious violation of the contract that allows the non-breaching party to terminate the contract and sue for damages.\n\nIn conclusion, breach of contract occurs when one party fails to perform its obligations under the contract. The two types of breaches of contract are actual breach and anticipatory breach. The different types of breach of contract include material breach, minor breach, fundamental breach, and repudiatory breach, each of which has its own legal consequences.",
