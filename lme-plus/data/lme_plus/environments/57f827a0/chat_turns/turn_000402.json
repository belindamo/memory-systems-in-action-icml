The best form of exercise is one that you enjoy and can commit to regularly. Ideally, a combination of aerobic exercise, strength training, and flexibility exercises is best for overall fitness and health. Aerobic exercise can include brisk walking, running, swimming, or cycling, while strength training may involve lifting weights, using resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises. Flexibility exercises may include stretching, yoga, or Pilates. Ultimately, the key is to find a form of exercise that you enjoy and can incorporate into your routine consistently.",
