For example, a team might have a few advanced players, some intermediate players, and a few beginners.\n3. **Player reassignment**: If the league administrators notice that a team is dominating or struggling, they might reassigned players to create more balanced teams.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* Be honest about your skill level during registration or evaluations. This helps the recreation center create teams that are more balanced and enjoyable for everyone.\n* If you have concerns about your team assignment or skill level, don't hesitate to speak with the league administrator or sports coordinator.
