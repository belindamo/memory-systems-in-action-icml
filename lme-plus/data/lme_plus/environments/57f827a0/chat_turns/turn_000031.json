  "content": "Yes, self-referential humor is a big part of what makes South Park so unique and beloved. The episode you're referring to is \"The Snuke\" (Season 11, Episode 4), where the show makes fun of its own animation style, as well as the exaggeration and repetition of catchphrases and tropes. This meta-humor is not only hilarious but also serves as a commentary on the show itself and the nature of satire in general. It's just another example of how South Park is constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in animated television.",
