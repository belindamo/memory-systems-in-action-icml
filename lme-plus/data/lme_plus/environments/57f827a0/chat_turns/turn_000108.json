  "content": "Here is a tabular format summarizing the differences between bailment and pledge:\n\n| Criteria | Bailment | Pledge |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Definition | A legal relationship in which one party (the bailor) transfers possession of goods to another party (the bailee) for a specific purpose. | A special kind of bailment where goods are given as security for a debt or obligation. |\n| Purpose | To protect and/or store the goods or to have them serviced or repaired. | To secure a debt or obligation. |\n| Transfer of Ownership | No transfer of ownership takes place. | No transfer of ownership takes place. |\n| Possession | The bailee has temporary possession of the goods. | The pledgee has possession of the goods. |\n| Liability | The bailee is liable for any loss or damage to the goods, unless it is caused by the bailor's negligence. | The pledgee is liable for any loss or damage to the goods, unless it is caused by events outside their control. |\n| Rights of Parties | The bailor retains ownership and has the right to terminate the bailment. The bailee has the right to possess and use the goods for the specified purpose. | The pledgee has the right to possess and sell the goods if the debtor defaults on the debt. The pledgor retains ownership and can redeem the goods by paying the debt. |\n| Transfer of Interest | The bailor can transfer ownership or interest in the goods to a third party while they are in bailment. | The pledgor cannot transfer ownership or interest in the goods while they are in pledge. |\n\nIn summary, the main differences between bailment and pledge are the purpose of the transaction, the possession and liability of the parties, and the rights and transfer of interest of the goods involved. While both involve the transfer of possession of goods from one party to another, they have distinct legal implications and serve different purposes.",
