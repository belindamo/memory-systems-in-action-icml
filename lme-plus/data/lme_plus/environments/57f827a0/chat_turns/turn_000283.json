Examples include:\n\t* Leg swings (front and back, side to side)\n\t* Arm circles (forward and backward)\n\t* Hip circles (clockwise and counterclockwise)\n\t* Calf raises\n\t* Toe taps\n3. **Muscle Activation**: Finish your warm-up with some muscle activation exercises to engage your core and glutes. Examples include:\n\t* Glute bridges\n\t* Plank holds\n\t* Leg raises (lying on your back with arms extended overhead)\n\n**Cool-down Routine (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Static Stretching**: Start with static stretching to help your muscles recover and reduce muscle soreness.
