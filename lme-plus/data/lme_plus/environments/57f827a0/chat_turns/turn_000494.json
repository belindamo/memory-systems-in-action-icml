  "content": "The cost of tickets to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower varies based on the type of ticket, age of the person, and access level to the tower. As of 2021, the basic access ticket for an individual to the top of the Eiffel Tower costs around \u20ac26. If you choose to take the stairs up to the second floor and then switch to the elevator to the top, the price is around  \u20ac19.50. There are also different ticket options available, such as priority access, guided tours, and night tours, which vary in their costs. While the ticket prices can be considered relatively expensive, the experience of visiting the Eiffel Tower and seeing the beautiful panoramic view of Paris from the top is well worth it.",
