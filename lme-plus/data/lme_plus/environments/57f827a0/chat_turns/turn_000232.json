  "content": "**Tracking Hashtag Performance:**\n\nAdding a column to track hashtag performance is an excellent idea. You can use tools like Hashtagify, RiteTag, or even Instagram Insights (if you have a business account) to track the performance of your hashtags. This will help you identify which hashtags are driving the most engagement, and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n**Google Analytics for Hashtag Tracking:**\n\nUnfortunately, Google Analytics isn't directly designed to track the performance of specific hashtags. Google Analytics is primarily used to track website traffic, conversion rates, and other website-related metrics.\n\nHowever, there are a few workarounds to track the performance of your #fitnessmotivation hashtag:\n\n1. **UTM Tracking:** You can add UTM parameters to the links you share on social media, including the ones with the #fitnessmotivation hashtag. This will allow you to track the traffic generated from those links in Google Analytics. For example, you can add `?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=fm_hashtag` to the end of your link.\n2. **Social Media Analytics Tools:** Use social media analytics tools like Hootsuite Insights, Sprout Social, or Agorapulse to track the performance of your hashtags across multiple platforms. These tools can provide you with hashtag-specific metrics, such as engagement rate, impressions, and clicks.\n3. **Instagram Insights:** If you have an Instagram business account, you can use Instagram Insights to track the performance of your hashtags. Instagram Insights provides metrics like reach, impressions, and engagement for each hashtag you use.\n\nKeep in mind that tracking hashtag performance can be a bit tricky, especially if you're using a popular hashtag like #fitnessmotivation. You might need to use a combination of tools and methods to get a clear picture of your hashtag's performance.\n\nDo you have any other questions about tracking hashtag performance or using UTM parameters?",
