  "content": "When it comes to spices and seasonings, a little can go a long way. Here's a rough estimate of the quantities you can use for each spice and seasoning in the almond mixture:\n\n**Italian-Style:**\n\n* 1/2 cup almonds\n* 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n* Salt and pepper to taste (about 1/4 teaspoon each)\n\n**Spicy:**\n\n* 1/2 cup almonds\n* 1 teaspoon chili powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika\n* 1/2 teaspoon cumin\n* Salt and pepper to taste (about 1/4 teaspoon each)\n\n**Lemon Rosemary:**\n\n* 1/2 cup almonds\n* 1 tablespoon lemon zest\n* 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary\n* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n* Salt and pepper to taste (about 1/4 teaspoon each)\n\n**Indian-Inspired:**\n\n* 1/2 cup almonds\n* 1 teaspoon garam masala\n* 1/2 teaspoon cumin\n* 1/4 teaspoon coriander\n* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)\n* Salt and pepper to taste (about 1/4 teaspoon each)\n\n**Simple yet Savory:**\n\n* 1/2 cup almonds\n* 1/2 teaspoon paprika\n* Salt and pepper to taste (about 1/4 teaspoon each)\n\nRemember, these are rough estimates, and you can adjust the quantities to your taste preferences. If you're unsure, start with a smaller amount and add more to taste.\n\nWhen mixing the almond mixture, combine the ingredients in a bowl and stir until the spices and seasonings are evenly distributed. You can also add a pinch of salt and pepper to the mixture to bring out the flavors.\n\nKeep in mind that the type and quality of spices and seasonings can affect the flavor profile. Freshly ground spices, for example, will have a more vibrant flavor than pre-ground spices. Experiment with different brands and types to find the ones that work best for you.",
