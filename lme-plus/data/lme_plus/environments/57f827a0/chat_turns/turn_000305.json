I've heard great things about both products, and I'm excited to see how they'll work together to improve my skin. Thanks for the info! By the way, have you got any recommendations for scented candles? I recently got one from Bath & Body Works, and I love it. It really makes my bathroom feel relaxing and inviting.",
