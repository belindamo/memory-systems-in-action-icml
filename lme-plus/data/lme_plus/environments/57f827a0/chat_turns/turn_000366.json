It's no wonder you're feeling the need to get back on track with your sleep schedule. Going to bed late can disrupt your body's natural sleep-wake cycle, making it harder to fall asleep, stay asleep, and get quality sleep.\n\nTry to establish a consistent sleep schedule, where you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends. This will help regulate your body's internal clock and improve the quality of your sleep.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some additional tips to help you wind down and prepare for bed earlier:\n\n1. **Set a \"bedtime mode\"**: Designate a specific time to start winding down, say 10-11 PM, and stick to it. This could mean turning off screens, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques.\n2. **Use the 10-minute rule**: When you start feeling tired, give yourself 10 minutes to wrap up whatever you're doing and get ready for bed.\n3. **Plan your TV show binge-watching**: Try to limit your TV show watching to earlier in the evening, and avoid getting sucked into just one more episode. You can always watch the next episode the following day!\n4. **Make a bedtime routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine, such as reading a book, listening to soothing music, or practicing gentle stretches. This will signal to your brain that it's time to sleep.\n\nRemember, it might take some time for your body to adjust to a new sleep schedule, so be patient and don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Keep working on establishing healthy sleep habits, and your body will thank you in the long run.\n\nGood luck with your progressive muscle relaxation tonight, and I hope you have a more restful sleep!",
