It's excellent that you've found a routine that's working for you.\n\nReading can be a calming activity that helps slow down your brain activity, making it easier to fall asleep. Plus, reflecting on the insights and ideas from your self-help book can help you process your thoughts and emotions, clearing your mind for a more restful sleep.\n\nSince you're already reading for 20-30 minutes before sleep, you might want to consider setting a specific bedtime routine around it. For example, you could try:\n\n1. **Dimming the lights**: Gradually dim the lights in your bedroom to signal to your brain that it's time for sleep.\n2. **Making a warm drink**: Prepare a warm, non-caffeinated drink, like tea or milk, to help you relax.\n3. **Getting cozy**: Make sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature, and you're wearing comfortable PJs.\n4. **Writing in a journal**: Take a few minutes to jot down any thoughts, reflections, or insights from your reading. This can help you process your thoughts and clear your mind.\n\nBy incorporating these small habits into your pre-sleep routine, you can create a calming and relaxing atmosphere that prepares your body and mind for a restful night's sleep.\n\nHow's the self-help book you're reading? Is there a particular theme or message that's resonating with you?",
