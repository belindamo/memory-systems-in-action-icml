I'm here to assist and provide information to help you with your Wi-Fi concerns.\n\nHowever, I'm glad you brought up the Wi-Fi analyzer app suggestion! As I mentioned earlier, using a Wi-Fi analyzer app can be a great way to identify the least crowded channel and optimize your Wi-Fi performance. It's a valuable tool for troubleshooting and improving your Wi-Fi network.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, I recommend downloading a Wi-Fi analyzer app (like Wi-Fi Analyzer or NetSpot) and scanning for nearby networks to see which channels are the most crowded. Then, you can adjust your router's channel settings to use a less crowded channel, which might help improve your Wi-Fi performance.\n\nRemember to also try moving your router to a higher location and updating the firmware, as we discussed earlier. These steps can also help improve your Wi-Fi signal strength and overall network performance.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!",
