  "content": "You can buy tickets on-site at the Eiffel Tower, but it's recommended to buy tickets in advance online to avoid long wait times. Online tickets allow you to skip the line and can be purchased up to 60 days in advance. Additionally, during peak seasons, it's possible that tickets for the same day might be sold out, so it's better to book in advance. However, if you decide to buy tickets on-site, be prepared to wait in long lines, especially during peak tourist season.",
