Being more mindful of your food choices can make a huge difference in your overall health and well-being. Oatmeal and scrambled eggs with veggies are excellent breakfast options - complex carbs, protein, and fiber to keep you going throughout the morning.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention being more mindful of what you eat after your meditation and yoga practice. Research suggests that mindfulness practices can indeed influence our food choices and eating habits. When we're more present and aware, we're more likely to make healthier decisions that nourish our bodies.\n\nHave you noticed any other changes in your daily habits or routines since starting your meditation practice? For example, have you become more productive, or do you find yourself handling stress and challenges differently?\n\n(And by the way, I'm loving this conversation! It's great to hear about your experiences and how meditation is positively impacting your life.)",
