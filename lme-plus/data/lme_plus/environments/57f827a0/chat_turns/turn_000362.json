  "content": "That sounds like an awesome experience! Small indie rock festivals can be really special, as they often offer a more intimate setting and a chance to discover new talent. The 1975 is a great headliner, too - they always put on an high-energy show with a lot of visual flair.\n\nIt's great that you got to see some up-and-coming bands, too. Sometimes, those acts can be just as exciting as the headliner, and you might even discover your new favorite band. Did any of the opening acts stand out to you, or was there a particular performance that surprised you?\n\nAnd, I'm curious, what was the atmosphere like at the festival? Was it a laid-back vibe, or was everyone pretty energetic and dancing throughout the day?",
