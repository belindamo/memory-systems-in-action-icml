  "content": "AGvisorPRO addresses Canada\u2019s goals to improve the environmental performance of the agriculture sector and make sure Canadian\u2019s have access to affordable food (The Canadian Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals, StatCan, June 22, 2021). \nImprovements in Canadian food production contribute to the availability of healthy food for Canadians and other nations that import our products. Improvements also bring more acclaim to Canadian agriculture\u2019s reputation as a global leader. \n\nAGvisorPRO believes that agriculture sustainability means building a resilient food supply chain that is economically viable and protects the environment, resulting in a better quality of life for future generations. We help to improve environmental sustainability by easing access to knowledge, helping agriculture to use resources more efficiently, improve food security, and reduce emissions. By connecting farmers with global experts, decisions made through AGvisorPRO are better decisions for the long term sustainable future of agriculture. \n\nAGvisorPRO builds capacity in farmers and the ag industry. The platform transfers comprehensive agriculture knowledge in an affordable and convenient way. This platform will aid farmers in building and maintaining their operations. Producers can use AGvisorPRO to gain knowledge that would have otherwise been unavailable, leading to increased profitability, efficiency, and sustainability. Supporting food production at the farm level is critical for the entire food supply chain.",
