Here are five dinner ideas, one for each weekday:\n\nMonday: Chicken Fajitas\n\n* Use the chicken breasts to make a flavorful and spicy fajita dish with bell peppers, onions, and fajita seasoning. Serve with warm flour or corn tortillas, sour cream, and salsa.\n\nTuesday: Korean-Style Ground Beef and Vegetable Stir-Fry\n\n* Utilize the ground beef to make a savory and spicy stir-fry with Korean chili flakes (gochugaru), soy sauce, and a variety of colorful vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers. Serve over rice or noodles.\n\nWednesday: Chicken Tikka Masala\n\n* Marinate the chicken breasts in yogurt and Indian spices, then grill or bake them. Serve with a rich and creamy tomato-based sauce, basmati rice, and naan bread.\n\nThursday: Beef and Mushroom Stroganoff\n\n* Saut\u00e9 the ground beef with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, onions, and a can of beef broth, served over egg noodles.
