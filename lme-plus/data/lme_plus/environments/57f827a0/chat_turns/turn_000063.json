  "content": "That's a great idea! San Francisco and Fresno are both great cities to visit, and they're relatively close to Yosemite. San Francisco is about a 4-hour drive from Yosemite Valley, and Fresno is about 2 hours away.\n\nSan Francisco is a fantastic city with a lot to offer, from iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island to vibrant neighborhoods like Fisherman's Wharf and Haight-Ashbury. You could easily spend a day or two exploring the city.\n\nFresno, on the other hand, is a great base for exploring Yosemite and the surrounding area. It has a more laid-back atmosphere than San Francisco, and it's a good place to stock up on supplies or grab a bite to eat before heading into the park.\n\nIf Mike and Sarah are interested in visiting either of these cities, you could consider adding a day or two to your itinerary to explore. Just keep in mind that it will add some extra driving time to your trip, so you'll want to make sure you have enough time to fit everything in.\n\nAnd don't forget to check out the Yosemite app! It's a great resource for planning your trip and getting the most out of your time in the park. It has maps, trail information, and even a feature that lets you report any issues or concerns you might have while you're in the park.\n\nI think you're really getting into the planning mode now! Have fun discussing the options with Mike and Sarah, and I'm sure you'll come up with a fantastic itinerary for your trip.",
