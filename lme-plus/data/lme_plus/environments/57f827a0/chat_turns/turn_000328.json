As for thrillers with a similar atmosphere to \"Hellbound\", I've got some recommendations that blend psychological horror with intense action sequences:\n\n1. **Train to Busan (2016)**: While not as dark as \"Hellbound\", this zombie apocalypse thriller shares a similar sense of urgency and intense action sequences. The film's claustrophobic setting on a train adds to the tension.\n2. **The Wailing (2016)**: This horror-thriller explores the supernatural and the psychological, much like \"Hellbound\". It's a slower-burning, atmospheric film with a sense of creeping dread, but it builds up to intense and disturbing sequences.\n3. **Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum (2018)**: This found-footage horror film takes place in a haunted asylum, which provides a creepy atmosphere similar to \"Hellbound\"'s hellish visions. It's a tense, jump-scare-filled ride with a strong psychological component.\n4. **House of Hummingbird (2018)**: Set in 1994, this psychological thriller follows a teenager struggling to cope with her family's dark secrets.

It shares \"Hellbound\"'s sense of claustrophobia and features intense, suspenseful sequences.\n6. **Deranged (2012)**: This sci-fi horror film follows a parasitic worm outbreak that turns people into violent, zombie-like creatures. It's a fast-paced, intense thriller with a strong psychological component, similar to \"Hellbound\".\n7. **Sector 7 (2011)**: This monster horror film takes place on an oil rig, where a creature begins to terrorize the crew. It's a tense, intense thriller with a sense of claustrophobia and features some impressive action sequences.\n\nThese films all share some elements of \"Hellbound\"'s blend of psychological horror and intense action sequences, so you're bound to find something that scratches that same itch!\n\nKeep in mind that some of these films might not be as intense or dark as \"Hellbound\", but they all have a similar atmosphere and tone that fans of the series are likely to appreciate.
