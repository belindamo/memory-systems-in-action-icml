  "content": "I'm happy to help you with meal planning and recipe suggestions! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't accompany you to Costco with your mom. But I'm here to assist you with your meal planning needs!\n\nTo get started, could you please provide me with some details?\n\n1. Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free)?\n2. How many people are you planning to cook for?\n3. What type of cuisine do you enjoy (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Asian, comfort food)?\n4. Do you have any ingredients or leftovers you'd like to use up?\n5. How much time do you have available for cooking each day?\n6. Would you like me to suggest breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a combination of meals?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized recipe suggestions and help you create a grocery list!",
