  "content": "The first season of Ted Lasso consists of 10 episodes, and each episode is approximately 30-40 minutes long. That's a total of around 6-8 hours of content.\n\nIf you plan to watch a few episodes each weekend, you can easily finish the entire first season over the next few weekends. Here's a rough plan to help you stay on track:\n\n* Weekend 1: Episodes 1-3 (around 2-3 hours)\n* Weekend 2: Episodes 4-6 (around 2-3 hours)\n* Weekend 3: Episodes 7-10 (around 2-3 hours)\n\nFeel free to adjust the pace to your liking, but this should give you a rough idea of how you can break it down. You might even find yourself binge-watching a few episodes in one sitting, as the show is quite engaging and easy to follow!\n\nEnjoy your Ted Lasso marathon, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more recommendations or have any other questions!",
