  "content": "Apple TV+ is a relatively new streaming service, and it's quite affordable.\n\nThe cost of Apple TV+ is:\n\n* $4.99 per month (with a 7-day free trial)\n\nIf you're not sure about committing to a monthly subscription, you can try the 7-day free trial to watch CODA and get a feel for the service. If you like it, you can continue with the subscription. If not, you can cancel before the trial ends, and you won't be charged.\n\nAdditionally, if you've purchased an Apple device recently (e.g., iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV), you might be eligible for a free year of Apple TV+. Check your device's settings or the Apple website to see if you're eligible for this offer.\n\nHope that helps you make a decision!",
