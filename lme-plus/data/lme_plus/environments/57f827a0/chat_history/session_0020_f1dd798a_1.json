If you're unsure, start with a smaller amount and add more to taste.\n\nWhen mixing the almond mixture, combine the ingredients in a bowl and stir until the spices and seasonings are evenly distributed. You can also add a pinch of salt and pepper to the mixture to bring out the flavors.\n\nKeep in mind that the type and quality of spices and seasonings can affect the flavor profile.
