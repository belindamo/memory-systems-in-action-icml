This is a relatively easy hike with beautiful scenery and a stunning waterfall to see along the way. It is also a shorter hike, which makes it perfect for those who are just starting out. However, it's always important to check the trail difficulty and length before attempting any hike and make sure to come prepared with the appropriate gear and supplies."
