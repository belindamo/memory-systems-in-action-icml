We are attracting public and private sector investment to Alberta.\n\nWe address Canada\u2019s goals to improve the environmental performance of the ag sector and ensure access to food (Canadian Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals). New agtech developed in Canada will be needed globally. \n\nOur mission:AGvisorPRO will increase farm profitability, agriculture sustainability and enhance global food security. 87% of the agri-food industry sees a need for a digital tool, like AGvisorPRO, that creates an industry knowledge hub(Agri-Food IMPACT- Agri-Food Ecosystem Platform Analysis and Overview, 2021). We eliminate the need for a farmer to meet an intermediary. Our technology will allow companies to raise the productivity of their workers by 20-25%(McKinsey & Co., July 1, 2012). \n\nAgriculture has a slow adoption rate(12 yrs for 16%)(Griffin, 2020). Before a farmer will adopt a practice to reduce fertilizer use, they need to have confidence that their decision will not negatively impact farm viability. To make significant changes by 2030, AGvisorPRO is needed to increase confidence and reduce adoption time.\n \nWe address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2, 8, 9, 12, &13. We provide digital access to knowledge resources, via communications technology, for food producers to ensure sustainable and resilient agricultural practices."
