      "content": "There is no specific trophy awarded between Ireland and Scotland in the Six Nations Championship. However, Ireland and Scotland do compete annually for the Centenary Quaich, which is a trophy awarded to the winner of their Six Nations match.\n\nThe Centenary Quaich was first presented in 1989 to commemorate the centenary of the first-ever meeting between the two teams in 1879. The Quaich is a Scottish drinking cup and is traditionally used for whisky, and it is named after the Gaelic word for cup.\n\nThe Centenary Quaich is not an official Six Nations trophy but is instead a separate trophy that is contested between Ireland and Scotland during their annual Six Nations match. The Quaich is currently held by Ireland, who won their 2021 Six Nations encounter with Scotland by a score of 27-24."
