  "content": "The WH-1000XM4 does sound impressive, but it's a bit pricey. I'm trying to stay within my budget for new gadgets this quarter. Speaking of which, the smartwatch was the first purchase, and it cost $200, which was a great deal considering it was originally $250. Do you think I can find any discounts or deals on the WH-1000XM4 that could bring the price down?",
