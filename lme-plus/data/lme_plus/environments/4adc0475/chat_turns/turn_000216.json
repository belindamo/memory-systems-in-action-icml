I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations for display cases that cater to your mixed collection of ancient and modern coins.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\nBefore we dive into specific recommendations, let's consider a few factors to ensure you find the perfect display case:\n\n1. **Size and layout**: How many coins do you have, and how do you want to organize them? Do you prefer a compact case or a larger one with multiple shelves?\n2. **Coin size and shape**: Are your coins uniform in size or do you have a mix of large and small coins?\n3. **Lighting**: Do you want a case with built-in lighting or would you prefer to use external lighting?\n4. **Security**: How important is security to you? Do you need a case with locking mechanisms or tamper-evident features?\n5. **Style and design**: Do you prefer a modern, sleek design or a more traditional, ornate look?\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nHere are some excellent display case options for your coin collection:\n\n1. **Coin Albums and Folders**: If you have a smaller collection or want a more portable option, consider coin albums or folders. These are great for storing and displaying coins in a compact format.

Brands like Woodland Scenics, DisplayIt, and Oakridge Hobbies offer wooden display cases.\n4. **Wall-Mounted Display Cases**: If you want to save space and add a touch of sophistication, consider wall-mounted display cases. These are perfect for smaller collections or for creating a focal point in a room.
