Preventing blisters is a common concern for many runners, and it's great that you're thinking ahead for your upcoming 10K.

Make sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your runs.\n7. **Wear socks with extra cushioning**: Socks with extra cushioning, especially in high-impact areas like the heel and toe, can help reduce friction and prevent blisters.\n8. **Try different lacing techniques**: Experiment with different lacing techniques, such as the \"bunny ear\" or \"heel lock\" methods, to reduce pressure on your feet and toes.\n9. **Use orthotics or insoles**: If you have foot issues or pronation, consider using orthotics or insoles to redistribute pressure and reduce friction.\n10. **Take care of your feet**: Regularly clean and dry your feet, trim your toenails, and moisturize your skin to keep your feet healthy and blister-free.\n\nBy following these tips, you can minimize the risk of blisters and ensure a comfortable and enjoyable running experience.
