  "content": "The silver content of your coins is an important aspect of their value.\n\n**Morgan Dollar Silver Content**\n\nThe Morgan dollar, minted from 1878 to 1904 and again in 1921, contains 90% silver and 10% copper. Each Morgan dollar weighs 26.73 grams, with a silver content of:\n\n* 0.7734 troy oz (24.05 grams) of silver\n* 0.0267 troy oz (0.83 grams) of copper\n\nThe silver content of the Morgan dollar is one of its most valuable aspects, especially considering the current price of silver.\n\n**Peace Dollar Silver Content**\n\nThe Peace dollar, minted from 1921 to 1935 and again in 1965, also contains 90% silver and 10% copper. Each Peace dollar weighs 26.73 grams, with a silver content of:\n\n* 0.7734 troy oz (24.05 grams) of silver\n* 0.0267 troy oz (0.83 grams) of copper\n\nLike the Morgan dollar, the Peace dollar's silver content is a significant contributor to its value.\n\n**Silver Value vs. Numismatic Value**\n\nThe silver content of your coins is often referred to as their \"melt value\" or \"intrinsic value.\" This is the value of the silver itself, regardless of the coin's numismatic value. The numismatic value, on the other hand, is the value placed on the coin due to its rarity, condition, historical significance, and demand.\n\nIn the case of Morgan and Peace dollars, the numismatic value often far exceeds the melt value. For example, a circulated Morgan dollar might have a melt value of around $15 (based on the current silver price), but its numismatic value could be $50 or more due to its condition, rarity, and demand.\n\n**Silver Price Fluctuations**\n\nThe value of silver can fluctuate over time, affecting the melt value of your coins. If the price of silver increases, the melt value of your coins will also increase. However, the numismatic value of your coins may not be directly affected by changes in the silver price.\n\nTo give you an idea of the current silver price, you can check online resources like APMEX, Kitco, or the London Bullion Market Association. As of our conversation, the silver price is around $18-20 per troy ounce.\n\nKeep in mind that the numismatic value of your coins is often more significant than their melt value. If you're considering selling your coins, it's essential to research their numismatic value, as well as the current silver price, to get a fair deal.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the silver content of your Morgan and Peace dollars!",
