Did you end up not getting the red dress, or do you have both the dress and the blouse?\n\nEither way, black ankle boots are an excellent choice because of their versatility. They can be dressed up or down and paired with a variety of outfits.\n\nIf you do have both the red dress and the white blouse, you could try pairing the boots with each item separately to see which look you like better. The boots might add a cool, edgy touch to the feminine white blouse, while they could create a chic, sophisticated look with the bold red dress.\n\nLet me know if you need any more fashion advice or have any other questions!",
