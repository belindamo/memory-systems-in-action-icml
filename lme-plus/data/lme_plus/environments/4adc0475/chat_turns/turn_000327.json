  "content": "You are right to be concerned, as younger users are more vulnerable to cyberbullying. There are several additional measures that can be taken to protect them:\n\n1. Age verification: Social media platforms should implement age verification systems to ensure that users are meeting the minimum age requirement, which will prevent younger children from accessing the platforms.\n\n2. Parental supervision: Parents should monitor their children's online activity and educate them about the risks of cyberbullying. They can also use parental control software to monitor their children's use of social media platforms.\n\n3. Restricting messages from strangers: Social media platforms should create default account settings that restrict messages from strangers being able to contact minors.\n\n4. Limiting sensitive information: Social media platforms should require users to limit personal and sensitive information that they share in their profiles, such as age, location, and photographs.\n\n5. Education: Education should be provided to children about online behavior, internet safety, and cyberbullying.\n\n6. Reporting options: Platforms should make it easier to report cyberbullying, with clear instructions and support for users.\n\n7. Collaborative action: Social media platforms should work together with schools, parents, and other relevant organizations to create a stronger environment against cyberbullying. \n\nBy implementing these measures, social media platforms can help keep younger users safe from the risks of cyberbullying.",
