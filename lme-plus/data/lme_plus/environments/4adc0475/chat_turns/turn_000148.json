However, I can provide some general examples of recent cases that the BWF has investigated and the sanctions imposed:\n\n1. In 2019, the BWF fined several players for breaching the code of conduct after a streak of on-court incidents, including one in which an Indonesian player physically attacked a coach following a game.\n\n2. In October 2020, the BWF issued a three-year ban to Indonesian player, Sony Dwi Kuncoro, after he tested positive for a banned substance.\n\n3. In November 2020, the BWF fined French player, Brice Leverdez, and his coach for unsporting behavior during a match at the Denmark Open.\n\n4. In January 2021, the BWF banned Indian badminton players, Ankit Parakh and Gaurav Khanna, for a year each for submitting fake COVID-19 test reports to participate in a tournament.\n\nIt is crucial to note that these are just some examples, and the BWF continuously investigates potential misconduct within badminton to uphold ethical and behavioral standards within the sport.",
