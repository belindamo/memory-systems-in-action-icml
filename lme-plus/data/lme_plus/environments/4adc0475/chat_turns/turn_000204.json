  "content": "During the later Vedic period, a number of deities gained more prominence in Hinduism. Among them were Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi.\n\nVishnu was worshiped as the preserver of the universe and was depicted as the supreme god who appeared on Earth in various incarnations, such as Rama and Krishna.\n\nShiva was worshiped as the god of destruction and regeneration, and he was considered the father of the universe. He was often revered by ascetics and those seeking spiritual enlightenment.\n\nDevi, or the goddess, became an important part of Hindu worship during this period. Devi was seen as the ultimate source of power, creativity, and fertility, and she was associated with different aspects of nature, such as the earth, the sky, and the sea.\n\nThese deities, along with others such as Ganesha and Hanuman, continue to be venerated in modern Hinduism.",
