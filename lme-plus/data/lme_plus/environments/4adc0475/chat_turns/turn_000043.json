  "content": "6.1 General description:\nThe hazard prediction module in the data fusion cell is designed to assist a CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) operator in integrating and analysing various sources of CBRN information to inform the prediction of potential hazards and contamination. The module will generate a comprehensive CBRN picture, including the predicted movement of CBRN clouds over time, and make this information continuously available to the CBRN operator and other parts of the data fusion cell.\n\n6.2 Design:\nThe hazard prediction module will be designed with internal interfaces that ensure the full fidelity of all related CBRN information. This will involve implementing data filtering and fusion techniques to combine and integrate the various sources of CBRN information. The module will also incorporate algorithms and models to predict the movement of CBRN clouds based on meteorological data and other relevant factors. The module will be user-friendly and intuitive, with the aim of providing the CBRN operator with a clear and easily understandable view of the CBRN situation.\n\n6.3 Technical description:\nThe hazard prediction module will be implemented using a combination of software and hardware technologies. It will utilise specialised software tools and algorithms for data integration and analysis, as well as hardware components such as sensors and monitoring systems to collect CBRN data. The module will be designed to operate in real-time, with the ability to continuously update and refine the CBRN picture as new information becomes available. The module will also have the capability to alert the CBRN operator of any potential hazards or changes in the CBRN situation.\n\n6.4 Responsibilities:\nThe hazard prediction module will be responsible for assisting the CBRN operator in integrating and analysing all relevant CBRN information, predicting the movement of CBRN clouds, and generating a comprehensive CBRN picture. It will also be responsible for making this information continuously available to the CBRN operator and other parts of the data fusion cell. The team responsible for designing and implementing the hazard prediction module will have expertise in CBRN data analysis, software development, and hardware engineering. They will also ensure that the module is user-friendly and easy for the CBRN operator to use.",
