  "content": "The On-Stage GS7361 is a popular and well-regarded music stand, known for its compact design, ease of use, and affordability. However, when it comes to holding heavy music books, I'd like to provide some additional insights.\n\n**Sturdiness and Weight Capacity:**\n\nThe On-Stage GS7361 has a sturdy steel construction, but it's designed to be lightweight and portable. While it can hold a decent amount of weight, it's not specifically designed to hold extremely heavy music books.\n\nThe manufacturer doesn't provide an exact weight capacity, but based on user reviews and feedback, it's generally recommended for holding a maximum of 2-3 pounds (0.9-1.4 kg) of music. If your music books are significantly heavier than that, you might want to consider a more heavy-duty music stand.\n\n**Tips for Using the GS7361 with Heavy Music Books:**\n\nIf you still want to use the GS7361 with your heavy music books, here are some tips to help ensure stability:\n\n1. **Distribute the weight evenly:** Place the heaviest books in the center of the tray, with lighter ones on the sides to maintain balance.\n2. **Use the adjustable height:** Lower the stand to a comfortable playing height to reduce the likelihood of the stand tipping over.\n3. **Secure the books:** Consider using music clips or a music holder with a grip to keep your books in place and prevent them from shifting or falling.\n4. **Place on a stable surface:** Position the stand on a flat, stable surface to prevent any wobbling or movement.\n\n**Alternative Options:**\n\nIf you're concerned about the weight capacity of the GS7361, you might want to consider other music stands specifically designed to hold heavier loads. Some options include:\n\n1. **Manhasset 5001:** A sturdy, heavy-duty music stand with a weight capacity of around 5 pounds (2.3 kg).\n2. **Hamilton KB90:** A robust music stand with a weight capacity of around 4 pounds (1.8 kg).\n\nUltimately, if you have extremely heavy music books, it's better to err on the side of caution and choose a music stand designed to handle the weight.",
