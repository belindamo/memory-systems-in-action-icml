However, based on publicly available information, the BWF has established a code of conduct for players, officials, and member associations which outlines expected behavior and ethical standards. The BWF also has a judicial system in place that investigates any potential misconduct or breaches of the code of conduct. Complaints or reports of misconduct can be made to the BWF Ethics Commission or other relevant bodies. The investigation involves gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses, and evaluating the validity of allegations. If found guilty of misconduct, the BWF imposes appropriate sanctions, which may include suspension, disqualification, fines, or other penalties, depending on the severity of the offense. The BWF also upholds transparency and accountability by publicizing information about any investigations and outcomes.",
