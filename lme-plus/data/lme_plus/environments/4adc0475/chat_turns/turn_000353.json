  "content": "Here are a few ways to tell if a call claiming to be from your bank is legitimate:\n\n1. Verify the caller's identity: Banks will usually be able to verify your identity by asking for your personal information, such as your address, date of birth, or the last four digits of your social security number. If the caller is unable to verify your identity, it may be a scam.\n2. Look out for red flags: Scammers often pressure you to act quickly, threatening to cancel your account or asking for personal information right away.\n3. Call the bank back: If you're unsure whether the call is legitimate, hang up and call the bank back using the phone number on your account statement or on the bank's official website. This way you can be sure you are talking to a legitimate representative from your bank.\n4. Be aware of spoofed calls: Scammers can use technology to make it appear as if the call is coming from a legitimate phone number, such as your bank's customer service number. Be wary of calls coming from numbers that look familiar, but may be slightly different.\n\nRemember, your bank will never ask for your personal information over the phone or by text, unless you have initiated the contact with them.",
