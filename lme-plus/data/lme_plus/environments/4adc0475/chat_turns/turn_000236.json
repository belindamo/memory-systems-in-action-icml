The total came out to be around $40.\n\nAnd... oh wait, I think I also found a receipt from a online furniture store. I bought a new desk lamp in late March, and that cost around $60.\n\nLet me add those to the list...\n\nDo you think we should categorize the Amazon purchase under Electronics, and the desk lamp under Home Goods?",
