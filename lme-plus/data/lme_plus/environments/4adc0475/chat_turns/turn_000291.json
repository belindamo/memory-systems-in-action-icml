  "content": "Yes, all species of frogs go through metamorphosis, which is a natural process of transformation from the larval (tadpole) stage to the adult stage. During metamorphosis, the tadpole undergoes significant physical changes, such as growing limbs, developing lungs, and losing its tail. The metamorphosis process can vary in duration, taking anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the species and environmental conditions.\n\nFrogs are classified as amphibians, which means they have a unique life cycle that involves an aquatic larval stage (tadpole) and a terrestrial adult stage. Metamorphosis is a crucial step in the frog life cycle, allowing them to adapt to changes in their environment, particularly the transition from living in water to living on land.",
