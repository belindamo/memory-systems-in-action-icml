  "content": "The duration of the photography exhibit can vary depending on the museum and the specific exhibit. Some photography exhibits can be temporary, lasting only a few weeks or months, while others can be more permanent or part of the museum's regular collection.\n\nAs a general rule, temporary exhibits can range from 3-6 months, but some can be shorter or longer. It's possible that the \"Contemporary Photography\" exhibit might be a temporary exhibit, especially if it's a traveling exhibit or a special showcase of a specific artist's work.\n\nI would recommend checking the museum's website or contacting them directly to ask about the exhibit's duration. They should be able to tell you how long the exhibit will be on display and if there are any plans for it to travel to other museums or be replaced by a new exhibit.\n\nIt's always a good idea to plan your visit accordingly, especially if you're interested in seeing a specific exhibit. You wouldn't want to miss it if it's only up for a limited time!",
