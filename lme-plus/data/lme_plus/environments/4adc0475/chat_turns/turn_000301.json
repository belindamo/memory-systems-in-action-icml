However, I can offer some general tips to help you find good deals on oats and milk:\n\n**Oats:**\n\n1. **Buy in bulk**: Purchasing oats in larger quantities can often lead to a lower cost per unit. Look for sales or discounts on bulk packs of oats at warehouse clubs or online retailers.\n2. **Store brands**: Opt for store-brand oats, which are often cheaper than name-brand options but similar in quality.\n3. **Rolling oats vs. steel-cut oats**: Rolling oats are generally cheaper than steel-cut oats, but both can be used for oatmeal porridge.\n\n**Milk:**\n\n1. **Sales and promotions**: Keep an eye on weekly ads or digital coupons for sales on milk at your local grocery stores.\n2. **Buy in bulk (again!)**: If you have the storage space, purchasing milk in larger quantities (e.g., gallons or 2% quart packs) can be more cost-effective.\n3. **Consider alternative milks**: If you're open to trying different types of milk, some stores may offer discounts or promotions on non-dairy milk alternatives like almond, soy, or oat milk.\n\n**Tips for finding deals:**\n\n1. **Check online retailers**: Websites like Amazon, Walmart, or Target often offer competitive pricing and discounts on oats and milk.\n2. **Use cashback apps**: Apps like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, or Checkout 51 may offer rebates or cashback on oats and milk purchases.\n3. **Plan ahead**: If you have a flexible shopping schedule, try to shop during sales cycles or stock up when prices are low.\n\nRemember to always check prices and compare deals at different stores to find the best value for your money. Happy shopping!",
