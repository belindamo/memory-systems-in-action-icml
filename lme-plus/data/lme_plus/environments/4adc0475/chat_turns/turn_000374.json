  "content": "Between 1960 and 1970, Angola was a colony of Portugal. In 1961, the anti-colonial movement known as the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) was founded, followed by the establishment of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in 1956. Both groups began to wage a guerrilla war against the Portuguese colonial government in the early 1960s. In 1974, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal led to the withdrawal of Portuguese forces from Angola, and in 1975, the MPLA declared Angola's independence. The FNLA and another anti-colonial group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), however, continued to fight against the MPLA in a civil war that lasted until 2002.",
