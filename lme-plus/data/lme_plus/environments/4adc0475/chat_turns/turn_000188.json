Congratulations on committing to regular practice and lessons.\n\nNow, about that music stand...\n\nFor a music stand that can hold both guitar and ukulele sheet music, I'd recommend considering the following factors:\n\n1. **Adjustable height and angle**: Look for a stand that can be adjusted to accommodate both instruments and your playing style.\n2. **Wide enough tray**: Ensure the tray is wide enough to hold both guitar and ukulele sheet music, which are usually smaller than standard music sheets.\n3. **Sturdy construction**: A sturdy stand will keep your music secure and prevent it from toppling over.\n\nBased on these factors, here are some music stand recommendations:\n\n1. **Manhasset 5001**: A popular, sturdy stand with an adjustable height range of 26-48 inches and a tray width of 12 inches. It's suitable for both guitar and ukulele music.\n2. **Hamilton KB90**: This music stand has a adjustable height range of 24-42 inches and a tray width of 11 inches. It's known for its stability and durability.\n3. **On-Stage GS7361**: This stand features a adjustable height range of 24-40 inches and a tray width of 12 inches. It's a compact, lightweight option that's easy to set up and transport.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider the following:\n\n* Do you prefer a collapsible stand for easy storage and transport?\n* Do you need a stand with a built-in page holder or clips to keep your music in place?\n* Is a weighted base or non-slip feet important to you?\n\nYou can find these music stands online at music gear retailers like Amazon, Musician's Friend, or Guitar Center.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect music stand for your guitar and ukulele adventures!",
