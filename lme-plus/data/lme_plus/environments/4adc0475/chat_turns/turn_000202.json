  "content": "Indra is one of the most ancient Vedic deities in Hinduism and has been worshiped since the Rigvedic period (1500\u20131200 BCE) as the god of thunder, lightning, and rain.\n\nIn the early Vedic period, Indra was considered the king of gods and was worshiped as the supreme deity. He was believed to control the weather and was often invoked during important rituals such as the Vajapeya yajna.\n\nDuring the later Vedic period (1000\u2013500 BCE), the worship of Indra began to decline as other deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi gained more prominence. However, Indra continued to be revered as a powerful god and was often mentioned in hymns and prayers.\n\nIn the Puranas, which were written during the medieval period (500\u20131500 CE), Indra was depicted as a flawed deity who was prone to arrogance and jealousy. He was often humbled by other gods or sages and had to seek their forgiveness. Despite this, he was still respected as an important deity and was considered the ruler of the heavens.\n\nIn modern Hinduism, Indra is not worshiped as much as he once was, but his stories and legends continue to be part of Hindu mythology. Some communities in India still worship him as a local deity, particularly in regions where agriculture and rainfall are important.",
