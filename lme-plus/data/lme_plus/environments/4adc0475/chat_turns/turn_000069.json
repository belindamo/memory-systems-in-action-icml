And mixing up your routine with new activities like kayaking or swimming can help keep things interesting and prevent boredom.\n\nRemember, every small step counts, and making small changes to your daily routine can add up to make a big difference in the long run. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two, just get back on track and keep moving forward.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and enjoy the process! Exercise should be a positive and enjoyable experience, not a chore. Experiment with different activities and find what works best for you.\n\nYou got this! You're taking control of your fitness journey, and I'm rooting for you all the way!",
