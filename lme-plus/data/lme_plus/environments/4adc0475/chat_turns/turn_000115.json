  "content": "It's not recommended to ingest essential oils without the guidance of a qualified healthcare practitioner, as some essential oils can be toxic or cause digestive distress if ingested in large amounts or improperly. \n\nIn general, most essential oils should not be consumed internally, as they can be harmful to the digestive system, liver, and other organs. Additionally, some essential oils may interact with medications or underlying health conditions, so it's important to consult with a healthcare provider if you are considering using essential oils for internal use.\n\nWhile some essential oils are considered safe to ingest in small amounts (such as peppermint or lemon), it's important to use caution and seek professional advice before using essential oils internally.\n\nIt's much safer to use essential oils for aromatherapy (by inhaling them through a diffuser) or topically (by diluting them in a carrier oil and applying to the skin) as directed.",
