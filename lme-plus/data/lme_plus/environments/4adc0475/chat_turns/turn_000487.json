Sharing your productivity tip on a YouTube video is a great way to help others and also reflect on your own habits.\n\nThe Pomodoro technique is a fantastic tool for staying focused, and it's wonderful that you're finding it helpful. By breaking down your work into shorter intervals with regular breaks, you can stay energized and motivated throughout the day.\n\nSince you mentioned social media and online platforms as distractions, I'd like to ask: Have you considered implementing any strategies to minimize your social media usage or limit your access to distracting websites?\n\nSome popular techniques include:\n\n1. Website blockers like Freedom, SelfControl, or Cold Turkey, which can block access to distracting websites during certain periods of the day.\n2. App blockers like Moment or Focus@Will, which can help you track and limit your app usage.\n3. Social media scheduling tools like Hootsuite or Buffer, which allow you to schedule your social media posts in advance and reduce the need for frequent checks.\n4. Browser extensions like uBlock Origin or News Feed Eradicator, which can remove distracting elements from your browser or social media feeds.\n\nThese tools can help you stay on track and reduce the time you spend on social media or other distracting platforms. Do any of these strategies appeal to you, or do you have other methods that work for you?",
