Recreational kayaks are great for beginners, as they're stable and easy to maneuver.

You can choose a paddle with an adjustable length to fit your height.\n3. **Personal Flotation Device (PFD):** A PFD, also known as a life jacket, is a must-have for kayaking. Make sure it's Coast Guard-approved and fits comfortably.\n4. **Clothing:** Dress in layers, as you'll get wet. Wear comfortable, quick-drying clothing, and consider a hat and sunglasses for sun protection.\n5. **Safety gear:** Bring a whistle, a first-aid kit, and a waterproof bag with snacks, water, and a phone.\n\n**Lessons and Guided Tours:**\n\n1. **Local outfitters:** Search online for kayak rental shops, outfitters, or guide services in your area.

Avoid whitewater or areas with strong currents unless you're experienced.\n2. **National parks or wildlife refuges:** Many national parks and wildlife refuges offer kayaking opportunities. Check their websites for regulations and guidelines.\n3. **State parks:** State parks often have kayaking facilities, rentals, and guided tours.\n\n**Tips for Beginners:**\n\n1. **Start on calm waters:** Begin with calm waters to get comfortable with the kayak and paddling techniques.\n2. **Take a lesson:** Invest in a lesson or guided tour to learn proper techniques, safety procedures, and how to handle the kayak.\n3. **Practice:** The more you kayak, the more comfortable you'll become.
