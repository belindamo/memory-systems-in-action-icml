Here's a brief review and comparison with other popular brands:\n\n**Sony WH-1000XM4 Review:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Unbeatable noise-cancellation**: Sony's advanced noise-cancellation technology, including adaptive sound control and atmospheric pressure optimization, makes it one of the best in the market.\n2. **Excellent sound quality**: Clear, balanced, and detailed sound with deep bass response.\n3. **Long battery life**: Up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, with quick charging offering 5 hours of playback with just 10 minutes of charging.\n4. **Comfortable design**: Ergonomic design with soft ear cushions and adjustable headband for a comfortable fit.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Expensive**: The WH-1000XM4 is a premium product with a price tag to match (around $350).\n2. **No major upgrades from the previous model**: If you already own the WH-1000XM3, the improvements might not be significant enough to warrant an upgrade.\n\n**Comparison with other brands:**\n\n1. **Bose QuietComfort 35 II**: Similar noise-cancellation performance, but with a more comfortable fit and slightly better sound quality. However, the Bose QC35 II has a shorter battery life (20 hours).\n2. **Sennheiser PXC 559**: Offers similar sound quality and noise-cancellation, but with a more compact design and longer battery life (30 hours). However, it's not as comfortable as the Sony WH-1000XM4.\n3. **Beats Solo Pro**: A more stylish option with a sleek design and impressive noise-cancellation. However, sound quality is not as good as the Sony WH-1000XM4, and battery life is shorter (22 hours).\n\n**Other considerations:**\n\n1. **Noise-cancellation mode**: If you prioritize noise-cancellation, the Sony WH-1000XM4 is the clear winner. If you prefer a more balanced sound, the Bose QC35 II might be a better fit.\n2. **Sound signature**: If you prefer a bass-heavy sound, the Beats Solo Pro might be the way to go. If you prefer a more neutral sound, the Sony WH-1000XM4 is a better choice.\n3. **Budget**: If you're on a tighter budget, the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 (around $100) offers impressive noise-cancellation and sound quality at a lower price point.\n\nAs for your Samsung smartwatch, that's a great deal! Which model did you get, and how do you like it so far?\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision on your wireless headphone purchase!",
