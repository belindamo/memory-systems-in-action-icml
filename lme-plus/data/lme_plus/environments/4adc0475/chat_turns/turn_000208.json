  "content": "Ganesha, also known as Ganapati, is one of the most popular deities in Hinduism. He is easily recognisable by his elephant head and human body. The story of Ganesha's birth is one of the most famous stories in Hindu mythology. According to the legend, the goddess Parvati created Ganesha from the dirt on her body while she was taking a bath. She asked him to guard the door while she finished bathing. Meanwhile, Lord Shiva, Parvati's husband, returned home and tried to enter the room, but Ganesha stopped him, as he had been instructed to not allow anyone in. A fight between the two ensued, and in a fit of rage, Shiva cut off Ganesha's head. Upon realizing what had happened, Parvati became extremely upset and declared that she would destroy the universe if her son was not brought back to life. To appease her, Shiva ordered his attendants to go and find the head of any creature that was sleeping with its head facing north. They found the head of an elephant and attached it to Ganesha's body, bringing him back to life. From that day forward, Ganesha has been revered as a god of wisdom, knowledge, and the remover of obstacles. He is often invoked at the beginning of new endeavors or important events, and his birthday is celebrated with great enthusiasm in Hindu communities around the world during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.",
