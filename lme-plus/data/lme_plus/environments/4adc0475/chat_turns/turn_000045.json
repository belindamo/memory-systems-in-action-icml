  "content": "6.1 General description:\nThe hazard prediction module is a software tool designed to assist a CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) operator in integrating and analysing various sources of CBRN information to inform the prediction of potential hazards and contamination. The module will generate a comprehensive CBRN picture, including the predicted movement of CBRN clouds over time, and make this information continuously available to the CBRN operator and other parts of the data fusion cell.\n\n6.2 Design:\nThe hazard prediction module will be designed with an intuitive and user-friendly interface to enable the CBRN operator to easily access and analyze the various sources of CBRN information. The module will incorporate data filtering and fusion techniques to combine and integrate the different sources of CBRN data, as well as algorithms and models to predict the movement of CBRN clouds based on meteorological data and other relevant factors.\n\n6.3 Technical description:\nThe hazard prediction module will be implemented as a software tool using specialized algorithms and techniques for data integration and analysis. It will have the ability to collect CBRN data from various sources, including sensors and monitoring systems, and process this data in real-time to continuously update and refine the CBRN picture. The module will also have the capability to alert the CBRN operator of any potential hazards or changes in the CBRN situation.\n\n6.4 Responsibilities:\nThe hazard prediction module will be responsible for assisting the CBRN operator in integrating and analysing all relevant CBRN information, predicting the movement of CBRN clouds, and generating a comprehensive CBRN picture. It will also be responsible for making this information continuously available to the CBRN operator and other parts of the data fusion cell. The team responsible for designing and implementing the hazard prediction module will have expertise in CBRN data analysis, software development, and will ensure that the module is user-friendly and easy for the CBRN operator to use.",
