Getting feedback from others can be super helpful in refining your skills.\n\nTaking good progress photos of your paintings is essential to track your progress, get feedback, and even build a portfolio. Here are some tips to help you take great progress photos:\n\n1. **Natural light**: Shoot near a window with soft, indirect natural light. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can create harsh shadows and unflattering colors.\n2. **Use a tripod**: A tripod will help you take steady, blur-free photos, especially if you're using a slower shutter speed or a macro lens.\n3. **Invest in a photo tent or box**: A photo tent or box can help diffuse the light, reduce shadows, and create a neutral background. You can also use a piece of white cardboard or a photography backdrop.\n4. **Shoot in RAW**: If your camera allows it, shoot in RAW format, which gives you more flexibility when editing the photos. JPEG format can also work well, but you'll have less room for editing.\n5. **Use a macro lens or close-up setting**: Get up close and personal with your painting to capture the textures, brushstrokes, and details.\n6. **Shoot from different angles**: Capture your painting from various angles, such as straight-on, slightly above, or from the side. This will give you a more comprehensive view of your work.\n7. **Show the painting in progress**: Take photos of your painting at different stages, including the initial sketch, underpainting, and intermediate stages. This will help you track your progress and identify areas for improvement.\n8. **Pay attention to color accuracy**: Try to capture the colors of your painting as accurately as possible. You can use a color calibration tool or adjust the white balance on your camera to achieve this.\n9. **Edit your photos**: Use photo editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to adjust the brightness, contrast, and saturation of your photos. Be careful not to over-edit, as this can affect the accuracy of the colors.\n10. **Document your process**: Take photos of your painting process, including your palette, brushes, and any reference materials. This can be helpful for sharing your process with others or creating a tutorial.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to take high-quality progress photos that showcase your artwork in the best possible light.\n\nRemember to share your progress with your mom and others who support your artistic journey. It's always exciting to see how a piece evolves over time!",
