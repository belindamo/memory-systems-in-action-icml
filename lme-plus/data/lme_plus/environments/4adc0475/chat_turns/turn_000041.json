  "content": "6.1 General description:\nThe hazard prediction module in the data fusion cell is designed to integrate and analyse various sources of CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) information using CBRN-Analysis software to inform the prediction of potential hazards and contamination. The module will generate a comprehensive CBRN picture, including the predicted movement of CBRN clouds over time, and make this information continuously available to other parts of the data fusion cell.\n\n6.2 Design:\nThe hazard prediction module will be designed with internal interfaces that ensure the full fidelity of all related CBRN information. This will involve implementing data filtering and fusion techniques using CBRN-Analysis to combine and integrate the various sources of CBRN information. The module will also incorporate algorithms and models to predict the movement of CBRN clouds based on meteorological data and other relevant factors.\n\n6.3 Technical description:\nThe hazard prediction module will be implemented using CBRN-Analysis software and hardware technologies. It will utilise CBRN-Analysis software tools and algorithms for data integration and analysis, as well as hardware components such as sensors and monitoring systems to collect CBRN data. The module will be designed to operate in real-time, with the ability to continuously update and refine the CBRN picture as new information becomes available.\n\n6.4 Responsibilities:\nThe hazard prediction module will be responsible for integrating and analysing all relevant CBRN information using CBRN-Analysis software, predicting the movement of CBRN clouds, and generating a comprehensive CBRN picture. It will also be responsible for making this information continuously available to other parts of the data fusion cell. The team responsible for designing and implementing the hazard prediction module will have expertise in CBRN data analysis, software development using CBRN-Analysis, and hardware engineering.",
