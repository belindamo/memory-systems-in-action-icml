You mentioned earlier that you have a red bodycon dress, but now you're talking about a white blouse from Zara?\n\nIf you're planning to wear the black ankle boots with the white blouse, it could work well depending on the style of the blouse and the overall aesthetic you're going for. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n**White blouse styles that might work well with black ankle boots:**\n\n1. **Crisp and clean**: A classic, crisp white blouse with a structured fit and a pointed collar can create a chic, professional look when paired with black ankle boots.\n2. **Lace or crochet**: A white blouse with lace or crochet details can add a touch of femininity and romance to your outfit, which can be balanced out by the edginess of black ankle boots.\n3. **Ruffled or bell-sleeved**: A white blouse with ruffles or bell sleeves can add a playful touch to your outfit, and the black ankle boots can ground the look.\n\n**Tips to make it work:**\n\n1. **Add a skirt or jeans**: Pair the white blouse with a flowy skirt or distressed jeans to create a more casual, laid-back look.\n2. **Add a jacket or cardigan**: Throw on a denim jacket, leather jacket, or a cozy cardigan to add texture and depth to your outfit.\n3. **Accessories matter**: Keep jewelry simple and understated, or add a statement piece to draw attention to your face or neck.\n\nHowever, if you're still planning to wear the red bodycon dress, I'd recommend sticking with the original advice. Black ankle boots would be a great choice to pair with the dress, as they'll create a chic, sophisticated look.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
