  "content": "I think it's a combination of the nostalgic value and the catchy melodies. I grew up listening to this music, and it brings back fond memories of my childhood. But at the same time, the synth-heavy sound and the energy of the songs are still really appealing to me today. I love how the genre blends catchy hooks with a darker, more introspective tone.",
