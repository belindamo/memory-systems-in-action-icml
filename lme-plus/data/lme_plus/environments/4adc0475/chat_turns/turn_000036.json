  "content": "Complete following text for a design document:\nThis section describes the design of the hazard prediction module in the data fusion cell. This design aims to align the internal interfaces in the data fusion cell to ensure full fidelity of all related CBRN information to inform the CBRN hazard prediction. Besides, the design has to ensure that the generated CBRN picture is continuously available to the other parts of the data fusion cell to describe the most accurate information on hazards and contamination including the predicted CBRN cloud movement over time.\n6.1 General description\nTO COMPLETE\n6.2 Design\nTO COMPLETE\n6.3 Technical description\nTO COMPLETE\n6.4 Responsibilities\nTO COMPLETE",
