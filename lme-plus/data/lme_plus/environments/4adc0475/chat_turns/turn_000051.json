Enzymatic Dental Chews\n2. **Rawhide chews**: Rawhide chews can help remove plaque and tartar, but make sure to choose ones that are:\n\t* Made from natural, unbleached, and unflavored rawhide\n\t* Not too small, as they can be a choking hazard\n\t* Monitored to avoid overconsumption, which can lead to digestive issues\n3. **Antimicrobial chews**: Chews containing antimicrobial agents, such as chlorhexidine, can help reduce bacteria and freshen breath.\n\n**Dental Toys:**\n\n1. **Nylabone DuraChew**: A popular, durable chew toy that helps remove plaque and tartar.\n2. **Kong Dental Toys**: Kong's dental toys are designed to stimulate your dog's natural instinct to chew, helping to remove plaque and tartar.\n3. **Tuffy's Dental Toys**: Tuffy's toys are made with a unique material that helps remove plaque and tartar while providing a fun chewing experience.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Rotate dental chews and toys**: Switch between different chews and toys to keep Max interested and engaged.\n2. **Supervise**: Always supervise your dog when introducing new chews or toys to ensure they're safe and suitable.\n3. **Use in conjunction with brushing**: Dental chews and toys are meant to supplement, not replace, regular brushing.\n4. **Consult your vet**: Before introducing new dental products, consult with your veterinarian to ensure they're suitable for Max's specific oral health needs.\n\nRemember, every dog is different, so it's essential to monitor Max's response to new dental chews and toys.
