It's great that you have a shared interest in art and museums with your sister, and it's even more special that you get to spend quality time together while exploring these exhibitions. The \"Impressionist Masters\" exhibition must have been a treat, and I'm sure you'll both enjoy the \"Contemporary Photography\" exhibit just as much.\n\nIt's lovely that you're planning to share this experience with your sister, and I'm sure the photography exhibit will provide plenty of conversation topics and opportunities to bond over your shared interests. You might even discover some new favorite artists or styles together!\n\nAre you planning on making a day of it and grabbing lunch or coffee together after the museum visit, or do you have other plans in the works?",
