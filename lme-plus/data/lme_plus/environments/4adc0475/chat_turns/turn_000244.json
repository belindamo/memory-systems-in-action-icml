I'm glad to hear you're enjoying it!\n\nAs for the next big sale event, there are a few upcoming opportunities to keep an eye on:\n\n1. **Prime Day** (usually in mid-July): Amazon's annual Prime Day sale often features discounts on electronics, including headphones. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you might be able to snag a deal on the WH-1000XM4.\n2. **Back to School Season** (July-September): Many retailers offer discounts on electronics during the back-to-school season. Keep an eye on prices during this period, as you might find deals on headphones.\n3. **Labor Day Sales** (early September): Labor Day sales often feature discounts on electronics, including headphones. This could be a good opportunity to find a deal on the WH-1000XM4.\n4. **Black Friday and Cyber Monday** (late November): These are the biggest shopping events of the year, with many retailers offering significant discounts on electronics. If you can wait, this might be the best time to find a deal on the WH-1000XM4.\n5. **Green Monday** (second Monday in December): Green Monday is often considered the best day to buy electronics, as it's typically the best sales day in December. Keep an eye on prices during this period for potential deals.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general sale events, and prices may vary depending on the retailer and availability. I recommend setting up price alerts or tracking the prices of the WH-1000XM4 at your preferred retailers to get notified when the price drops.\n\nIn the meantime, you can also consider purchasing a previous model, like the WH-1000XM3, which might be available at a discounted price. While it's not the latest model, it's still a great pair of headphones with excellent noise-cancellation and sound quality.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
