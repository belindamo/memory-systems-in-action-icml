      "content": "An idiom for the silent treatment is \"give someone the cold shoulder.\" It means to deliberately ignore or show indifference to someone, often as a form of punishment or to express disapproval. The phrase \"cold shoulder\" may have originated from the idea that serving someone a cold shoulder of meat was a way of expressing disapproval or indicating that they were not welcome at the dinner table."
