One thing that comes to mind is that I spent a decent amount on some collectible vinyl records on eBay around the same time in March. I think it was around $200, and it included a rare pressing of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Do you think that's something we should prioritize tracking?"

Can you remember what you bought from Everlane? Was it a specific item, like a shirt or a pair of pants, or was it a few items in general?\n\nAlso, do you recall the original price of the item(s) before the 20% discount? If you have the receipt or order confirmation, you can check the subtotal and the discount amount to get the original price.\n\nOnce we have those details, we can calculate the total amount you spent and add it to our list.\n\n**March - Everlane - ? - ?**\n\n* Item: ?\n* Original Price: ?\n* Discount: 20% off\n* Total Spent: ?\n\nAny details you can provide will help us get a clearer picture of your spending habits."
