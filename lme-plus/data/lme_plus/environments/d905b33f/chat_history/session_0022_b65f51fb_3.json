      "content": "Congratulations on taking the step to update your surname!\n\nTypically, banks require documentation to verify your identity and confirm the name change. Since you've recently submitted your application to change your surname with the Social Security Administration (SSA), you'll need to wait for your new Social Security card to arrive before updating your bank account information. Once you receive your new Social Security card, you can provide the following documents to your bank:\n\n1. **New Social Security card**: This is the primary document that proves your name change. Make sure it arrives and you have it in hand before approaching your bank.\n2. **Government-issued ID**: You'll need to provide a government-issued ID, such as a driver's license or state ID, that reflects your new name. If your ID still shows your previous name, you may need to update it first.\n3. **Name change documentation**: Bring a certified copy of your marriage certificate, divorce decree, or court order that shows your name change. This document should be official and include your previous and new names.\n4. **Proof of identity**: Your bank may request additional identification, such as a passport or birth certificate, to verify your identity.\n\nOnce you have these documents, you can visit your bank's branch or contact their customer service to update your account information. Be prepared to fill out a name change form and provide the required documents.\n\nKeep in mind that banks may have slightly different requirements, so it's a good idea to call your bank ahead of time to confirm their specific needs. Additionally, you may need to update your account information with other financial institutions, creditors, or services that use your old name.\n\nRemember to also update your name with other relevant institutions, such as:\n\n* Credit card companies\n* Loan providers\n* Investment accounts\n* Utility services (e.g., electricity, water, internet)\n* Subscription services (e.g., streaming, gym memberships)\n* Employer and HR department (if applicable)\n\nStay organized, and don't hesitate to ask your bank or other institutions if you have any questions or concerns about the process."
