Additionally, it replaces the invalid tickers with valid ones from different exchanges, such as CBOE for DJIA, NYSEARCA for SPY, BINANCE for XRPBUSD and RUBBUSD, and different contract symbols for futures commodities. Note that the \"TOTAL2\" ticker on Kraken represents the same metric as \"TOTAL\" on Binance."

Note that the \"TOTAL\" and \"TOTAL2\" tickers represent the total volume traded on a specific exchange, and are not available on TradingView. Additionally, the ticker symbols for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index are not available on TradingView, so I replaced them with futures contracts that track these indices. Finally, I replaced the \"RUBBUSD\" ticker with \"USDRUB\", which represents the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Russian ruble."
