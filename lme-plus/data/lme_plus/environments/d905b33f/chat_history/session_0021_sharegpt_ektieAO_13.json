      "content": "Sure, here's an elaboration for each task in Section 6:\n\n6. Auditing Tasks:\n7. Network Scanning: Network scanning involves the use of software tools to identify all devices connected to a network and detect any potential vulnerabilities or security risks. The audit should include a review of the network topology and configuration, as well as an assessment of the security controls in place.\n8. Vulnerability Scanning: Vulnerability scanning involves using software tools to identify any weaknesses in the system or network that could be exploited by an attacker. The audit should identify all potential vulnerabilities, prioritize them based on severity, and provide recommendations for remediation.\n9. Log Review: Log review involves reviewing the logs generated by the system or network to identify any potential security breaches or unauthorized access attempts. The audit should verify that the logs are being generated and stored properly and that they contain sufficient information to support a forensic investigation if necessary.\n10. Authentication: Authentication involves verifying the identity of a user or device before granting access to the system or network. The audit should review the authentication mechanisms in place, including password policies, multi-factor authentication, and biometric authentication. The audit should verify that the authentication mechanisms are working correctly and are aligned with best practices.\n11. Access Control: Access control involves managing and restricting access to the system or network based on the user's role, responsibilities, and level of authorization. The audit should verify that the access control mechanisms are in place and functioning correctly, and that access is granted based on the principle of least privilege.\n12. Backup Storage: Backup storage involves the process of backing up critical data and storing it in a secure location to ensure that it can be recovered in case of a disaster or system failure. The audit should verify that backups are being performed regularly, that the backup data is stored securely, and that recovery procedures have been tested and are functioning correctly.\n\nEach of these auditing tasks is critical to identifying potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system or network, and the audit should provide detailed recommendations for remediation where necessary. The audit report should provide a detailed overview of the findings for each of these tasks and prioritize any identified issues based on their severity and potential impact."
