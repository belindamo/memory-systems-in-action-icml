      "content": "Happy birthday to your niece! I'd be delighted to help you with some gift ideas.\n\nSince you mentioned a doll or a craft set, I assume your niece enjoys playing with toys and being creative. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Doll and accessories**: If you decide to go with a doll, consider getting a few outfits, shoes, and accessories to go along with it. You could also opt for a doll that comes with its own playset or Carrier.\n2. **Art supplies**: A craft set is a great idea! You could also consider individual art supplies like paints, markers, colored pencils, or a sketchbook. If your niece enjoys drawing or painting, a set of washable art supplies would be a great gift.\n3. **Building and construction toys**: Blocks, LEGO, or Magna-Tiles are always a hit with kids. These toys encourage creativity, problem-solving, and fine motor skills.\n4. **Imaginative play**: A play kitchen, play food, or a doctor's kit can foster imaginative play and role-playing.\n5. **Books**: A beautifully illustrated children's book or a popular series can spark a love for reading.\n6. **Puzzles and games**: A puzzle, a board game, or a card game like Uno can provide hours of entertainment and help develop critical thinking skills.\n7. **Outdoor toys**: If your niece enjoys playing outside, consider a new bike, a ball, or a bubbles set.\n8. **Subscription box**: A subscription to a kids' craft or activity box, like Kiwi Crate or Crayola Box, can provide a new creative project every month.\n9. **Science or nature kit**: A simple science kit or a nature exploration kit can encourage curiosity and exploration.\n10. **Experience gift**: Consider gifting your niece an experience, like tickets to a children's show, a movie, or a fun activity like rock climbing or a pottery class.\n\nRemember to choose a gift that aligns with your niece's interests and abilities.\n\nBy the way, the funny mug you got for your coworker sounds like a great gift!"
