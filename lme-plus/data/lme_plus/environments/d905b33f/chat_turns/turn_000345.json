  "content": "The Trek FX 3 is a great bike!\n\nA roof-mounted rack can be a good option for you, but it depends on your Honda Civic's roof shape and size. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Roof type**: If your Civic has a sunroof or a panoramic roof, a roof-mounted rack might not be the best option. These types of roofs can be more prone to damage from rack installation or may have limited mounting options.\n* **Roof size**: The Trek FX 3 is a hybrid bike, so it's likely to be around 42-45 inches (107-114 cm) long. If your Civic has a smaller roof, you might need a shorter rack or a rack with a more compact design.\n* **Crossbar spacing**: Make sure the roof rack's crossbar spacing is compatible with your bike's wheelbase. Most roof racks have adjustable crossbars, but it's essential to check the minimum and maximum spacing to ensure a secure fit.\n\nIf you're still interested in a roof-mounted rack, here are a few options to consider:\n\n* **Thule Evo**: Thule's Evo series is a popular choice for roof-mounted racks. They offer a range of models with different crossbar lengths and spacings.\n* **Yakima FullBack**: Yakima's FullBack is a great option for smaller roofs. It's a compact rack with a shorter crossbar length, making it ideal for smaller cars like the Civic.\n* **Rhino-Rack Vortex**: Rhino-Rack's Vortex series is known for its durability and easy installation. They offer a range of models with different crossbar lengths and spacings.\n\nBefore making a purchase, I recommend checking the manufacturer's website or visiting a local bike shop to ensure the rack is compatible with your Honda Civic's roof and your Trek FX 3.\n\nRemember to also consider the weight capacity of the rack, as well as any additional features you might need, such as locks or bike lights.",
