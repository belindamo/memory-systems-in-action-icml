Asking the jeweler for recommendations can be very helpful, and they might have some wonderful suggestions for you.\n\nWhen it comes to the message, it's really up to you and what you feel comfortable with. However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Short and sweet: A brief message can be very effective and to the point. It might be a simple \"I love you, Mom\" or \"Happy Anniversary, Mom and Dad.\" This type of message is great for a more subtle and understated approach.\n* A bit longer and more heartfelt: If you want to express your feelings in a more elaborate way, you could write a short paragraph or a few sentences that convey your love and appreciation. For example: \"To the most amazing mom in the world, thank you for being my rock, my confidante, and my guiding light. I love you more than words can say.\" This type of message is perfect for a more emotional and sentimental gift.\n\nSome things to consider when writing your message:\n\n* Keep it sincere and authentic. Your mom will appreciate the thought and love behind your words.\n* Consider your mom's personality and sense of humor. If she loves puns, for example, you could incorporate a playful message.\n* Think about the occasion. For an anniversary, you might want to focus on the love and commitment between your parents. For a birthday, you could highlight your mom's strengths and accomplishments.\n* Don't worry too much about grammar or spelling. The jeweler will likely help you refine the message, and the imperfections will add a personal touch.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to speak from your heart and express your feelings in a way that feels true to you and your mom.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have any ideas for your message already, or do you want to brainstorm some more?",
