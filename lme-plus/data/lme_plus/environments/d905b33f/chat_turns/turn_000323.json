However, I can provide some general advice.\n\nIf you're considering getting a new toy for Luna, that's great! Cats can get bored with the same old toys, and introducing new ones can help keep them engaged and stimulated.\n\nWhen choosing a new toy, consider Luna's preferences and personality. Does she like interactive toys, feather wands, or puzzle toys? Does she have a favorite texture or color?\n\nYou might also want to consider rotating toys every few days to keep things fresh and exciting for Luna. This can help prevent boredom and keep her engaged.\n\nRemember to always supervise your cat when introducing new toys to ensure her safety.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further advice, feel free to ask!",
