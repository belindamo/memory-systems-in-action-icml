  "content": "Yes, here are a few recent collaborations the Vi\u0161njan Observatory has had:\n\n1. In 2020, the Vi\u0161njan Observatory collaborated with the European Space Agency and the University of Helsinki on the Euclid space mission. The mission aims to study dark energy and dark matter, which are the two biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\n2. In 2019, the observatory collaborated with the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, on the \"Precision Asteroseismology\" project. The project aims to use asteroseismology, which is the study of star oscillations, to better understand the properties of stars and their evolution.\n\n3. The observatory has also been involved in the world's largest survey of galaxies, the Dark Energy Survey, since 2013. In this project, the observatory collaborates with several other astronomy institutions to map the distribution of dark energy and dark matter in the universe.\n\nThese recent collaborations demonstrate that the Vi\u0161njan Observatory continues to contribute to cutting-edge research in astronomy and astrophysics, both locally and internationally.",
