  "content": "That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you're observing positive interactions between your fish, and it's not uncommon for Rasboras and Neon Tetras to get along well. The Rasboras' increased activity and playfulness are likely due to the stimulation and companionship provided by the Neon Tetras.\n\nIt's also normal for the Neon Tetras to be skittish and dart around the tank, especially when you approach. They're naturally nervous and flighty fish, and it may take some time for them to get used to their new surroundings and feel comfortable. As they settle in, they'll likely become less skittish and more confident in their environment.\n\nThe fact that you're seeing them swimming together in small schools is a great sign, as it indicates that they're starting to feel more at ease and are beginning to establish a social hierarchy. Just remember to provide plenty of hiding places and visual barriers, such as plants and decorations, to help them feel secure and reduce stress.\n\nIt's great that you're taking the time to observe and appreciate the behaviors and interactions of your fish. This will help you better understand their needs and preferences, and make adjustments to their environment accordingly. Keep up the good work, and I'm sure you'll continue to enjoy watching your fish thrive and interact with each other!\n\nBy the way, have you considered adding any other decorations or features to the tank to provide more visual interest and stimulation for your fish? For example, you could add some driftwood, rocks, or artificial decorations to create more hiding places and visual barriers.",
