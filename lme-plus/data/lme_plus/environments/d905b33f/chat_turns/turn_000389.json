Soaking the plants in a separate container is an excellent way to prevent introducing unwanted snails or parasites into your main tank.\n\nCreating a DIY background using foam and rocks is a fantastic idea! Not only will it provide hiding places for your fish, but it'll also add visual interest and create a more natural environment. Just make sure to secure the materials properly to prevent any loose debris or sharp edges that might harm your fish.\n\nRegarding your maintenance schedule, it's a good start! Here are some suggestions to consider:\n\n* **Water changes:** 10% every week is a good starting point, but you might want to consider increasing the frequency or amount of water changes depending on your tank's bioload and water parameters. For example, if you have a heavily stocked tank or notice any water quality issues, you might want to do 15-20% water changes every week.\n* **Filter cleaning:** Cleaning the filter every two weeks is a good frequency, but you should also consider monitoring the filter's performance and cleaning it more frequently if you notice any drop in water flow or quality. It's also essential to replace the filter media according to the manufacturer's instructions to ensure optimal performance.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider the following maintenance tasks:\n\n* **Monitor water parameters:** Regularly test your tank's water parameters, such as ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, and temperature, to ensure they're within a safe range for your fish.\n* **Clean the glass:** Regularly clean the tank's glass walls to prevent algae buildup and maintain clear visibility.\n* **Vacuum the substrate:** Use a gravel vacuum to remove debris and waste from the substrate, which will help prevent water quality issues and maintain a healthy environment.\n* **Inspect equipment:** Regularly inspect your tank's equipment, such as the heater, filter, and pumps, to ensure they're functioning properly and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nRemember, regular maintenance is crucial to maintaining a healthy and thriving aquarium. By staying on top of these tasks, you'll be able to create a happy and healthy environment for your fish to thrive in.",
