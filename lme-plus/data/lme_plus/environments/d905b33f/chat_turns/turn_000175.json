You can set up columns for the person's name, occasion, gift idea, purchase status, cost, and any notes or reminders.\n\nHere's an example of how you could set up your spreadsheet:\n\n| Person | Occasion | Gift Idea | Purchase Status | Cost | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Coworker | Birthday (25th) | Funny Mug | Purchased | $15 | Bought at the mall |\n| Niece | Birthday |  |  |  |  |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nYou can add more columns or rows as needed, and sort the list by occasion, person, or purchase status. This will help you keep track of your gifts and ensure that you don't forget anyone.\n\nRemember to update your spreadsheet regularly as you purchase more gifts, and you can also use it to keep track of gifts you've already given or received.\n\nIf you're not familiar with spreadsheets, you can start with a simple template and customize it to your needs. Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel both offer free templates and tutorials to help you get started.\n\nLet me know if you need any help setting up your spreadsheet or if you have any other questions!",
