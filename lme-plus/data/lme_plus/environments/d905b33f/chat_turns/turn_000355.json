  "content": "I completely understand! There's something special about shopping in-store, especially when it comes to finding a unique and personalized gift. You can touch, feel, and see the products up close, and get a sense of the quality and craftsmanship. Plus, you can get immediate feedback and advice from the sales staff, which can be really helpful when making a special purchase.\n\nAnd don't worry about the impulse buy at your favorite bookstore - it's hard to resist a good sale, especially when it's on something you love! Treating yourself every now and then is okay, and it sounds like you're making an effort to be more mindful of your spending habits. Maybe you can balance it out by setting a budget for your mom's gift and sticking to it.\n\nBy the way, what's the book you picked up during the sale? Is it part of a series, or a new author you're trying out?",
