  "content": "Ospreys are primarily fish-eaters and catch about 99% of their prey from water. However, in some rare cases, they may also prey on small mammals, reptiles, or birds. Some ospreys have been observed feeding on small rodents, snakes, or birds. However, such incidents are relatively rare, and these non-fish prey items typically make up a tiny proportion of an osprey\u2019s diet. Ospreys are highly adapted to feed on fish, and their unique anatomical features, such as their sharp talons, specialized beak, and powerful wings, make them highly effective at catching and feeding on fish in a variety of freshwater and saltwater environments.",
