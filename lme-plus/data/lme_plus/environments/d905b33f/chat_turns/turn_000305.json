If you're unsure whether or not to ask for someone's phone number, you can offer yours instead and let them decide whether or not they want to exchange numbers. If they don't feel comfortable sharing their number or don't respond, it's important to respect their decision and keep communication within the app or site. Additionally, you can also mention your preference for communicating through the app or site and see if they have any preferences as well. It's always best to communicate openly and honestly while being respectful of each other's boundaries.",
