  "content": "I have noticed some interesting behaviors between my fish. Now that I've added the Neon Tetras, I've seen my Rasboras being more active and playful. They seem to be enjoying the company of the Tetras, and I've even seen them swimming together in small schools. It's really cute to watch! The Neon Tetras, on the other hand, are very skittish and dart around the tank quickly, especially when I approach the tank. I'm sure they'll settle down once they get more comfortable with their new environment.",
