While it's okay to treat yourself occasionally, frequenting Saks and Neiman Marcus regularly might not be the best idea, especially if you're trying to get a handle on your finances.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Expensive habits**: Shopping at high-end stores can be a costly habit, especially if you're buying luxury items regularly. Those $800 handbags and designer clothing can add up quickly!\n2. **Impulse purchases**: Upscale stores are designed to make you feel luxurious and tempted to splurge. It's easy to get caught up in the moment and make impulse purchases, which can blow your budget.\n3. **Comparison game**: Shopping at high-end stores can lead to comparison and the feeling that you need to keep up with the latest trends and luxury brands. This can create an unhealthy mindset and lead to overspending.\n\nThat being said, if you enjoy shopping at these stores and can afford it, it's not necessarily a bad thing. However, it's essential to be mindful of your spending habits and make sure you're not overspending or going into debt to maintain a certain lifestyle.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Set a budget**: Decide how much you're willing to spend on luxury items each month and stick to it.\n2. **Make a shopping list**: Before you head to the store, make a list of what you need or want to buy. Stick to your list to avoid impulse purchases.\n3. **Consider alternatives**: Look for more affordable options or alternatives to high-end brands. You might find similar quality at a lower price point.\n4. **Practice delayed gratification**: When you see something you want, wait 24 hours before buying it. This can help you determine if the purchase is truly necessary or just an impulsive want.\n\nRemember, it's all about being mindful of your spending habits and making intentional choices. If you can afford to shop at high-end stores and it brings you joy, that's okay! Just be sure to keep your spending in check and prioritize your financial goals.\n\nHow do you feel about setting some boundaries around your shopping habits?",
