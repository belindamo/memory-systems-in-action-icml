The project has significantly reduced the risk of flooding along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, particularly in the lower Mississippi River Valley.\n\nThe levees, floodways, and other infrastructure built under the project have made it possible to contain and channel floodwaters, thereby protecting lives and property from devastating floods. The MR&T project played a critical role in protecting the region during the historic flood of 2011, which was one of the largest and most prolonged floods on record along the Mississippi River.\n\nIn addition to its flood control benefits, the MR&T project also supports navigation and economic development along the river. The project has helped maintain a reliable and efficient transportation system that supports commerce and industry throughout the region.\n\nOverall, while the MR&T project has been expensive, it has proven to be an effective investment in reducing the risk of flooding and supporting economic growth in the Mississippi River Basin.",
