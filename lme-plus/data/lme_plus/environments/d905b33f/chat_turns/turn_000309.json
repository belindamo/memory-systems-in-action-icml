  "content": "Title: Modernizing Government Software Integrations: A Case Study of Olmsted County\n\nOverview:\nOlmsted County, a consolidated agency with the city of Rochester, Minnesota, faced multiple challenges with its outdated software systems. These included double-inputting information into various systems, confusing citizens during city planning processes, and an inability to offer online payments. To address these challenges, Olmsted County sought to streamline its computer and software systems by integrating Laserfiche and Accela and optimizing the county\u2019s systems for Accela.\n\nObjectives:\nThe chief objectives for Olmsted County were to provide a single system for inputting data, integrate various software systems, reduce paper and data processing substeps, enable citizens to submit applications online, and offer online payment options.\n\nSolution:\nTo achieve these objectives, our team integrated the Laserfiche connector and Accela connector with the county\u2019s systems, allowing for seamless data transfer and increased automation, employee productivity, and efficiency. The implementation of these integrations resulted in a 90% reduction in the time employees spent on file management, eliminating the need for double-inputting data into different systems and resolving 12 of 24 sub-steps for paper and data processing.\n\nEffects:\nWith the new integrations in place, citizens in Olmsted County are now able to submit applications for plumbing and mechanical work, new wells, new septic systems, and online inspections. Additionally, citizens can now make payments online with credit cards and Echeck, resulting in a 46% increase in online payments during the previous four months. These improvements have not only increased citizen satisfaction but have also allowed government workers to focus on more pressing tasks, saving valuable time and resources.\n\nConclusion:\nThe case of Olmsted County illustrates how local governments can better serve their community by deploying state-of-the-art payment and document processing systems. Our team\u2019s expertise in software integrations helped Olmsted County modernize its outdated systems and provide citizens with the convenience of online submissions and payments. We encourage local officials to understand the benefits of improving their computational infrastructure and to consider the implementation of modern software solutions.",
