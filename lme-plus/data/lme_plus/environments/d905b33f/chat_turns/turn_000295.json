  "content": "Ospreys are known for their ability to dive into the water at high speeds to catch fish. They can reach speeds of up to 80 km/h (50 mph) during a dive, and can plunge from up to 30 metres (100 feet) in the air into the water. When they spot a fish, they close their wings, extend their legs forward, and dive beak-first into the water, grasping the fish with their sharp talons. The osprey's powerful wings and aerodynamic body shape allow it to generate significant lift and maneuverability, making it one of the most agile and effective fish-hunting birds.",
