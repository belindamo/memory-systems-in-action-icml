  "content": "If you're looking for something more exhilarating, you may want to consider taking a day trip to nearby Otsu City. There, you can try your hand at flyboarding on Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan.\n\nFlyboarding is a water sport that involves a board connected to a watercraft through a long hose, which propels the board into the air using water pressure. It's a bit like a cross between wakeboarding and jetpacking, and it's becoming increasingly popular around the world.\n\nOn Lake Biwa, you can take a lesson with a professional instructor and learn how to flyboard over the crystal-clear waters. It's an exciting and unique experience that's sure to get your adrenaline pumping.\n\nKeep in mind that this does require a day trip from Kyoto, and there may be restrictions and fees associated with the activity, so be sure to plan ahead if you're interested.",
