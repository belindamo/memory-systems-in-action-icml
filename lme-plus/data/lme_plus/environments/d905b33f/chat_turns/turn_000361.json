That's a great starting point!\n\nGiven your previous experience, it's definitely worth checking out that store again for your mom's gift. They might have some new pieces or designs that would be perfect for a custom order. Plus, since you've already worked with them before, they might be more willing to work with you to create a custom piece that meets your vision.\n\nBefore you go, you might want to:\n\n* Call ahead to confirm they offer custom design services and can accommodate your request\n* Ask about their design process, including how they work with customers to create custom pieces\n* Inquire about their materials, pricing, and turnaround time\n* Bring some ideas or inspiration with you, such as pictures or descriptions of what you have in mind\n\nBy doing your due diligence, you'll get a better sense of whether they're the right fit for your mom's gift. And who knows, you might even find a beautiful piece that's already in their collection!\n\nWhat do you think? Are you going to check out that store again, or do you want to explore other options?",
