Checking the websites beforehand can save you time and ensure that they have the products you need.\n\nAs for sales and discounts, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to current sales or promotions at specific stores. However, I can suggest some ways to find out about any ongoing deals:\n\n1. **Check their websites**: Petco and PetSmart often have a \"Deals\" or \"Sales\" section on their websites, where they list current promotions and discounts.\n2. **Sign up for their newsletters**: Both Petco and PetSmart offer newsletters that often feature exclusive discounts, promotions, and sales.\n3. **Follow them on social media**: Keep an eye on their social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) for flash sales, promo codes, or special offers.\n4. **Use online coupons and deal sites**: Websites like RetailMeNot, Coupons.com, or Groupon often have pet-related deals and discounts.\n5. **Check for loyalty programs**: If you're a frequent customer, consider joining their loyalty programs, which may offer rewards, discounts, or exclusive deals.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of any sale or promotion to ensure it applies to the products you need.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find some great deals on Max's food and Luna's dental care supplies!",
