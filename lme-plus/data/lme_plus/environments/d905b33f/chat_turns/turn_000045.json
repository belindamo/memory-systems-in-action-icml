  "content": "I see what you mean. Yes, you used rule 11 repeatedly until you reached rule 10, which gave you the value of 1 # 3. This approach does resemble mathematical induction, where we start with some base case and repeatedly apply a rule to arrive at our desired result. In this case, we started with the input value of 1 # 3 and used rule 11 to simplify the expression, then repeated this process until we reached the base case of 1 # 0, which gave us the final value of 1 # 3. We can call this approach \"Ninduction\" to distinguish it from regular mathematical induction.",
