  "content": "I'm actually considering adding an antique mirror to my collection. I recently visited an antique shop with my friend Emily, and we stumbled upon an old, ornate mirror that looked identical to one my mother had in her bedroom when I was a child. I ended up buying it for $120, and the shop owner told me it was from the 1920s. I think it would be a great addition to my home office, and it would complement the desk and locket nicely. What do you think?",
