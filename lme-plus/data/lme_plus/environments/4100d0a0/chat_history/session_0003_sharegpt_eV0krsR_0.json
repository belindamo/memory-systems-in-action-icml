      "content": "This is a transcription of an interview. What is most important for N when it comes to board games? \n\nIntroduction\n\nN: My name is Nikki. I am working on a project right now to better understand how people think about purchasing board games and how they actually go about purchasing them. So I mean, user experience researcher at this company, and I wanted to understand your thoughts and your thought process on how you go about purchasing board games. So this session will only be about 30 minutes. And there are no right or wrong answers. So I want you to answer honestly. You\u2019re not going to hurt anybody\u2019s feelings with your feedback. Since we\u2019re going to use this, your feedback and opinions improve our product and purpose. Do you have any questions before we begin, though?\n\nC: That will make sense?\n\nN: Okay, cool. Do you mind if I record this session before we start this?\n\nC: Absolutely fine.\n\nDiving in\n\nN: Okay, cool. Awesome. So as I mentioned, I want to understand a little bit better how you think about purchasing board games. Um, so just to kick it off, could us think back to the last time you purchased a board game on your own, not a gift or anything, and kind of walk me through from when you first realized that you wanted or needed the board game all the way through actually purchasing it?\n\nC: Yeah, sure. Um, so I really like board games. I\u2019m not trying to say need as many as I have. But for me, it\u2019s been like a hobbit in German. And I like to have kind of a diverse board game. Depending on who we play with, there are a few things that so I think maybe contextualize it a little bit. The last board game was called charter stone. I saw actually I was in a board game store said we had brunch with a friend, and we were walking past a board game store on the way back. And I dropped in. It was actually the box that first attracted me to it. I thought it was a really well-designed box. And aside to read it, and it was a legacy type board game. To me, it\u2019s one of those that changes every time you play it. So what you do in one game will affect the next day. So normally, for I buy a board game, I actually also put alliances quite a popular website for games called BoardGameGeek, which is like the online home of board games. So on there, you\u2019ll have forums discussing them, reviews for each game. And reviews will take things like complexity into account, learn the number of players, and the mechanics because there are many different mechanics in board games. So if you think of it a bit like a video game, you can, you know, you can build a base, or you can do a first-person shooter or car racing game. Like board games, you have different mechanics, and people prefer different mechanics on what they\u2019re doing. So while I was in the store, I quickly looked it up. I saw it had a really good rating there. This one was made a little bit more of an impulse buy. And so I bought that one on the spot because there were the mechanics are involved. And it was a theme that I liked. The artwork was beautiful. And then at least initial reviews that I read on Board Game Geek really positive, so I bought it.\n\nN: Wonderful. Awesome. So that was a lot of information. And so what I might do is I might actually go back and talk to you a little bit about what you what you just talked about. But when you say that you bought it, can you just describe that portion a little more. You were in a store?\n\nC: I\u2019d looked at a couple of ones. I picked it up and did the kind of browsing things on my phone. And just to see what Board Game Geek was saying what some of the big reviewers were saying about it. And it was generally positive. And so I picked up I wandered around the store for a little bit longer. It was more a case of what else might I buy? I said, there\u2019s a board game store. There was nothing else typical that I really wanted that day or caught my eye. So I went and bought it was pretty straightforward.\n\nN: Well, awesome. Going back way to the beginning of when you mentioned that you dropped into the board game store and saw it was there anything that kind of triggered you dropping into that board game store in particular.\n\nC: It\u2019s my local board game store. So so it\u2019s the one that\u2019s nearest to where I live. I bought a few games there before they\u2019ve always really friendly, really nice, and there\u2019s a huge selection, which is good. And we finished brunch, and it was literally two streets away from where we were eating, so it\u2019s close by that as I might as well. And Saturday tends to be the day that I indulge in my hobbies. I have a couple of hobbies, so if I\u2019m near the local store for that hobby, I maybe go in and just kind of browse and see what\u2019s available. So that was it.\n\nN: Okay, so it was location-based like you were close to it. So it was easy to stop by. And so you mentioned that the board game like the actual box caught your eye. And you said that it was like well designed, can you talk a little bit more about what you mean by well designed.\n\nC: So this one\u2019s actually quite a fun example. Because there\u2019s almost nothing on the box, if you think about a box, you\u2019d get with Apple, where you have an iPhone on the front, and then no information. It was kind of like that. The box is very clean, very white and actually stood out against a lot of the board games in the store, which is why I noticed it the first time. I then went to the back. There\u2019s a brief summary of the mechanics, which I said were the kind of mechanics I liked. So kind of building strategy and building games, a nice preference of style, there are the little artworks, but there wasn\u2019t that one was very clean and very crisp, and that I was pretty impressed by that. So I like legacy games. I like village building games. And obviously, at that point, it wasn\u2019t enough for me to purchase it. I was really interested. And that\u2019s when I went to Board Game Geek. And I got some information.\n\nN: That\u2019s really interesting. And so you said that that box was different because of maybe the clean and the lack of information on the box? Could you give an example maybe of what the board games normally have on the box?\n\nC: Yeah, it depends on the box. You\u2019d normally get a lot of information on the side of them. So you\u2019ll normally have, it kind of depends. So on the front, you normally have obviously the title and some illustrations on the back or the side, you will tend to get kind of function information to how many players rough time how long it takes to play. And some of the mechanics that are involved with the dice base game is a card game is it, those kinds of things. So the mechanics I mentioned before. And then on the back, normally, you get a picture or an overlay of what\u2019s included in the box, if I think about my favorite game, The Game of Thrones board game, or Imperial settlers. If you look on the back of that box, it gives you an overview of what it might look like when you\u2019ve set. This box doesn\u2019t do that because it\u2019s more of a story mode. Because I said it\u2019s a legacy game. You don\u2019t know what cards are there. That\u2019s actually one of the things when you open the box is a big thing says do not read the cards because you\u2019re meant to play through the story mode. So your game evolves, depending on your decision. So you\u2019re not allowed to say no, and it looks like and also by printing on the back of the box. It\u2019s not representative because it\u2019s going to look different for every player based on their decisions. So that one, I think, is very different from most of the games that I play. And I think after the election did a good way of giving a hint of mystery about what\u2019s involved.\n\nN: That\u2019s super interesting. So you mentioned that, since there wasn\u2019t a lot of information, you went on to Board Game Geek to go and kind of look up the reviews and the different mechanics and more information. But before we get into that, and how you went through that process with charter stone, do you also go on to Board Game Geek when you get all that information on the box?\n\nC: Yes. Oh, Board Game Geek is a pretty good community. It\u2019s quite a diverse community. It\u2019s like the authoritative source of like board games online. Like that\u2019s the place you go to check it. For example, if you\u2019re playing a game and you\u2019re not sure about a rule, or you feel that it\u2019s two rules that are conflicting, almost everyone I know will go to the board game geek website before they go to the official, the official website because normally it\u2019s easy to find other people obviously because they the official companies can test the game like 100,000 times. So people do it. And also, if someone\u2019s got an official answer from a company, they will consolidate there. So Board Game Geek is pretty authoritative. It\u2019s also very detailed in what you\u2019re looking for. And the website\u2019s not the prettiest, I\u2019ll be honest, but it\u2019s very functional. You find what you need to find, which is great. To go back to your question, yeah, I will use Board Game Geek pretty much every time. I will also use it sometimes if I\u2019m at home and browsing online for a board game. I will use maybe five or six big reviewers that I will also see what they\u2019ve said about again.\n\nN: Cool. Awesome. Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. Could you talk about a time when you have seen a game online or in a store and purchased it without going to board game geek?\n\nC: Yes, but only when I\u2019ve played the game before. For example, if I played with a friend so Game of Thrones, the board game is actually my current favorite board game and has been for several years that I bought off Amazon. Immediately I finished I went to I got introduced to it by one of my other friends who went down we spent the day playing. I laughed. I was like, I\u2019m buying this game because I played it. And I had the experience. And I use I guess I use this on Board Game Geek as a proxy, I proxy other people\u2019s experiences to be like, would this apply to me? And if I played it with them, and I like it, I will buy it without checking Board Game Geek.\n\nN: Okay. Interesting. So it seems that if you\u2019ve had the experience of playing the game, you feel more comfortable purchasing it without visiting board game geek.\n\nC: Yeah, because at that point in my experience, I know I like it. As I said, I think with Board Game Geek, I use it when it\u2019s new for me. You can read the packaging, maybe less overcharged soon, because the packaging, but generally, you can get an overview of how the game works, doesn\u2019t say how the game plays, which is very, which is a very different thing. And there\u2019s a lot of board games out there. They\u2019re not all fantastic. And there are multiple reasons that that will be the case. So I tend to trust the community of gamers about what they like what they do, like, there may be a chance I\u2019m missing out on an awesome game that I would think was fantastic because the community doesn\u2019t like it. But generally, I found that the games that I buy, the process of buying games generally seems to work for me.\n\nN: Okay. And that\u2019s the process of looking and looking it up on Board Game Geek.\n\nC: Yeah, it\u2019s about more validating. So I\u2019ll come across it in bed. So a friend will mention a game, or I\u2019ll see online I see in a bookstore for game geeks, which is my way of getting more information. What is the experience of playing this? Occasionally, I get games recommended to friends. And if a friend has recommended the game to me, I\u2019ll check it out. But I probably still will check Board Game Geek if I haven\u2019t played it myself. Okay. Okay. Even if it is a recommendation from a friend, you are more likely to. Yeah, I think it depends. I\u2019ve got many friends who play board games, and they\u2019ve all got different preferences. I mean, there\u2019s a couple of friends who like or enjoy almost the same games. So if they recommended them, I probably would take it off the bat as a smart purchase."
