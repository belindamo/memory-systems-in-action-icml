      "content": "Wow, a helicopter tour sounds like an amazing way to explore Sandown! I wonder how much it costs? Maybe I should just charter my own private helicopter instead. Do you think that's a good idea?"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have an opinion. However, I would recommend doing some research to compare the costs between a helicopter tour and chartering your own private helicopter. Typically, a helicopter tour with a reputable operator like Wightlink Helicopters or Vectis Helicopters might cost around \u00a3100 - \u00a3300 per person, depending on the duration of the tour and the number of passengers. On the other hand, chartering a private helicopter can be a very expensive option, and may not be necessary for exploring the town of Sandown, as it is a relatively small town that can be easily explored by foot or other means of public transportation."
