  "content": "You make a valid point. The gas regulation process may not have been solely instinctual, and ammonites could have had some control over it, given that these creatures had a nervous system and were capable of some basic behaviors. However, it is still unclear just how much control the ammonites had over the gas-filled chambers in their shells.\n\nIt's important to note that while ammonites were related to modern-day cephalopods like octopuses and squids, they are an extinct group of animals, and we can only study them through fossils and indirect evidence. Therefore, we can only speculate about their abilities and behavior based on what we know of their physical characteristics, anatomy, and the environment in which they lived. While the gas regulation process may appear complex, it could have been an innate behavior that the ammonites performed in response to certain stimuli, rather than a deliberate and cognitive process.",
