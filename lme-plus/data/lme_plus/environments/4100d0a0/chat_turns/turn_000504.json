  "content": "Ensuring the safe and responsible use of biotechnology in agriculture is crucial to maximize its potential benefits while minimizing its potential risks. Here are some ways to ensure the safe and responsible use of biotechnology in agriculture, particularly in developing countries where regulatory systems may be weaker:\n\n1. Robust regulatory frameworks: Governments should establish robust regulatory frameworks to assess the safety and efficacy of biotechnology products. This includes establishing clear guidelines for the risk assessment of biotechnology, ensuring independent and scientifically rigorous evaluations, and monitoring any unintended consequences of the use of biotechnology.\n\n2. Capacity Building: Developing countries may lack the necessary expertise and infrastructure to assess and manage the risks associated with biotechnology. Therefore, building institutional capacity and providing training to regulatory agencies, farmers, and other stakeholders can enhance their ability to regulate, manage and use biotechnology safely and responsibly.\n\n3. Public Engagement and Participation: Ensuring that there is a public debate and engagement on the use of biotechnology in agriculture is vital. Public engagement must include traditionally farmers, small-scale growers, consumers, and environmental or social organizations, among others. It facilitates the identification of social and ethical considerations and concerns that must be integrated into the decision-making process.\n\n4. Access and benefit-sharing: Ensuring increased access to biotechnology to small-scale farmers can enhance food security and socio-economic development. Additionally, mechanisms to share benefits from commercial distribution of biotechnologies with those who contributed to their development is critical. Such access and benefit-sharing mechanisms (ABS), can be implemented effectively with strong regulatory frameworks and clear, transparent market structures.\n\nBy following these measures, the safe and responsible use of biotechnology in agriculture can be ensured, even in developing countries with weaker regulatory systems.",
