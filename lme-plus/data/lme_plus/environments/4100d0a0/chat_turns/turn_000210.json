  "content": "MP3 has been around for much longer than AAC and was one of the first widely-used digital audio formats. It gained popularity in the early days of digital music and became the de facto standard for digital music files. As a result, many consumer devices and apps have built-in support for MP3 playback, and users have a large library of MP3 files that they have accumulated over the years.\n\nAnother reason why MP3 is still popular is that it is supported by a wider range of devices than AAC. While AAC is now widely supported on newer devices, older devices and some cheaper or more basic devices may not support it. In addition, some users may prefer MP3 because it has a more established ecosystem of software tools and services for managing and playing back music files.\n\nThat being said, the popularity of AAC has been growing in recent years, particularly in the streaming media industry. AAC is now widely used in streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, and many new devices now support AAC playback as well.",
