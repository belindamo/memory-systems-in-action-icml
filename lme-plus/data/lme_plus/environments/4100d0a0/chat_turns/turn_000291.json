You can visit their website, click on \"Store Locator\" at the top right corner, and enter your location or zip code to find nearby stores. You can also filter the results by distance, hours of operation, and services offered (e.g., fitting rooms).\n\nAlternatively, you can use online directories like Google Maps or Yelp to search for Old Navy stores near your location. Just type \"Old Navy near me\" or \"Old Navy [your city/state]\" and you'll get a list of nearby stores along with their addresses, phone numbers, and hours of operation.\n\nIf you prefer to try on coats at Uniqlo, you can also use their store locator feature on their website. Just click on \"Store Locator\" at the top right corner, enter your location or zip code, and you'll get a list of nearby stores.\n\nIt's always a good idea to call the store before visiting to confirm their hours, availability of the coats you're interested in, and to ask about their return and exchange policies.\n\nHope this helps, and happy coat shopping!",
