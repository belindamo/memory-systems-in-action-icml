To make your graphic tees last longer and keep them looking their best, here are some tips on how to care for them:\n\n**Wash Inside Out**\n\n* Always wash your graphic tees inside out to prevent the design from fading or peeling off. This is especially important for tees with screen-printed or heat-pressed designs.\n\n**Cold Water Only**\n\n* Wash your graphic tees in cold water to prevent shrinkage and color fading. Hot water can cause the colors to run, and it can also shrink the fabric.\n\n**Mild Detergent**\n\n* Use a mild detergent that's specifically designed for washing clothes with prints or colors. Avoid using harsh detergents or bleach, as they can damage the fabric or cause the design to fade.\n\n**Avoid Fabric Softener**\n\n* Fabric softener can leave a residue on your graphic tees that can affect the print or cause it to fade faster. If you must use fabric softener, make sure to rinse your tees thoroughly to remove any excess residue.\n\n**Don't Over-Dry**\n\n* Avoid over-drying your graphic tees, as this can cause them to shrink or lose their shape. Remove them from the dryer while they're still slightly damp, and hang them up to air-dry.\n\n**Iron Inside Out**\n\n* If you need to iron your graphic tees, do it inside out to prevent the design from getting damaged. Use a low heat setting and avoid ironing over the design itself.\n\n**Avoid Stretching or Tugging**\n\n* Be gentle when putting on or taking off your graphic tees to avoid stretching or tugging on the fabric. This can cause the design to distort or lose its shape.\n\nBy following these care tips, you can help extend the life of your graphic tees and keep them looking their best. Happy styling!",
