Here are a few things users can do to hold companies accountable:\n\n1. Conduct Your Research: Before installing an app or creating an account with a company, you can conduct research on the company's privacy policy and data protection measures. Reviewing their policies and practices can help you make better decisions regarding how your data is used and increase your confidence that the company has user privacy as a core value.\n\n2. Leave a Review: If you feel that a company's privacy practices are inadequate, another option is to leave a review outlining your concerns. Reviews from other users can help potential customers make informed decisions regarding the companies they interact with.\n\n3. Bring it to Attention: Users can also take action by reaching out to the company itself to express concerns or to government agencies that oversee data privacy, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), or Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) in the EU.\n\n4. Use Privacy-Oriented Tools: Another option available to users is the use of privacy-oriented tools such as browser extensions, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), and ad-blockers.\n\nBy following these practices and holding companies accountable, we can promote data privacy and help ensure that user privacy remains a cornerstone of tech company operations, thus strengthening the broader ecosystem.",
