  "content": "Vaccination campaigns are one of the most effective strategies to prevent the spread of rabies in both animals and humans. Vaccination provides long-term immunity to rabies, reducing the risk of infection and transmission of the virus.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vaccinating at least 70% of dogs in a population to achieve herd immunity and control rabies transmission. This approach has been shown to be effective in several countries, including the Philippines, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe duration of protection of the rabies vaccine varies depending on the type of vaccine used, but it typically lasts between one and three years in dogs. Regular booster vaccinations are recommended to maintain immunity.\n\nIt's important to note that vaccination campaigns need to be conducted regularly to maintain herd immunity in the population. Additionally, other measures such as responsible pet ownership, animal control programs, public education, and rapid response to animal bites should also be implemented in conjunction with vaccination campaigns to effectively control and prevent the spread of rabies.",
