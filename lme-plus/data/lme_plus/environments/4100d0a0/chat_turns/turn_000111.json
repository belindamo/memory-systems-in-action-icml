However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n* The U.S. Department of Energy recommends the following temperature settings for energy efficiency:\n\t+ Winter: 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) when you're awake and 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) when you're asleep or away.\n\t+ Summer: 78\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) when you're awake and 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) when you're asleep or away.\n* The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests the following temperature ranges:\n\t+ Winter: 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) to 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C) when occupied, and 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) to 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) when unoccupied.\n\t+ Summer: 73\u00b0F (23\u00b0C) to 79\u00b0F (26\u00b0C) when occupied, and 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) to 85\u00b0F (29\u00b0C) when unoccupied.\n\nIn your case, setting the temperature to 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C) is a good starting point, but you may want to experiment to find the optimal temperature for your comfort and energy efficiency.\n\nHere are some tips to help you optimize your temperature settings:\n\n1. **Experiment with small changes**: Try adjusting the temperature by 1-2\u00b0F (0.5-1\u00b0C) and see how it affects your comfort and energy consumption.\n2. **Use the 'schedule' feature**: Program your smart thermostat to adjust the temperature automatically based on your daily schedule, so you can save energy when you're not home or when you're sleeping.\n3. **Consider a 'smart' temperature**: Some smart thermostats can learn your schedule and preferences to optimize the temperature for energy efficiency. If your thermostat has this feature, enable it to see if it can find a better temperature for you.\n4. **Monitor your energy consumption**: Keep an eye on your energy bills and monitor your thermostat's energy usage reports to see how your temperature settings are impacting your energy consumption.\n5. **Don't forget about humidity**: In addition to temperature, humidity can also affect your comfort and energy efficiency. Consider using a humidifier or dehumidifier to maintain a comfortable humidity level (between 30-60%).\n\nRemember, the key to energy efficiency is finding a balance between comfort and energy savings. Experiment with different temperatures and settings to find what works best for you and your home.",
