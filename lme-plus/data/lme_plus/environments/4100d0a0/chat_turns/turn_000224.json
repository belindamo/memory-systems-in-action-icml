  "content": "AAC is certainly a widely used audio codec for internet radio broadcast, but there are other codecs in use as well. MP3, for example, remains a popular format for internet radio, particularly for legacy streams that have been in operation for many years. Additionally, some broadcasters may use other codecs such as Opus or Vorbis for specific purposes, such as providing higher-quality streams for certain genres of music or for use in low-bandwidth environments.\n\nUltimately, the choice of codec will depend on a number of factors, including the needs of the broadcaster, the preferences of their audience, and the capabilities of their distribution platforms.",
