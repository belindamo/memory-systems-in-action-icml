They might even have some surprises up their sleeve that aren't listed on the menu!\n\nDon't hesitate to ask them about any special birthday treats or options they might have available. They'll likely be happy to help make your niece's birthday celebration even more special.\n\nRemember to also ask about any special birthday buttons or decorations they might have available to make the occasion even more festive.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find the perfect treat to make your niece's birthday celebration at Disneyland even more magical!",
