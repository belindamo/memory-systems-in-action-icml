  "content": "I'm sorry but as an AI language model, I'm not able to arrange for private helicopter tours or book reservations. However, you can contact the helicopter charter companies that I mentioned earlier, such as Atlas Helicopters, Elite Helicopters, Aero Legends, or Phoenix Helicopters directly to get a quote and book a reservation for a private helicopter tour of Sandown. You can specify your requirements and preferences (such as luxury amenities) to the company, and they will tailor the experience to your needs. Please keep in mind that private helicopter tours can be quite expensive, so it might be a good idea to check the cost beforehand with the company you choose.",
