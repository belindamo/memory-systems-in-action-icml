  "content": "That's really interesting. I've been noticing that women are underrepresented in leadership positions in my own company, and I've been wondering if it's just my company or if it's an industry-wide issue. You mentioned that women hold only 12% of technical leadership positions in software development. That's even lower than I expected. \n\nBy the way, I recently attended a workshop on gender equality in the workplace and learned that women make up only 25% of the workforce in my company's industry. It's frustrating to see such low numbers, but it's motivating me to get more involved in initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion.",
