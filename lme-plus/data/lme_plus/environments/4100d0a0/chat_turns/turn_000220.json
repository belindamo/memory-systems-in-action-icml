  "content": "Yes, when you use `ffmpeg` to create an HLS stream, it will create a series of `.m3u8` playlist files and segment files, where each segment is typically a few seconds of audio or video data. These segments will be encoded in a format compatible with HLS, which can include AAC audio.\n\nYou can then upload these files to a web server and serve them as an HLS stream to end-users, who can listen to the audio in a web browser or with an HLS-compatible media player. The `.m3u8` playlists will reference the AAC audio segment files in the correct order to play the audio stream.",
