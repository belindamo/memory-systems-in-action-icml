Catching up on work or taking a short walk around the block are both great options. If the weather's nice, a short walk can be a lovely way to refresh your mind and get some extra steps in.\n\nSince you've got some flexibility in your lunch break, you might also consider using that time to do something that brings you joy or relaxation. Perhaps you could read a book, listen to music, or chat with a friend? Whatever you choose, make sure it's something that recharges your batteries for the rest of the day!\n\nHow's your workload looking for the day? Do you have any pressing tasks or deadlines you need to meet? I'm here to help you prioritize if you need it!",
