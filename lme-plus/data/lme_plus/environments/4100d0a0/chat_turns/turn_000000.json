The remnants of the old Empire still exist, however, and some of the clones and their supporters continue to resist the changes that have been brought about.\n\n4501 - 5000:\nThe tenth generation of clones has now been born, but they hold no political power in the galaxy. The Foundation and its allies have cemented their place as the dominant force in the galaxy, ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity. However, there are still pockets of resistance and dissent, and the memory of the old Empire and its genetic dynasty lingers on.\n\nOverall, the presence of a genetic dynasty in the Empire would have significant implications for the story of Foundation. It would create a unique source of stability and continuity, but also lead to concerns about genetic health, resistance to change, and challenges to the legitimacy of the ruling clones. These factors could play out in different ways over the course of 500 years, shaping the evolution of the galaxy and the fate of the Foundation.",
