  "content": "Excellent choices! Both Good Omens and The Rosie Project are wonderful audiobooks that will keep you entertained during your commute.\n\nRegarding Good Omens, while it's a longer book (around 14 hours of audio), the story is engaging, and the humor is top-notch. The audiobook is well-narrated by Martin Jarvis, who brings the characters to life. If you're commuting daily, you can easily get through 30-60 minutes of listening per day, which would put you at a pace of around 1-2 weeks to finish the book.\n\nTerry Pratchett's writing is known for its wit, satire, and clever wordplay, which makes the story fly by. You'll be laughing out loud one moment and nodding your head in agreement the next. The book has a great balance of humor, adventure, and heart, making it an enjoyable listen.\n\nNeil Gaiman's contribution to the book adds an extra layer of depth and cleverness to the story, and the collaboration between the two authors is seamless. You'll find yourself looking forward to your daily commute just to hear what happens next!\n\nSo, while Good Omens is a longer book, I think you'll find it's well worth the investment of time. The story is engaging, the characters are lovable, and the humor is infectious. You might even find yourself recommending it to friends and family once you've finished!",
