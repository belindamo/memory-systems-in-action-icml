  "content": "That's a great idea to consider accommodations, especially since you're familiar with the downtown Marriott hotel. It's always convenient to stay at a hotel that's close to the event venue, and it's even better if they offer special packages or discounts for event attendees.\n\nI would recommend contacting the downtown Marriott hotel directly to inquire about any potential packages or promotions they might be offering for the event. They may have a special room rate or package deal for attendees, which could include perks like:\n\n* Discounted room rates\n* Complimentary breakfast or parking\n* Late check-out\n* Access to a VIP lounge or concierge services\n* A special event package that includes a room, transportation to and from the event, and other amenities\n\nEven if they don't have a specific package for the event, they might be able to offer a discounted rate for attendees or provide recommendations for nearby hotels that do.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check the event organizer's website or contact them directly to see if they have any partnerships with local hotels or recommendations for accommodations. They might have negotiated special rates or packages for attendees, which could be a great way to save money and ensure a convenient stay.\n\nRemember to book your accommodations as early as possible, especially if the event is popular or takes place during a peak travel season. This will help ensure that you get the best rates and availability.",
