  "content": "The room is roughly 12 by 15 feet, and it's a rectangle. My coffee table is about 4 feet long and 2 feet wide. The bookshelf, which my brother helped me with, is about 5 feet tall and 3 feet wide, and it's currently against a wall. I've got a sectional sofa that seats 3 people, and I'm aiming for a modern look. There's a large window on one side of the room, and I'd like to leave some space in front of it for a reading nook.",
