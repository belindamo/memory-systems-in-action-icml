  "content": "I've already read The Nightingale, but The Alice Network and The Song of Achilles sound really interesting. I've actually had The Song of Achilles on my shelf for a while now, but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet. Can you tell me more about The Alice Network? Also, do you have any recommendations for audiobooks in historical fiction? I've been listening to audiobooks during my daily commute and I'd love some suggestions.",
