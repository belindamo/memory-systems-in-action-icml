Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n**Setting up Routines:**\n\nRoutines are a series of actions that can be triggered by a single voice command or a specific event. To set up routines, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open the Google Home app**: On your mobile device, open the Google Home app (make sure you're signed in with the same Google account linked to your Google Home device).\n2. **Tap on the \"+\" icon**: In the top-left corner of the app, tap on the \"+\" icon to create a new routine.\n3. **Choose a trigger**: Select the trigger that will activate your routine. You can choose from various options, such as:\n\t* Voice command (e.g., \"Good morning\")\n\t* Time of day (e.g., 7:00 AM)\n\t* Sunrise/sunset\n\t* Location (e.g., when you arrive or leave home)\n4. **Add actions**: Choose the actions you want to perform when the routine is triggered. In this case, you can add your smart thermostat to the routine. Select \"Smart devices\" and then choose your thermostat from the list.\n5. **Configure thermostat settings**: Set the desired temperature, mode (e.g., heat, cool, or auto), and fan mode for your routine.\n6. **Add more actions (optional)**: You can add more actions to your routine, such as turning on lights, locking doors, or sending notifications.\n7. **Save the routine**: Give your routine a name and save it.\n\n**Setting up Custom Commands:**\n\nCustom commands allow you to create personalized voice commands for specific actions. To set up custom commands, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open the Google Home app**: Open the Google Home app and navigate to the \"Routines\" tab.\n2. **Tap on \"Custom commands\"**: Tap on the \"Custom commands\" button at the top of the screen.\n3. **Create a new custom command**: Tap on the \"+\" icon to create a new custom command.\n4. **Enter the command**: Enter the voice command you want to use (e.g., \"Set my thermostat to 72 degrees\").\n5. **Choose the action**: Select the action you want to perform when the custom command is triggered. In this case, choose your smart thermostat.\n6. **Configure thermostat settings**: Set the desired temperature, mode, and fan mode for your custom command.\n7. **Save the custom command**: Give your custom command a name and save it.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Routine: \"Good morning\" -> Turns on the living room lights, sets the thermostat to 72\u00b0F, and plays your favorite morning playlist.\n* Custom command: \"Set my thermostat to 72 degrees\" -> Sets the thermostat to 72\u00b0F.\n* Custom command: \"Make it cozy\" -> Sets the thermostat to 75\u00b0F, turns on the fireplace, and dims the living room lights.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use phrases like \"Hey Google, turn the thermostat to 72 degrees\" or \"Hey Google, make it warm\" to trigger your custom commands.\n* Create multiple routines and custom commands to cater to different scenarios, such as \"Goodnight\" or \"Leaving home.\"\n* Experiment with different phrases and actions to find what works best for you.\n* You can also use Google Home's \"Quick phrases\" feature to create shortcuts for frequently used commands.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to create routines and custom commands that enhance your smart home experience and make your life more convenient.",
