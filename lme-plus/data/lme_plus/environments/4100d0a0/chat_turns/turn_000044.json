  "content": "I'm glad you had a great time at the Paradise Garden Grill yesterday! However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time information or personal experiences. I can provide general information about the Paradise Garden Grill, but I won't be able to confirm specific details about their current menu or character meet-and-greets.\n\nThat being said, Paradise Garden Grill is a great choice for a family-friendly lunch spot! According to Disneyland's website, they offer a variety of Mediterranean-inspired cuisine, including sandwiches, salads, and skewers. They might have kid-friendly options like chicken tenders, mac and cheese, or burgers, but I recommend checking the official Disneyland website or the Disneyland app for the most up-to-date menu information.\n\nRegarding character meet-and-greets, Paradise Garden Grill doesn't typically offer character dining experiences during lunch. However, you can check the Disneyland website or the park schedule for character meet-and-greet opportunities elsewhere in the park. You might be able to catch your niece's favorite characters at designated meet-and-greet locations or during parades and shows.\n\nIf you're looking for a character dining experience, you might consider booking a character breakfast or lunch at other Disneyland restaurants, such as Plaza Inn, Goofy's Kitchen, or Ariel's Grotto. These restaurants often offer character meet-and-greets and photo opportunities during meal times.\n\nRemember to make dining reservations up to 60 days in advance, as popular character dining experiences can fill up quickly!",
