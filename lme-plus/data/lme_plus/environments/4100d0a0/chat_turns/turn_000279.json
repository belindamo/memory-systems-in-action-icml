It's great that you've got a few hours to tackle those tasks without feeling too much pressure.\n\nRemember to take breaks in between tasks to stretch, grab a snack or drink, and rest your eyes. You've got this!\n\nSince you've got a relatively relaxed day ahead, is there anything else you'd like to fit in? Maybe something you've been putting off or wanting to tackle in your personal time?
