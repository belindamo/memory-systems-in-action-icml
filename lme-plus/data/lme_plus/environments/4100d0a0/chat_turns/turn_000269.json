You can use the `pyplot` sublibrary of `matplotlib` to plot the grid and the groups on it.\n\nHere is an example of how you could generate a picture of the grid with the locations of the groups using `matplotlib`:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef plot_grid(groups, grid_size):\n    grid = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size)) # create an empty grid of the specified size\n    for group in groups:\n        for cell in group:\n            x, y = cell\n            grid[x][y] = 1 # mark the cell as belonging to a group\n    plt.imshow(grid, cmap='gray') # plot the grid using a grayscale colormap\n    plt.show()\n\nplot_grid(groups, 100)\n```\nIn this example, the `plot_grid(groups, grid_size)` function takes two arguments: the `groups` and the `grid_size`. The function first creates an empty grid of the specified size using the `numpy` library, then it iterates over the groups, and for each group, it iterates over the cells, and marks the cells as belonging to a group, then it plots the grid using the `imshow()` function of `pyplot` and sets the color map to 'gray' and shows the plot\n\nYou can also add the (x,y) values of the groups on the picture by :\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef plot_grid(groups, grid_size):\n    grid = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size)) # create an empty grid of the specified size\n    for group in groups:\n        for cell in group:\n            x, y = cell\n            grid[x][y] = 1 # mark the cell as belonging to a group\n    plt.imshow(grid, cmap='gray') # plot the grid using a grayscale colormap\n    for group in groups:\n        for cell in group:\n            x, y = cell\n            plt.text(y, x, f'({x}, {y})', fontsize=8, color='white', ha=\"center\",va=\"center\")\n    plt.show()\n\nplot_grid(groups, 100)\n```\nIn this example, the `plot_grid(groups, grid_size)` function plots the grid and then iterates over the groups, and for each group, it iterates over the cells, and adds the (x,y) values of the groups as text on the corresponding cells, this is done by using the `text()` function of `pyplot` with the parameters x, y, the text to be displayed , fontsize, color, ha and va.\n\nNote that this is just an example, and you can adjust the parameters of the functions according to your needs and you can use different colors and shapes to differentiate between different groups.",
