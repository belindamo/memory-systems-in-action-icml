  "content": "Sure, I can explain. The shells of ammonites were divided into a series of chambers, and the living animal inhabited the final and largest chamber. Each chamber was connected to the previous one via a small opening called a \"siphuncle,\" which allowed the ammonites to move gas between chambers.\n\nTo regulate their buoyancy, ammonites could add or remove gas from the chambers as needed. They could do this by secreting or absorbing gas into the chambers through their siphuncle. For example, if an ammonite wanted to rise to the surface of the water, it would add gas to the chambers, increasing its overall buoyancy. Conversely, if it wanted to sink deeper, it would remove gas from the chambers, making itself denser and therefore more likely to sink.\n\nIt's worth noting that while this process may seem complicated, it was likely an instinctual behavior for these creatures, much as breathing is for humans.",
