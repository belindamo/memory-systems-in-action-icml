I've got some fantastic ideas that are easy to customize and can be reheated throughout the week. Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Grain bowls**: Cook a large batch of grains like brown rice, quinoa, or farro, and then top with different ingredients throughout the week. Think roasted vegetables, proteins like chicken or tofu, and sauces like tahini or salsa.\n2. **Slow cooker recipes**: Slow cookers are perfect for meal prep. Try making a big batch of chili, stew, or curry, and then portion it out into individual containers for the week.\n3. **Mason jar salads**: Prep a week's worth of mason jar salads by layering greens, vegetables, proteins, and nuts. Add a simple vinaigrette, and you're good to go!\n4. **Protein-packed soups**: Cook a large batch of soup and portion it out into individual containers. You can customize with different toppings like avocado, sour cream, or croutons.\n5. **Roasted vegetables**: Roast a large batch of vegetables like broccoli, sweet potatoes, or Brussels sprouts, and then use them throughout the week in different meals.\n6. **Casseroles**: Casseroles are perfect for meal prep. Try making a big batch of lasagna, chicken enchiladas, or chicken and rice, and then portion it out into individual containers.\n7. **Breakfast burritos**: Scramble eggs, cook sausage or bacon, and add cheese, salsa, and avocado. Wrap individual burritos and reheat throughout the week.\n8. **Lentil or vegetable curries**: Cook a large batch of lentils or vegetables in a curry sauce, and then serve over rice or with naan bread.\n9. **Quesadillas**: Cook a large batch of quesadillas with different fillings like chicken, steak, or vegetables, and then reheat throughout the week.\n10. **Muffin tin meals**: Use muffin tins to portion out individual meals like scrambled eggs, meatloaf, or chicken and rice.\n\nThese recipes are all easy to customize and can be reheated throughout the week. Feel free to get creative and add your own favorite ingredients or spices!\n\nDo any of these recipes stand out to you, or is there a specific type of cuisine you're interested in exploring?",
