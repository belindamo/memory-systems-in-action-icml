Encouragement to speak up: Social support systems can provide encouragement to athletes to speak up about pain, injuries or other concerns during the game. Additionally, medical staff and coaches can work to reduce stigma around injuries and create a culture where athletes feel comfortable reporting symptoms.\n\n4. Emotional support: Having a supportive team and community can provide athletes with emotional support during challenging times, including after injuries. This can help foster a positive attitude and reduce stress, which can aid in the healing process.\n\n5. Reduced risk-taking behaviors: A social environment that encourages athletes to follow safety guidelines and utilize proper technique can help reduce the risk of injuries caused by reckless behavior.
