  "content": "AAC is considered to be better than MP3 at low bitrates because it uses more advanced encoding techniques such as spectral band replication (SBR) and parametric stereo to reduce the amount of data required to represent the audio signal. These techniques allow AAC to achieve similar audio quality to MP3 at lower bitrates. In addition, AAC has better handling of transient sounds and is less prone to artifacts such as ringing and pre-echo, which can be particularly noticeable at lower bitrates.\n\nAnother reason why AAC is preferred over MP3 for streaming applications is that it provides better support for metadata and streaming features such as gapless playback, chapter markers, and multiple audio tracks. These features are important for delivering a high-quality user experience in streaming applications.",
