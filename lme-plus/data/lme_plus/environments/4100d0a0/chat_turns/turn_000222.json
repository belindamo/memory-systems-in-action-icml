  "content": "There isn't necessarily a de facto standard audio codec for internet radio broadcasts, as different broadcasters and streaming platforms may use different codecs depending on factors such as audio quality, bandwidth, and compatibility with different devices and platforms.\n\nHowever, AAC is a common audio codec used for internet radio broadcasts because of its efficient compression and high audio quality at low bitrates. It is also supported by many devices and platforms, including mobile devices, web browsers, and streaming media players.\n\nThat being said, some internet radio broadcasters may still use other codecs such as MP3 or Ogg Vorbis depending on their specific needs and preferences. It ultimately depends on the individual broadcaster's goals and the requirements of their audience and distribution channels.",
