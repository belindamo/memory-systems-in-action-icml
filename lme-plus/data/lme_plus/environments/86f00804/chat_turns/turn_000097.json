Don't forget to stay hydrated, stretch your legs during the flight, and take breaks to move around.\n\nAnd, of course, enjoy your Uber ride to the airport! You might even get a chance to relax, listen to some calming music, and mentally prepare for your trip.\n\nRemember to double-check your flight details, packing list, and any travel documents before you head out the door. And, if you have any downtime during your trip, you could even squeeze in a quick yoga practice in your hotel room or find a local yoga studio near your destination.\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you have a productive and relaxing trip!",
