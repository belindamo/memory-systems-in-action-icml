  "content": "The conference venue is at the LA Convention Center. My budget is around $200 per night, and I'm open to any type of hotel as long as it's clean and comfortable. I'd prefer a hotel with free Wi-Fi and a gym. I'll be staying for 3 nights. Oh, and by the way, I've been meaning to ask, can you give me some tips on how to make the most out of industry conferences? I've been to a few, but I feel like I could be getting more value out of them.",
