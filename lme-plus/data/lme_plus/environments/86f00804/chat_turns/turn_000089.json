And how lovely that you met Rachel, a yoga instructor, and got some valuable advice on poses for better sleep!\n\nHere are some tips to help you establish a consistent yoga practice:\n\n1. **Set a specific goal**: Commit to practicing yoga at the same time every day or week. It could be 3 times a week, 20 minutes a day, or whatever works for you. Write it down and make it a non-negotiable part of your schedule.\n2. **Create a dedicated space**: Designate a quiet, peaceful area in your home where you can practice yoga without distractions. This will help you associate that space with relaxation and mindfulness.\n3. **Start small**: Begin with short practices (10-20 minutes) and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. This will help you build confidence and make yoga feel less daunting.\n4. **Find a yoga style that resonates with you**: Experiment with different styles, such as Hatha, Vinyasa, Restorative, or Yin, to find what works best for your body and mind. This will keep you engaged and motivated.\n5. **Invest in a good yoga mat and props**: Having a high-quality yoga mat and props like blocks, straps, or blankets can make a big difference in your practice. It's a small investment that can enhance your experience.\n6. **Schedule it**: Treat your yoga practice as a non-negotiable appointment. Write it down in your calendar and set reminders to ensure you don't forget.\n7. **Make it a ritual**: Develop a pre-practice routine that signals to your body and mind that it's time for yoga. This could be as simple as lighting a candle, sipping herbal tea, or playing calming music.\n8. **Be gentle with yourself**: Remember that yoga is a journey, not a competition. Listen to your body, honor its limitations, and don't push yourself too hard. This will help you stay consistent and avoid injuries.\n9. **Track your progress**: Keep a yoga journal or use an app to track your practices, note your progress, and set reminders. This will help you stay motivated and see the benefits of your consistent practice.\n10. **Seek inspiration**: Follow yoga bloggers, Instagram accounts, or YouTube channels for inspiration, tips, and new sequences to try. This will keep your practice fresh and exciting.\n\nAs for the advice Rachel gave you on poses for better sleep, that's fantastic! You might want to explore those poses further and incorporate them into your daily routine. Remember to also focus on relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation, to help you unwind before sleep.\n\nGood luck on your yoga journey, and I hope these tips help you establish a consistent practice that brings you peace, calmness, and better sleep!",
