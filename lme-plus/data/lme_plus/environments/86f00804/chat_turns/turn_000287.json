Here's a detailed comparison:\n\n**Netgear Orbi:**\n\n* **System:** The Orbi is a tri-band mesh network system, which means it has a dedicated 5GHz band for communication between the router and satellites.\n* **Router and Satellites:** The system consists of a router (RBR50) and one or more satellites (RBS50). You can add up to 3 satellites to the system.\n* **Range:** The Orbi system can cover up to 6,000 square feet (around 560 square meters) with a single router and one satellite.\n* **Speed:** The Orbi supports speeds up to 3.2 Gbps (1.9 Gbps on the 5GHz band and 1.3 Gbps on the 2.4GHz band).\n* **Features:** The Orbi has a strong set of features, including:\n\t+ MU-MIMO technology for simultaneous streaming to multiple devices\n\t+ Beamforming for improved range and coverage\n\t+ Guest network support\n\t+ Parental controls\n\t+ Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant integration\n* **Price:** The Orbi system is generally priced around $300-$400 for a 2-pack (router and one satellite).\n\n**Linksys Velop:**\n\n* **System:** The Velop is a tri-band mesh network system, similar to the Orbi.\n* **Router and Nodes:** The system consists of a router (WHW0301) and one or more nodes (WHW0302). You can add up to 3 nodes to the system.\n* **Range:** The Velop system can cover up to 6,000 square feet (around 560 square meters) with a single router and one node.\n* **Speed:** The Velop supports speeds up to 2.2 Gbps (867 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 867 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band).\n* **Features:** The Velop has a strong set of features, including:\n\t+ MU-MIMO technology for simultaneous streaming to multiple devices\n\t+ Beamforming for improved range and coverage\n\t+ Guest network support\n\t+ Parental controls\n\t+ Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant integration\n\t+ Integration with Linksys Shield, a security software\n* **Price:** The Velop system is generally priced around $250-$350 for a 2-pack (router and one node).\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nBoth systems are high-performance mesh network systems with strong features and good range. Here are some key differences:\n\n* **Speed:** The Orbi has slightly faster speeds than the Velop, especially on the 5GHz band.\n* **Range:** Both systems have similar range, but the Orbi might have a slight edge in terms of coverage.\n* **Design:** The Orbi has a more traditional router design, while the Velop has a more compact, cube-shaped design.\n* **Price:** The Velop is generally priced lower than the Orbi, especially for the 2-pack option.\n\nUltimately, the choice between the Netgear Orbi and Linksys Velop will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you prioritize speed and range, the Orbi might be the better choice. If you're looking for a more affordable option with a strong set of features, the Velop could be the way to go.",
