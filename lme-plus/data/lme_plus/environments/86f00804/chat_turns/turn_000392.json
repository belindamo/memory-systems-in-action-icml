  "content": "It is not possible to determine who was the very first person to see Prince George's County, Maryland in history, as the area was likely inhabited by various indigenous tribes for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans.\n\nThe first Europeans to explore the region were likely the Spanish, who sailed up the Potomac River in the 16th century. The English established the Province of Maryland in 1632, and Prince George's County was created in 1696. The first English colonists to settle in the area were likely farmers and tobacco planters, who would have interacted with the local indigenous peoples.",
