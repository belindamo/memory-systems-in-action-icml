Here are some ideas that might interest you:\n\n1. **College Memories Slideshow**: Create a slideshow with photos from your college days and have everyone guess who's in the picture, what year it was taken, or what event it was from.\n2. **Then and Now**: Prepare a handout with two columns: \"Then\" and \"Now.\" Ask everyone to fill in the columns with fun facts about themselves, such as their major, favorite hobby, or dream job back in college, and what they're doing now.\n3. **Human Bingo**: Create bingo cards with different traits, characteristics, or interests (e.g., \"has traveled to another country,\" \"speaks more than one language,\" \"has kids,\" etc.). Each person needs to find someone who fits each of the characteristics and get them to sign the corresponding square.\n4. **Scavenger Hunt**: Prepare a list of items or challenges that people need to complete during the reunion, such as \"find someone who has the same birthday as you\" or \"take a photo with someone who has the same major.\"\n5. **Two Truths and a Lie**: Have each person come up with two true statements about themselves and one false statement. The others have to guess which one is the lie.\n6. **College Trivia**: Prepare a quiz with questions about your college days, such as the name of the mascot, the year a certain building was constructed, or the name of a popular professor.\n7. **Word Cloud**: Create a word cloud with words related to your college experience (e.g., \"friends,\" \"memories,\" \"late nights,\" etc.). Ask everyone to take a few minutes to write down words that come to mind when they think of their college days. Then, have each person share one or two words and why they chose them.\n8. **Milestone Recognition**: Take a few minutes to recognize and celebrate the milestones and achievements of your classmates, such as weddings, graduations, new babies, or new jobs.\n9. **College Story Swap**: Divide the group into smaller circles of 3-4 people and have each person share a brief story about their favorite college memory or experience. Then, have each circle share one or two stories with the larger group.\n10. **Photobooth**: Set up a photobooth with props and backdrops that evoke a college theme (e.g., a fake dorm room, a college logo, etc.). This can be a fun way to get people laughing and mingling.\n\nRemember to keep the activities light-hearted and fun, and make sure they're inclusive for everyone. You can always adjust the activities based on the size and demographics of your group.\n\nI hope these ideas help you get started!",
