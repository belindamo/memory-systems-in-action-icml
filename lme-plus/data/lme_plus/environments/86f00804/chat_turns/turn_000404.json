  "content": "To Little Deer and his friends, nature in Prince George's County prior to European settlement would have been a vast and diverse landscape, filled with forests, rivers, mountains, and plains. They would have seen a variety of plant and animal life, ranging from towering trees to tiny insects.\n\nIn the forests, Little Deer and his friends might have seen towering oak and hickory trees, with leaves that turned brilliant shades of orange and gold in the fall. They might have heard the rustling of leaves as animals such as squirrels, raccoons, and deer moved through the underbrush. They might have seen wildflowers, berries, and mushrooms growing in patches of sunlight.\n\nNear the rivers, they would have seen water teeming with fish and other aquatic life. They might have seen turtles sunning themselves on rocks, or beavers building dams. They would have heard the sound of rushing water as the rivers flowed downstream.\n\nIn the mountains and plains, they might have seen herds of bison or elk grazing in the grasslands, or eagles soaring overhead. They might have seen towering cliffs or rock formations, and experienced the wide open spaces that characterize the western parts of Maryland.\n\nOverall, Little Deer and his friends would have been intimately connected with nature and the changing seasons. They would have relied on the natural world for food, shelter, and other basic needs. They would have learned from their elders how to observe and respect the rhythms of the natural world, and how to live in harmony with the plants and animals around them.",
