  "content": "Both the Asus RT-AX88U and Netgear Nighthawk RAX80 are high-performance WiFi 6 routers with excellent range and coverage. Here's a detailed comparison:\n\n**Asus RT-AX88U:**\n\n* **Range:** The RT-AX88U has a strong range, covering up to 5,000 square feet (around 460 square meters) with a single router.\n* **Antennas:** It comes with 8 external antennas, 4 of which are dedicated to the 5GHz band and 4 to the 2.4GHz band. This helps improve range and coverage.\n* **Beamforming:** The router supports beamforming technology, which focuses WiFi signals on specific devices to improve range and reduce interference.\n* **Mesh capability:** The RT-AX88U supports Asus's AiMesh technology, which allows you to create a mesh network by connecting multiple Asus routers. This can help extend the range and coverage of your network.\n* **WiFi signal strength:** The router has a strong WiFi signal, with a maximum transmission power of 30 dBm (1 W).\n\n**Netgear Nighthawk RAX80:**\n\n* **Range:** The RAX80 has an impressive range, covering up to 3,500 square feet (around 325 square meters) with a single router.\n* **Antennas:** It comes with 6 external antennas, 3 of which are dedicated to the 5GHz band and 3 to the 2.4GHz band.\n* **Beamforming:** The router supports beamforming technology, which helps improve range and reduce interference.\n* **Mesh capability:** The RAX80 supports Netgear's Nighthawk Mesh technology, which allows you to create a mesh network by connecting multiple Netgear routers.\n* **WiFi signal strength:** The router has a strong WiFi signal, with a maximum transmission power of 30 dBm (1 W).\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nBoth routers have excellent range and coverage, but the Asus RT-AX88U has a slightly stronger range and more antennas. The RT-AX88U's 8 antennas provide better coverage and help to reduce dead spots, while the RAX80's 6 antennas are still sufficient for most homes.\n\nHowever, the RAX80 has a more advanced mesh technology, with a more seamless handoff between nodes. This means that you can move around your home without experiencing drops in connectivity.\n\nUltimately, the choice between the two routers will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you have a larger home or need more advanced mesh capabilities, the Asus RT-AX88U might be the better choice. If you prefer a more seamless mesh experience and a stronger focus on gaming performance, the Netgear Nighthawk RAX80 could be the way to go.",
