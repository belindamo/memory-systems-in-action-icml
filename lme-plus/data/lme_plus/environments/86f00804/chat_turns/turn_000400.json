  "content": "If the children in Prince George's County prior to European settlement looked in the Potomac River and caught their reflections, they would have seen themselves as they truly were, just as we do today when we look in a still body of water. They would have seen their faces, hair, and clothing reflected in the water, as well as any surroundings or other people who might be with them.\n\nIt is possible that the children might have been fascinated by their reflections, especially if they had not seen them before. They might have laughed and played, making faces or trying to touch their own image in the water. Depending on the time of day and the weather, the reflections might have been clearer or more distorted, adding to the sense of wonder and discovery.\n\nIn addition to their own reflections, the children might have seen the reflections of animals, trees, and other natural features of the landscape. They might have recognized these reflections as part of their daily lives, and used them to navigate and understand the world around them. The reflections in the water would have been just one of many ways that the children interacted with and learned from their environment.",
