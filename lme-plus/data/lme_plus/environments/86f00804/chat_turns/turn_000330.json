Here are some tips to help you store them efficiently and keep your kitchen tidy:\n\n**Cookware Organization:**\n\n1. **Categorize and Group**: Divide your cookware into categories like pots, pans, lids, utensils, and baking dishes. Group similar items together, making it easier to find what you need.\n2. **Assign a Home**: Designate a specific area or cabinet for each category. For example, all pots and pans can go in one cabinet, while utensils can be stored in a nearby drawer.\n3. **Use Vertical Space**: Maximize your cabinet space by using stackable cookware or installing shelves and dividers.
