That kind of experience and perspective is incredibly valuable, and I'm sure you've gained a deep understanding of the industry's evolution.\n\nSpeaking of which, what do you think are some of the most significant changes you've seen in the industry over the past 2 years? Are there any particular trends, technologies, or shifts in consumer behavior that have stood out to you?\n\nAlso, I'm curious - what's been the most rewarding part of working on the new product line made from recycled materials?
