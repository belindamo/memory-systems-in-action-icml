Cooking bacon can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you achieve that perfect crispy-but-not-burnt bacon.\n\n**Pan-Frying:**\n\n1. **Choose the right pan**: Use a medium-sized skillet or pan that can fit your bacon slices in a single layer. A cast-iron or stainless steel pan is ideal, as they retain heat well.\n2. **Preheat the pan**: Place the pan over medium heat and let it preheat for 2-3 minutes.\n3. **Add bacon**: Carefully place the bacon slices in the pan, leaving some space between each slice.\n4. **Cook for 2-3 minutes**: Cook the bacon for 2-3 minutes on the first side, or until it starts to release its fat and the edges start to curl.\n5. **Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes**: Flip the bacon slices and cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until they reach your desired level of crispiness.\n6. **Drain excess fat**: Remove the bacon from the pan and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess fat.\n\n**Tips for crispy bacon:**\n\n* **Don't overcrowd the pan**: Cook the bacon in batches if necessary, to ensure each slice has enough room to cook evenly.\n* **Don't stir too much**: Let the bacon cook for a minute or two on each side before stirring. This helps create a crispy crust.\n* **Adjust heat as needed**: If the bacon is cooking too quickly or slowly, adjust the heat to prevent burning.\n* **Don't overcook**: Bacon can go from perfect to burnt quickly. Keep an eye on it and remove it from the pan when it reaches your desired level of crispiness.\n\n**Alternative methods:**\n\n* **Oven-roasting**: Line a baking sheet with foil and lay the bacon slices on it. Bake in a preheated oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, or until crispy.\n* **Grilling**: Place the bacon slices on a preheated grill and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until crispy.\n\n**The perfect crispiness:**\n\n* **Visual cue**: Look for a golden-brown color and a crispy texture. The bacon should be slightly flexible but still have a satisfying crunch.\n* **Sound cue**: Listen for a gentle crackle when you bite into the bacon. This indicates it's crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.\n\nNow, go ahead and cook that bacon to perfection!",
