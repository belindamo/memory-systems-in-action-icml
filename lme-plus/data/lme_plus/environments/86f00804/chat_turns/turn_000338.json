However, I can give you some general ideas on how to find suitable venues in your area.\n\nHere are some venue types that might interest you:\n\n1. **Private dining rooms in restaurants**: Many restaurants have private rooms that can be reserved for events. They often offer catering services, and you can work with their event coordinator to customize the menu and setup.\n2. **Community centers**: Community centers often have meeting rooms or event spaces that can be rented for private events. They might offer amenities like tables, chairs, and audio-visual equipment.\n3. **Breweries or wineries**: If you're looking for a more casual, social atmosphere, consider renting a private room at a local brewery or winery. Many offer food and drink packages, and some have outdoor spaces as well.\n4. **Event spaces**: Dedicated event spaces often offer private rooms, amenities like catering, and flexible layouts to accommodate your needs.\n\nTo find specific venues in your area, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Online search**: Use search engines like Google to look for \"private event venues near me\" or \"event spaces in [your city/region]\".\n2. **Social media**: Check out Facebook or Instagram to see if any local venues have pages or accounts where they promote their event spaces.\n3. **Review websites**: Websites like Yelp or TripAdvisor can help you find highly-rated venues in your area.\n4. **Ask for referrals**: Reach out to friends, family, or colleagues who have hosted events in the past and ask for recommendations.\n\nWhen you have a list of potential venues, be sure to contact them to inquire about:\n\n* Availability on your preferred date\n* Room capacity and layout\n* Catering options and pricing\n* Audio-visual equipment and technical support\n* Parking and accessibility\n* Any other amenities or services they offer\n\nRemember to check their websites or visit the venues in person to get a sense of the atmosphere and ensure it fits your vision for the college reunion.\n\nGood luck with your planning, and I hope you have a fantastic reunion!",
