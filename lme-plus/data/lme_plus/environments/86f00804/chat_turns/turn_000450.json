Moroccan-inspired accents are always a great addition to any space.\n\nFor ambient lighting, you'll want to consider lamps that not only provide warm, soft light but also complement your blue-gray color scheme and Moroccan-inspired rug. Here are some lamp style suggestions that might fit the bill:\n\n1. **Brass or Copper Accented Lamps**: Metallic accents in brass or copper can add a warm, exotic touch to your space, echoing the Moroccan inspiration. Look for lamps with a subtle patina or a distressed finish to add depth.\n2. **Glass Table Lamps with a Soft Blue or Gray Hue**: A glass lamp with a soft blue or gray tint can help tie in your color scheme. You can opt for a simple, cylindrical shape or a more ornate, Moroccan-inspired design.\n3. **Woven or Rattan Table Lamps**: Natural materials like woven rattan or wicker can bring a cozy, organic feel to your space. Look for lamps with a soft, warm finish that complements your rug's blue and gray tones.\n4. **Moroccan-Inspired Lantern-Style Lamps**: A lantern-style lamp with intricate metalwork or a beautiful tile pattern can add a touch of Moroccan flair to your room. You can place it on a side table or hang it from the ceiling as a pendant light.\n5. **Soft-Shaded Floor Lamps**: A floor lamp with a soft, linen or silk shade in a light gray or beige tone can provide warm, ambient light without overpowering your color scheme. Look for a lamp with a slender profile to avoid overwhelming the space.\n\nWhen choosing a lamp, consider the following factors:\n\n* Scale: Ensure the lamp is proportional to your furniture and the room's size.\n* Material: Balance the materials in your room by mixing and matching different textures, such as wood, metal, glass, or natural fibers.\n* Lighting direction: Decide whether you want the light to be directed downward (e.g., a table lamp) or upward (e.g., a floor lamp with an upward-facing shade).\n* Dimmability: Consider lamps with dimmer switches to adjust the light level to your liking.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different lamp styles and placements to find the perfect combination that complements your beautiful Moroccan-inspired rug and blue-gray color scheme.",
