Food is a great topic to discuss, and it's even better when you get personalized recommendations from a local.\n\nI'm sure you appreciated the tips on restaurants in the city. There's nothing like getting insider knowledge from someone who knows the area well. Did you end up trying any of the restaurants Alex recommended?\n\nIt's also lovely that you had a chance to connect with Alex on a personal level. Sometimes, those brief conversations with strangers can make a big difference in our day. It's a great reminder to be open, friendly, and engaging, even in brief interactions.\n\nI hope you have a great trip, and who knows, maybe you'll have another pleasant conversation with an Uber driver on your way back!",
