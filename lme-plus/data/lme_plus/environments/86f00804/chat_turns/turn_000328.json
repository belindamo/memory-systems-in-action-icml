  "content": "Monterey Jack is a classic choice for fajitas, and shredding it will help it melt beautifully.\n\nNow, about sour cream: both regular and low-fat versions will work well in your One-Pot Chicken Fajitas. The choice ultimately comes down to personal preference and your guests' dietary needs. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Regular Sour Cream:**\n\n* Has a richer, creamier flavor and texture\n* Will add a more indulgent, comforting element to your fajitas\n* May be a better choice if you're looking for a more traditional, authentic fajita flavor\n\n**Low-Fat Sour Cream:**\n\n* Has fewer calories and less fat compared to regular sour cream\n* Still offers a tangy, creamy flavor, but with a lighter texture\n* A good option if you're watching calories or catering to guests with dietary restrictions\n\nIf you're unsure, you could also consider a middle ground: a reduced-fat sour cream that offers a balance between flavor and nutrition.\n\nIn terms of brands, you can't go wrong with popular options like:\n\n* Daisy\n* Breakstone's\n* Kraft\n* Organic or store-brand options (if you prefer)\n\nWhen it comes to sour cream, the quality of the brand doesn't dramatically affect the flavor. However, if you're looking for an organic or non-GMO option, be sure to check the labels.\n\nRemember, sour cream is an optional topping, so feel free to offer both regular and low-fat versions if you have guests with different preferences. You can also consider other toppings like diced onions, cilantro, or salsa to give your guests more options.\n\nNow that we've covered the essentials, I think you're all set to make some delicious One-Pot Chicken Fajitas!
