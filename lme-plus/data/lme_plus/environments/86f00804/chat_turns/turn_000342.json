The examples you mentioned are perfect:\n\n* \"Find someone who went to the same fraternity/sorority as you\"\n* \"Find someone who took the same favorite class as you\"\n* \"Find someone who worked at the same campus job as you\"\n* \"Find someone who lived in the same dorm as you\"\n* \"Find someone who attended the same campus event (e.g., concert, play, etc.) as you\"\n\nYou could also consider adding items that are specific to your college or university, such as:\n\n* \"Find someone who has a photo with the college mascot\"\n* \"Find someone who has a favorite spot on campus (e.g., a specific bench, a hidden garden, etc.)\"\n* \"Find someone who has a favorite college tradition (e.g., a particular event, a specific food, etc.)\"\n\nTo make it even more challenging and fun, you could add some creative twists, such as:\n\n* \"Take a photo with someone who has the same college major as you\"\n* \"Get a signature from someone who was in the same club or organization as you\"\n* \"Find someone who has a similar college-era memorabilia (e.g., a t-shirt, a pin, etc.)\"\n\nRemember to keep the items achievable and fun, and make sure they don't require too much effort or discomfort for the participants. You want everyone to have a good time and enjoy the experience!\n\nYou could also consider offering small prizes or recognition for the winners, such as a \"Scavenger Hunt Champion\" title or a small gift related to your college or university.\n\nI hope this helps you create a fantastic scavenger hunt for your college reunion!",
