  "content": "That's a great question. I think one of the most significant changes I've seen in the industry is the shift towards digital marketing and e-commerce. When I first started, our company was still heavily focused on traditional marketing channels like print and TV ads, but now we're seeing a huge emphasis on social media, influencer marketing, and online advertising. It's been a big adjustment, but it's also created a lot of new opportunities for us to reach customers in different ways.\n\nAs for the new product line, I think the most rewarding part has been seeing the positive impact it's had on our customers. We've had a lot of feedback from customers who are really passionate about sustainability and reducing waste, and they're excited to see a company like ours taking steps in that direction. It's been great to be a part of something that's making a difference, even if it's just in a small way.\n\nBy the way, I'm also curious about the industry conferences you mentioned earlier.",
