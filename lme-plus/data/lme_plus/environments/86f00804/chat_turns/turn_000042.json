I've been noticing that our company's consumer goods division has been growing rapidly, and I think it's because we've been focused on sustainability and eco-friendliness, which aligns with the trend you mentioned. I'm actually part of the team that's been working on a new product line that's made from recycled materials, and we're seeing a lot of interest from customers. By the way, I've been with the company for about 2 years and 3 months now, and I've seen a lot of changes in the industry during that time.",
