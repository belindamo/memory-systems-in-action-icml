      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but it is not necessarily essential for an athletic director to know the ins and outs of every sport in their program. However, they should have a working knowledge of the general rules, regulations, and aspects of each sport to effectively lead and support their coaches and student-athletes. Additionally, they need to have familiarity with the athletic program's goals, objectives, and competition schedules to make informed decisions and support the program's growth and development effectively. It is equally important for the athletic director to have the leadership, communication, and management skills necessary to create and sustain a positive, high-performing athletic program."
