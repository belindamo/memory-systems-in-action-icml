It's a previous pitch I wrote (as JMB's publicist) to LGBT+ writers:\n\n- Dear \\_,\n- I am writing from Decca Records (part of Universal Music), representing an exciting queer music artist with a fascinating story. \n- Jean-Michel Blais, the Canadian post-classical piano icon, speaks so powerfully about the relationship between his Tourettes, his music and his queerness.\n- He's charismatic, huge in the booming minimalist piano streaming world, and coming to London for his first UK show in March (Southbank Centre).\n- His three major releases to date have earned him a TIME album of the year nod, a Polaris prize and huge streaming numbers. His new album is the first set for the release of Decca imprint Mercury KX.\n- After Jean-Michel was diagnosed with Tourettes, he found early on that playing music helped alleviate his physical tics. The relationship between his condition and his music has remained strong. For example, he has released an album of electronic/ambient music inspired by the soundscapes his parents used to play him to calm his symptoms. He is working with a hospital in Quebec that is doing pioneering research into Tourrettes. He provides music for their fundraising and community events, drinks wine and discusses the condition with the lead researcher, and plans to host special music concerts designed to give people with Tourettes a safe space to experience music.\n- He also draws comparisons between Tourrettes, which is often framed as excessive energy that the individual must repress, and the sexual energy he had to repress as a young gay man in a Conservative rural part of Canada.\n- The new album \\_\\_aubades\\_\\_is his first ensemble record, and is named after a French \"goodbye\" morning serenade, which was inspired by a break-up just before lockdown. His Southbank show (27 March) is set (technicalities providing) to resemble a sunrise (the lights will slowly brighten and warm the stage as the show progresses).\n- The press release for the album is below, and the music and album booklet are available here.\n- Do let me know if you are interested and I can set up an interview aroundthe album launch and the Southbank show.\n- Best wishes,\n- Martin"
