      "content": "\"Hey there! I appreciate your honesty and straightforwardness in what you're looking for. I totally understand your position as a gray-asexual and demi-sexual person. A low frequency, long-term friendship with occasional cuddling benefits sounds like a unique and special connection. I respect your preference for exclusivity and being ambiamorous.\n\nI understand that you prefer to focus on one conversation at a time and may not respond immediately, and that's completely okay. I appreciate your transparency and being upfront about your communication preferences. I'll make sure to keep that in mind and won't take it personally if you don't respond right away.\n\nIf we end up having a good connection, I'd be more than happy to meet more frequently and see where it takes us. Let's see if we can make a connection that works for both of us. How about we schedule a call soon and chat more in-depth?\""

I totally get not being into hook-ups or marriage, that's not my thing either. And I'm cool with being friends with benefits, cuddling included. I'm down for more frequent meet-ups if we hit it off, but I totally understand if you need space too. No pressure.\n\nI totally relate to the struggle of being an introvert and getting exhausted quickly. I'm all for being transparent and clear, so I really appreciate the message you drafted. And don't worry, I won't overload your inbox. I'm a one-convo-at-a-time kind of guy.\n\nI'm all for calls over texts and I'm happy to turn off my notifications for this. Let's chat and see where things go!\""
