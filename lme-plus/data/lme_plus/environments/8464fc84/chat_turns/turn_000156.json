In a blender or food processor, combine tahini, soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, Gochujang (if using), garlic, and ginger. Blend until smooth.\n2. With the blender or food processor running, slowly pour in the sesame oil and water. Continue blending until the glaze is smooth and emulsified.\n3. Taste and adjust the glaze as needed. You may want to add more honey for sweetness, soy sauce for umami, or rice vinegar for brightness.\n4. Transfer the glaze to a bowl and whisk in any remaining ingredients.\n\n**Using the Sesame Glaze:**\n\n1. Brush the sesame glaze over the grilled or pan-seared pork belly or pancetta during the last minute of cooking.\n2. Toss cooked pappardelle noodles with the sesame glaze, kimchi, and scallions for a harmonious balance of flavors and textures.\n3. Use the glaze as a sauce for the dish, serving it on the side or drizzling it over the top of the noodles and pork.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* For a thicker glaze, reduce the amount of water or add more tahini.\n* For a lighter glaze, add a little more water or rice vinegar.\n* Substitute peanut butter or cashew butter for tahini for a different nutty flavor.\n* Add some grated daikon or carrot for added freshness and texture.\n* Experiment with different types of chili paste or hot sauce for varying levels of heat.\n\nThis sesame glaze is a versatile condiment that can be used in many Asian-inspired dishes, from noodle bowls to stir-fries and grilled meats.
