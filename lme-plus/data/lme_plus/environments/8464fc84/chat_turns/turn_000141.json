I'm happy to help alleviate any concerns you may have!\n\n**Endoscopy:**\n\nAn endoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to visually examine the inside of your upper digestive tract, including your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Here's what you can expect:\n\n1. **Preparation:** You'll be asked to fast for a certain period, usually 6-8 hours, before the procedure. You may also be given a mild sedative to help you relax.\n2. **Procedure:** You'll lie on your side, and the doctor will insert a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end (endoscope) through your mouth and into your esophagus. The doctor will examine the inside of your upper digestive tract and may take biopsies or remove any abnormal growths.\n3. **After the procedure:** You may feel a bit groggy from the sedative, but you'll be monitored for a short time to ensure you're okay. You may experience some bloating, gas, or discomfort, but these symptoms are usually mild and temporary.\n\n**Colonoscopy:**\n\nA colonoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to visually examine the inside of your colon (large intestine) and rectum.
