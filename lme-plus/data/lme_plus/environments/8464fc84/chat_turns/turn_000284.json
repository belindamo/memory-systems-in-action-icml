  "content": "To export all information for each product in a single column in the PrestaShop database, you can use the following SQL query:\n```\nSELECT CONCAT(id_product, ' ', description, ' ', description_short, ' ', link_rewrite, ' ', meta_description, ' ', meta_title, ' ', name) as product_info\nFROM ps_product_lang\nWHERE id_lang = 7\n```\nThis query is using the CONCAT function to combine all of the relevant columns (id\\_product, description, description\\_short, link\\_rewrite, meta\\_description, meta\\_title, and name) into a single column called \"product\\_info\".\nIt will return the single column with all the product information for all products with id\\_lang = 7 in the \"ps\\_product\\_lang\" table.\n\nPlease note that by using the concat function all the information will be in a single string, and you may want to consider splitting the information in multiple columns if you need to process it later on.",
