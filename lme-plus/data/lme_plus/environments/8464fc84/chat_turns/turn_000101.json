The Neutrogena Hydrating Facial Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid is a popular choice for combination skin, and it's great for providing long-lasting hydration without feeling heavy or greasy.\n\nHyaluronic acid is an excellent ingredient for combination skin, as it can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent humectant that attracts and retains moisture. This can help to:\n\n* Hydrate dry areas of the skin\n* Reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles\n* Improve skin elasticity and firmness\n* Soothe and calm the skin\n\nSince you're already using the Neutrogena face wash, you may want to consider using the moisturizer in the following way:\n\n1. Cleanse your face with the Neutrogena face wash\n2. Pat dry with a clean towel\n3. Apply a small amount of the Hydrating Facial Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid to your face and neck\n4. Gently massage the moisturizer into your skin until it's fully absorbed\n\nRemember to use a gentle, upward stroking motion when applying the moisturizer to help lift and firm the skin.\n\nI hope you'll enjoy using this moisturizer and see improvements in your skin's hydration and overall health!
