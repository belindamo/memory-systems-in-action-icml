The exemption is authorized by law and would not present an undue risk to public health and safety or common defense and security.\n2. Compliance with the regulation would result in a significant hardship or would have a significant adverse impact upon the continued operation of the facility.\n3. Application of the regulation in the particular circumstance would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.\n4. The exemption would provide a net safety benefit.\n5. An emergency exists that makes strict compliance with the regulation impracticable.\n6. The exemption is otherwise in the public interest.\n\nThe licensee seeking an exemption must provide adequate justification for their request, and the NRC evaluates each exemption request on a case-by-case basis, considering all relevant factors, including the potential impact on public health and safety and common defense and security.",
