What question do you want to answer?\n2. **Conduct preliminary research**: Read and gather information about your topic to get a better understanding of the subject matter.\n3. **Identify key concepts and themes**: What are the main ideas and themes related to your topic? Make a list or create a concept map to visualize the relationships between them.\n4. **Ask open-ended questions**: What are the implications of these concepts and themes? How do they relate to each other? What are the potential consequences or effects?\n5. **Make a claim or argument**: Based on your research and analysis, what claim or argument can you make about your topic? What stance can you take?\n6. **Refine your thesis statement**: Use the information gathered to craft a specific, focused, and arguable thesis statement.\n7. **Test and revise**: Evaluate your thesis statement against the criteria for a strong thesis statement (specific, arguable, relevant, etc.). Revise as needed.\n\n**Brainstorming Techniques:**\n\n1. **Freewriting**: Write down everything that comes to mind about your topic without stopping or worrying about grammar or spelling.\n2. **Mind mapping**: Create a visual map of your ideas, using circles, arrows, and keywords to connect related concepts.\n3. **Listing**: Make a list of key terms, concepts, and ideas related to your topic.\n4. **Categorizing**: Group similar ideas or concepts into categories to identify patterns or relationships.\n5. **Questioning**: Ask yourself questions about your topic, such as \"What if...\", \"How does...\", or \"What are the implications of...\".\n\n**Developing a Strong Thesis Statement:**\n\n1. **Use specific language**: Avoid vague or general terms and use specific keywords related to your topic.\n2. **Make a clear claim**: State your argument or claim clearly and concisely.\n3. **Provide context**: Give your thesis statement context by including relevant background information or setting.\n4. **Use action verbs**: Verbs like \"argues,\" \"analyzes,\" \"examines,\" or \"explores\" can help you create a more dynamic thesis statement.\n5. **Ensure relevance**: Make sure your thesis statement is relevant to your research question and topic.\n\n**Example of Brainstorming and Developing a Thesis Statement:**\n\nTopic: The impact of social media on mental health\n\nResearch question: How does social media use affect the mental health of young adults?\n\nPreliminary research: Social media use is linked to increased stress, anxiety, and depression in young adults.\n\nKey concepts and themes: Social media, mental health, young adults, stress, anxiety, depression.\n\nOpen-ended questions: What are the specific ways in which social media use contributes to mental health issues? How do social media platforms perpetuate these issues?\n\nClaim or argument: Social media use is a significant contributor to the rising rates of anxiety and depression among young adults, and platform design changes are necessary to mitigate these effects.\n\nThesis statement: \"The pervasive use of social media among young adults is a primary driver of increased anxiety and depression, and therefore, social media platforms must implement design changes to promote healthier online interactions and mitigate the negative effects on mental health.\"\n\nRemember, developing a strong thesis statement takes time and effort. Be patient, and don't be afraid to revise and refine your thesis statement as you continue to research and analyze your topic.",
