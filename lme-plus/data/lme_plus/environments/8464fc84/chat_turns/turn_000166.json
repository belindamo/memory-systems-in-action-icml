Here's what you need to know:\n\n**1. Heat level:** Gochugaru is generally hotter than regular chili flakes. While regular chili flakes can range from mildly spicy to hot, gochugaru is consistently very spicy, with a Scoville heat unit (SHU) rating of 10,000-20,000. For comparison, cayenne pepper has an SHU rating of 30,000-50,000.\n\n**2. Flavor profile:** Gochugaru has a distinct, smoky, slightly sweet, and nutty flavor, which is often described as more complex and deeper than regular chili flakes. This flavor profile is due to the type of peppers used and the way they're processed.\n\n**3. Peppers used:** Gochugaru is typically made from a specific type of Korean pepper called \"gochu\" or \"Korean red pepper.\" These peppers are smaller, more aromatic, and have a thicker flesh than other types of peppers. Regular chili flakes, on the other hand, can be made from various types of peppers, such as ancho, bell, or jalape\u00f1o.\n\n**4. Production process:** Gochugaru is usually made by drying and crushing gochu peppers, which are then sifted to remove seeds and stems. This process preserves the peppers' natural flavor and heat. Regular chili flakes, by contrast, might be made from peppers that are ground or crushed without sifting, resulting in a coarser texture and a less refined flavor.\n\n**5. Usage:** Gochugaru is often used in smaller quantities than regular chili flakes due to its intense heat and flavor. It's commonly used to add depth and heat to Korean dishes, such as kimchi, stews, soups, and sauces.\n\nWhen using gochugaru in your Korean recipes, keep the following in mind:\n\n* Start with a small amount and adjust to taste, as gochugaru can be quite potent.\n* Mix gochugaru with other ingredients, like garlic, ginger, and soy sauce, to balance its flavor and heat.\n* Store gochugaru in an airtight container to preserve its flavor and aroma.\n\nIf you can't find gochugaru at your local Asian market or online, you can substitute it with a combination of cayenne pepper and paprika. However, keep in mind that the flavor and heat will not be exactly the same.\n\nI hope this helps you in your Korean cooking adventures!",
