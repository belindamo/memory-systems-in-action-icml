I've also been meaning to clean my bag more regularly, so I'll make sure to do that too. Speaking of bags, I've been thinking about getting a smaller bag for daily errands and grocery shopping. Do you have any recommendations for a good canvas tote bag or any other type of bag that would be suitable for that purpose?",
