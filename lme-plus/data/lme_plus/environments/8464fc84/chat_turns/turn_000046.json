  "content": "I had a great time at the \"Women in Art\" exhibition at the Modern Art Museum downtown. I was particularly moved by Frida Kahlo's self-portraits and spent a good 20 minutes in front of them. I even ran into my old friend Rachel, who's an art history major, and we ended up discussing the exhibition for over an hour. It was really inspiring to see so many talented female artists featured in one place.",
