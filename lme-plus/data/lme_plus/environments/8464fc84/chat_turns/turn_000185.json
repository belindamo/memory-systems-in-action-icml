And yeah, cleaning the mirrors was a long overdue task, but it feels great to have them sparkling clean again. The glass cleaner I used was really effective, I'll have to remember to order more from Amazon when I need it again. Thanks for chatting with me, it was helpful to get some advice and reminders on a few things I needed to tackle!",
