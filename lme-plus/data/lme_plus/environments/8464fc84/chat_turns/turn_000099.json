  "content": "With combination skin, acne, and hyperpigmentation concerns, I'd recommend a moisturizer that:\n\n1. Balances hydration and oil control\n2. Fights acne-causing bacteria and inflammation\n3. Addresses hyperpigmentation with brightening and antioxidant properties\n4. Is lightweight and non-greasy to avoid clogging pores\n\nHere are some moisturizer suggestions within your budget of $15-$25:\n\n1. **Neutrogena Hydrating Facial Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid** ($17): This moisturizer is a great option since you're already using Neutrogena face wash. It contains hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, and green tea extract to provide long-lasting hydration, soothe, and protect your skin.\n2. ** Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Acid** ($19): This lightweight, oil-free moisturizer contains salicylic acid to help unclog pores, reduce acne, and improve skin texture. It's also formulated with antioxidants and has a gentle, non-irritating pH.\n3. **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid** ($20): This moisturizer is designed for sensitive, acne-prone skin. It's lightweight, non-comedogenic, and contains caffeine to reduce puffiness and antioxidants to protect against environmental stressors.\n4. **Dermalogica Daily Moisturizing Cream** ($22): This rich-yet-lightweight moisturizer contains a blend of antioxidants, peptides, and vitamins to address hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and dryness. It's also formulated with tea tree oil to help control acne.\n5. **EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46** ($25): This moisturizer provides broad-spectrum sun protection, which is essential for preventing further hyperpigmentation. It's lightweight, non-comedogenic, and contains antioxidants to help reduce inflammation.\n\nThese options should provide a good starting point. Remember to always patch test a new moisturizer on a small area of your skin before using it on your face to ensure you don't have any adverse reactions.\n\nDo any of these options stand out to you, or would you like me to suggest a few more options?",
