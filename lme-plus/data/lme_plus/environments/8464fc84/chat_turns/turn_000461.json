That's a great start!\n\nCreating content that resonates with your audience is crucial to increasing social media engagement. Here are some tips to help you craft content that resonates with your audience:\n\n1. **Know your audience**: Understand who your target audience is, what they're interested in, and what problems they're trying to solve. Create buyer personas to help you tailor your content to their needs.\n2. **Be authentic and relatable**: Share your personal experiences, stories, and opinions. Be transparent and vulnerable to build trust and connection with your audience.\n3. **Focus on quality over quantity**: Instead of churning out mediocre content frequently, focus on creating high-quality, well-researched, and engaging content that adds value to your audience.\n4. **Use attention-grabbing headlines and thumbnails**: Craft headlines and thumbnails that are informative, entertaining, or thought-provoking. This will encourage people to click on your content and engage with it.\n5. **Keep it concise and scannable**: Break up long blocks of text into shorter paragraphs, use bullet points, and add visuals to make your content easy to consume.\n6. **Encourage engagement**: End your content with a question, ask for feedback, or request that viewers share their own experiences. This will encourage audience participation and foster a sense of community.\n7. **Use emotional connections**: Appeal to your audience's emotions by sharing inspiring stories, humor, or relatable moments. This will help create a deeper connection with your audience.\n8. **Optimize for SEO**: Ensure your content is optimized for search engines by using relevant keywords, meta descriptions, and optimizing images.\n9. **Repurpose and update content**: Breathe new life into old content by repurposing it into different formats (e.g., turning a blog post into a video or social media post). Update outdated content to keep it relevant and fresh.\n10. **Analyze and adjust**: Monitor your analytics to see what's working and what's not. Adjust your content strategy based on the data to improve engagement and reach.\n\nRegarding your YouTube video, 100 views within the first 24 hours is a good start, but to increase engagement and views, consider the following:\n\n* **Promote your video**: Share your video on social media platforms, forums, and relevant online communities.\n* **Optimize your video title, description, and tags**: Ensure your video title, description, and tags are accurate, informative, and relevant to your content.\n* **Use eye-catching thumbnails**: Create thumbnails that grab attention and accurately represent your content.\n* **Engage with your audience**: Respond to comments, ask for feedback, and encourage viewers to subscribe and share your video with others.\n* **Collaborate with other creators**: Partner with other YouTubers or influencers in your niche to reach a broader audience.\n\nRemember, building an audience and increasing engagement takes time and effort. Focus on creating high-quality content that resonates with your audience, and with persistence and consistency, you'll see improvement over time.",
