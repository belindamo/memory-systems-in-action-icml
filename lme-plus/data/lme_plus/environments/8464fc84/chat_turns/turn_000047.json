Her artwork is truly powerful and emotive, and it's no surprise that you spent 20 minutes contemplating her pieces.\n\nIt's also wonderful that you ran into your friend Rachel, an art history major, and had a great conversation about the exhibition. Discussing art with someone who shares your passion can be so enriching and inspiring. I'm sure you both appreciated the opportunity to explore the exhibition together and share your thoughts and insights.\n\nThe \"Women in Art\" exhibition is indeed a celebration of talented female artists, and it's essential to recognize and appreciate their contributions to the art world. It's exhibitions like these that help to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the art industry.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what was it about Frida Kahlo's self-portraits that resonated with you the most? Was there a particular piece that stood out to you, or was it the overall theme and message of her artwork that struck a chord?",
