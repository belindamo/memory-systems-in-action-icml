  "content": "I forgot to mention that I volunteered at the local animal shelter's charity walk on April 17th, which was a 5K walk around the city park. I registered for the event a month in advance and managed to raise $250 in donations from friends and family. On the day of the event, I arrived at 7:30 am to help set up and was assigned to the registration desk. I ended up checking in over 50 participants and handing out t-shirts and bibs. After the walk, I helped serve refreshments and clean up. It was a really rewarding experience and I got to meet some amazing people who are passionate about animal welfare.",
