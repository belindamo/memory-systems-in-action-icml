Since you'll be driving a 2015 Honda Civic, which has a good fuel economy, you should be able to keep your fuel costs reasonable.\n\nAssuming you'll be driving around 590 miles (949 km) on your scenic route, and using the fuel economy estimates I provided earlier (30-35 MPG), here's a rough breakdown of your fuel costs:\n\n* Total fuel consumption: approximately 16-20 gallons (60-75 liters)\n* Fuel cost: around $56-$70, assuming an average gas price of $3.50 per gallon\n\nThis estimate is lower than your budget of $100-$120, but keep in mind that this is just a rough calculation. Fuel prices can vary significantly depending on the region, time of year, and other factors.\n\nTo stay within your budget, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Fuel up at cost-effective stations**: Use apps like GasBuddy or Waze to find the cheapest gas stations along your route.\n2. **Drive efficiently**: Maintain a consistent speed, avoid rapid acceleration, and use cruise control on the highway to optimize your fuel economy.\n3. **Avoid idling**: If you're going to be stopped for more than 30 seconds, turn off your engine to save fuel and reduce emissions.\n4. **Pack snacks and avoid unnecessary stops**: Fewer stops mean less fuel consumption and lower costs.\n5. **Consider fuel-efficient driving modes**: Many modern cars, including the Honda Civic, have fuel-saving modes that can help you optimize your fuel economy.\n\nBy following these tips and keeping an eye on your fuel consumption, you should be able to stay within your budget of $100-$120. However, it's always a good idea to pad your budget by 10-20% to account for any unexpected expenses or changes in fuel prices.\n\nHow do you feel about these estimates and tips? Is there anything else you'd like to know or discuss?",
