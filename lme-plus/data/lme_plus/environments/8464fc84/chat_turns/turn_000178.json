Here are some tips to help you reduce the likelihood of clogs in your sink:\n\n1. **Be mindful of what you put down the drain**: Avoid pouring grease, oil, or food scraps down the drain, as they can solidify and cause blockages. Instead, dispose of them in the trash or recycling.\n2. **Use a drain screen or filter**: Installing a drain screen or filter can catch hair and other debris before they go down the drain. You can find these at most hardware stores or home improvement stores.\n3. **Don't wash large amounts of hair down the drain**: As you mentioned, washing your hair in the sink can contribute to clogs. Try to minimize the amount of hair that goes down the drain by using a drain screen or filter, or by wiping out excess hair from your brush or comb before washing it.\n4. **Use a gentle shampoo**: Using a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo can help reduce the amount of residue and soap scum that can build up in your pipes.\n5. **Run hot water regularly**: Running hot water through your sink drain on a regular basis can help dissolve and flush out any soap scum, grease, or other debris that might be building up.\n6. **Consider using a drain maintenance product**: There are many products on the market that are designed to help maintain your drains and prevent clogs. These products typically contain natural enzymes that break down organic matter and help keep your pipes flowing freely.\n7. **Don't overuse harsh chemicals**: While it might be tempting to use harsh chemicals to clear a clog, these can actually damage your pipes and cause more harm in the long run. Instead, stick to natural methods or gentle cleaning products.\n8. **Clean your sink drain regularly**: Regularly cleaning your sink drain with a gentle cleanser or baking soda and vinegar can help prevent clogs from forming.\n\nBy following these tips, you can reduce the likelihood of clogs and keep your sink drains flowing freely.\n\nRemember, prevention is key!",
