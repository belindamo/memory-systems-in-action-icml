  "content": "The members of the General, Housing, and Military Affairs Committee (GHMA) are legislators who are elected by Vermont citizens and who are expected to have knowledge and expertise in a variety of areas related to general affairs, housing, and military affairs. \n\nBefore being assigned to the GHMA committee, members have often served on other committees within the Vermont House of Representatives and have gained experience and knowledge about a specific area of concern. For example, a representative who has served on the Commerce and Economic Development Committee may have expertise in small business development, which could inform their decision-making when considering bills related to housing and homelessness prevention.\n\nIn addition, committee members often draw upon the expertise and experiences of outside organizations, experts, and constituents to inform their decision-making process. Public hearings are held for many bills, which allow committee members to hear from a diverse group of stakeholders and to consider various viewpoints before making a decision.\n\nWhile having one committee that oversees such different and broad topics may not be a perfect solution, the GHMA committee has been functioning effectively for many years and has had success in addressing important issues facing Vermont citizens.",
