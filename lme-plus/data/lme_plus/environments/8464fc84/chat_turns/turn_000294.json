Most of the souvenir shops offer a wide range of religious-themed souvenirs, including statues, rosaries, crosses, and other decorative pieces. Additionally, you can find souvenirs of the Vatican, including postcards, books, and prints of famous artworks, such as The Last Judgment by Michelangelo. Keep in mind that some of these shops can be quite touristy and may have higher prices than shops outside the Vatican walls, so be sure to shop around and compare prices before making your purchase.",
