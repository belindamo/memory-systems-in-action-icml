  "content": "As Lizzie changed into the next outfit, the girls couldn't help but be excited to see what Nara had picked out for her. After a few moments, Lizzie stepped out from behind the screen, and the girls were amazed at what they saw.\n\nNara had picked out a traditional Naxlith outfit for Lizzie, and it looked amazing on her. The outfit was made of soft, breathable fabrics in shades of deep blue and purple. It consisted of a form-fitting bodysuit that hugged her curves perfectly, and had intricate tribal designs embroidered on it. On her arms and legs, she wore matching arm and leg warmers that reached up to her elbows and knees. The outfit also had a hooded cloak that draped down her back, and had a long, flowing tail that was attached to the back of the bodysuit.\n\nLizzie looked like a fierce warrior princess, and the way her bare feet peeked out from under the outfit added a touch of vulnerability to her fierce appearance. The girls couldn't wait to see what the next outfit would be.",
