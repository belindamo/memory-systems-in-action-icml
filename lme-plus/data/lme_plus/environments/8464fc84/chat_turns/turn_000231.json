  "content": "I was thinking of offering a 10% discount for customers who buy 3 or more jars of different flavors. I've noticed that customers like Sarah, who's been using my strawberry jam as a topping for her yogurt, tend to come back for more and try out new flavors. I want to encourage more customers to do the same. Also, I've been working on designing some seasonal labels and packaging to make my products more appealing as gifts. Do you think I should highlight the gift-giving potential of my products in my promotional materials?",
