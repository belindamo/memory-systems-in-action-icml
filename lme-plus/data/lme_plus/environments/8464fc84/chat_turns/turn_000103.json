I'd be happy to help you optimize your storage and make your morning routine more efficient.\n\nHere are some tips to help you organize your skincare products by category and create a functional bathroom cabinet:\n\n1. **Categorize your products**: Group your skincare products into categories, such as:\n\t* Cleansers\n\t* Toners\n\t* Exfoliants\n\t* Essences\n\t* Serums\n\t* Moisturizers\n\t* Eye care\n\t* Masks\n\t* Tools (e.g., cotton pads, tweezers, etc.)\n2. **Assign a home for each category**: Designate a specific shelf, basket, or container for each category. This will make it easy to find what you need and prevent clutter from building up.\n3. **Use vertical space**: Maximize your cabinet's vertical space by using stackable shelves, baskets, or turntables. This will help keep products off the countertops and make the most of your storage space.\n4. **Store frequently used products front and center**: Place your daily essentials, like your face wash, moisturizer, and sunscreen, in an easy-to-reach location, such as the top shelf or in a convenient basket.\n5. **Keep similar products together**: Store products that are used in a specific routine (e.g., morning or nighttime) together. For example, keep your morning products, like cleanser and moisturizer, together, and your nighttime products, like serums and eye creams, together.\n6. **Label and sign your categories**: Use labels or stickers to identify each category, and consider adding a sign or a chart to remind you of your skincare routine and the products you need to use.\n7. **Store products by size**: Place smaller products, like sample sizes or travel-sized items, in a separate area or container to prevent them from getting lost among larger products.\n8. **Keep it tidy**: Set aside some time each week to tidy up your bathroom cabinet and ensure everything is in its assigned home. This will help maintain your organization system and prevent clutter from building up again.\n\nSome popular storage solutions for bathroom cabinets include:\n\n* Stackable shelves or baskets\n* Turntables or lazy susans\n* Adhesive hooks for hanging items like towels or bags\n* Drawer dividers or inserts\n* Tiered storage containers\n* Over-the-door storage racks\n\nRemember to measure your cabinet space before purchasing any storage solutions to ensure they fit comfortably.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a functional and organized bathroom cabinet that makes your morning skincare routine a breeze!",
