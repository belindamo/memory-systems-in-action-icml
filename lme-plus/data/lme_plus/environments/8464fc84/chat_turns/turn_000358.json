Here are some tips to help you structure and price your workshop:\n\n**Structuring the Workshop:**\n\n1. **Define the objectives**: Determine what students will learn and take away from the workshop. Will it be a beginner's introduction to soap-making or an advanced class on specific techniques?\n2. **Choose a format**: Decide on the workshop format: hands-on, demonstration, or a combination of both. Consider the guild's workspace and equipment limitations.\n3. **Set a duration**: Determine the length of the workshop, considering the complexity of the project and the attention span of your students. Typically, 2-4 hours is a good duration.\n4. **Plan the agenda**: Create a detailed agenda, including setup, introduction, instruction, hands-on time, and Q&A.\n5. **Prepare materials and equipment**: Ensure you have all necessary materials and equipment, including soap-making supplies, protective gear, and workspace essentials.\n6. **Limit the number of students**: To ensure a good student-to-instructor ratio, limit the number of students to 6-12, depending on the workshop format and guild's workspace.\n\n**Pricing the Workshop:**\n\n1. **Calculate costs**: Factor in costs such as materials, equipment, workspace rental, and your time (including preparation, instruction, and cleanup).\n2. **Research the market**: Check what similar workshops are charging in your area to ensure your pricing is competitive.\n3. **Consider the value proposition**: Price your workshop based on the value it provides to students, including the skills and knowledge they'll gain, and the quality of the experience.\n4. **Tiered pricing**: Offer different pricing tiers, such as:\n\t* Early bird discount for early registrations\n\t* Member discount for guild members\n\t* Non-member pricing for non-guild members\n5. **Add-ons and extras**: Consider offering additional services or products, like a soap-making kit or private consultation, to increase revenue.\n\n**Pricing Guidelines:**\n\n* Beginner soap-making workshop (2-3 hours): $50-$100\n* Intermediate soap-making workshop (3-4 hours): $75-$150\n* Advanced soap-making workshop (4-6 hours): $100-$250\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Partner with the guild**: Discuss with the guild how they can support your workshop, such as promoting it to their members or providing a discounted workspace rental.\n* **Offer private workshops**: Consider offering private workshops for individuals or small groups, which can command a higher price.\n* **Create a series**: Develop a series of workshops, each focusing on a specific aspect of soap-making, to encourage repeat business and build a loyal following.\n* **Follow-up and feedback**: Encourage students to provide feedback and consider offering follow-up workshops or one-on-one consultations to help them continue learning and improving.\n\nBy structuring and pricing your workshop thoughtfully, you'll create a valuable experience for your students and generate a profitable revenue stream for your business. Good luck!",
