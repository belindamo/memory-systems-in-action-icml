  "content": "To select all images (both the main image and additional images) for all products in the PrestaShop database, you can use the following SQL query:\n```\nSELECT p.id_product, i.id_image, i.position FROM ps_product p\nINNER JOIN ps_image i ON p.id_product = i.id_product\nORDER BY p.id_product, i.position;\n```\nThis query uses an INNER JOIN to combine the data from the \"ps\\_product\" table (where the product IDs are stored) and the \"ps\\_image\" table (where the image information is stored). The query will return the product ID, image ID, and position of each image for all products in the database, ordered by product ID and then by image position.",
