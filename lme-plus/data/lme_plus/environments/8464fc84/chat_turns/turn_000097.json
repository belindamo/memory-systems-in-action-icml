  "content": "I'd be happy to help you find a moisturizer that pairs well with your Neutrogena face wash.\n\nTo give you a more personalized recommendation, can you please tell me a bit more about your skin type and concerns? For example:\n\n1. What is your skin type (normal, dry, oily, combination, sensitive, acne-prone)?\n2. Do you have any specific skin concerns (acne, hyperpigmentation, fine lines, dehydration, redness)?\n3. Do you prefer a lightweight, non-greasy moisturizer or something more rich and nourishing?\n4. Are you looking for a moisturizer with specific ingredients (e.g. hyaluronic acid, retinol, vitamin C, SPF)?\n5. Is there a particular price range you're comfortable with?\n\nThe Neutrogena face wash you're using is a gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser, so I'll assume you're looking for a moisturizer that complements its gentle, non-irritating properties.\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your skin type and concerns, I can suggest some moisturizers that would work well with your current face wash routine.",
