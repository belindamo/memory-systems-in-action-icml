It's a fun and unique way to pay homage to the moment that started it all. It's a special memory that's personal to your relationship, and it adds a lovely layer of depth to your playlist.\n\nHowever, I do understand your concern about whether it fits with the overall vibe of your wedding. To make it work, you could consider a few things:\n\n1. **Choose a song that fits the tone:** If the song from your cousin's wedding is a fun, upbeat track, it might fit perfectly into your playlist. If it's a slower or more somber song, it might not fit as well with the overall vibe of your wedding.\n2. **Consider the flow:** Think about the flow of your playlist and where you want to place the song. You might want to place it towards the beginning of the \"Our Story\" segment, as a fun and lighthearted way to set the tone.\n3. **Make it a surprise:** You could surprise your guests by including the song in your playlist without announcing it. This way, it's a fun little Easter egg for your guests who were at your cousin's wedding, and it adds an element of surprise to the playlist.\n\nUltimately, it's your wedding, and you should include the songs that are meaningful to you and your fianc\u00e9. If the song from your cousin's wedding is a special memory for you both, it's worth including it in your playlist.\n\nRemember to communicate with your DJ or emcee about the song and its significance, so they can help you incorporate it into the playlist in a way that feels natural and fun.",
