  "content": "I think I'll use a simple 0-10 scale to track my energy levels, where 0 is \"extremely fatigued\" and 10 is \"full of energy\". For muscle strength, I'll track my ability to perform daily activities and exercise tolerance. I'll log this information in Sympto along with my temperature and other symptoms. It'll be helpful to have all this information in one place.\n\nBy the way, I'm a bit concerned about my upcoming endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures. I've never had them before, and I'm not sure what to expect. Can you provide some general information about what I should expect during and after the procedures?",
