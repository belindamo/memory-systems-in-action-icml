  "content": "Lizzie was handed a box by Zara, and then retreated behind the screen again. as she did, Alyssa explained that due to how hybrid's feet have an unnatural durability that allows hybrids to be barefoot everywhere. hybrids can't do any permanent damage to their feet. For instance, If one stepped on something sharp, it'd hurt for a moment or two, but it wouldn't be able to break the skin, so their feet couldn't be cut, or damaged, in any way. due to this, they prefer to be barefoot no matter what.\n\nas she explained that, Lizzie stepped out from behind the screen in Zara's outfit. It was a beautiful, traditional Farisian outfit, made of soft, silky fabrics in shades of orange and gold. The outfit consisted of a long, flowing skirt that reached down to her ankles, and a matching top that was adorned with intricate embroidery and beading. The top had a low cut neckline, and had a long, flowing cape that draped down her back. On her head, she wore a delicate, gold-plated headpiece that was adorned with small, sparkling jewels.\n\nLizzie did a little twirl, and the way her bare feet, and adorable toes peeked out from under the skirt was just too cute.\n\n(do not skip any further, just leave a Segway to the next outfit at the end of the prompt, but don't skip over anything.)",
