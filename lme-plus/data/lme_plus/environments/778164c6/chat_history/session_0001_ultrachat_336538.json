      "content": "The painting The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh does not have a clear and universally accepted symbolic meaning in terms of the artist's personal life. However, some art historians and scholars have suggested that the swirling and turbulent sky in the painting represents the turmoil and mental anguish that van Gogh experienced throughout his life. The dark colors and swirling clouds in the painting may also be interpreted as a reflection of his loneliness and isolation, as he struggled with mental illness and social ostracism. Ultimately, the meaning of the painting remains open to interpretation, and it may hold different significance for different viewers."
