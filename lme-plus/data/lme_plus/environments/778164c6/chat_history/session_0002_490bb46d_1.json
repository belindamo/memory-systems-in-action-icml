      "content": "Concert enthusiast! I totally understand the excitement of scoring tickets to your favorite artist's show! I'm happy to help you explore ways to save money on concert tickets. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Official Ticket Sources**: Always try to buy tickets directly from the official ticketing websites, such as Ticketmaster, AXS, or the venue's website. These sites often don't charge extra fees like resale websites do.\n2. **Presale Opportunities**: Sign up for the artist's fan club, follow them on social media, or join their email list to get access to presale tickets, which can be cheaper than general sale tickets.\n3. **Early Bird Discounts**: Keep an eye out for early bird discounts or promotional offers, which may be available for a limited time.\n4. **Ticket Lotteries**: Some artists or festivals offer ticket lotteries, where you can enter to win tickets at face value or even for free.\n5. **Secondary Marketplaces**: If you do need to use a resale website, consider using sites like StubHub, SeatGeek, or Vivid Seats, which often have a wider selection and more competitive prices. Be cautious of fake tickets and make sure to read reviews before making a purchase.\n6. **Bundle Deals**: Look for bundle deals that include tickets, merchandise, or experiences, which can sometimes be cheaper than buying individual tickets.\n7. **Consider Upper-Level Seats**: If you're not particular about being close to the stage, upper-level seats can be a more affordable option.\n8. **Avoid Service Fees**: Some ticketing websites, like Ticketmaster, offer a \"no service fee\" option if you purchase tickets at the venue's box office or at a participating retail outlet.\n9. **Follow Local Radio Stations**: Keep an ear out for local radio stations giving away tickets or offering exclusive presale codes.\n10. **Be Flexible**: Be open to attending concerts on weeknights or during off-peak seasons, when ticket prices might be lower.\n11. **Use Cashback Apps**: Use cashback apps like Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates) or TopCashback, which offer a percentage of your ticket purchase back as cash or credit.\n12. **Student or Military Discounts**: If you're a student or military personnel, check if the venue or artist offers special discounts.\n\nIn your case, paying $120 for a ticket from a resale website might not be the best deal. For future concerts, try exploring these options to see if you can score tickets at a lower price.\n\nRemember, always be cautious when buying tickets from third-party sellers, and make sure to research the seller's reputation and reviews before making a purchase. Happy concert-going!"
