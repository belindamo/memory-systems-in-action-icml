      "content": "now this: so that kind of always brings me to this one thought and this was before i was ever a personal trainer into nutrition i was watching some show i don't know if it was national geographic or what it was but they were cave diving and they found some ancient skeleton in there of a female and they thought she was like 17 years old but they noted that they were able to see how hard she worked because of her bone density because it was very apparent that she had obviously been lifting lots of heavy things and like and stuff like that because her bone\n36:56\ndensity was her bones were super thick and they were they were they made a great note of that and i always for some reason that's filed in my brain because i was like wow this girl was i know more obviously now but this girl was lifting these heavy things and her bone responded to that another another example of that is i've been in dentistry for 13 years and people when they grind and clench their teeth a lot they grow tori and and buckle excess toe ex ptosis and all sorts of fun things like that which is all\n37:30\nbone growth in response to constant pressure on that area so all of a sudden all these things started coming together in my brain as like okay you place stress on this it's going to grow it's going to strengthen not only your muscle it's going to strengthen your bone as well exactly perfect so and it also means that if you're starting you ought to kind of go bit gradual yeah because you can you can injure it if you try to go too fast because there is a there's a remodeling process that occurs so while we're on this\n38:08\nlittle subject here i'd love to get some information from you as far as how you feel about blood flow restriction training or occlusion training do you are you on that bandwagon off of it what are your thoughts i'm on it i do it i like it i do it two days a week um and it's funny because i get when i do it i get stronger i mean it really it within a couple weeks i see change you know you're adding five more pounds like it's it's it's uh it's very interesting i you know and then i noticed i i\n38:47\nstopped doing it for a while my house is being remodeled and my my exercise room got sort of messed up and i and i i didn't do it for a while and i actually lost some strength and it was like you know i used to be able to do like five pounds more on my dumbbell my dumbbell presses and i don't know it's not there and then i i just started this week i put the bands back on and i'm using it and it's like oh you know you can feel it it's uh i i really like it i think it's i think it's great\n39:18\nespecially possibly for people that are intimidated by going into the weight room and lifting or or maybe they're at a more aged state where they can't tolerate that kind of exercise i know there's been a lot of studies out there backing up blood flow restriction in older people and elderly populations to prevent sarcopenia which is the loss of muscle right and they don't have to do heavy weights that's the other thing you know like i'm trying to to do heavier weights but you don't have to do heavy weights and\n39:54\nyou do more reps once you get that muscle hypoxic you know you you stress it enough so that with the blood flow restriction that muscle is needing oxygen you can do it with 10 pounds you don't have to do it with 35 or 40 pounds and you will get a training effect so older people who don't have big strength and who don't even want to do it they can use their little dumbbells and do the thing and if the restriction is there they will get a response that's what i told like i'm like hey grandma you can\n40:25\nput these on and grab a soup can and just you know move your arm up and down and you could get results from that the the hormone release even is an incredible thing for people yeah yeah so no i think it's brilliant work and i i i i've been into it for a while and i really like it awesome so tell us actually let me remind here just a moment so i will say this i started using your guys's product and it's kind of a little coincidence i started using your guys's product and i noticed almost immediately\n40:59\nprobably within a week that my recovery was a lot better and i do load it more than your recommended well you have a recommended dose for people that aren't athletes i think on there or something like that and then a higher dose for people that are putting their body under strain so i was going for the higher dose and i noticed almost within a week or so that i started to recover a lot better so then i i was like okay i'm gonna tell my friend about this uh because she could maybe utilize it or whatever and uh\n41:32\ni actually think maybe you guys released it on um oh what is it uh full script did you put it on full script yes we did okay that's why so she does full script and i was like hey and i'm pretty sure you can get it on full script so you should check it out and she was like oh okay let me look send me a picture of it or whatever and i sent her a picture and she was like oh i've been taking this forever it improves my workout so much and all this stuff and i was like okay good it's not just a placebo effect i know\n42:00\nthat this is actually something that's legit so uh i i do have to say that i have i'm i'm i'm kind of a supplement snob i don't take a lot of supplements um i have a couple that i do take and i incorporated yours in and i was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it was really great so you definitely hooked me on it good you know the other thing is we just we we have a relatively new product which is our electrolytes and we've put in per scoop of electrolytes so it's a mixture of sodium\n42:31\npotassium rather high potassium for most electrolyte mixtures zinc magnesium and a whole bunch of trace elements but we put two grams of perfect amino per scoop and this has been for athletes the feedback from the athletes especially if there's a lot of sweating or if they're doing aerobic exercise this product is incredible and i if if you haven't tried it uh we should have you try it and um it's really it is really good like like regular electrolytes are fine and you need it if you're sweating a lot but\n43:04\nwhen you put some amino acids in there there is a difference there's a there is the body just is like stronger i feel it mentally too like when you're tired you can hold your concentration um it's also a great it's a it's i just recommend it really well the feedback on it is terrific that's awesome i love that i'll have to um get myself some more of that stuff because i did have a little bit of it and i was using it and then i ran out so i need to i need to do that but anyway yeah so i i am i am happy to share with\n43:39\nmy listeners though i have tried your product i have had a good experience with your product and so i definitely am on the train of your amino acid thoughts there so yeah thank you um but yeah so um before we run out of time here i just wanted to talk a little bit more about you yourself your training i mean you're you're you're a master's competitor obviously uh and you're still out there rocking it you just said you were training for races right now so what does your training look like and how has it\n44:11\nchanged over the years i'm busier now with sort of practice and business than i ever have been so i probably have a 60 hour work week um so i used to be able to i used to like between 20 and 22 hours a week would be good for iron man training uh i can't do it now i don't have enough time so i usually get a long day sunday what what i do right now is saturday morning i'm about five miles from the ocean or from the gulf from where i am so i will warm up and then i'll do a bike ride it's a it's a junk heavy bike because at\n44:52\nthe beach it'll get stolen so it's an ugly bike no one would take it so i i get on that bike and i ride the five miles and there's a there's a bridge in between that's you i would call it a mountain but i've been to coeur d'alene and i know what mountains are but around in florida a mountain is a bridge that goes over some water so it's probably three percent grade for maybe a quarter mile so but that's the best we've got so anyway i ride to the beach and once once i warm it up i go as hard as i can\n45:26\ni then uh i'll i'll swim between 2 000 and 4 000 yards it depends on where i am so that's a that's an open water swim and then i'll run between 8 and 15 miles and then i'll ride the bike back home easy so that's my saturday and then sunday i'll do a 40 to 90 mile ride depending on the on the day you know depending on what i'm doing like now i'm starting to ramp up so tomorrow so this sunday i'll probably ride 70 or 75 miles um during the week i usually take um mondays off and uh tuesday and thursday\n46:05\ni'll do a pool swim workout i was doing masters but the masters is the pools are all sort of crazy you can't get in the locker rooms and so i'm just doing it on my own and uh tuesday and thursday i'll do an indoor bike interval workout on a trainer um i'll do rovi or i'll do one of the workouts i have a i have a wahoo uh kicker and i'll i'll do that i'm jealous i'm wanting to get myself a wahoo and i i'm gonna pull the trigger on it here pretty quick but i'm jealous of that\n46:41\nright right um and then um wednesday and friday i'll do a uh interval runs so um usually three to six miles just depending mixture of sort of quarter miles one miles um six to ten repeats depending um so it's not a lot of hours uh probably 10 12 hours a week but i feel pretty good and i'm not breaking down and i'm you know it's what i can do and it works and so there's not a you know in my age group at iron man now there's maybe between 10 and 20 of us and we're all kind of most of the guys been doing it for a\n47:27\nlong time so it's friendly it's fun and we're just trying to improve ourselves you know an ironman is a race against yourself and against your own head and can you you know can you still do it um after i finished my first my first iron man was iron man hawaii in 1982 and at the end of that race i could not remember why i wanted to do it and when i finished i decided i was never going to do another one and we i was living in san diego at the time and on the way back in the plane and the guy my training partner went with me and he\n48:06\nhad the same feeling and on the way back in the plane there was like 40 guys that had done their race and um the uh uh so you start talking with everybody and we first over six hours welcome is a bit commiserated about the race and how tough it was and by the time the plane landed almost all of us decided we were going back next year because we weren't gonna let this race beat us so that's sort of my philosophy in life you just keep doing it until you get it and if you went down that just means you got to get up and you just got to do it\n48:39\nagain because the you know the guy who survives is the guy who wins and the guy who keeps making it fun is the guy who has a happy life i love that and you know i can relate with it on so many levels"
