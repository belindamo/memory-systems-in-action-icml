  "content": "Pocahontas, also known as Matoaka and Amonute, was a Native American woman who lived in the early 17th century. She was a member of the Powhatan tribe, which was located in what is now Virginia. Pocahontas is famous for her relationship with the English colonist John Smith and for her role in the early history of the English colonies in North America.\n\nThere is some debate about the details of Pocahontas' life, as much of what is known about her comes from accounts written by European colonists. However, it is generally agreed that she married John Rolfe, an English colonist, in 1614. Rolfe was a tobacco farmer who had settled in Jamestown, the first English colony in Virginia. The marriage was seen as a way to create peace between the Powhatan tribe and the English colonists, and it marked the beginning of a period of relative peace between the two groups.\n\nPocahontas and Rolfe had one son, Thomas Rolfe, who was born in 1615. Pocahontas died in 1617 while on a trip to England with her husband and son.",
