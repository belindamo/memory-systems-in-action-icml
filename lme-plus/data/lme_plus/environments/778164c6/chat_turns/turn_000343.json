Please provide the following information:\n\n1. What is your vehicle's make and model?\n2. What is the current mileage of your vehicle?\n3. What is the recommended oil change interval for your vehicle (e.g., every 5,000 miles, every 7,500 miles, etc.)?\n4. When was your last oil change (approximate date or mileage)?\n5. Do you want to set a reminder for a specific date or a specific mileage?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you set a reminder for your next oil change.\n\n(Note: I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to send you reminders or notifications. However, I can provide you with a suggested date or mileage for your next oil change, and you can set a reminder on your own calendar or planner.)",
