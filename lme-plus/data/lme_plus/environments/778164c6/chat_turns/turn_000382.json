Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nHow Do You Identify and Respond to Repudiation of a Contract?\n\nIf someone is accusing you of repudiation or repudiatory conduct, then you should respond to the allegations. If you fail to respond to the allegations, then you expose yourself to the other party relying on your failure to properly respond as support and evidence of your repudiatory conduct.\n\nIf your conduct is not a repudiation but rather you invoking your interpretation of the contract, then you should explain your conduct. You should explain the factual and legal grounds that you rely on as your response. Taking these steps will help you mitigate a claim of repudiation against yourself.",
