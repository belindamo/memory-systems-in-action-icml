  "content": "The viscosity of shampoo can vary depending on the specific formulation and the concentration of the ingredients. Generally, the viscosity of shampoo can range from 100 to 10,000 cP (centipoise), with most shampoo products falling within the range of 1,000 to 3,000 cP. The viscosity can also vary based on the temperature at which it is measured, as well as the shear rate applied during measurement.",
