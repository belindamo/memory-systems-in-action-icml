  "content": "Yes, direct eye contact is an important aspect of communication and social interaction in the Czech Republic. Maintaining eye contact during conversations is a sign of respect and indicates that you are engaged and interested in what the other person is saying.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the cultural norms around eye contact may vary depending on the situation and the people involved. For example, in more formal or hierarchical settings, such as business meetings, it may be more appropriate to avoid prolonged eye contact with superiors out of deference to their status.\n\nAt the same time, excessive or unwavering eye contact with strangers or acquaintances can be perceived as aggressive or confrontational. So, it's important to find a balance and use your judgement on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOverall, when in doubt, it's always a good idea to follow the lead of the locals and observe their social cues and behaviors. With time and practice, you'll get a feel for the appropriate levels of eye contact in different situations.",
