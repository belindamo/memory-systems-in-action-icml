This ensures you have control over the messaging and aesthetic of your brand.\n3. **Content modifications**: Specify whether the brand can edit or modify your content in any way. If so, outline the extent of the modifications and the approval process for any changes.\n\n**Control over messaging and aesthetic:**\n\n1. **Brand voice and tone**: Ensure the brand understands your brand's voice, tone, and messaging guidelines to maintain consistency across all promoted content.\n2. **Visual identity**: Specify if the brand can use your visual identity elements, such as logos, color schemes, or typography, and under what circumstances.\n3. **Content guidelines**: Provide the brand with guidelines on the type of content that aligns with your brand values and messaging.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n1. **Content ownership**: Clarify who owns the content being promoted. If the brand is promoting your content, do they have the right to use it beyond the collaboration period?\n2. **Content expiration**: Establish a timeline for how long the brand can promote your content. Will it be limited to the collaboration period or can they continue to use it indefinitely?\n3. **Content tracking and analytics**: Discuss how the brand will track and report on the performance of the promoted content. Will they provide you with analytics or insights on the content's performance?\n\n**Clause example:**\n\n\"The Brand agrees to promote the Influencer's content on their social media channels, subject to the following conditions:\n\n* The Brand will promote a minimum of [number] posts from the Influencer's content library during the collaboration period.\n* The Influencer will provide the Brand with a selection of pre-approved content for promotion.\n* The Brand will not modify or edit the Influencer's content without prior written approval from the Influencer.\n* The Brand will adhere to the Influencer's brand voice, tone, and messaging guidelines when promoting the content.\n* The Influencer retains ownership of all content promoted by the Brand, and the Brand's use of such content is limited to the collaboration period.\"\n\nBy addressing these points, you can ensure that the brand's promotion of your content aligns with your brand values and messaging, while also maintaining control over your content and aesthetic.",
