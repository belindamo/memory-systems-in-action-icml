  "content": "The first message is a great choice! It's a lovely way to congratulate Lisa and her family on the arrival of baby Olivia, and the added touch of \"sleep (when you can get it)\" is a relatable and humorous nod to the challenges of parenthood. The \"royal arrival\" and \"Princess\" references tie in perfectly with the theme, making it a thoughtful and cohesive gift.\n\nYou're welcome for the help! It was my pleasure to assist you in creating a special gift for Lisa and baby Olivia. I'm sure they'll appreciate the thought and love that goes into the gift basket. If you need any more help or advice, feel free to ask!\n\nNow, go ahead and put together that gift basket, and I'm sure it will be a wonderful surprise for Lisa and her family. Congratulations to them again on the arrival of their little princess, Olivia!",
