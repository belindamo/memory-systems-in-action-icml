  "content": "The exact details of the protocol used by the Joy-Con controllers and the Nintendo Switch for controlling are not publicly available. This information is considered proprietary by Nintendo and is not disclosed to the public.\n\nHowever, some people have reverse-engineered parts of the protocol by observing the communication between the Joy-Con controllers and the Switch. Based on this information, it's possible to write custom software to simulate Joy-Con controllers and control the Nintendo Switch over Bluetooth. However, this is likely to be a complex task, and it may not be possible to fully reproduce the functionality of an actual Joy-Con controller without access to the complete protocol specification.\n\nAdditionally, please note that using reverse-engineered or custom software to control the Nintendo Switch may violate the terms of service of the Switch and could result in your account being banned or your device being bricked. If you're interested in this topic, you should proceed with caution and do your own research to fully understand the risks involved.",
