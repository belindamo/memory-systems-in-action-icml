Here are some recommendations for storing your Contra, Sonic the Hedgehog, and other vintage games:\n\n**Storage Options:**\n\n1. **Cartridge Cases:** Individual cartridge cases or storage boxes are great for protecting your games from scratches, dust, and damage. You can find cases specifically designed for Sega Genesis, NES, or other console cartridges.\n2. **Game Storage Binders:** Three-ring binders with protective pages can store multiple games, keeping them organized and protected.
