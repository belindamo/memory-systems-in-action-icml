Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nHow Does the Court Work Out Whether a Party Has Repudiated a Contract?\n\nIt can be a complex matter on determining whether or not a party has repudiated the contract. There is high court authority that helps with understanding the principles and elements of repudiation. However, because we are dealing with facts and events, it is not a formula where one-size-fits-all.\n\nThe court will assess whether or not the repudiatory conduct is a breach of an essential term of the contract, or a breach of a non-essential term but causing substantial loss or benefit; and a renunciation of the contract. Of course, there may be multiple breaches which enliven more than one of the three types of breaches.",
