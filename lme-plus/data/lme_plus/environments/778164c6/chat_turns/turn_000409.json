  "content": "Certainly, the show is still funny on its own, even without the narrator's commentary, and it's subjective whether or not you find the narrator annoying or distracting.\n\nHowever, the voiceover narration is an integral part of Arrested Development's unique humor and storytelling. It creates a self-referential tone and adds an extra layer of irony and sarcasm in a way that makes the show stand out from other sitcoms. \n\nThat being said, if you find the narrator's voice to be a distraction, it's understandable to want to focus solely on what's happening on-screen. Different people have different tastes and preferences when it comes to comedy, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's essential to enjoy the show in the way that suits you the best.",
