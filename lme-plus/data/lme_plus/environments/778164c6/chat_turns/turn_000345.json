  "content": "Based on your inputs, I can help you calculate when your next oil change is due.\n\nSince your last oil change was at 71,500 miles, and the recommended interval is every 7,500 miles, you can expect your next oil change to be due at:\n\n71,500 miles + 7,500 miles = 79,000 miles\n\nSo, your next oil change is due when your car reaches approximately 79,000 miles.\n\nTo give you a rough estimate of when that might be, let's assume you drive around 1,000 miles per month (a reasonable estimate for many people). Based on this, you can expect to reach 79,000 miles in about:\n\n79,000 miles - 72,000 miles = 7,000 miles\n7,000 miles / 1,000 miles/month = approximately 7 months\n\nSo, you can expect your next oil change to be due in about 7 months. You can set a reminder on your calendar or planner for around that time to ensure you don't forget.\n\nRemember to keep track of your mileage and adjust the reminder accordingly if your driving habits change. It's also a good idea to check your owner's manual for any specific recommendations or guidelines for your Honda Civic.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
