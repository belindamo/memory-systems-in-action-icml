However, I have to break it to you - I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to know about your personal experiences or access your computer, so I didn't know you've been enjoying Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist. But I'm glad to hear that you're excited about music!\n\nNow, let's get to organizing your iTunes library! Here are some tips to help you consolidate your songs into a central library:\n\n1. **Create a master library folder**: Designate a specific folder on your computer as your central music library. This will be the hub where you'll store all your music files.\n2. **Gather all your music files**: Collect all your music files from different folders, external hard drives, or devices, and move them to your master library folder. This might take some time, but it's essential to have all your music in one place.\n3. **Organize your files by artist and album**: Create subfolders within your master library folder, organized by artist and then album. This will make it easier to find specific songs and albums.\n4. **Use iTunes' built-in organization features**: iTunes has features like \"Consolidate Library\" and \"Organize Library\" that can help you tidy up your music collection. You can find these options in the File menu or by right-clicking on your library.\n5. **Remove duplicates**: Use iTunes' \"Display Duplicates\" feature to identify and remove duplicate songs, which can help declutter your library.\n6. **Add metadata and tags**: Make sure your songs have correct metadata like artist, album, genre, and track numbers. You can use tools like MusicBrainz Picard or TuneUp to help with this task.\n7. **Backup your library**: Once you've organized your library, make sure to backup your files to an external hard drive or cloud storage service to prevent data loss.\n8. **Consider using a music management software**: If you're not a fan of iTunes, you might want to explore alternative music management software like MusicBee, Foobar2000, or Plex.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to consolidate your iTunes songs into a central library and make it easier to find and enjoy your music.\n\nRemember, organizing your music library takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the end. Happy organizing!",
