You can also use formulas to calculate totals and summaries, such as:\n\n* **Total Sales by Product**: Use the SUMIF formula to calculate the total sales for each product across all dates.\n* **Total Sales by Date**: Use the SUM formula to calculate the total sales for each date.\n* **Top-Selling Products**: Use the FILTER and SORT functions to identify the top-selling products by total sales.\n\nTo make it even more organized, you can create separate sheets within your Google Sheet for different types of data, such as:\n\n* **Sales Tracker**: The table above to track daily sales.\n* **Product List**: A list of all your products, including their unit prices and descriptions.\n* **Sales Summary**: A summary of your sales by product, date, or other criteria.\n\nFeel free to customize and modify the table to fit your specific needs. If you have any questions or need help with formulas, just let me know!",
