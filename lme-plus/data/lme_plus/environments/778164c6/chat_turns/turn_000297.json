I'll definitely check out TrueFire's TrueFire Live and Jam Zone, as well as Guitar Tricks' community forum and challenges. I might also explore the online music communities and social media groups you mentioned. Who knows, maybe I'll even start my own virtual jam session or collaboration project!",
