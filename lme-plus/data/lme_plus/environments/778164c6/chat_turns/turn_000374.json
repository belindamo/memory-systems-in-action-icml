Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nIs Repudiation the Same as Termination?\n\nRepudiation is not the same as termination. Repudiation refers to the conduct or event that enlivens the innocent party\u2019s right to terminate the contract. It is common that the innocent party notifies the party whose conduct is repudiatory to rectify the repudiatory conduct. If the repudiatory conduct is not remedied then the innocent party may terminate the contract.\n\nThe effect of termination of contract is to bring the contract to an end. So in effect, a person who repudiates a contract may be exposed to the innocent party terminating the contract.\n\nOften, the innocent party would be entitled to claim damages.",
