I've seen some really cool display ideas online, and I think it would be a great way to showcase my collection. I've got a few more games to go before I complete my set, but once I do, I'd love to set up a nice display.\n\nAs for my favorite aspect of collecting vintage video games, I think it's the thrill of the hunt. I love searching online marketplaces, thrift stores, and garage sales for rare or hard-to-find titles. It's always exciting when I finally track down a game I've been looking for, and it's even better when it's in great condition.\n\nI've also been getting into collecting vinyl records, and I've had a similar experience with that. There's something special about finding a rare or limited edition record in great condition, and it's always a thrill to add it to my collection.\n\nDo you have any tips for displaying",
