I'd be happy to help you with pricing your antique items and also try to help you uncover more about your great-great-grandmother's vase.\n\nTo price your antique items accurately, we'll need to consider several factors. Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. **Research, research, research**: Look for similar items online, in antique shops, and at auction houses to determine their market value. Websites like eBay, Etsy, and specialized online marketplaces like 1stdibs or Ruby Lane can give you an idea of what similar items are selling for.\n2. **Identify the item**: Determine the type of item, its material, age, and condition. In your case, you have a vase, which is a great starting point. Is it made of porcelain, ceramic, glass, or another material?\n3. **Provenance**: The fact that the vase belonged to your great-great-grandmother is a great selling point! Document any history or stories you have about the item, including its origins, ownership, and any notable events or people associated with it.\n4. **Condition**: Carefully inspect the vase for any damage, chips, cracks, or restoration. The condition of the item significantly affects its value.\n5. **Rarity**: Is the vase a unique piece or part of a limited production run? If it's a rare or hard-to-find item, it may be more valuable.\n6. **Expert opinions**: Consider consulting with an appraiser, antique dealer, or collector who specializes in your type of item. They can provide valuable insights and help you set a realistic price.\n7. **Pricing strategies**: You can choose to price your item competitively, taking into account the lowest prices you've found in your research. Alternatively, you can price it higher, highlighting its unique features, provenance, and rarity.\n\nNow, about your great-great-grandmother's vase... Can you tell me more about it? What does it look like? Are there any markings, signatures, or dates on the vase? Do you have any family stories or documentation about its history? The more information you can provide, the better I'll be able to help you uncover its story.",
