When you need to do something that requires quick bursts of energy, like lifting weights or sprinting, your muscles use a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for fuel. However, your muscles can quickly run out of ATP, which can limit your performance.\n\nThis is where creatine comes in. When you take creatine supplements, it increases the amount of stored creatine in your muscles. This, in turn, allows your muscles to make more ATP and sustain high-intensity activities for longer periods of time.\n\nIn simpler terms, creatine acts like a reserve energy source that helps your muscles perform better during intense physical activities.",
