  "content": "The viscosity of 10% Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate at room temperature can vary depending on the specific formulation and processing conditions. Generally, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate is a liquid ester that is used as an emollient and viscosity-increasing agent in personal care products, and it has a low to medium viscosity.\n\nIn some formulations, a 10% concentration of Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate might have a viscosity in the range of 500-1000 cP (centipoise) at room temperature. However, the actual viscosity can be higher or lower depending on the other ingredients in the formulation, the processing conditions, and the specific test method used to measure viscosity.",
