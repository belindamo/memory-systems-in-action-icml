  "content": "I'm really happy with how my bookshelf turned out, and I'm glad I took the time to organize everything. I do have a few favorite series, including some classic Spider-Man and X-Men comics. I've also been getting into some newer titles like Saga and Black Hammer.\n\nAs for maintaining my collection, I think the key is to just set aside a little time each week to tidy up and make sure everything is still organized. It doesn't have to be a lot of time, just 10-15 minutes to make sure everything is still in its place. I also try to handle my comics carefully and avoid stacking them too high, so they don't get damaged.\n\nBy the way, speaking of collecting, I've also been trying to complete my vintage video game cartridge collection. I recently purchased a copy of Earthworm Jim for the Sega Genesis, which I received just today. It's in near-mint condition and works perfectly on my retro console.",
