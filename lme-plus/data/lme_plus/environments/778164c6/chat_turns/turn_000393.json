Their rewards program is fantastic, and that 20% discount is a wonderful perk.\n\nSkincare products can make wonderful gifts, especially when paired with unique jewelry pieces. Here are some ideas for gift sets or products that might complement the handmade jewelry:\n\n1. **Mini skincare sets**: Look for travel-sized or mini sets that feature a combination of products, such as cleansers, toners, and moisturizers. These are perfect for trying out new brands or products.\n2. **Luxurious face masks**: Sephora offers a wide range of face masks from various brands. Choose a few that cater to different skin types or concerns (e.g., hydrating, brightening, or detoxifying).\n3. **Best-selling skincare products**: Consider gifting popular, highly-rated products like Drunk Elephant's Protini Polypeptide Cream, Sunday Riley's Power Couple, or Laneige's Water Bank Moisturizing Cream.\n4. **Skincare tools**: A gentle exfoliating brush, a rose quartz facial roller, or a microneedling device can be a unique and thoughtful addition to a skincare routine.\n5. **Gift sets with a personalized touch**: Look for sets that include a personalized message or a monogrammed bag. This adds a special touch to the gift and makes it feel more thoughtful.\n\nTo complement the handmade jewelry, consider the following:\n\n* **Natural or eco-friendly brands**: If the jewelry has a bohemian or earthy vibe, look for skincare brands that share similar values, such as Burt's Bees, Lush, or The Body Shop.\n* **Products with natural ingredients**: Choose products with natural ingredients that align with the handmade, artisanal feel of the jewelry. For example, look for products featuring botanicals, essential oils, or plant-based actives.\n* **Luxurious textures and scents**: Opt for products with rich, indulgent textures and scents that evoke a sense of pampering and self-care. This can help create a cohesive, spa-like experience.\n\nRemember to consider your friends' skin types and preferences when selecting skincare products. If you're unsure, you can always opt for gift cards or a \"choose your own adventure\" style gift, where they can select their own products.\n\nNow, go ahead and treat yourself to some wonderful skincare goodies, and enjoy the 20% discount!",
