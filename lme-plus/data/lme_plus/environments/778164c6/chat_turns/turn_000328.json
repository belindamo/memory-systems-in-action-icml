  "content": "Front Runner Outfitters is a great choice for modular racking systems, and they're very popular among 4Runner owners.\n\nGlad to hear that your roof rack system performed well on your solo trip, and that you were able to get out of the mud safely using your winch and some careful driving skills! Getting stuck can be a stressful experience, but it's all part of the off-roading adventure, right?\n\nIt's great that you were prepared with a winch and knew how to use it effectively. Winches can be a lifesaver in situations like that. Did you have to use any other recovery gear, like maxtrax or a snatch block, to get out of the mud?\n\nAnd how did you find the solo trip experience? Was it your first time going off-roading alone, or do you prefer solo adventures?",
