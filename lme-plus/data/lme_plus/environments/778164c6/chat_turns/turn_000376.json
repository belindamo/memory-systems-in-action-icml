Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nWhat Happens If You Accept Repudiation?\n\nWhen a party accepts repudiation, the innocent party has the right to terminate the contract. The termination results in the contract being deemed void at common law. It is not possible to sue for repudiation specifically, but rather, one would bring a claim for breach of contract. Damages may be available in such a claim, depending on the circumstances of the case.",
