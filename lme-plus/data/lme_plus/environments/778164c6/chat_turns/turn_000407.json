  "content": "Yes, the show can definitely be funny on its own, as it is full of clever writing, quick-witted jokes, and absurd situations. However, the voiceover narration's purpose is not just to explain the jokes or storylines to the audience. Its role is to add an extra layer of humor and enhance the show's overall comedic effect.\n\nOftentimes, the narrator's commentary can take a seemingly obvious joke and elevate it to the next level of hilarity by adding a clever twist or clever wordplay to it. Additionally, the narration can activate the humor that may have gone unnoticed or add context that adds to the absurdness of a situation. The voiceover works because it turns already funny scenes and situations into even funnier ones and delivers an entirely unique brand of sarcasm, irony and meta-jokes that the show wouldn't be the same without.\n\nSo, while it may seem like the narrator is stating the obvious at times, they do so with a unique underlying commentary, which enhances the show's overall humor.",
