Congratulations on taking the first step towards learning a new language! \n\nConsistency is key when it comes to language learning, and it's excellent that you've committed to practicing for 15-20 minutes every evening. Focusing on basic phrases and vocabulary is a great way to build a solid foundation.\n\nHere are some tips to help you make the most out of your language learning journey:\n\n1. **Set achievable goals**: Break down your goals into smaller, achievable milestones. This will help you stay motivated and track your progress.\n2. **Practice active listening and speaking**: Try to listen to native speakers and practice speaking as much as possible. This will help you improve your pronunciation and get a feel for the rhythm of the language.\n3. **Use flashcards and spaced repetition**: Flashcards can be a great tool for memorizing new vocabulary. Consider using apps like Anki to create digital flashcards and implement spaced repetition to review words at optimal intervals.\n4. **Immerse yourself in the language**: Watch TV shows or movies in the target language with English subtitles, listen to podcasts or radio shows, and try to read books or articles in the language.\n5. **Find a language buddy or tutor**: Having someone to practice with and get feedback from can be incredibly helpful. Look for language exchange websites or apps, or consider hiring a tutor.\n6. **Be patient and persistent**: Learning a language takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you make mistakes or struggle to understand certain concepts. Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement over time.\n7. **Use your new language in context**: Try to use the language in real-life situations, even if it's just ordering food at a restaurant or asking for directions. This will help you build confidence and reinforce new vocabulary.\n\nRemember, the key to language learning is consistent practice and exposure. Keep up the good work, and you'll be speaking like a native in no time!",
