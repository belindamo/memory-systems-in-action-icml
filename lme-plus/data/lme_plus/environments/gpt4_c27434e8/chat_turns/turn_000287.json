  "content": "What I mean by \"it doesn't mean they can't understand or have an opinion about it\" is that being a member of a particular group, like a woman or a cat, is not a requirement for understanding or having an opinion about that group. Just because someone is not a woman, for example, doesn't mean they can't understand or have an opinion about women's experiences or issues. People can gain knowledge and understanding through various means, such as research, education, and personal experience, which can allow them to form informed opinions about a particular group or issue. Therefore, it's not necessary to be a member of a group to have an opinion about it.",
