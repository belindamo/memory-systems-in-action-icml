Since you're in the city center, you might not expect to find hiking trails nearby, but there are some great options within a short drive or even a walkable distance. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Riverview Trail**: This trail is about a 10-15 minute walk from the city center and offers a scenic hike along the river. It's a relatively easy 2-mile loop with great views of the city and the river.\n2. **City Creek Trail**: This trail is about a 10-minute drive from the city center and features a 3.5-mile out-and-back hike with some gentle inclines. You'll get to enjoy the scenery of the surrounding hills and maybe even spot some local wildlife.\n3. **Hilltop Park Trail**: This trail is about a 15-minute drive from the city center and offers a more challenging 4-mile loop with some steeper inclines. You'll be rewarded with panoramic views of the city and the surrounding mountains.\n\nAll of these trails are well-marked and well-maintained, and you can find more information about them online or through local outdoor groups.\n\nIf you're looking for something more leisurely, you could also consider a walk along the **Riverwalk**, which is a paved path that runs along the river and offers great views of the city. It's about a 5-minute walk from The Daily Grind, so you could even do a quick walk before or after your brunch.\n\nWhich of these options sounds appealing to you and Emily? Or would you like more information about any of these trails?",
