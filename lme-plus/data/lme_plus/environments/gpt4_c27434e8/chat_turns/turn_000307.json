  "content": "What a great idea! I'd be happy to help you organize the films you've seen at Sundance and other festivals. Let's get started!\n\nTo help me better assist you, can you please provide some details about the films you saw at Sundance? Here are some questions to get us started:\n\n1. Which year's Sundance Film Festival are we talking about? (e.g., 2022, 2021, etc.)\n2. Do you have a list of the films you saw, or do you need help recalling them?\n3. If you do have a list, are they organized in any way (e.g., by title, director, genre, rating)?\n4. Would you like to keep track of additional information about each film, such as:\n\t* Your rating or review\n\t* The date you saw the film\n\t* The venue or theater where you saw it\n\t* Any notable cast or crew members\n\t* Awards or nominations the film received at Sundance\n\nOnce we get started, we can create a system that works for you to organize your film festival experiences. From there, we can expand to other festivals, like Tribeca, and help you keep track of all the amazing films you've seen!",
