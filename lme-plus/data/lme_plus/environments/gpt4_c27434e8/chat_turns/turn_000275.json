  "content": "Yes, the UC San Diego Library has a wide range of Dr. Seuss's works on display, including some of his lesser-known works. In addition to his famous children's books, the library has a collection of his political cartoons from World War II, some of which were quite controversial at the time. The library also has a collection of his early advertising work, which includes ads for companies such as NBC, Ford, and General Electric. The library's Dr. Seuss Collection is one of the largest in the world, so there are many different pieces of his work on display at any given time. Visitors can check with the library or online to see what is currently on display.",
