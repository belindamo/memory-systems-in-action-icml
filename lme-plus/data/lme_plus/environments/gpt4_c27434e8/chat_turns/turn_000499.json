Here is a version of the summary that is written in a style inspired by Alan Turing and is approximately 5000 characters in length:\n\n\"The rapid developments in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence have led to a need for new formal methods, specifically logics, that can effectively handle the reasoning tasks involved in their analysis. However, existing techniques and tools, which have been well-developed for classically-based logics such as modal and description logics, are not always suitable for more general non-classical logics, such as subclassical, paraconsistent, many-valued, and fuzzy logics. These logics must be tailored case-by-case, which is a major hindrance to progress in this area.\n\nThis project aims to overcome this gap by providing general results and techniques that enable a finer control over the complexity of symbolic reasoning tasks. We are taking a modular approach, considering the language, deductive system, and semantics of these logics, and building on recent research on the axiomatization and decision properties of various non-classical logics. Our goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how different logical parameters impact complexity, and to develop a range of techniques that can be applied to a wide range of non-classical logics.\n\nTwo key mathematical ideas that we are exploring are partial non-deterministic semantics and a multiple-conclusion approach to logical consequence. These concepts allow us to effectively combine the semantics of different logics, update semantics with new axioms, and provide analytic axiomatizations for a given semantics. These generalized notions of semantics and logic also enable us to understand how to:\n\n* Effectively combine the semantics of two logics, capturing the effect of joining their axiomatizations\n* Update semantics when imposing new axioms\n* Provide analytic axiomatizations for a given semantics\n\nAnalytic calculi are a valuable tool in logic, as they not only provide decision procedures for the validity problem, but their proof-search capabilities can also be used to tackle more complex functionalities in a purely symbolic fashion. The multiple-conclusion environment we are using offers these advantages without introducing the usual complexity of meta-level language in the calculi, as is the case in alternatives such as sequent calculi, natural deduction, and labelled tableaux. This allows for a purely internal view of logic, which fits well with our compositional approach and grants a finer control over the origin of interactions and the tracking of increases in complexity.\n\nWe are also developing an online platform called CT4L, which will provide a range of reasoning capabilities and will be publicly available. Our goal is to demonstrate the practical applications of these techniques through case studies and to eventually generalize our approach to more complex, quantified, and typed languages. While we have made substantial progress in this research, the full benefits of our work are only now beginning to be realized. CT4L is expected to be an important bridge between our fundamental results and practical needs, allowing for experimentation with examples from real-world applications where reasoning tools are essential.",
