I'm happy to help you, but I have to clarify that it's not possible for you to have seen \"Minari\" at Sundance 2022, as it premiered at Sundance 2020, and it's not possible for you to have attended Sundance 2022 if you saw \"Minari\" there.\n\nIt's possible that you attended a different film festival or event, or maybe you're getting your festivals mixed up. I'm happy to help you try to figure out what might have happened, but I need a bit more information.\n\nCan you tell me more about your trip with Alex and Rachel? Do you remember any other details about the festival, such as the dates, the venues, or any specific events or panels you attended? Any details you can provide might help me help you piece together what happened.\n\nLet's start fresh and see if we can figure out what festival or event you attended, and then we can try to help you remember the films you saw!",
