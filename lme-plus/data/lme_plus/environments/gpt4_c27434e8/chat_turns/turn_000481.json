Here are some tips to help you ease back into your yoga practice:\n\n**1. Start small and be gentle**: Don't try to do too much too soon. Begin with short practices (20-30 minutes) and gradually increase your duration and intensity as your body allows.\n\n**2. Listen to your body**: Honor your body's needs and limitations. If you're feeling tired or experiencing discomfort, stop and rest. It's better to take it slow and gentle than to risk injury or burnout.\n\n**3. Focus on breathing and relaxation**: Begin with simple breathing exercises, meditation, or gentle restorative yoga to help your body and mind relax and unwind. This will help you reconnect with your practice and build a strong foundation for more physical postures.\n\n**4. Re-establish a routine**: Commit to practicing at the same time every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. Consistency is key to developing a habit.\n\n**5. Choose gentle and restorative practices**: Opt for yin yoga, hatha yoga, or restorative yoga classes, which focus on gentle, slow movements and deep relaxation. These styles can help you rebuild strength, flexibility, and endurance.\n\n**6. Modify and adapt**: Be kind to yourself and modify postures to accommodate any physical limitations or discomfort. Use blocks, straps, or blankets to support your body, and avoid postures that exacerbate your stomach issues.\n\n**7. Practice self-care**: Prioritize self-care activities, such as meditation, journaling, or reading, to help manage stress and anxiety, which can contribute to stomach issues.\n\n**8. Seek guidance**: Consider taking a few private lessons or workshops to help you transition back into your practice. A teacher can provide personalized guidance, modifications, and support.\n\n**9. Celebrate small victories**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small accomplishments, even if it's just showing up to your mat for 10 minutes a day. This will help you build confidence and motivation.\n\n**10. Be patient and kind**: Remember that it's okay to take time to recover and rebuild. Be patient and kind to yourself, and don't judge your progress. Focus on the journey, not the destination.\n\nAdditional tips for stomach issues:\n\n* Practice gentle twists and forward bends to help stimulate digestion and relieve discomfort.\n* Avoid hot yoga or intense practices that can exacerbate stomach issues.\n* Consider incorporating gentle abdominal exercises, such as pelvic tilts or leg raises, to help strengthen your core and improve digestion.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to listen to your body and honor its needs. With patience, kindness, and gentle persistence, you can ease back into your yoga practice and cultivate a stronger, healthier you.",
