  "content": "The Tribeca Film Festival is an annual event that typically takes place in late April and early May in New York City. The exact dates may vary from year to year, but it usually runs for about 12 days.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are the dates for the past few years:\n\n* 2022: April 20 - May 1\n* 2021: June 9 - 20 (note: this was a special edition, as the festival was postponed from its usual April dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic)\n* 2020: April 15 - 26 (online edition only, due to the COVID-19 pandemic)\n* 2019: April 24 - May 5\n* 2018: April 18 - 29\n\nI recommend checking the official Tribeca Film Festival website or social media channels for the latest information on the upcoming festival dates.
