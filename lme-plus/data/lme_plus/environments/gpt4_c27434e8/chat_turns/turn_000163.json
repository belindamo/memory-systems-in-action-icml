  "content": "I used pre-made decals specifically designed for the Ferrari 288 GTO. The application process was pretty straightforward, but it did take some patience and care to avoid air bubbles and wrinkles. I applied them to the engine compartment and body about a week ago, and I'm really happy with how they turned out.\n\nNext, I'm actually planning to focus on the paint job, using my new airbrush compressor to get a smooth, even finish. I've been doing some research on weathering and aging effects, so I might try to add some subtle wear and tear to the model to give it a more realistic look.\n\nRegarding additional details, that's a great point! I did think about adding some wiring and hoses to the engine compartment, but I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra effort. Now that you mention it, I think it could really make a difference in the overall look of the model. Do you have any tips on how to add those details without making the model look",
