  "content": "Yes, mammoths did have predators to worry about. Some of their predators included sabre-toothed cats, wolves, and humans. However, their large size and the presence of tusks made them formidable prey, and they could fend off predators when they needed to. Scientists also believe that mammoths lived in herds which was a possible defense mechanism against predators. This way, they could protect each other and help to deter predators. Despite these defenses, it is believed that hunting contributed to the eventual extinction of mammoths.",
