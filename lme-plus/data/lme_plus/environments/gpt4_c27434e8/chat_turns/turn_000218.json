That being said, the Sydney Roosters have a very talented squad with several players who could potentially be key contributors in the upcoming match against their biggest rival.\n\nSome of the Roosters' star players who could have a big impact on the match include their captain and hooker Jake Friend, fullback James Tedesco, halfback Luke Keary, and forward Jared Waerea-Hargreaves. These players are all experienced and have proved themselves to be elite performers at the highest level of the sport.\n\nHowever, any player on the Roosters' roster could step up and have a standout performance on the day, so it will be interesting to see who makes the biggest impact when the match arrives.",
