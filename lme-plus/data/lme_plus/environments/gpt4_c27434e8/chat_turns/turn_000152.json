It sounds like your Chicago trip was a great learning experience for packing essentials, from rotating your shirts to carrying a portable charger.\n\nThat lake walk must have been lovely, but I can imagine how quickly your phone's battery could drain with all the photo opportunities and map checks. Having a portable charger on hand must have been a huge relief. It's amazing how something so small can make such a big difference in our travel experiences.\n\nI'm glad you're applying those lessons to your upcoming LA trip. You're going to be so prepared and stress-free, enjoying every moment of your adventure!",
