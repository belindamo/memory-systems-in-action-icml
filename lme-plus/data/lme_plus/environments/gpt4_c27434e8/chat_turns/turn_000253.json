  "content": "Mammoths were adapted to living in cold environments, and they had several adaptations that allowed them to find and eat vegetation in their surroundings. Firstly, mammoths had long and curved tusks that they used to dig through snow and ice to access the vegetation underneath. Secondly, they had long and coarse hair that acted as insulation and protected them from the harsh cold climate.  Additionally, mammoths had a specialized digestive system that allowed them to break down tough and coarse vegetation like grass, sedges, and shrubs. Lastly, they traveled in herds and migrated to different areas in search of fresh vegetation. This allowed them to find enough food to survive in changing environments.",
