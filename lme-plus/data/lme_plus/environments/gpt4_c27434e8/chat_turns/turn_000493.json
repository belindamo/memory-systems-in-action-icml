Here is an attempt at summarizing the text in a style inspired by Alan Turing:\n\n\"There is a pressing need for new logics to be developed for the analysis of computer science and artificial intelligence, which can handle the reasoning tasks required in these fields. However, existing techniques and tools are not always suitable for non-classical logics, such as subclassical, paraconsistent, many-valued, and fuzzy logics.\n\nThis project aims to address this gap by providing general results and techniques that enable a finer control over the complexity of symbolic reasoning tasks. We are taking a modular approach, considering the language, deductive system, and semantics of these logics, and building on recent research on the axiomatization and decision properties of various non-classical logics.\n\nTwo key mathematical ideas that we are exploring are partial non-deterministic semantics and a multiple-conclusion approach to logical consequence. These concepts allow us to effectively combine the semantics of different logics, update semantics with new axioms, and provide analytic axiomatizations for a given semantics.\n\nWe are also developing an online platform called CT4L, which will provide a range of reasoning capabilities and will be publicly available. Our goal is to demonstrate the practical applications of these techniques through case studies and to eventually generalize our approach to more complex, quantified, and typed languages.\n\nWhile we have made substantial progress in this research, the full benefits of our work are only now beginning to be realized. CT4L is expected to be an important bridge between our fundamental results and practical needs, allowing for experimentation with examples from real-world applications where reasoning tools are essential.\"",
