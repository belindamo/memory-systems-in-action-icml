  "content": "The Daily Grind is a popular spot, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nYes, The Daily Grind does have outdoor seating! They have a lovely patio area with tables and chairs where you can enjoy your meal while soaking up some sunshine. It's a great spot to people-watch and take in the city atmosphere. Just keep in mind that the outdoor seating is on a first-come, first-served basis, so you might want to arrive a bit early to snag a spot.\n\nAdditionally, if you're planning to sit outside, you might want to check their social media or call ahead to confirm their outdoor seating is open. Sometimes, they might have special events or closures, but it's usually available during peak brunch hours.\n\nNow that we have your brunch spot settled, what time were you thinking of meeting Emily? And would you like me to provide any additional recommendations for things to do or see in the area after your meal?",
