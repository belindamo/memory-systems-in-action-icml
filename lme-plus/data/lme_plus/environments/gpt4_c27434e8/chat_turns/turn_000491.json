  "content": "The text describes a research project focused on developing new formal methods (specifically, logics) for use in the analysis of artificial intelligence and computer science. These methods need to balance expressivity (the ability to represent a wide range of concepts and relationships) with complexity (the difficulty of making decisions based on the logic). The project aims to provide general techniques for controlling the emergence of complexity in symbolic reasoning tasks, using a modular approach that allows for a deeper understanding of how different logical parameters (language, deductive system, and semantics) impact complexity. The project also aims to build on recent research on the axiomatization and semantics of non-classical logics, and to develop an online platform (CT4L) that provides a range of reasoning capabilities, including model checking, decision of satisfiability and validity, proof search, and extracting explanations from proofs. The project plans to use case studies to demonstrate the practical applications of these techniques in real-world contexts.",
