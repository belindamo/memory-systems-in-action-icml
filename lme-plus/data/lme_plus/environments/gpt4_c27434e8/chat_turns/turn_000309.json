  "content": "Let's get started on organizing your Sundance 2022 film list.\n\nFirst, I'll note that \"The French Dispatch\" actually premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, not Sundance 2022. It's possible you saw it at a different festival or event, or maybe you're thinking of a different film?\n\nMoving on, let's focus on the 12 films you saw at Sundance 2022. Can you try to recall the other 11 films on your list? You can give me titles, directors, or any other details you remember. We can work together to fill in the gaps.\n\nTo help jog your memory, you can check the Sundance 2022 program or look up articles from the festival. If you need any assistance or prompts, feel free to ask!\n\nOnce we have your list, we can organize it in a way that works for you, including adding any additional details you'd like to track.",
