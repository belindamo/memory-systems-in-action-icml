Could you please tell me:\n\n1. What city or area you're in?\n2. What type of cuisine are you and your friend in the mood for? (e.g., eggs, pancakes, sandwiches, international, etc.)\n3. Are you looking for a casual, laid-back spot or something more upscale?\n4. Do you have a budget in mind?\n5. Are there any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.) I should consider?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized brunch spot recommendations!",
