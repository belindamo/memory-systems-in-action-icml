Their Cyrano and Aliante handlebars are popular choices, and their grips feature ergonomic designs and comfortable materials.\n* **Specialized:** Specialized's handlebars, like the Aerofly and Shallow Drop, are designed for comfort and aerodynamics. Their grips, such as the S-Wrap, feature ergonomic shapes and comfortable materials.\n* **Other brands:** Other brands like Bontrager, Easton, and Pro offer a range of handlebars and grips designed for comfort and performance.\n\nBefore upgrading, consider the following:\n\n* **Consult a professional:** Visit a local bike shop or a professional fitter to get a proper bike fit and recommendations on handlebars and grips.\n* **Test and demo:** Try out different handlebars and grips to see what works best for you.\n* **Prioritize your needs:** Identify the specific areas of discomfort and focus on upgrading the components that will make the most significant difference.\n\nBy addressing your saddle, handlebars, and grips, you'll be well on your way to a more comfortable and enjoyable riding experience on your Trek Emonda!",
