  "content": "\"Minari\" is a great film! However, I think there's a small mistake again. \"Minari\" actually premiered at Sundance 2020, not 2022. It was a critical darling and went on to receive several Academy Award nominations.\n\nDon't worry, it's easy to get film festivals and years mixed up! Let's focus on getting your Sundance 2022 list accurate.\n\nCan you think of any other films you saw at Sundance 2022? Were there any particular genres, directors, or actors that you were interested in? Any films that stood out to you, or ones that you're still thinking about?\n\nWe can work together to recreate your list and make sure it's accurate. I'm here to help!",
