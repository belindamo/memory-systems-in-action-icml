They'll be able to assist you with making a reservation for a large group. Be prepared to provide the date, time, and number of guests.\n2. **Use online reservation platforms**: You can also try using online reservation platforms like OpenTable or Yelp to make a reservation. However, for a large group, it's best to call them directly to ensure they can accommodate your party.\n3. **Be flexible**: Keep in mind that Foreign Cinema is a popular spot, so it's a good idea to be flexible with your dates and times. If you have a specific date in mind, be prepared to book well in advance.\n\nAs for your manager's email, I'm happy to chat with you, but I'm not capable of storing or retrieving information about your personal emails or calendar events. You might want to check your email archives or calendar to confirm the details of the email.\n\nRemember to confirm the reservation details with Foreign Cinema, including the date, time, and any special requests you may have. They may also require a deposit or credit card to hold the reservation.\n\nLet me know if you need any more help or have other questions!",
