  "content": "If you want to separate the system/installation and logs onto different disks or volumes, you can do so by allocating storage space based on the requirements for each volume.\n\nFor an Elastic Stack server with separate system and log volumes, consider the following minimum storage requirements:\n\n1. System/Installation volume:\n\t* At least 30-50 GB of free disk space to accommodate the operating system, Elastic Stack components (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), and additional tools or modules.\n2. Log volume:\n\t* At least 200 GB (or more, depending on log retention policies and log volume) of free disk space to store the Elasticsearch indices containing the log data.\n\nThe minimum CPU and memory requirements remain the same:\n\n1. Processor: 4 CPU cores (or more, depending on log volume)\n2. Memory: 16 GB RAM (Elasticsearch benefits from more memory for better performance)\n\nWhen setting up the Elastic Stack server, ensure that the separate volumes are correctly mounted and configured. In the Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`), specify the log volume's path for storing the indices:\n```lua\npath.data: /path/to/log/volume\n```\nMake sure to replace `/path/to/log/volume` with the actual path to the mounted log volume on your system.\n\nRemember that these are general guidelines and may need to be adjusted based on the specific needs of your environment. Always consult official documentation for the most up-to-date information on system requirements and configuration.",
