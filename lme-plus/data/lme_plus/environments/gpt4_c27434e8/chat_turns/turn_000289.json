  "content": "The cat scenario is a way of illustrating the point that being a member of a particular group is not necessary to understand or have an opinion about that group. Matt used the example of a cat to show that Tran's argument that only women can understand what women are is flawed. Matt's point was that just as someone who is not a cat can still understand and have an opinion about what a cat is, someone who is not a woman can still understand and have an opinion about what women are or the issues they face. Matt's goal was to show that Tran's argument was overly restrictive and that people can gain knowledge and understanding about a group through various means, not just through membership in that group.",
