      "content": "Can you summarize the following text? \"The growing developments of computer science and artificial intelligence, with applications in critical areas, demand new formal methods (read logics) able to cope with the reasoning tasks involved in their analysis. To this end, we need to find trade-offs between the expressivity of the considered logics and the complexity of their associated decision problems. \nHowever, the existing techniques and tools (well developed for classically-based logics, modal and description logics used in knowledge representation tasks in areas such as law, medicine or biology) are hardly usable when considering general non-classical logics (e.g., subclassical, paraconsistent, many-valued, fuzzy) and must be tailored case-by-case. \n\nThis project aims at overcoming this gap. Our goal is to provide general results and techniques enabling a finer control in taming the emergence of complexity in symbolic reasoning tasks. We pursue a modular approach to compositionality that allows for a wider understanding of the effects of tuning the key logical parameters: language, deductive system and semantics.\nWe build on various fundamental results obtained in recent years regarding axiomatization and semantics of general propositional logics, their decision and complexity properties covering many relevant non-classically based logics.\n\nBased on our recent experience, and the promising preliminary results obtained, there are two key mathematical ideas to explore: i) partial non-deterministic semantics, and (ii) a multiple-conclusion approach to logical consequence. We have found this to be the right level of abstraction when tackling compositionality problems in logic. It is another instance of the well known advantages of embedding a problem in a richer context, like moving to complex numbers helped in fundamental problems of real analysis. These generalized notions of semantics and logic allow us to finally understand how to:\n- effectively combine the semantics of two logics capturing the effect of joining the their axiomatizations,\n- update semantics when imposing new axioms, and \n- provide analytic axiomatizations for a given semantics.\n\nAnalytic calculi are a valuable tool in logic, allowing not only decision procedures for the validity problem, but the proof-search capabilities can be used for tackling in a purely symbolic fashion more complex functionalities. These advantages of the multiple-conclusion environment come without the usual price on the compositionality front of introducing meta-level language in the calculi as is the case in the most used alternatives: sequent calculi, natural deduction and labelled tableaux. Allowing for a purely internal view of logic which fits well with the compositional approach, granting a finer control on the origin of the interactions and tracking the increases in complexity. \n\nMany of these results allow for effective functionalities that we are implementing and which we plan to integrate in an online platform for public use, named CT4L. Its features cover a wide range of reasoning activities such as model checking, decision of satisfiability and validity, proof search and extracting explanations from proofs. Its modular character also allows us to observe the effect on operations on the semantic side when altering the calculi presentation and vice versa. For simplicity we started by considering propositional logics, however we are confident we can generalize our approach to logics over more complex languages, quantified and, more generally, typed languages. \n\nThese past years translate into a substantial amount of insight. However, its fruits are only now starting to produce relevant usable outcomes. The platform CT4L is expected to constitute an important bridge between our fundamental results and more practical needs as it pushes the frontier beyond what is feasible using only pen and paper, allowing for experimentation with examples coming from real applications where reasoning tools are essential. \n\nWe intend to develop exploratory illustrative case studies covering the numerous situations where effective symbolic reasoning is highly valued, namely in probabilistic reasoning, information security proofs, the correctness of quantum algorithms, or the verification of robustness properties of deep neural networks (DNN), taking advantage of the flexibility endowed by semantical non-determinism and partiality, via appropriate abstractions.\n\nThe core team of CT4L has a long standing interest in these research topics, with a relevant track of publications, and a network of international collaborations in the area, which shows that they can be expected to carry on with the most fundamental work. Their experience in supervising MSc and PhD students, and their working environment at Instituto de Telecomunica\\c{c}\\~oes (IT) and at Instituto Superior T\\'ecnico (IST) of Universidade de Lisboa, are also indicators that good students can be hired to cope with the more practical and applicational tasks. \n\""

These methods need to balance expressivity (the ability to represent a wide range of concepts and relationships) with complexity (the difficulty of making decisions based on the logic). The project aims to provide general techniques for controlling the emergence of complexity in symbolic reasoning tasks, using a modular approach that allows for a deeper understanding of how different logical parameters (language, deductive system, and semantics) impact complexity. The project also aims to build on recent research on the axiomatization and semantics of non-classical logics, and to develop an online platform (CT4L) that provides a range of reasoning capabilities, including model checking, decision of satisfiability and validity, proof search, and extracting explanations from proofs.
