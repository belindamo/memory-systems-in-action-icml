      "content": "When I mention \"4 CPU cores (or more, depending on log volume),\" I'm suggesting that the number of CPU cores required for your ELK stack server can vary depending on the amount of log data you need to process. Higher log volume generally requires more processing power.\n\nIt's difficult to provide an exact threshold for log volume that would necessitate a change in the number of CPU cores because the required processing power depends on several factors, including:\n\n1. The number and complexity of Logstash filters and pipelines.\n2. The rate at which logs are ingested into the system.\n3. The number of concurrent queries and aggregations performed by Elasticsearch.\n4. The performance and resource requirements of additional modules and data shippers (e.g., Beats).\n\nAs a general guideline, you can start with 4 CPU cores and monitor the performance of your ELK stack server. If you experience high CPU utilization or slow query performance, you might need to allocate more CPU cores to your server.\n\nTo determine if you need to increase the number of CPU cores, monitor the following:\n\n1. CPU utilization: If the CPU utilization is consistently high (e.g., above 80-90%) during normal operation, consider adding more CPU cores.\n2. Elasticsearch performance: Monitor Elasticsearch query and indexing performance. If you notice slow response times or increased latency, additional CPU resources might help.\n3. Logstash processing: Check for any Logstash processing bottlenecks, such as slow filter execution or backlogs in the processing pipeline. More CPU cores can help alleviate these issues.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to monitor and analyze the performance of your ELK stack server to determine the most appropriate resource allocation. You may need to adjust the number of CPU cores, memory, or storage based on your specific environment and use case."

      "content": "If you want to separate the system/installation and logs onto different disks or volumes, you can do so by allocating storage space based on the requirements for each volume.\n\nFor an Elastic Stack server with separate system and log volumes, consider the following minimum storage requirements:\n\n1. System/Installation volume:\n\t* At least 30-50 GB of free disk space to accommodate the operating system, Elastic Stack components (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), and additional tools or modules.\n2. Log volume:\n\t* At least 200 GB (or more, depending on log retention policies and log volume) of free disk space to store the Elasticsearch indices containing the log data.\n\nThe minimum CPU and memory requirements remain the same:\n\n1. Processor: 4 CPU cores (or more, depending on log volume)\n2. Memory: 16 GB RAM (Elasticsearch benefits from more memory for better performance)\n\nWhen setting up the Elastic Stack server, ensure that the separate volumes are correctly mounted and configured. In the Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`), specify the log volume's path for storing the indices:\n```lua\npath.data: /path/to/log/volume\n```\nMake sure to replace `/path/to/log/volume` with the actual path to the mounted log volume on your system.\n\nRemember that these are general guidelines and may need to be adjusted based on the specific needs of your environment. Always consult official documentation for the most up-to-date information on system requirements and configuration."
