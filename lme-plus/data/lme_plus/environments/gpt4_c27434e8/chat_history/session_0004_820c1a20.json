      "content": "Madden NFL is a fantastic choice for a tournament, and it's easy to learn, even for non-football fans.\n\n**Bracket Size:**\n\nA bracket with 4 or 8 players is a great idea. A smaller bracket with 4 players can be a good starting point, especially if you're short on time or have a smaller group of guests. This will allow for a quick and intense tournament with a clear winner.\n\nIf you have a larger group of guests, an 8-player bracket can be more exciting, with more games and more opportunities for upsets. However, keep in mind that this will take longer to complete, and you'll need to plan accordingly.\n\n**Game Length:**\n\nFor a tournament, you'll want to keep the games relatively short to keep the pace of the event moving. Here are some options:\n\n* 5-minute quarters: This is a good starting point, as it allows for a decent amount of gameplay without dragging on too long.\n* 3-minute quarters: If you're short on time or want to fit in more games, you can reduce the quarter length to 3 minutes. This will make the games more fast-paced and exciting.\n\n**Tournament Format:**\n\nYou can choose a single-elimination format, where the winner of each game advances to the next round, and the loser is eliminated. This is a great way to create a sense of urgency and importance around each game.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a round-robin format, where each player plays every other player in their group, and the player with the best record advances to the next round. This format is more forgiving, but it can take longer to complete.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to set a time limit for each game, so players know how much time they have to complete their game.\n* Consider having a \"mercy rule\" in place, where the game ends early if one team is ahead by a certain number of points (e.g., 14 points).\n* Have a plan in place for tiebreakers, in case two or more players are tied in the standings.\n* Encourage players to trash talk and have fun! A little friendly competition can add to the excitement of the tournament.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to hosting a fun and engaging Madden NFL tournament that your guests will love!"
