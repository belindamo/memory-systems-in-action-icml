They have a lovely patio area with tables and chairs where you can enjoy your meal while soaking up some sunshine. It's a great spot to people-watch and take in the city atmosphere. Just keep in mind that the outdoor seating is on a first-come, first-served basis, so you might want to arrive a bit early to snag a spot.\n\nAdditionally, if you're planning to sit outside, you might want to check their social media or call ahead to confirm their outdoor seating is open. Sometimes, they might have special events or closures, but it's usually available during peak brunch hours.\n\nNow that we have your brunch spot settled, what time were you thinking of meeting Emily? And would you like me to provide any additional recommendations for things to do or see in the area after your meal?"

      "content": "11 am is a great time for brunch, and then you'll have plenty of time for your hike afterwards.\n\nAs for hiking trails near the city center, I'm happy to recommend a few options. Since you're in the city center, you might not expect to find hiking trails nearby, but there are some great options within a short drive or even a walkable distance. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Riverview Trail**: This trail is about a 10-15 minute walk from the city center and offers a scenic hike along the river. It's a relatively easy 2-mile loop with great views of the city and the river.\n2. **City Creek Trail**: This trail is about a 10-minute drive from the city center and features a 3.5-mile out-and-back hike with some gentle inclines. You'll get to enjoy the scenery of the surrounding hills and maybe even spot some local wildlife.\n3. **Hilltop Park Trail**: This trail is about a 15-minute drive from the city center and offers a more challenging 4-mile loop with some steeper inclines. You'll be rewarded with panoramic views of the city and the surrounding mountains.\n\nAll of these trails are well-marked and well-maintained, and you can find more information about them online or through local outdoor groups.\n\nIf you're looking for something more leisurely, you could also consider a walk along the **Riverwalk**, which is a paved path that runs along the river and offers great views of the city. It's about a 5-minute walk from The Daily Grind, so you could even do a quick walk before or after your brunch.\n\nWhich of these options sounds appealing to you and Emily? Or would you like more information about any of these trails?"
