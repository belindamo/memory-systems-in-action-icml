  "content": "II. Fetal Development\n=====================\n\nAt twenty-seven weeks, the fetus undergoes a plethora of changes. Each development milestone strengthens the connection between mother and child.\n\na. Organ Development, Location, and Movement\n--------------------------------------------\n\nDuring this stage, the fetus's brain continues its rapid growth, developing more distinct grooves and indentations. The lungs are maturing, producing a substance called surfactant, which helps them expand and contract. The eyes, now wide open, sport fully formed eyelids. Though vision is still blurry, the fetus can perceive light and dark.\n\nThe baby's position may change regularly, as it has ample space for movement within the womb. The fetus might be head down, feet first (breech), or lying sideways (transverse). It's normal for the baby to change positions frequently, but most will settle into a head-down position by the end of pregnancy.\n\nb. Size, Shape, and Weight\n--------------------------\n\nAt twenty-seven weeks, the fetus resembles a small, plump baby, measuring about 14.4 inches (36.6 cm) in length and weighing around 1.9 pounds (875 grams). Soft, downy hair called lanugo covers the baby's body, while a protective waxy substance called vernix caseosa protects its delicate skin.\n\nc. Signs of a Healthy Fetus\n---------------------------\n\nA healthy fetus at twenty-seven weeks will exhibit regular movements, which may feel like kicks, rolls, or even hiccups. Most women feel at least ten movements within two hours. However, each baby is unique, and some may be more active than others. Expectant mothers should communicate with their healthcare providers about their baby's movement patterns.\n\nd. Nutrition for Fetal Development\n----------------------------------\n\nA nutritious diet is crucial for the growing fetus. Expectant mothers should consume a well-balanced diet rich in protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins, such as folic acid and vitamin D. Key food groups include lean meats, fish, dairy products, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Prenatal vitamins can help supplement the necessary nutrients for optimal fetal development.\n\nThat's the second part, \"Fetal Development,\" of the article.
