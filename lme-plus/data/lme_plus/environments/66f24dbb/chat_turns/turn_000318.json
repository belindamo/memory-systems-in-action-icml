Here's a classic recipe with a hint of apple cider:\n\n**Apple Cider Donuts Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup whole milk\n* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* 2 large eggs\n* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n* 1/2 cup apple cider (chilled)\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* Confectioners' sugar, for dusting (optional)\n* Cinnamon sugar, for coating (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and yeast.\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, egg, and melted butter.\n3. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a smooth batter forms.\n4. Add the apple cider, vanilla extract, and mix until fully incorporated.\n5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.\n6. Preheat the oil in a deep frying pan or a deep fryer to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n7. Once the oil is hot, use a cookie scoop or a spoon to drop the dough into the oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.\n8. Fry the donuts for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.\n9. Remove the donuts from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n10. Dust the donuts with confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar (if desired) and serve warm.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to use cold apple cider for the best flavor.\n* If you don't have apple cider, you can substitute it with a mixture of 1/2 cup water and 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar.\n* For an extra crispy coating, you can chill the donuts in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before frying.\n* Be careful when working with hot oil, and never leave it unattended.\n\nThese donuts will pair perfectly with your butternut squash soup, and the apple cider flavor will complement the sweet and spicy notes in the soup. Enjoy!",
