Government regulations: Governments can establish and enforce environmental regulations that require corporations to operate in more sustainable ways, such as stringent emissions standards, waste disposal regulations, and penalties for violations. Additionally, governments can also provide incentives for businesses that invest in sustainability practices.\n\n2. Corporate Sustainability Reporting: Companies can be held accountable for their sustainability efforts through Sustainability reporting. This type of reporting provides information on a company's environmental, social and economic performance that is made available to the public. This information can help stakeholders understand the company's sustainability performance and will also encourage the business to focus more on sustainability.\n\n3. Investor Pressure: Investors, including institutional investors such as pension funds, as well as individuals, can pressure companies to act more sustainably. They can use their influence as shareholders to demand more transparency regarding corporate environmental impacts and policies. This can help raise awareness of sustainability and create a business environment where sustainability is a priority.\n\n4. Consumer Pressure: Consumers can also put pressure on companies by boycotting brands that engage in unsustainable practices and instead choosing to support companies that prioritize sustainability. This can create a shift in the business world towards more sustainable practices.\n\n5. Sustainability Certifications: Corporations may be recognized for their sustainability efforts by third party independent sustainable certification organizations. For example, a company may receive a certification for meeting certain environmental requirements, policies and procedures. These types of certifications lend credibility and transparency to the company's sustainability efforts and help to hold them accountable.",
