Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Chocolate Ganache**: Make a rich and creamy chocolate ganache by heating up non-dairy milk with vegan chocolate chips and a pinch of salt. Let it cool and thicken, then spread or drizzle it over the cake.\n2. **Vegan Buttercream**: Whip up a vegan buttercream using a non-dairy milk, vegan butter, and powdered sugar. You can flavor it with vanilla or cocoa powder for a chocolatey twist.\n3. **Fresh Fruit**: Top your cake with fresh fruit like strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries for a sweet and colorful touch. You can arrange them in a pattern or create a fruit \"crown\" around the top of the cake.\n4. **Chocolate Shavings or Chips**: Sprinkle shaved vegan chocolate or chocolate chips over the top of the cake for a simple yet elegant look.\n5. **Coconut Whipped Cream**: Whip up a batch of coconut whipped cream using full-fat coconut milk and a sweetener like maple syrup.
