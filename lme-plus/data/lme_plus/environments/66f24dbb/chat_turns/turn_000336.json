  "content": "Here's my next response:\n\nI'm really hoping that volunteering at the animal shelter will help me meet some new people. I've been relying too much on social media to feel connected, and it's just not the same as having real conversations with people. Like I mentioned, last week was especially tough - I went four days without having a single conversation with someone in person, which was really isolating. But I'm trying to focus on the positives and take small steps towards changing that. Do you have any tips on how to make the most of my volunteer experience and meet new people?",
