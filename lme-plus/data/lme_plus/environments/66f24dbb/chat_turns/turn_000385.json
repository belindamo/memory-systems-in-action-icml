  "content": "This paper argues for the use of computational approaches to ethnography as a field of study that involves computational descriptive phenomenology. The methodology proposed in this paper is based on the idea that ethnography can be used to study the experiences and perspectives of non-human entities, such as AI systems. The paper presents a case study in which the authors used computational methods to interview an AI system and analyzed the data obtained from this interview. The findings of this study suggest that computational ethnography can be a valuable tool for understanding the experiences and perspectives of AI systems, and that it can be used to gain insights into how these systems think and operate. The paper concludes by arguing that computational ethnography is a valuable approach for transdisciplinary anthropological research and that it has the potential to reveal new insights into the nature of AI systems.",
