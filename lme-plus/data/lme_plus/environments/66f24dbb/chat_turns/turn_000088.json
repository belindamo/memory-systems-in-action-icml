  "content": "I think I'll start by applying my guitar knowledge to the ukulele and see how that goes. Since I've already been practicing guitar for a few weeks, I figure it'll be easier to transfer some of that knowledge over to the ukulele. Plus, I've heard that ukulele chords are similar to guitar chords, just with fewer strings, so I'm hoping that'll make it easier to learn. Do you think that's a good approach, or should I start from scratch with ukulele-specific resources?",
