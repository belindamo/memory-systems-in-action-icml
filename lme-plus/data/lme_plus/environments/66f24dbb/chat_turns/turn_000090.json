  "content": "I think I'll start by applying my guitar knowledge to the ukulele and then gradually incorporate ukulele-specific techniques and characteristics as I become more comfortable with the instrument. I've heard that the ukulele has a more delicate sound than the guitar, so I'll need to adjust my playing style and technique to accommodate that. I'm looking forward to exploring the ukulele's unique sound and characteristics, and I'm excited to see how my music theory knowledge will help me in this process.",
