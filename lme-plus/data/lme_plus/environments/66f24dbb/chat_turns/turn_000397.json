How do you see it impacting the field?\"\n\nYoshua Bengio: \"I think imagination is crucial in AI research. It allows us to think beyond what's currently possible and imagine new possibilities. Without imagination, we would be limited to solving only the problems that we already know how to solve.\"\n\nKarim Jerbi: \"I completely agree. But how do you think we can foster imagination in AI systems?\"\n\nYoshua Bengio: \"Well, one way is to expose AI systems to a diverse range of data and experiences. By doing so, it allows them to develop a broader understanding of the world and think of new solutions that we may not have considered before. Additionally, we should encourage interdisciplinary collaboration between experts from different fields, to bring different perspectives and ideas to the table.\"\n\nKarim Jerbi: \"That's an interesting approach. I've also been thinking about the relationship between creativity and reality in AI research. How do you think it influences the field?\"\n\nYoshua Bengio: \"I think the relationship between creativity and reality is very important in AI research. Our perception of reality influences the problems we choose to solve and the solutions we come up with. By understanding how our perception of reality shapes our creative process, we can create AI systems that are better equipped to solve real-world problems.\"\n\nKarim Jerbi: \"Yes, I couldn't agree more. The ability to understand and shape the relationship between creativity and reality is key to creating AI systems that are truly beneficial to humanity.\"",
