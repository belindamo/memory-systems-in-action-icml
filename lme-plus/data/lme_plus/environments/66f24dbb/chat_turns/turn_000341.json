But kudos to you for staying positive and recognizing that small win with Alex last week!\n\nIt's great that you're not giving up and are trying a new approach with the photography class. Sometimes, a change of scenery or a more structured environment can make a big difference in meeting new people and building connections.\n\nThe fact that you had a decent conversation with Alex last week is a great starting point. It shows that you're capable of connecting with others who share your passion for photography. Now, it's just a matter of finding the right setting and people to build on that momentum.\n\nRemember that building connections takes time, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on being your awesome self, being open-minded, and showing genuine interest in others. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't click with everyone immediately. Just enjoy the process, learn from the class, and see where things go.\n\nIn the class, try to sit near people who seem friendly and interested in photography, and strike up conversations during breaks or after class. You might find that you have more in common with your classmates than you think! \n\nKeep me posted on how the class goes, and I hope you meet some amazing people who share your passion for photography!",
