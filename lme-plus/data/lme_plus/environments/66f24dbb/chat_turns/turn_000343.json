It takes time to get settled, explore your new surroundings, and build a social network from scratch.\n\nIt's great that you're taking proactive steps to meet new people and build connections in your new neighborhood. The photography class is a fantastic way to start, and I'm sure you'll meet some like-minded people who share your passion for photography.\n\nIn addition to the class, you might want to consider exploring your new neighborhood, trying out local cafes, restaurants, or parks, and striking up conversations with the people you meet. You could also try joining local Facebook groups or online forums for people in your area, which can be a great way to connect with others who share similar interests.\n\nRemember, building connections takes time, and it's okay to start small. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't click with everyone right away. Just focus on being friendly, approachable, and open to new experiences, and you'll increase your chances of meeting new people and building meaningful connections.\n\nKeep in mind that it's normal to feel a bit lonely or disconnected when you're in a new environment. But with time, patience, and effort, you'll start to build a new social network and feel more at home in your new neighborhood.\n\nGood luck with the photography class, and I hope you meet some amazing people who share your passion for photography!",
