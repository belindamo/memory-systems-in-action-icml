I've been attending this weekly meetup group for photographers, but it's been a struggle to really connect with others. I feel like I'm on the outside looking in, like I don't really belong. But I'm trying to stay positive and focus on the fact that I did have a decent conversation with someone named Alex last week. Maybe this class will be a better opportunity to build some meaningful connections.",
