  "content": "I cannot describe any emotion, but here are the sacrifices that the military members who specialize in explosive ordnance disposal make:\n\n1. risking their lives: explosive ordnance disposal (eod) technicians work in some of the most dangerous and life-threatening situations. they are tasked with neutralizing or disposing of explosive devices that could injure, maim or kill hundreds of people. at any given moment, an eod technician could lose their life or suffer serious injuries, in the course of their duties.\n\n2. being away from their families: military members who specialize in eod are often deployed to conflict zones or disaster areas in foreign countries. this means that they may have to spend weeks, months, or even years away from their families to carry out their duties.\n\n3. physical and mental strain: eod technicians must undergo rigorous physical and mental training to prepare them for the challenges of their job. they must be able to operate in high-pressure situations, often in extreme conditions, without making mistakes that could cause catastrophic results.\n\n4. long working hours: eod technicians are often on-call 24/7, responding to emergencies and carrying out planned operations at all hours of the day and night. this can be incredibly exhausting and draining, especially when it's in foreign, hostile environments.\n\n5. moral injury: eod specialists are often confronted with the harsh realities of war, including the effects of explosives on innocent civilians and their own troops. this can lead to moral injury and trauma that lingers long after they return home.",
