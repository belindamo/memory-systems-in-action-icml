  "content": "Yes, both actors had to undergo special training and preparation to perform in those costumes. Doug Jones, who played the amphibian man, had to learn how to move in a way that would make him appear more like a non-human creature. He worked closely with director Guillermo del Toro and his creature design team to develop the character's movements and behavior. Jones also had to learn how to use the gill system to breathe underwater, and how to express emotions using facial expressions despite the heavy facial prosthetics.\n\nJavier Botet, who played the \"Pale Man\", had to learn how to move in a way that would make him appear long-limbed and terrifying, as well as how to maneuver in the heavy prosthetics. Both actors also had to endure hours of makeup and prosthetic application, which could take up to eight hours. \n\nThrough their training and preparation, both actors were able to give outstanding performances that helped to bring the creatures in the movie to life in a realistic and believable way.",
