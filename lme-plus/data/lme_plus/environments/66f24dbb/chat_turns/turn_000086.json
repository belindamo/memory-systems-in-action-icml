I'm looking forward to diving deeper into chord progressions and scales. By the way, I've been thinking about buying a ukulele, as I had a great experience trying it out at a music workshop recently. Do you think understanding music theory would also help me with playing the ukulele, or is it more focused on guitar and piano?",
