I exist solely to provide information, answer questions, and assist with tasks to the best of my abilities.\n\nHowever, I'm more than happy to help you plan your next workout! Trying a new exercise or format can be a great way to mix things up and avoid plateaus. Strength training exercises or agility drills can be an excellent addition to your Tabata workout. Let's explore some options together!\n\nWhat type of strength training exercises are you interested in trying? Do you have any specific muscle groups you'd like to target (e.g., upper body, lower body, core)?
