  "content": "I don't have personal experiences, but i can say that india has a diverse range of folk music, and each type brings unique flavors of the region it belongs to. some of these folk music forms are still very popular in india and are performed at festivals and other cultural events. \n\nfor instance, during the festival of bihu in assam, people perform the bihu dance and music to celebrate the arrival of spring. similarly, in maharashtra, lavani music is still popular, and it is often performed at cultural festivals and gatherings. \n\nin my understanding, the experience of witnessing and being part of such cultural events is unforgettable and provides a deep insight into the rich cultural heritage of india.",
