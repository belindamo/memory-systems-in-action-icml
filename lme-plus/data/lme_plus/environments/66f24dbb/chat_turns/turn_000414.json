  "content": "I'm thinking of getting a cable organizer box or a desk cable management system. I've got a lot of cables and wires cluttering up my workspace, and I want something that can hold everything neatly. My laptop bag is actually a black Lenovo one with extra padding for my 15.6-inch laptop, and it cost me around $40. I got it from Amazon on 15th March, and it's been doing a great job of protecting my laptop so far. Anyway, back to the cable management system... I don't have a specific budget in mind, but I'm open to suggestions.",
