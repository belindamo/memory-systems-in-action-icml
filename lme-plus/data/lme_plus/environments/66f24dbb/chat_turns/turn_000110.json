  "content": "As an Airbnb host, there are several ways you can upsell guests who are in town for weddings. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. Offer transportation services: Guests attending weddings often require transportation to and from the venue. Consider partnering with a local transportation company or providing a shuttle service to the wedding venue. This can be a great way to offer convenience and peace of mind to your guests.\n2. Provide pre-wedding services: Many guests attending weddings will be getting ready at your Airbnb. You can offer pre-wedding services such as hair and makeup services, or even have a stylist come to your Airbnb to offer these services to your guests.\n3. Stock your Airbnb with wedding essentials: Stock your Airbnb with wedding essentials such as extra hangers, garment steamers, and ironing boards. You can also provide a wedding emergency kit that includes things like safety pins, stain remover, and fashion tape.\n4. Recommend local activities: Many guests attending weddings will be in town for several days. Offer recommendations for local activities such as winery tours, spa services, or other local attractions that they can enjoy during their stay.\n5. Provide welcome baskets: Welcome your guests with a basket of local goodies, such as a bottle of wine, chocolates, and a list of local restaurants that they can try out while they're in town.\n6. Offer a post-wedding brunch: If the wedding venue is nearby, you can offer to host a post-wedding brunch for your guests. This can be a great way to provide an extra special touch and allow guests to relax and unwind after the wedding festivities.",
