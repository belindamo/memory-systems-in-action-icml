  "content": "It sounds like you've done your due diligence in troubleshooting the bluescreen issue, and replacing the graphics card is a good next step.\n\nRegarding the wireless mouse, it's great that you're considering upgrading! A 12,000 DPI optical sensor and customizable buttons are excellent features for a gaming mouse. The price of $60 seems reasonable, but as I mentioned earlier, it's essential to research the brand, read reviews, and compare prices to ensure you're getting the best value.\n\nHere are some questions to consider:\n\n* Is the brand known for producing high-quality gaming mice?\n* What do reviews say about the mouse's performance, accuracy, and durability?\n* Are the customizable buttons easy to use and program?\n* How long does the battery last, and is it rechargeable?\n* Are there any other features that are important to you, such as ergonomic design, adjustable weight, or RGB lighting?\n\nIf you've answered these questions and feel confident in the mouse's quality and value, $60 might be a good deal. However, I'd recommend checking out other options and reading more reviews to ensure you're making an informed decision.\n\nRemember, a good gaming mouse can make a significant difference in your gaming experience, so it's worth taking the time to find the right one for your needs and budget.",
