Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Less competition**: Weekends are often crowded with live streams, especially in popular niches. Weekday evenings might offer less competition, giving you a better chance to stand out.\n2. **Targeted audience**: If your target audience is professionals, students, or people with regular 9-to-5 jobs, they might be more available and engaged during weekday evenings.\n3. **Increased visibility**: Streaming during the week can help you reach a different audience segment that might not be active on weekends.\n4. **Improved consistency**: Adding a weekday stream can help you maintain a consistent schedule and keep your audience engaged throughout the week.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Viewership might be lower**: Weekday evenings can be busy for many people, with family commitments, work, or other activities competing for their attention.\n2. **Scheduling conflicts**: You might need to adjust your personal schedule to accommodate the weekday stream, which could be challenging if you have other commitments.\n3. **Burnout risk**: Adding an extra stream to your schedule can lead to burnout if you're not careful. Make sure you're not overcommitting yourself.\n\nTo mitigate the risks, consider the following:\n\n1. **Start small**: Begin with a bi-weekly or monthly weekday stream and see how it performs before committing to a regular schedule.\n2. **Choose a consistent time**: Pick a specific time and day that works for you and stick to it, so your audience knows when to expect your weekday stream.\n3. **Promote your weekday stream**: Make sure to promote your weekday stream as much as your weekend streams to attract a consistent audience.\n4. **Monitor and adjust**: Keep an eye on your viewership and engagement during weekday streams and adjust your schedule or content as needed.\n\nIf you decide to add a weekday stream, Tuesday or Thursday evenings could be good options. These days tend to be less busy than Mondays or Fridays, which are often reserved for tackling new tasks or wrapping up projects.\n\nUltimately, the decision to stream on a weekday evening depends on your target audience, your personal schedule, and your content strategy. If you're willing to experiment and adapt, it could be a great way to expand your reach and engagement.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards trying a weekday stream, or do you have any other questions about this topic?",
