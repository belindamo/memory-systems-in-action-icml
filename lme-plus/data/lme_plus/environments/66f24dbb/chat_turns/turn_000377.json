Here are some ideas to try:\n\n1. **Low-angle shots**: Get low and shoot from a worm's-eye view to add drama and emphasize the city's grandeur.\n2. **High-angle shots**: Shoot from a high vantage point, like a rooftop or a hill, to capture a bird's-eye view of the city.\n3. **Dutch angles**: Tilt your camera to create a sense of dynamic tension and add visual interest to your compositions.\n4. **Reflections**: Look for reflective surfaces like windows, puddles, or mirrors to add depth and creativity to your cityscapes.\n5. **Frames within frames**: Use architectural elements like archways, doorways, or bridges to create frames within your composition.\n6. **Play with negative space**: Experiment with incorporating negative space to create a sense of simplicity and emphasize the subject.\n\n**Upgrading to a Full-Frame Camera:**\n\nThe Canon EOS 5D Mark IV is an excellent choice! Full-frame cameras offer several advantages over crop sensor cameras, especially in low-light conditions and when it comes to depth of field. Here are some benefits you can expect:\n\n1. **Improved low-light performance**: Full-frame sensors tend to perform better in low-light conditions, resulting in cleaner images with less noise.\n2. **Shallow depth of field**: With a full-frame camera, you can achieve a shallower depth of field, making it easier to isolate your subject and create a sense of intimacy.\n3. **Increased dynamic range**: Full-frame cameras typically have a wider dynamic range, which means they can capture a greater range of tones and colors.\n4. **Better image quality**: Full-frame cameras tend to produce images with more detail, color accuracy, and overall quality.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that upgrading to a full-frame camera also means:\n\n1. **Larger and heavier body**: Full-frame cameras are often larger and heavier than crop sensor cameras.\n2. **More expensive lenses**: Full-frame lenses are generally more expensive than crop sensor lenses.\n3. **Increased storage needs**: With higher resolution and larger file sizes, you'll need more storage space for your images.\n\nBefore making the upgrade, consider the following:\n\n1. **Assess your current gear**: Make sure you're getting the most out of your current camera and lenses.\n2. **Define your goals**: Determine what you want to achieve with your photography and whether a full-frame camera will help you reach those goals.\n3. **Budget and cost**: Consider the cost of the camera, lenses, and accessories, as well as any potential upgrades to your computer and storage needs.\n\nIf you've outgrown your current camera and want to take your cityscape photography to the next level, the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV is an excellent choice. However, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision based on your needs and goals.",
