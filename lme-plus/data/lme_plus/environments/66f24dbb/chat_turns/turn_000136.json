  "content": "The realistic and detailed creatures in The Shape of Water were created using a combination of practical effects and digital animation. The actors who played the amphibian man and the other creature were costumed in intricate prosthetic makeup, including complete body suits, gloves, and facial prosthetics that were hand-painted to look like scales or skin. Additionally, the creatures were brought to life through computer-generated imagery, or CGI, with meticulous attention to detail, such as the way their skin moved and their eyes glittered underwater. The filmmakers also used animatronics and puppetry to achieve certain effects, such as the movement of the amphibian man's gills or the movement of water around his body. Ultimately, the use of all of these techniques helped to create the incredibly realistic, detailed, and believable creatures that brought the film to life.",
