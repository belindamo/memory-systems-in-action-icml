  "content": "Yes, the Hobbiton movie set tour is a very popular and highly recommended experience. Visitors can tour the movie set and see the Hobbit houses, the Party Tree, the Green Dragon Inn, and other iconic locations from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movies. The tour also provides interesting insights into the filming and production process, and visitors will have the chance to learn about the history and culture of the Waikato region, where the set is located. The tours usually last for around two hours and include a complimentary drink at the Green Dragon Inn. Reservations are highly recommended as the tours can sell out quickly.",
