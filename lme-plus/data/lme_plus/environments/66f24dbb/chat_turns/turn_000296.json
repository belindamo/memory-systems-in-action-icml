  "content": "You're making great progress! The \"Touch Once\" rule and categorizing papers into piles will definitely help you make a dent in that paper clutter.\n\nFor a file organization system in your desk drawers, I recommend a combination of the following:\n\n1. **File Folders with Labels**: Use sturdy file folders with clear labels to categorize your files. You can use a label maker or write the labels by hand. Consider using a consistent labeling scheme, such as using a specific color or font for each category.\n2. **File Drawer Organizers**: Invest in file drawer organizers or dividers to separate your files within the drawer. These can be adjustable or fixed, depending on your needs.\n3. ** Hanging File Folders**: Use hanging file folders with tabs to store files that you need to access frequently. These are great for storing files that you need to refer to often, but don't need to keep on your desk.\n4. **Desk File Sorter**: Consider a desk file sorter or a file organizer with separate compartments to store files on your desk. This can help keep your workspace organized and make it easy to find what you need.\n\n**File Organization Tips:**\n\n1. **Keep Frequently Used Files Accessible**: Store your most frequently used files in an easy-to-reach location, such as the top drawer or in a desk file sorter.\n2. **Store Less Frequently Used Files**: Store less frequently used files in lower drawers or on higher shelves to keep them out of the way but still accessible.\n3. **Use a Consistent Naming Convention**: Use a consistent naming convention for your files and folders to make it easy to find what you need. For example, you could use a \"Year-Month-Category\" format for your files.\n4. **Purge Regularly**: Set aside time to review your files regularly and purge any unnecessary or outdated documents.\n\nSome popular file organization systems for desk drawers include:\n\n1. **The Smead File System**: A popular and customizable file organization system that uses color-coded labels and folders.\n2. **The Pendaflex File System**: A file organization system that uses hanging file folders with tabs and a customizable labeling system.\n3. **The FileThis File System**: A file organization system that uses a combination of file folders, hanging file folders, and a customizable labeling system.\n\nRemember, the key to a successful file organization system is to create a system that works for you and stick to it. Experiment with different methods and products until you find what helps you stay organized and productive.",
