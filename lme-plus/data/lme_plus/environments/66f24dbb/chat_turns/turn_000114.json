I'm glad you found the recommendations helpful.\n\nPaulette Jiles and Martha Hall Kelly are both excellent choices. \"News of the World\" by Paulette Jiles is a beautifully written novel that explores the complexities of human relationships and the power of storytelling. And \"Lilac Girls\" by Martha Hall Kelly is a heart-wrenching and powerful novel that sheds light on a lesser-known aspect of WWII history.\n\nIt's great to hear that you participated in an online book club discussion on Facebook Live! \"The Nightingale\" is a powerful and emotional novel that lends itself well to discussion. Revisiting the characters and themes with other readers can be a great way to gain new insights and perspectives. Online book clubs are a fantastic way to connect with fellow readers and discuss books in a convenient and accessible way.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what did you think of \"The Nightingale\"? What aspects of the book did you and your book club discuss?",
