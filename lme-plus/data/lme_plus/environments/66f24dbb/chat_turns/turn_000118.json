It's great that your book club had a nuanced discussion about it!\n\nRegarding books that explore the theme of women's roles in wartime, I have several recommendations:\n\n1. **The Alice Network** by Kate Quinn: This novel tells the story of two women, a socialite and a spy, during WWI. It's a fascinating exploration of women's roles in the war effort and the impact of their experiences on their lives.\n2. **The Women in the Castle** by Jessica Shattuck: This novel follows three women in Germany during and after WWII, exploring their struggles, sacrifices, and resilience in the face of war and occupation.\n3. **Those Who Save Us** by Jenna Blum: This novel explores the complex relationship between a mother and daughter during WWII, delving into the themes of love, sacrifice, and survival.\n4. **The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society** by Mary Ann Shaffer: While not exclusively focused on women's roles, this epistolary novel explores the experiences of women on the island of Guernsey during the German occupation, highlighting their resourcefulness and resilience.\n5. **The Soldier's Wife** by Pam Jenoff: This novel follows a young German woman's struggles to survive and resist during WWII, exploring the moral complexities of living under occupation.\n\nThese books offer powerful and thought-provoking explorations of women's experiences during wartime, and I hope you find something that interests you!\n\nDo you have a preference for books set during a specific time period or conflict, or are you open to exploring different eras and settings?",
