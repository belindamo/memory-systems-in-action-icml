I'm especially interested in Paulette Jiles and Martha Hall Kelly. I think I'll check out their books next. By the way, I recently participated in an online book club discussion on Facebook Live, where we discussed \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah. It was a great experience to revisit the characters and themes with other readers.",
