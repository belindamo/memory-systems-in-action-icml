  "content": "I think I'll start by learning some basic fingerpicking patterns and strumming styles, and then gradually experiment with different techniques and styles as I become more comfortable with the instrument. I've heard that ukulele fingerpicking patterns can be quite intricate and delicate, so I'll need to develop my finger independence and dexterity to play them smoothly. I'm also interested in exploring different genres, such as traditional Hawaiian music and folk, to see how they incorporate the ukulele into their sound.\n\nBy the way, I've been thinking about my keyboard playing and composition skills, and I was wondering if you could recommend any resources for learning to read sheet music. I've been relying on tabs and chord charts, but I think learning to read sheet music would really help me improve my composition skills and understanding of music theory.",
