  "content": "Yes, the actors who played the creatures, Doug Jones and Javier Botet, did find it difficult to perform in those costumes and makeup as they were quite intricate and heavy. Doug Jones, who played the amphibian man, had to wear a full-body suit which weighed around 75 pounds and had to be fitted and painted by hand. The suit also had a special water-filled layer that helped to simulate the creature's underwater movements. Jones also had to wear contact lenses that distorted his vision and had to learn how to breathe through a specially designed gill system. Javier Botet, who played the \"Pale Man\", had to wear a similar full-body suit which was designed to give him a long-limbed and emaciated appearance. \n\nDespite the challenges, both actors have credited their costumes and prosthetics with helping them to fully immerse themselves in their roles and bring their characters to life on screen.",
