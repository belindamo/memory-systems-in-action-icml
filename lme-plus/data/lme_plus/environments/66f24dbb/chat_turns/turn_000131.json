  "content": "I think I'll start by logging my workouts and using a habit tracker to monitor my consistency. I'll also set specific goals for myself, like completing 8 rounds in 4 weeks, and reward myself when I reach those milestones. Additionally, I'll try to mix up my workouts by changing the exercises and adding new ones to keep things interesting. And, I'll remind myself of my \"why\" - I want to improve my cardiovascular endurance and feel more confident in my kickboxing classes. Thanks for the tips!",
