If you enjoy her style of historical fiction, here are some similar authors you might like:\n\n1. **Paulette Jiles**: Known for her lyrical prose and meticulous research, Jiles' novels like \"News of the World\" and \"The Color of Lightning\" explore the American West and Civil War era.\n2. **Helen Simonson**: This author's debut novel, \"Major Pettigrew's Last Stand\", is a historical fiction gem that explores post-WWII England. Her writing is reminiscent of Hannah's in its depth and character development.\n3. **Martha Hall Kelly**: Kelly's \"Lilac Girls\" is a powerful and emotional historical fiction novel that explores the lives of three women during WWII. Her writing style and attention to historical detail are similar to Hannah's.\n4. **Susan Meissner**: Meissner's novels, such as \"A Bridge Across the Ocean\" and \"Secrets of a Charmed Life\", often explore the lives of women during times of war and social change.
