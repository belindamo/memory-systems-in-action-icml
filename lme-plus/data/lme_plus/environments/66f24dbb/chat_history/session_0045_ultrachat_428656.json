These guidelines promote sustainable film production practices by recommending that filmmakers work in collaboration with local communities, minimize their carbon footprint and waste, and respect and protect natural and cultural resources.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Conservation works with filmmakers to ensure that filming activities on public land comply with environmental sustainability standards, ecological impact assessments, and cultural considerations. These measures help to ensure that filming in New Zealand is sustainable, respectful and beneficial for both the environment and the local communities."
