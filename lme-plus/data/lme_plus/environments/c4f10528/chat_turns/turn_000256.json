  "content": "Okay, I can auto-generate Legolas' stats using their race, class, and background story. Here are Legolas' stats:\n\n* Strength: 12\n* Dexterity: 16\n* Constitution: 14\n* Intelligence: 13\n* Wisdom: 16\n* Charisma: 14\n\nThese stats are balanced and appropriate for a non-binary elf ranger who is lawful good and grew up in a large elven city. The high dexterity will help Legolas with their ranged attacks and their defense, and the high wisdom will help them understand the natural world and cast spells. The high charisma will help them interact with others, and the average strength will reflect their focus on finesse over brute force.\n\nDo you want to make any changes to Legolas' stats, or are you happy with them as they are? Let me know, and we can move on to creating the next character.",
