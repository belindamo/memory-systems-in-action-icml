You're the only friend I've ever had.\"\n\nMacaque looked at Pigsy, who gave him a nod. \"Well, I suppose I can stick around a little longer,\" he said, trying to sound nonchalant.\n\nMK's face lit up. \"Thank you, thank you!\"\n\nMacaque put his arm around MK's shoulder. \"Don't worry, kid. I won't leave you high and dry.\"\n\nPigsy grinned. \"I don't mind having another monkey around to help with the shop.\"\n\nMacaque laughed. \"You got it, Pigsy. Just don't expect me to do the dishes.\"\n\nThey all chuckled, relieved and happy to be together.",
