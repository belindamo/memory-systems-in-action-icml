  "content": "It looks like you're trying to run the Python file by typing its path directly into the command prompt. However, this is not the correct way to run a Python script. Instead, you should open a command prompt, navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved, and then run the file using the `python` command followed by the file name. For example:\n```makefile\nC:\\Users\\Dan.QTIS> cd Desktop\\Dan-Special\\Tests\nC:\\Users\\Dan.QTIS\\Desktop\\Dan-Special\\Tests> python try2.py\n```\nRegarding the error message you provided, it appears to be a `SyntaxError` related to a line of code containing a mixture of Spanish and English text. It looks like this line may have been accidentally pasted into your code. I would recommend removing this line and making sure your code is written entirely in English.",
