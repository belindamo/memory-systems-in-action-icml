Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Purge and declutter**: Begin by removing everything from your cabinet and sorting items into three piles: keep, donate/sell, and discard. Be ruthless \u2013 if you haven't used it in the past year, it's probably safe to get rid of it.\n2. **Categorize and group**: Once you've purged your items, categorize them into groups like skincare, haircare, oral care, and miscellaneous.
