It seems like this is meant to be a filename containing your Google Cloud Speech API credentials, but you need to pass it as a string, like this:\n```python\nGOOGLE_CLOUD_SPEECH_CREDENTIALS = 'caramel-base-379922-9d9af53bf1a0.json'\n```\nMake sure that the file path is correct and that the JSON file containing your credentials is located in the same directory as your Python script.",
