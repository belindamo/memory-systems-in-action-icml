Curious, MK walked over to him and stood silently, waiting for him to finish.\n\nAfter a few moments, Macaque looked up and noticed MK standing there. \"Did you need something, young master?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" replied MK, \"I just saw you praying and wanted to join you.\"\n\nMacaque smiled and motioned for MK to sit beside him. \"Of course,\" he said, \"we have much to be thankful for tonight.\"\n\nAs they bowed their heads and closed their eyes, Macaque began his prayer. \"Thank you, oh great Jade Emperor, for sending the celestial army to aid us in our battle against Wukong and his minions. Thank you for keeping us safe and bringing us victory.\"\n\nMK echoed Macaque's words, adding his own gratitude. \"Thank you for bringing me to Pigsy and protecting me from harm. Thank you for Nezha and his kindness. And thank you for Macaque, who has become like family to me.\"\n\nMacaque opened his eyes and looked at MK. \"You have a good heart, young master,\" he said. \"And I am honored to be able to protect you and call you family.\"\n\nMK smiled, feeling grateful for the monkey's words. \"I'm lucky to have you, Macaque.\"\n\nWith their prayers finished, the two monkeys settled in for the night, feeling grateful for the blessings that had come their way.",
