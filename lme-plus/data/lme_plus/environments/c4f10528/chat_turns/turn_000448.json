You're safe now, mortal.\"\n\nMK's expression grew serious as he pleaded, \"Please don't go, Macaque. I don't want to be alone.\"\n\nMacaque's playful grin turned into a small smile as he looked at Pigsy, who gave him a nod of approval. \"I suppose I can stick around a while longer.\"\n\nMK beamed with gratitude, \"Thank you, Macaque! I don't know what I would do without you.\"\n\nMacaque chuckled, \"Don't worry about it. You're stuck with me for now.\"\n\nPigsy added with a smile, \"Looks like we got ourselves a new member of the noodle shop family.\"\n\nMacaque laughed, \"I don't know if I'm ready for that yet.\"\n\nNezha, who had been watching the exchange from a distance, approached the group. \"It seems like you've got everything under control here.\"\n\nMacaque turned to Nezha and nodded, \"Yeah, we do. Thanks for everything, Nezha.\"\n\nNezha smiled, \"No problem. I'm glad everything worked out for the best. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask.\"\n\nWith a final wave, Nezha took off into the sky, leaving the group behind.\n\nMK turned to Macaque and Pigsy with a smile, \"I can't believe everything that's happened. Thank you both for sticking by me.\"\n\nMacaque smiled and ruffled MK's hair, \"That's what friends are for, kid.\"\n\nPigsy chimed in, \"Now, let's go back to the shop and celebrate with some noodles!\"\n\nMK laughed and followed his new friends back to the noodle shop, grateful for the unexpected turn his life had taken.",
