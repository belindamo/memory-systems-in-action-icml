  "content": "The production design in \"Minari\" is indeed remarkable. The film's production designer, Yong Ok Lee, and her team did an outstanding job of recreating the 1980s rural Arkansas setting.\n\nAccording to interviews and behind-the-scenes features, the production design team conducted extensive research to ensure accuracy and authenticity. They poured over photographs, documents, and personal accounts from the 1980s to get a sense of the era's aesthetic, architecture, and way of life.\n\nTo recreate the rural Arkansas landscape, the team chose to film on location in Oklahoma, which offered a similar terrain and climate. They scouted out rural areas, farms, and small towns to find the perfect locations to build and dress the sets.\n\nFor the Yi family's farm, the team built a functional farm from scratch, including the farmhouse, barn, and outbuildings. They used a combination of traditional construction methods and modern materials to create a authentic and weathered look. The farm's surroundings, including the fields, gardens, and woods, were also meticulously dressed to reflect the changing seasons.\n\nCostume designer Susanna Song worked closely with the production design team to ensure a cohesive look. She drew inspiration from 1980s fashion, as well as traditional Korean clothing, to create a wardrobe that reflected the characters' cultural heritage and socioeconomic status. The costumes were often distressed and aged to give them a worn, lived-in look.\n\nThe team also paid attention to the smallest details, such as the props, set dressing, and even the family's car. They sourced vintage items from thrift stores, antique shops, and private collectors to add authenticity to the film's sets.\n\nThe research and preparation that went into creating the film's sets and costumes were meticulous and thorough. The production design team's hard work paid off, as the film's settings and characters feel deeply rooted in the 1980s rural Arkansas landscape.",
