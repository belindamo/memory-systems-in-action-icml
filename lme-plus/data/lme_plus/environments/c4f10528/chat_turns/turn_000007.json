Simmer for 5-7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is fully coated.\n6. **Season and serve:** Season the chicken tikka masala with salt to taste. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve over basmati rice or with naan bread.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a mixture of chicken breast and thighs for a more tender and juicy result.\n* Add some bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms to the masala sauce for extra flavor and texture.\n* For a creamier sauce, add more heavy cream or half-and-half.\n* Serve with a side of cucumber raita or papadum for a refreshing contrast.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe!
