  "content": "Excellent approach! Starting with a small amount of gochujang paste and adjusting to taste is the way to go.\n\n**Steak Recommendations**\n\nFor a Korean-style soy-ginger marinade with gochujang paste, I recommend using a steak with a good balance of marbling and tenderness. Here are some steak options that would pair well with this marinade:\n\n1. **Ribeye**: A rich, tender cut with a good amount of marbling, which will help to balance the bold flavors of the marinade.\n2. **Sirloin**: A leaner cut with a firmer texture, which will hold up well to the bold flavors of the marinade.\n3. **Flank Steak**: A lean and flavorful cut that's perfect for marinating, with a good balance of tenderness and chew.\n4. **Skirt Steak**: A flavorful and tender cut with a good amount of marbling, which will add depth to the dish.\n\n**Tips for Choosing the Right Steak**\n\n1. **Look for a good balance of marbling**: A moderate amount of marbling will help to keep the steak tender and flavorful.\n2. **Choose a steak with a good texture**: A steak with a firm, yet tender texture will hold up well to the marinade and grilling.\n3. **Opt for a thicker steak**: A thicker steak will allow for a more even distribution of the marinade and a nicer sear on the grill.\n\n**Grilling Tips**\n\n1. **Grill over medium-high heat**: Grill the steak over medium-high heat to achieve a nice sear and a tender interior.\n2. **Don't overcook**: Cook the steak to your desired level of doneness, but avoid overcooking, which can make the steak tough and dry.\n3. **Let it rest**: Let the steak rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving to allow the juices to redistribute.\n\nI hope this helps! Enjoy your Korean-style grilled steak, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions.",
