I also want to make sure I understand the policy details and limitations. Thanks for the tips! By the way, have you heard anything about Travelworld agency? I met some representatives at the travel expo last weekend, and they were promoting their new packages to South America. I'm really interested in visiting Brazil and Argentina someday.",
