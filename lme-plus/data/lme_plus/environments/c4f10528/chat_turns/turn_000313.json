  "content": "The film \"The Silent Forest\" I'm referring to is a drama feature film directed by Polish filmmaker Anna Zamecka, and it was indeed a world premiere at the Berlinale film festival, which I attended from February 10th to 17th. It was one of the highlights of my festival experience. Can you tell me more about Anna Zamecka's previous work and what kind of themes her films usually explore?",
