  "content": "Great to hear that you're looking to mix up your exercise routine and incorporate new strength training exercises!\n\nI'd be happy to recommend some exercises that target your core and arms. Here are a few:\n\n**Core Exercises:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise targets your entire core, including your abs, obliques, and lower back.\n2. **Russian twists**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold a weight or medicine ball and twist your torso from side to side, touching the weight to the ground beside you. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n3. **Leg raises**: Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n4. **Bicycle crunches**: Lie on your back with your hands behind your head and alternate bringing your knees towards your chest, as if pedaling a bicycle. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**Arm Exercises:**\n\n1. **Bicep curls**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold dumbbells with your palms facing forward. Curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders, then lower them back down. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n2. **Tricep dips**: Sit on the edge of a chair or bench with your hands gripping the edge and your feet flat on the floor. Lower your body down by bending your elbows until your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle, then straighten your arms to return to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n3. **Overhead tricep extensions**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell or weight overhead with both hands. Lower the weight behind your head, then raise it back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n4. **Hammer curls**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold dumbbells with your palms facing towards your body. Curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders, then lower them back down. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\nRemember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become stronger. It's also important to focus on proper form and technique to avoid injury.\n\nGlad to hear that the stationary bike is helping with your leg muscles! Low-impact exercises can be great for improving cardiovascular fitness and strengthening your muscles without putting excessive strain on your joints.\n\nI hope these exercises help you mix up your routine and target your core and arms effectively!",
