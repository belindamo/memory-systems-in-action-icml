Without your aid, Wukong might have killed MK.\"\n\nNezha smiled. \"It was the least I could do. You were instrumental in bringing the diamond snare back to us, and I owe you a debt of gratitude for that.\"\n\nMacaque chuckled. \"It was nothing, really. I'm just glad everything turned out okay in the end.\"\n\nNezha nodded. \"Yes, it did. And I have to admit, I'm surprised to see you here, Macaque. I thought you would have gone with your monkey brethren when they fled.\"\n\nMacaque shrugged. \"I had to see this through. Wukong was my friend once, but he was also dangerous. I couldn't let him continue to hurt innocent mortals like MK.\"\n\nNezha nodded in understanding. \"I see. Well, I won't keep you any longer. Take care, Macaque.\"\n\nMacaque nodded in return. \"You too, Nezha.\"\n\nAs Nezha soared away on his chariot, Macaque watched him go before turning and disappearing back into the forest.",
