  "content": "It seems that you are encountering a Unicode escape error, which occurs when Python tries to interpret special characters in a string, such as backslashes. To avoid this error, you can either use a raw string or escape the backslashes with another backslash.\n\nHere's an example using a raw string:\n```python\nGOOGLE_CLOUD_SPEECH_CREDENTIALS = r'C:\\Users\\Dan.QTIS\\Desktop\\Dan-Special\\Tests\\caramel-base-379922-9d9af53bf1a0.json'\n```\nAlternatively, you can escape the backslashes with another backslash like this:\n```python\nGOOGLE_CLOUD_SPEECH_CREDENTIALS = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Dan.QTIS\\\\Desktop\\\\Dan-Special\\\\Tests\\\\caramel-base-379922-9d9af53bf1a0.json'\n```",
