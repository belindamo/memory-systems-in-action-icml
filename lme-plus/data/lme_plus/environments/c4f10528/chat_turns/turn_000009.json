  "content": "Naan bread is a staple in Indian cuisine, and making it from scratch can be a great experience! While store-bought naan is convenient, homemade naan can be a game-changer. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Simple Naan Bread Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast\n* 1/2 cup lukewarm water\n* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n* Optional: garlic, cilantro, or other herbs for flavor\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Activate the yeast:** In a small bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-7 minutes, until the yeast is frothy and bubbly.\n2. **Mix the dough:** In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast mixture. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.\n3. **Knead the dough:** Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n4. **Rest the dough:** Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest in a warm place for 1-2 hours, until it has doubled in size.\n5. **Divide and shape:** Divide the dough into 6-8 equal portions. Shape each portion into a ball and then flatten it slightly into an oval shape.\n6. **Cook the naan:** Heat a non-stick skillet or tava over medium heat. Cook the naan for 1-2 minutes on each side, until it's golden brown and puffed up.\n7. **Brush with oil:** Brush the naan with melted butter or ghee, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a cast-iron skillet or a tava to cook the naan, as they retain heat well.\n* If you don't have a tava, you can cook the naan in a conventional oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 10-12 minutes.\n* To make garlic naan, mix in 1-2 cloves of minced garlic into the dough before kneading.\n* Experiment with different herbs and spices, like cilantro, cumin, or coriander, to create unique flavor profiles.\n\nWhile this recipe makes a delicious naan, you can always adjust it to your taste preferences. If you're short on time, store-bought naan is still a great option. Many Indian grocery stores or well-stocked supermarkets carry a variety of naan breads.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first batch of homemade naan doesn't turn out exactly as you hoped. Keep trying, and you'll soon be enjoying delicious, fresh naan bread with your Chicken Tikka Masala!",
