  "content": "can you count all the distinct concepts presented in the following: The pole of duality stretches from unified consciousness all the way to the superficial.\n\nDuality and Unity seems like a paradox, but if you look closer, you'll see that everything emanates from the unity and that the superficial appearances of a Dualistic universe are representations/projections of source.\n\nThe cosmic threads of causality all lead back to source and ALL that exists borrows energy from source.\n\nOn the most fundamental level of it all, it's all source recycling itself for eternity.\n\nBut you can't get lost in the abyss of prime consciousness, you must also firmly establish yourself in this universe to find true grounding, spiritual strength and the spiritual wholeness to pursue the self actualization necessary to shift the timeline into a more harmonious one.\n\nThe fostering of the individual's growth in the real world, is instrumental in their growth in every spiritual aspect.\n\nWithout a biological avatar body, we wouldn't be able to exist in a Dualistic universe and so spiritual growth wouldn't be possible.\n\nNecessity is the driver of invention, on a cosmic level. At some point in the projection from source, we arrived and needed somewhere to go.\n\nBeing one with the source was taken off the table, when your spirit individualized and became somewhat self aware.\n\nImagine a super futuristic computer, and you've been running a consciousness program on it for an eternity. The moment an individual sub-program gains sentience in the whole program, the coding in the entire system changes.\n\nEvery spiritual milestone and action an individual achieves, authors changes to the timeline. That's the very basis for Chaos Magic.\n\nSimply put, everything is chaos that you can mindfully orchestrate into harmony. The chain of cause and effect that leads to timeline changes, often starts on a psychological/behavioral level.\n\nThe 'magic' in Chaos Magic is a misnomer, leading one to think it involves woo or supernatural ability. When in actuality, every sort of altered state of consciousness an individual has leads to realization of how deep the chains of causality go inward.\n\nSeeing the entire chain of causality from the depth of your soul to the outer world you have actualized, and then realizing the innate ability to shift the timeline and author changes to it, is Chaos Magic.\n\nIt's metaprogramming meant to create a a desired effect on self, which translates into a desired effect on the world.\n\nYou become what you want to see from the world.\n\nRealizing this ability is self realization and it's the opposite of derealization.",
