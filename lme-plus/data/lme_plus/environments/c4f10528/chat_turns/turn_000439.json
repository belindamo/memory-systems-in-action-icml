Here are some of the countries that have been dominant in the new Olympic events that were added in recent years.\n\nSkateboarding:\nIn its debut year at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, skateboarding was dominated by athletes from Japan and Brazil. Japan won three out of the four gold medals, while Brazil won one gold medal and two silver medals.\n\nSport Climbing:\nSport climbing has been dominated by Japanese and Slovenian athletes in recent years. In the 2019 IFSC World Championships, Japanese athletes won two of the three women's events and one of the three men's events, while Slovenian athletes won the other two men's events and one of the women's events.\n\n3x3 Basketball:\nThe United States and China have been the most dominant teams in 3x3 basketball. The United States won the gold medal at the 2019 FIBA 3x3 World Cup, while China won the silver medal. However, the inaugural 3x3 basketball tournament at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics saw Latvian, Belgian, and Serbian teams taking home medals.\n\nKarate:\nKarate is a sport that originated in Japan; therefore, Japanese athletes have dominated in many karate competitions, including the Olympic Games. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Japan won three out of the eight karate events, with Spain, Italy, and Turkey also taking home medals.\n\nSurfing:\nSurfing is a relatively new sport to the Olympics, with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics being the first time it was contested. Brazilian surfers dominated, winning both the men's and women's gold medals. The United States and Japan also won medals in the event.\n\nOverall, it's important to note that the dominance of countries in new Olympic events can change from one competition to another, and is dependent on a variety of factors such as investment in the sport, coaching, and the quality of athletes.",
