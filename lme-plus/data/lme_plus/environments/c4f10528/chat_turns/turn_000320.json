  "content": "The casting process for \"Minari\" was indeed a crucial aspect of the film's success.\n\nAccording to Lee Isaac Chung, the casting process was a long and thorough one. He worked closely with casting director Julia Kim to find the right actors for each role. Chung wanted to find actors who could bring a sense of authenticity and vulnerability to their performances.\n\nFor the role of Anne, Chung wanted to find a young actress who could convey a sense of curiosity, independence, and playfulness. He auditioned many young girls, but ultimately chose Millicent Simmonds, who is deaf, for the role. Simmonds brought a unique perspective and authenticity to the role, having grown up in a similar environment as the character.\n\nFor the role of David, Chung wanted to find an actor who could capture the character's sense of wonder, energy, and sensitivity. After auditioning many young boys, he chose Alan Kim, who was making his film debut. Chung was impressed by Kim's natural charm and ability to convey emotion without dialogue.\n\nChung's approach to casting the children was centered around finding kids who were comfortable with improvisation and could respond naturally to the situations presented to them. He wanted the children to feel like they were living in the moment, rather than simply reciting lines.\n\nTo prepare the child actors for their roles, Chung and the casting team conducted extensive workshops and rehearsals. They also provided the children with a safe and nurturing environment, encouraging them to explore their characters and develop their own relationships with the other actors.\n\nThe adult cast, including Steven Yeun and Yeri Han, were also carefully chosen for their ability to bring depth and nuance to their roles. Chung wanted actors who could convey the complexities and subtleties of the adult characters, while also being able to connect with the children in a natural and authentic way.\n\nOverall, the casting process for \"Minari\" was a thoughtful and meticulous one, with Chung and his team seeking out actors who could bring a sense of authenticity and vulnerability to their performances. The end result is a film that feels deeply personal and emotionally resonant, thanks in large part to the talented cast.",
