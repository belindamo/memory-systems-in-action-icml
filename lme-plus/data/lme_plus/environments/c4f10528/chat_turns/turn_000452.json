  "content": "MK enters his room, still feeling a little overwhelmed by the events of the day. He starts to change into his pajamas when he hears a soft voice coming from the alcove. Curious, he walks over and peeks in to see Macaque kneeling on the ground with his hands pressed together in prayer.\n\n\"Jade Emperor, I am forever grateful for your mercy and guidance,\" Macaque says softly, his eyes closed. \"Thank you for sending your celestial army to protect us and for sparing us from the wrath of Wukong.\"\n\nMK watches in silence for a moment before deciding to join in. He kneels down beside Macaque and closes his eyes.\n\n\"Jade Emperor, thank you for keeping us safe and for sending Nezha to save me,\" MK says, his voice quiet but sincere. \"Thank you for giving us the strength to overcome our enemies and for showing us that even in the darkest moments, there is hope.\"\n\nMacaque opens his eyes and looks at MK with a small smile. \"You have a good heart, my young friend,\" he says, placing a hand on MK's shoulder. \"Together, we will continue to walk the path of righteousness.\"\n\nMK smiles back at Macaque, feeling grateful for the older monkey's guidance and support. He finishes his prayers and heads to bed, feeling a sense of peace and hope for the first time in a long while.",
