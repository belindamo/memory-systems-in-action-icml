But I can try to help you find the information you're looking for.\n\nThere have been several films titled \"The Silent Forest\" over the years, so could you please provide more context or details about the specific film you're referring to? For example, was it a feature film or a short film? Was it a drama, thriller, or another genre? Was there a particular cast or crew member that stood out to you?\n\nAdditionally, the Berlinale film festival usually takes place in February, so if you attended it last month, that would mean it was the 2023 edition. You can check the official Berlinale website or online archives to see if they have a list of films that premiered during the festival, including \"The Silent Forest.\"\n\nOnce I have more information about the film, I can try to help you find the production company and expected release date.",
