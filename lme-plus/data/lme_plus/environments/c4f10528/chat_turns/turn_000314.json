Her debut feature documentary, \"Communion\" (2016), received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the European Film Award for Best Documentary.\n\n\"Communion\" is a poignant and intimate portrayal of a family's struggles with their 14-year-old son's disability and their own relationships. The film explores themes of love, responsibility, and the complexities of family dynamics.\n\nFrom what I've found, Anna Zamecka's work often focuses on character-driven stories that delve into the human condition, exploring themes such as identity, empathy, and the complexities of relationships. Her films often have a strong emotional resonance and a deep understanding of the human experience.\n\nNow, regarding \"The Silent Forest,\" I couldn't find specific information on the film's production company or release date yet. However, as it was a world premiere at the Berlinale, it's likely that the film will be making the festival circuit in the coming months. You can keep an eye on the film's social media pages, the Berlinale website, or film industry news outlets for updates on its release schedule.\n\nIt's great to hear that \"The Silent Forest\" was a highlight of your festival experience! Anna Zamecka's work is highly regarded, and I'm sure her new film will continue to resonate with audiences.",
