I'll use a combination of tools like TubeBuddy, VidIQ, and Morning Fame to optimize my video title, description, and tags. I'll also create an eye-catching thumbnail using Canva or Adobe Spark, and make sure it's relevant to my content. Additionally, I'll use YouTube Analytics and Google Analytics to track my video's performance and adjust my strategy accordingly. Thanks for the suggestions and resources!",
