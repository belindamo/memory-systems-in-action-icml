  "content": "Chicken tikka masala is a great choice! Naan bread is a perfect accompaniment, and making it from scratch can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are some side dish recommendations that would pair well with your homemade chicken tikka masala:\n\n**Naan Bread Recipe**\n\n1. **Simple Naan Bread**: Mix 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast. Add 1/2 cup lukewarm water and 1 tablespoon yogurt. Knead for 5-7 minutes, rest for 1 hour, and cook in a skillet or oven.\n\n**Other Side Dish Options**\n\n1. **Basmati Rice**: A classic combination with chicken tikka masala. Use a ratio of 1 cup basmati rice to 1 3/4 cups water. Add salt and ghee or oil for flavor.\n2. **Roasted Vegetables**: Roasting brings out the natural sweetness in vegetables, which pairs well with the spicy and creamy flavors of chicken tikka masala. Try roasting cauliflower, carrots, broccoli, or Brussels sprouts with some oil, salt, and pepper.\n3. **Saag Aloo**: A spicy mustard green dish that complements the rich flavors of chicken tikka masala. Simply saut\u00e9 chopped onions, ginger, and garlic, then add mustard greens, potatoes, and a blend of spices.\n4. **Raita**: A cool and creamy side dish that helps balance the spiciness. Mix plain yogurt with diced cucumber, tomato, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper.\n5. **Papadum**: Thin, crispy flatbreads that can be served as a side or used to scoop up the chicken tikka masala sauce. You can find papadum at most Indian grocery stores or online.\n\n**Tips for Making Naan Bread at Home**\n\n1. **Use a hot skillet**: A hot skillet is essential for cooking naan bread. You can also use a pizza stone in the oven for a crispy crust.\n2. **Don't overwork the dough**: Mix the ingredients just until they come together, and avoid over-kneading.\n3. **Let it rest**: Let the dough rest for at least an hour to allow the yeast to ferment and the gluten to relax.\n4. **Use a gentle touch**: When shaping the dough into balls, use a gentle touch to avoid developing the gluten, which can make the naan bread tough.\n\nI hope these recommendations and tips help you create a delicious and authentic Indian-inspired meal at home!",
