I'll make sure to keep them concise, consistent, and aligned with my brand's tone and personality. For the captions, I'll use a font that's easy to read and a color scheme that matches my brand. I might also add some animated GIFs to add a touch of humor to the bloopers and outtakes. Can you suggest some tools or resources to help me optimize my video for YouTube?",
