  "content": "Absolutely! One of the best things about sporting events is the camaraderie and sense of community that comes from being part of a group of fans all rooting for the same team. The pre-game tailgating experience is an integral part of that feeling, and it's understandable how much you miss it.\n\nHowever, with the progress being made in controlling the virus, the hope is that tailgating and other pre-game traditions will return soon. In the meantime, we should still look for ways to connect with fellow fans remotely or in small, socially distanced gatherings, whether it's through virtual watch parties or outdoor get-togethers.\n\nWith time and patience, we will all be able to get back to the full pre-game experience we once knew and loved. Until then, let's all continue to look forward to the return of in-person tailgating and the joy of sharing great food and drinks with fellow fans.",
