  "content": "Sure, here are more details about the 3x3 basketball event and how it differs from traditional basketball:\n\nThe 3x3 basketball event is a variant of basketball that is played with teams of three players, using only one half-court. The game follows the same basic rules as traditional basketball, but with some key differences:\n\n1. Scoring - Points in the 3x3 game are scored differently than in traditional basketball. Each basket made inside the arc (within the 3-point line) is worth one point, while each basket made outside the arc (beyond the 3-point line) is worth two points. Free throws are also one point each.\n\n2. Time - The game is played for 10 minutes, or until one team reaches 21 points, whichever comes first. If neither team reaches 21 points by the end of the 10 minutes, the team with the highest score wins.\n\n3. Substitutions - Teams can substitute players in and out of the game at any time, but only during dead-ball situations.\n\n4. Fouls - Each player is allowed six fouls before being disqualified from the game.\n\n5. Jump ball - Instead of a traditional jump ball to begin the game, the ball is awarded to one team and the game begins.\n\nOverall, the 3x3 basketball event is faster-paced and more physical than traditional basketball, with more one-on-one matchups and fewer players on the court.",
