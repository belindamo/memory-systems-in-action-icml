It has supported the development of several road projects, including the reconstruction of the Kabul-Kandahar highway and the Herat Ring Road.\n\n2. The Asian Development Bank: The Asian Development Bank has also provided funding for transportation infrastructure projects in Afghanistan. It has supported the rehabilitation of the Salang Pass tunnel, which is a critical transport route connecting northern and southern Afghanistan.\n\n3. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): The UNDP has partnered with the Afghan government to improve access to transportation services in rural areas. It has supported the construction of bridges and small roads in remote areas, making it easier for people to transport goods and access basic services.\n\n4. The Afghan Ministry of Public Works: The Afghan Ministry of Public Works is responsible for planning, constructing, and maintaining the transportation infrastructure in the country. It has several ongoing projects to improve road networks, bridges, and airports across the country.\n\n5. Private sector initiatives: There are several private companies investing in Afghanistan's transportation infrastructure. For example, in 2016, the Silk Road Logistics Company invested in a railway network between Torkham in eastern Afghanistan and Spin Boldak on the Pakistan border, which has helped to improve trade between the two countries.\n\nAlthough it is a challenging and long-term process, these organizations and initiatives are working towards improving the transportation infrastructure situation in Afghanistan, which will contribute greatly to the social and economic development of the country.",
