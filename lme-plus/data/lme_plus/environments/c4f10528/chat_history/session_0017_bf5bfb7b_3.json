Use a ratio of 1 cup basmati rice to 1 3/4 cups water.

This helps maintain a consistent level of humidity and keeps the bread fresh for longer.\n2. **Store in a dry place**: Avoid storing naan bread in a humid or damp environment, as this can cause it to become soggy or moldy.\n3. **Freeze in portions**: If you don't plan on using all the naan bread within a few days, consider freezing it in portions. This way, you can simply thaw and reheat the desired amount.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your homemade naan bread for several days and make the most of your cooking efforts!"
