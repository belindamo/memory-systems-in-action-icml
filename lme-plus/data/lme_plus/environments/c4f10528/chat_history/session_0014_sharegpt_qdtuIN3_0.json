It is important to me to know the outcome of step 1 and 2 before continuing with the paper\n3) Once the methodology has been set from step 1 and 2. I want the following in the paper:-\n 1) Introduction to anomalies, anomaly detection and anomaly detection in knowledge graphs\n 2) Literature review that answer the questions (1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.d)\n 1) The new methodology to be described using formal mathematical equations/expressions with explanation\n 2) The hypothesis for the new methodology to be described using formal mathematical equations/expressions with explanation\n 3) Metrics to prove the hypothesis using implementation results, graphs, charts"

      "content": "1. Literature review related to GBAD-MDL and similar methods:\na. GBAD-MPS and GBAD-P are variations of GBAD-MDL that have been proposed in the literature. GBAD-MPS uses a multi-parent selection strategy to improve the model building process, while GBAD-P uses a probabilistic approach to select the best model. Other related methods include GDTW, GBOOST, and GKDR, which also use knowledge graphs for anomaly detection.\nb. Previous literature on anomaly detection using knowledge graphs has primarily focused on using statistical and machine learning-based methods. However, these methods are limited in their ability to handle complex relationships between entities and attributes in knowledge graphs.\nc. Current methodologies for the open problem of anomaly detection in knowledge graphs involve integrating domain-specific knowledge into the anomaly detection process, developing efficient algorithms for processing large knowledge graphs, and improving the interpretability of anomaly detection results.\nd. Despite being coined in 2003, GBAD-MDL is still a relevant methodology for anomaly detection in knowledge graphs because of its ability to handle complex relationships between entities and attributes in knowledge graphs. To contribute to the problem, one can make modifications to the methodology to incorporate domain-specific knowledge, improve efficiency, or enhance interpretability.\n2. If GBAD-MDL is not a suitable strategy for addressing the open problem, other methods that satisfy the requirements of 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d can be considered. Some potential alternatives include:\n* Deep learning-based methods such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and attention-based models that can effectively capture complex relationships between entities and attributes in knowledge graphs.\n* Rule-based methods that leverage expert knowledge and domain-specific rules to detect anomalies.\n* Hybrid approaches that combine statistical and machine learning-based methods with domain-specific knowledge.\n3. Once the methodology has been selected, the following should be included in the paper:\n4. Introduction to anomalies, anomaly detection, and anomaly detection in knowledge graphs.\n5. Literature review that addresses the questions posed in 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d.\n6. Description of the selected methodology using formal mathematical equations and explanations.\n7. Hypothesis for the new methodology using formal mathematical equations and explanations.\n8. Metrics to evaluate and prove the hypothesis, including implementation results, graphs, and charts."
