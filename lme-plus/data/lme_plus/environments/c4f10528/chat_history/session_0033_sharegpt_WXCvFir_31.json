      "content": "Manipal is located in the Udupi district of Karnataka, which is known for its banana production. The region has a tropical climate and fertile soil, which is conducive to banana farming. The most common banana varieties grown in Udupi district are the robusta and nendran varieties.\n\nTo source banana fibers for the blended clothing business, the business can work with local farmers who grow bananas in the region. The banana stems can be harvested after the fruit is harvested, and the fibers can be extracted using a process that involves stripping the outer layers of the stem and extracting the fibers from the inner layers.\n\nIt is important for the blended clothing business to work with farmers who practice sustainable agriculture and use eco-friendly farming techniques. This can help to ensure that the business's supply chain is environmentally responsible and socially conscious. Additionally, working with local farmers can help to support the local community and contribute to the region's economy."

      "content": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. Manipal is a town in the Udupi district of Karnataka, India, and it does not produce bananas itself. However, Udupi district is one of the largest producers of bananas in Karnataka state. According to the Department of Horticulture, Government of Karnataka, Udupi district produced 229,700 metric tonnes of bananas in 2019-2020, which is a significant amount. This indicates that there is a good potential for sourcing banana fiber for a banana fabric business in Manipal or nearby areas."
