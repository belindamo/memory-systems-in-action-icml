Simple payments such as Samsung Pay and NAVER Pay have become a part of our daily lives, and many people have experienced financial apps such as TOS, which allows you to send money by simply tapping 'Send' on a smartphone text message with your account number .\n\nThe same trend is happening in e-commerce. Once customers have experienced the easy way, they want online shopping to be as easy as a few clicks.\n\nCafe24, which has the largest number of customers in Korea, is also on a journey to make its service easier to meet this need. For example, Edibot, a product detail page editing tool that uploads product images and arranges them according to the shopping mall area, Edibot Banner, a banner editing tool that allows you to create images for your shopping mall without professional help using various templates, and Smart Design Easy, which allows you to complete your shopping mall design without coding.\n\nToday, we're going to introduce you to Smart Design Easy, which will make designing your Cafe24 website even easier!\n\nDesign a shopping mall without knowing HTML\nOne of the most common barriers to creating a shop with Cafe24 has been the need to work with HTML. You need to paste the HTML source into the area you want to modify, and you need to know how to use the relevant tags, so it was difficult for beginners to access.\n\nIn late September, we launched a new service to address these concerns. It's Smart Design Easy, a service that allows you to create an online shop with a few clicks and no coding.\n\nSmart Design Easy is a service that allows new users who sign up for Cafe24 to design online shopping mall screens without prior knowledge of HTML. All you need to know is how to click and drag a mouse.\n\nOne of the best features of SmartDesignEasy is the templates. All you have to do is pick a theme and you can easily create your shop design. There are currently 5 design templates available, but more are on the way!\nSo, let's take a look and choose your favorite template. Once you've chosen your template, hit edit. This is where you can customize your shop's main page popup window, band banner, header, smart banner, footer, etc. without having to enter the admin page.\n\nFor example, if you select the header area, you can see how you want to place your shop's logo and menu. On the left side, you can click on the menu to change the layout, text, and images, and on the right side, you'll see your settings reflected on the actual shop.\n\nIf you move your mouse in the right area where your settings are reflected, you'll see boundaries for each section, such as the header, smart banner, etc. Clicking the + button you see in this state creates a new section where you can add any content you want. Each section can be easily reordered from one to the other with a simple mouse drag.\n\n\u270dEditor's note\n\nBanded banner - an ad area that runs horizontally across the top of your shop like a band.\nHeader - the area at the top of the shop where you can set your logo, menu, etc.\nSmart banner - an area that displays content about your shop's featured products, important information, etc.\nFooter - The area at the bottom of the shopping mall where the name of the representative, business address, customer center, payment information, and SNS channels are displayed.\n\nDisplay products and change banner design at once\nYou can also manage product display right from within the Smart Design Easy editing tool. While setting up your shopping mall design, you can utilize the pre-registered product information to load and display it directly.\n\nIn addition, when setting up the smart banner area that is displayed on the main screen of the shopping mall, you will be directed to a page where you can create banners by linking Edibot Banner. This minimizes the number of windows and clicks users have to make when displaying products and creating banners.\nPC and mobile designs directly in the editing tool\nAnother change is that you can now see how your design will look on both PC and mobile screens. SmartDesignEasy provides a service based on 'WYSIWYG'. WYSIWYG is short for \"What you see is what you get,\" which literally means that what you see when you change the settings is what you get.\n\nBy being able to see what you're actually seeing on the screen when you connect to your PC or smartphone, you can make edits right away, so you can intuitively understand the results of your settings, spend less time working on them, and get more done!\nBashrak Homepage\nWhat kind of customers are using it?\nAs it is easier to use compared to Smart Design, we are actually seeing a variety of applications, such as building a new online mall using Smart Design Easy, as well as renewing our own online mall or transferring from a third party.\n\n'Camping on Incheon' used only open marketplaces until last year, but in recent months, they opened their own online mall using Smart Design Easy. They are happy to report that their sales have skyrocketed since then!\n\n'Basrak', a mall specializing in healthy lunchboxes, and 'Duklim Furniture', a furniture brand, renewed their sites with Smart Design Easy after using free and paid designs, respectively.\n\nIt is expected that more customers will be able to complete their shopping mall designs more easily in the future.\nWe will continue our efforts to go beyond 'easy solution' to 'easy sales'!!!\n\nWith reference to the above, write a 100% unique, creative and Human-written article in English for the Keyword \"Create a shopping mall without coding, a completely different smart design Easy\".
