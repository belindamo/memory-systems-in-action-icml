In the Dolphin file browser, you can try removing the file indexing cache to force it to update its view of the drive's available space.\n\nTo do this, navigate to your home directory and then to the hidden `.cache` folder. Inside the `.cache` folder, find and delete the `baloo` folder. This should remove the file indexing cache and force Dolphin to reindex the files and update the available space information.\n\nAlternatively, you can try logging out and logging back in to refresh the system information and see if that resolves the issue."

You can try rebuilding the KIO slave cache for Dolphin.\n\nTo do this, open up a terminal and run the following command:\n```css\nkbuildsycoca5 --noincremental\n```\nThis command will rebuild the KIO slave cache for Dolphin. Once it's finished, try opening Dolphin again and see if the drive size is displayed correctly."

      "content": "`kbuildsycoca5` is a command-line utility that is used to build a system configuration cache for KDE applications. This cache is used to speed up the loading of KDE applications by providing a precompiled configuration database that is quickly accessible.\n\nWhen a KDE application starts up, it reads its configuration settings from the configuration files in the system and user directories. These configuration files can be scattered throughout the system, and searching them all at startup can take a lot of time. To speed up this process, KDE maintains a configuration cache that contains information about all the available configuration files.\n\n`kbuildsycoca5` is responsible for building and updating this configuration cache. It searches the system and user directories for configuration files, and then adds the information about these files to the configuration cache. Once the cache has been built, KDE applications can quickly access the configuration settings they need, without having to search through all the configuration files on the system."
