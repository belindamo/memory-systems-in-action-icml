The following information was obtained from SARs made to\nDCMS, requesting information held or generated by the CDU in particular.\nTargeting criticism of modelling\nElected politicians and ex-Ministers were not exempt from the CDU\u2019s monitoring, with\nConservative MP David Davis\u2019s views on modelling during the pandemic drawing the\nattention of the DCMS disinformation team. In an entry in his SAR response vaguely titled\n\u201canalysis of online content\u201d, the senior Tory MP\u2019s tweets questioning the modelling\nput forward at the start of the pandemic were monitored and recorded. Similar labels in\nother SARs have subsequently been confirmed to be CDU or Logically documents, so it is\nreasonable to assume this document is of a similar ilk.\nThe entry does not cite which specific statements from Mr Davis warranted attention\nbut mentions him as \u201ccritical of the government\u201d . In the weeks preceding the 15th May\n2020, the date on the entry, he tweeted questioning the model and co-authored a Daily\nTelegraph article questioning the mathematical reasoning underpinning the Imperial\nCollege model that influenced the government\u2019s early COVID-19 decision-making. Both of\nthese examples are likely to be relevant.\nNeither the Daily Telegraph piece, co-written with the science writer Lord Ridley, nor Mr\n12\nDavis\u2019s tweets say the Imperial model is necessarily incorrect \u2013 rather, they raise concerns\nabout the code and mathematical assumptions contained within it.35 Mr Davis called for\ntransparency about the model, which formed part of the basis for incredibly important\npolicy decisions. Encouraging openness and scrutiny as he did is the very antithesis of a\ndisinformation campaign.36\nAs an elected politician Mr Davis, must be free to hold ministers and officials to account\non behalf of his constituents and the country, including scrutinising the evidence that\nunderpinned major policy decisions such as lockdown \u2013 without being covertly monitored,\nrecorded and potentially even put in the cross-hairs for corporate censorship by the\ngovernment. It is simply unjustifiable for a government unit to expend resources monitoring\na Member of Parliament for seeking transparency and accountability in a sensitive policy\narea. Free speech across the board is under threat if concerns about disinformation can\nbe used to rebrand scepticism as the peddling of falsehoods \u2013 but it is in total crisis if\nparliamentary scrutiny can be rebranded as disinformation.\nAnother three unnamed Conservative MPs also came to the CDU\u2019s attention in the summer\nof 2020 by joining the free speech social network Parler, which became associated with\nthe alt-right. Despite the unit not suggesting that the accounts were posting much of any\ninterest to the government, their creation was monitored by the CDU \u2013 underlining that\neven politicians of the government\u2019s party had their activities surveilled.\nSome MPs, including former and current Ministers, were affected by CDU activities in\nrelation to their criticism of government policies during the pandemic, but chose not to be\nnamed in this report.\nTargeting lockdown harms dissent\nJournalist, broadcaster and political commentator Julia Hartley-Brewer was featured\n35 Is The Chilling Truth That The Decision To Impose Lockdown Was Based On Crude\nMathematical Guesswork?, The Daily Telegraph, 10th May 2020, https://www.telegraph.co.uk/\nnews/2020/05/10/chilling-truth-decision-impose-lockdown-based-crude-mathematical/\n36 Tweet from David David MP, 5th May 2020, https://twitter.com/DavidDavisMP/\nstatus/1257761434039136256\n13\nrepeatedly in the Logically \u201cCOVID-19 Mis/Disinformation Platform Terms of Service\nReport\u201d commissioned by DCMS, a fact that was only disclosed after repeatedly asking the\nDepartment to clarify the reasons for holding her data. DCMS\u2019 initial response to her SAR\nmasked the name of the documents she was included in as \u201creports on online activity\u201d.\nThe tweets from Ms Hartley-Brewer that were included in the reports suggest that the\nDCMS contractor was stretching its remit and broadening the definition of disinformation\nunjustifiably to include comments critical of the government.\nFor example, Logically reported a tweet to government in which Ms Hartley-Brewer\nshared an interview with a listener who had suffered during the lockdown. The other drew\nattention to deaths from cancer that may have been impacted by the NHS\u2019s COVID-19\nfocus, leading to fewer referrals for malignancies \u2013 an issue that has been documented in\npeer-reviewed research.37\nIt is clear that lockdown had serious harms and downsides associated with it, which can\nbe acknowledged separately from the debate over whether it was the best policy at the\ntime or not.38 From businesses closing to a lack of contact with loved ones and a loss of\n37 Impact Of The COVID-19 Pandemic On The Detection And Management Of Colorectal\nCancer In England: A Population-Based Study, Professor Eva Morris et al, The Lancet: Gastroenterology\n& Hepatology 6(3), 1st March 2021, https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-\n1253(21)00005-4/fulltext\n38 Coronavirus Lockdown: Costs and Benefits, Chris Smith, The House of Lords Library, https://\n14\ncivil liberties, lockdown was not harm-free and people should be free to both talk about\ntheir experiences and express their own views on the level of harm experienced as a\nresult of lockdown policies compared to the direct harm caused by the virus. Experiences\nand opinions should not be classified as disinformation.\nIn another example, Logically reported a tweet to government in which Ms Hartley-Brewer\nquoted the UK\u2019s number of cancer deaths per day, with the figure matching data from the\nOffice for National Statistics.39 Cancer charities had been flagging the negative impact\nthat coronavirus had on treatment for the disease, and this was widely considered an\nimportant topic for discussion. \u2013 not so-called misinformation.\nTargeting opposition to Covid passes\nEvidence from SARs submitted by our director, Silkie Carlo, and Advocacy Manager, Mark\nJohnson, show that Logically, and by extension, the CDU, strayed significantly from their\n\u201cdisinformation\u201d remit to monitor and delegitimise domestic political dissent in their\nreports.\nBig Brother Watch led the campaign against mandatory domestic COVID-19 certification\nlordslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus-lockdown-costs-and-benefits/, 22nd July 2020\n39 Total Cancer Deaths In The UK In 2019 and 2020, Office for National Statistics, 30th\nJuly 2021, https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/\ntotalcancerdeathsintheukin2019and2020\n15\nin the UK, rallying a cross-party coalition of 99 parliamentarians to oppose the policy on\nhuman rights and equality grounds.40 The Conservative rebellion against mandatory Covid\npasses in the December 2021 House of Commons vote marked the biggest rebellion since\nthe vote on the Iraq War.\nLogically monitored and recorded our criticism of the mandatory Covid pass policy in two\nof its reports, with Mark Johnson\u2019s tweet included in the COVID-19 Mis/Disinformation\nReport and a tweet of an interview clip of Silkie Carlo on OFCOM-regulated talkRADIO\nincluded in the COVID-19 Mis/Disinformation Platform Terms of Service Report. The latter\nreport appears to function to \u201cindicate [to the government] that content might potentially\nbreach Twitter\u2019s terms of service\u201d, according to a SAR response from Logically to Silkie\nCarlo. It is not clear how or why the Tweet would breach the terms of service.\nMark Johnson\u2019s tweet advocated that people sign a petition on the official parliamentary\npetitions website, where all petitions are vetted and fact-checked before they are\npublished, urging the government not to roll out COVID-19 vaccine passports.41 At the\ntime of the tweet and the report, scores of MPs held the same view and the government\nwas conducting a consultation on Covid passes - it was not a settled policy to implement\nthem.42 The petition had over 275,000 signatures on the day the Logically report was\n40 Stop Vaccine Passports, Big Brother Watch, accessed 9th November 2022, https://\nbigbrotherwatch.org.uk/campaigns/stopvaccinepassports/#crosspartycampaign\n41 Do Not Rollout COVID-19 Vaccine Passports, Closed Parliamentary Petition, accessed 9th\nNovember 2022, https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/569957\n42 COVID-19: PM Promises Review On Issues Of Vaccine Passports, BBC News, 23rd February\n16\ndated;43 10,000 signatures triggers a government response, and 100,000 signatures\nleads to a debate in Parliament. Neither the petition nor the tweet discussed the vaccine\nitself, but focused on the negative human rights implications of vaccine passports. It is\ninconceivable that any reasonable person could view this as \u201cdisinformation\u201d and its\ninclusion betrays a concerning level of mission creep.\nThis raises questions about why the CDU contracted a company to surveil opposition to a\npolicy among human rights groups, especially when the government had supposedly yet\nto decide on the policy\u2019s appropriateness.\nThe issue of COVID-19 passports was a controversial, live and important debate in Britain\nat the time. It is very worrying that a private company, at the behest of the government,\nsecretly monitored, recorded and reported on mainstream political dissent under the\nguise of tackling \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\nThe monitoring and recording of Silkie Carlo\u2019s interview with Julia Hartley-Brewer shows\nthat attention paid to vaccine passport opposition was not a one-off incident, but a\ntheme. The interview, which coincided with the launch of Big Brother Watch\u2019s crossparty\ncoalition of 99 parliamentarians opposing Covid passes and the publication of Big\nBrother Watch\u2019s report Access Denied: the case against a two-tier Britain under COVID-19\ncertification, focused entirely on the social harms that vaccine passports could have, yet\nappears in a report titled \u201dCOVID-19 Mis/Disinformation Platform Terms of Service\u201c.44 The\n2021\n43 Do Not Rollout COVID-19 Vaccine Passports Archive, Parliamentary Petition, archived\n9th March 2021,https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163330/https://petition.parliament.uk/\npetitions/569957\n44 Silkie Carlo Interview on TalkRadio, 2nd April 2021, https://twitter.com/i/\nstatus/1377890760360615936\n17\nlack of context in the SAR response and refusal by DCMS to disclose the full report mean\nit is difficult to understand the purpose of the inclusion of the interview \u2013 however, it is\nconcerning that monitoring of political dissent was being conducted under the banner of\ncountering \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\nLogically also reported a tweet by Silkie Carlo in a \u201dCOVID-19 Mis/Disinformation Platform\nTerms of Service\u201c report shared with DCMS, in which she compared the enforcement and\nimpact of vaccine passports to mandatory vaccines. DCMS did not disclose this in response\nto her SAR, but Logically did, further disclosing that they viewed the tweet as a potential\nbreach of Twitter\u2019s terms of service, claiming that it supported a \u201cnarrative\u201d that \u201cvaccine\npassports are a form of mandatory vaccination\u201d and that the analysis \u201cspeculates\u201d and\n\u201cdistorts facts\u201d. However, her description of how both policies are generally enforced\nwas factually accurate. Their report entry on her also interpreted the tweet as \u201csaying\n[vaccine passports] will inevitably lead to mandatory vaccines\u201d which the tweet evidently\ndid not do; rather, it was a comparison of the enforcement mechanism and impact of both\npolicies. In any event, Twitter\u2019s medical misinformation policy from early March 2021 made\nno mention of vaccine passports and defended the right for people to express strong\nopinions or commentary.45 Logically\u2019s misrepresentation of our director\u2019s policy analysis,\nand inclusion of it in a \u201cdisinformation\u201d report, is highly inappropriate and indicates that\nprotected speech was monitored and flagged for potential censorship with disturbing\ncasualness.\n45 Twitter Medical Misinformation Policy, archived 6th Match 2021, https://web.archive.org/\nweb/20210306141333/https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy\n18\nThe CDU highlighted a tweet by Adam Brooks, the pub landlord and political commentator,\nin an August 2021 internal report titled \u201cVaccine Mis/Disinformation: Narratives and\nEngagement\u201d in which he opposed both vaccine passports and compulsory vaccines \u2013\nbut not vaccination itself.\nIn the report, CDU officials discussed a Mail on Sunday article covering the news that\nvaccine requirements for travel and care home workers would extend to require a third\ndose to qualify, and the engagement with it online.46 The CDU report claimed there was\n\u201clow engagement\u201d with the piece and highlighted \u201ctweets from vaccine and lockdown\nsceptics\u201d opposing the measure, naming Mr Brooks as one of the people advocating for\nthat position.\nMr Brooks\u2019s tweet did not make any claims about the vaccine itself \u2013 rather, he opposed\ncoercion or compulsion around vaccines, a position widely held across society. By including\nhis tweet in a report on disinformation the CDU appears to have used an alarmingly broad\ndefinition of the term that covers general opposition to government coronavirus policy.\nLabelling Mr Brooks as a lockdown/vaccine sceptic, the latter of which comes with\nnegative connotations, suggests that the CDU had decided which views or people were\nworth listening to, and who should be quickly dismissed. Dissent is not disinformation but\nit appears that the CDU is blurring the lines between the two to invoke powers to monitor\n46 COVID-19 Booster Shots Will \u2018be Obligatory For Trips Abroad And Care Home Staff\u2019 - As\nMillions Are Set To Offered A Third Jab From September, Mail on Sunday, 15th August 2021, https://www.\ndailymail.co.uk/news/article-9894487/Booster-COVID-19-vaccines-mandatory-care-home-staff-foreigntrips-\nUK.html\n19\nand suppress criticism. Whitehall officials are tasked to make a success of government\npolicies \u2013 not to act as an authority on truth. These two roles clearly conflict."
