Deep breathing: Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of your breath and allow your mind to clear. 2. Body scan: Close your eyes and focus on each part of your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to the top of your head. Notice any areas of tension and consciously release them. 3. Visualization: Imagine a peaceful place or situation, such as a beach or a sunny meadow. Focus on the details of this visualization to help calm your mind. 4. Mindful eating: Take time to savor each bite of your meal, focusing on the taste, smell, and texture of your food. Pay attention to your body's signals of hunger and fullness. 5. Mindful walking: Take a short break and go for a walk. Focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground and the rhythm of your breathing. Remember, the key to practicing mindfulness is to stay present in the moment and focus on what you're experiencing right now, rather than worrying about the past or future."

Work together to find a time and place that works for both of you.\n\nRemember that approaching a coworker about mindfulness practices can be a sensitive topic for some people, so be respectful and understanding of their response.
