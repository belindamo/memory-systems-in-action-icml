  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. In the Dolphin file browser, you can try removing the file indexing cache to force it to update its view of the drive's available space.\n\nTo do this, navigate to your home directory and then to the hidden `.cache` folder. Inside the `.cache` folder, find and delete the `baloo` folder. This should remove the file indexing cache and force Dolphin to reindex the files and update the available space information.\n\nAlternatively, you can try logging out and logging back in to refresh the system information and see if that resolves the issue.",
