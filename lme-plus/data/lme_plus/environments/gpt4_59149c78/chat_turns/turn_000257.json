You can search by location and type of treatment. 2. The American Psychological Association provides a psychologist locator service that allows you to search for licensed psychologists by location and specialty, including PTSD. 3. The Psychology Today directory allows you to search for therapists by location, specialty, insurance accepted, and other factors. 4. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) offers a helpline that you can call or text for information and support in finding mental health services, including therapy for PTSD. 5. Your primary care physician or insurance company may also be able to provide referrals or recommendations for qualified therapists who specialize in treating PTSD. Remember to verify the credentials and experience of any mental health professional before beginning treatment.
