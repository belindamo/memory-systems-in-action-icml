Creating a sense of cohesion in an abstract piece can be a bit more challenging, but here are some suggestions to help you tie everything together:\n\n1. **Unifying Color Palette**: Stick to a consistent color palette that reflects the earthy tones you mentioned. Choose a few core colors and their variations to create a sense of harmony. You can use metallic paints to add pops of color and interest.\n2. **Repeating Elements**: Repeat certain elements throughout the piece to create a sense of rhythm and cohesion. This could be a specific shape, like a leaf or a circle, or a texture, like the burlap or a specific brushstroke.\n3. **Visual Flow**: Consider the visual flow of your piece. Guide the viewer's eye through the composition using lines, shapes, and colors. You can create a sense of movement or energy by using diagonal lines, curves, or sweeping brushstrokes.\n4. **Texture and Dimension**: Mix different textures to add depth and interest. In addition to the burlap background, consider adding other textures like modeling paste, gel medium, or even fabric. This will create a tactile experience and engage the viewer.\n5. **Focal Point**: While your piece is abstract, it's still important to have a focal point that draws the viewer's eye. This could be a bold color, a specific shape, or a interesting texture. Use this focal point to anchor the composition and create a sense of balance.\n6. **Balance and Harmony**: Pay attention to the balance and harmony of your piece. Make sure the composition feels balanced and visually appealing. You can use the principles of design, like symmetry, asymmetry, or the rule of thirds, to guide your composition.\n7. **Limiting Elements**: Don't be afraid to limit your elements and simplify your composition. Too many different textures, colors, and shapes can create a busy, overwhelming piece. Edit your elements and focus on the ones that work together to create a cohesive whole.\n8. **Emotional Connection**: Remember, the goal of an abstract piece is to evoke an emotional response. Focus on capturing the feeling of being in nature, and let that guide your creative decisions.\n\nTo tie everything together, you could try creating a loose, expressive sketch of your composition before you start painting. This will help you visualize the layout and balance of your piece. Then, start building up your layers, using the suggestions above to guide you.\n\nHow do you feel about incorporating symbols or marks that evoke nature, like seeds, flowers, or feathers? Could these elements help create a sense of cohesion and meaning in your piece?",
