  "content": "The current Cafe24 brand guide items provide a strong foundation for brand management, but I would recommend adding the following items to increase the brand value:\n\n1. Brand Guidelines for Visual Content: Clear guidelines for visual content can help ensure that all marketing materials, advertisements, and other visual content are consistent with the brand's identity and tone. This can include elements such as typography, imagery, and graphic design standards.\n2. Brand Guidelines for Customer Experience: A strong brand is not just about visual identity but also the experience it provides to customers. Guidelines for customer experience can help ensure that all customer interactions are consistent with the brand's personality and values. This can include elements such as customer service standards, in-store experience, and packaging design.\n3. Brand Guidelines for Employee Behavior: Employees are ambassadors of the brand, and their behavior can have a significant impact on the brand's perception. Guidelines for employee behavior can help ensure that all employees represent the brand in a consistent and positive manner. This can include elements such as dress code, language and communication standards, and guidelines for representing the brand in public.\n4. Brand Guidelines for Brand Partnerships: As Cafe24 expands its partnerships, guidelines for brand partnerships can help ensure that all partnerships are aligned with the brand's values and goals. This can include elements such as the types of partnerships that are acceptable, guidelines for co-branding, and expectations for how brand partners will represent the brand.\n5. Brand Guidelines for Crisis Management: In the event of a crisis, clear guidelines can help ensure that the brand responds in a way that is consistent with its values and tone. Guidelines for crisis management can include elements such as communication protocols, social media policies, and guidelines for working with the media.\n\nBy adding these additional items to the brand guide, Cafe24 can provide employees with a more comprehensive understanding of the brand and ensure that all aspects of the brand are aligned with its values and goals. This can help increase the brand's power and influence in the marketplace.",
