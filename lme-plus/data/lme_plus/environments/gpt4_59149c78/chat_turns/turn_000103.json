  "content": "Yes, there are several government initiatives in India that aim to promote more sustainable farming practices and improve soil quality in the country. One such initiative is the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), which was launched in 2010 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare.\n\nThe NMSA aims to promote sustainable agriculture practices, such as agroforestry, crop diversification, and integrated pest management, and to enhance the resilience of agricultural production systems to climate change. The initiative also includes programs aimed at improving soil health through the use of organic and natural fertilizers, and through the promotion of conservation agriculture practices like minimum tillage and crop rotation.\n\nIn addition to the NMSA, the Indian government has also launched several other initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture and improving soil quality. For example, the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) is a program that aims to improve water use efficiency in agriculture through the adoption of water-saving technologies like drip irrigation and sprinklers. The government has also launched initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy in agriculture, such as the Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) scheme, which aims to provide solar-powered irrigation pumps to farmers.\n\nOverall, the Indian government is actively working to promote more sustainable farming practices and improve soil quality in the country. While there is still much work to be done, these initiatives represent an important step toward building more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems in India.",
