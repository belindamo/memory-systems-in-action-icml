  "content": "While medication can be helpful in managing anxiety symptoms, it's important to remember that medication alone is not a cure for anxiety or negative thinking patterns. To effectively manage anxiety in the long term, it's recommended to combine medication with therapy, cognitive-behavioral techniques, and self-care practices.\n\nMedication can help with symptoms such as panic attacks, but it does not address the underlying causes of anxiety. Additionally, medication may have side effects, may not work for everyone, and may lose its effectiveness over time. Therapy and self-help techniques, on the other hand, are designed to help you develop skills and strategies to manage your anxiety in a more sustainable way.\n\nThat being said, it's important to consult with a mental health professional and/or doctor to determine the best course of treatment for you. They can help you weigh the benefits and drawbacks of medication and provide guidance on incorporating therapy and other tools into your treatment plan.",
