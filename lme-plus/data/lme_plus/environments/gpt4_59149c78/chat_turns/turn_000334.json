I just got back from a crafting retreat at a local farm stay, and being surrounded by all that natural beauty really sparked my creativity. I'm thinking of using earthy tones like greens, browns, and blues, and combining the metallic paints with some natural materials like burlap or leaves. Do you have any ideas for how I can incorporate those elements in a cohesive way?",
