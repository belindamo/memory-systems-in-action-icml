This trail is relatively flat and paved, making it accessible for people of all ages and fitness levels. It is also a long trail, stretching over 13 miles along the canyon rim, so hikers can take in stunning views of the canyon without having to venture too far into the park. Additionally, the trail is dotted with various lookout points, providing hikers with different perspectives of the canyon.",
