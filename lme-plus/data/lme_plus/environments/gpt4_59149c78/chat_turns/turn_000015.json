For example:\n\n1. What type of genres are you interested in? (e.g. drama, comedy, sci-fi, fantasy, horror, etc.)\n2. Are you more into TV shows or movies?\n3. Are there any specific shows or franchises you're currently watching or interested in? (e.g. Game of Thrones, The Handmaid's Tale, Marvel, Star Wars, etc.)\n4. Do you have a preference for original content or do you also watch licensed content (e.g. TV shows and movies from other networks or studios)?\n5. Are you open to watching older shows or do you prefer new releases?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your viewing preferences, I can provide you with a comparison of HBO and Hulu's offerings and help you determine which one might be the best fit for you.\n\nAdditionally, here's a brief overview of each service to get us started:\n\n**HBO:**\n\n* Known for its high-quality, premium original content, including popular shows like Game of Thrones, Westworld, and Chernobyl\n* Offers a smaller but curated selection of TV shows and movies, with a focus on drama, comedy, and documentaries\n* Has a strong lineup of original movies and documentaries, including Oscar-winning films and critically-acclaimed series\n* Available as a standalone streaming service or as an add-on to other streaming services like Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV\n\n**Hulu:**\n\n* Offers a larger library of TV shows, including a mix of current and past episodes from major networks like ABC, NBC, FOX, and CBS\n* Has a stronger focus on TV shows, with a larger selection of sitcoms, dramas, and reality TV shows\n* Also offers a smaller but growing selection of original content, including shows like The Handmaid's Tale, Castle Rock, and Shrill\n* Available in two flavors: a ad-supported option with a lower monthly price, and an ad-free option with a higher monthly price\n\nLet me know your preferences and I can provide a more detailed comparison of the two services!",
