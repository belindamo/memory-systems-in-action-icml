I've been experimenting with wire-wrapping and beading lately, so I might try incorporating some wire-wrapped seed or flower shapes into the piece. That could add an interesting texture and dimension. Plus, it would tie in nicely with the natural theme. What do you think about using natural materials like sand, dirt, or even water to add more texture and interest to the piece?",
