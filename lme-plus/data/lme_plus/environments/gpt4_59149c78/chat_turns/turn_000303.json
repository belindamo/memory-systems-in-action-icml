  "content": "While the Iowa delegation to Congress is made up of members from both major political parties, they generally work well together and have a history of collaborating on important issues that impact the state. \n\nFor example, Iowa's congressional delegation has been united in their support for policies that benefit Iowa's agriculture industry, which is a significant driver of the state's economy. They have also worked together to promote infrastructure investments, secure federal funding for disaster relief, and advocate for policies that support small businesses.\n\nAdditionally, members of Iowa's delegation have a long-standing tradition of putting partisan politics aside when it comes to matters that are important to the state. For example, when Iowa was hit by a devastating derecho in August 2020, which left tens of thousands of Iowans without power and caused significant damage to crops and property, members of Iowa's delegation worked together to secure federal disaster relief funding to help the state recover.\n\nIn summary, while members of Iowa's delegation may have different political ideologies and policy preferences, they are generally able to work together in a bipartisan manner to advance policies that benefit the state and its residents.",
