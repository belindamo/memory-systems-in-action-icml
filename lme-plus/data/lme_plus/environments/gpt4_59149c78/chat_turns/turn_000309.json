  "content": "Yes, hairstyles and grooming were important to Vikings, and many of their styles and rituals are still recognizable today. \n\nViking men typically wore their hair long and either loose or tied back into a ponytail. Some also grew beards, often braiding them or adding metal beads for decoration. Shaving was not common among Viking men, and they typically only trimmed their mustache or the hair around their ears.\n\nWomen also wore their hair long, though they sometimes braided it or tied it up in elaborate styles. Married women often covered their hair with a headscarf or hood, while unmarried women could wear their hair loose or with a single braid over their shoulder.\n\nGrooming was also important to Vikings, and they often used combs made from bone or horn to keep their hair neat and clean. Bathing was less common, however, and Vikings were sometimes criticized by other cultures for their perceived lack of cleanliness.\n\nOverall, hairstyles and grooming were important ways to express identity and showcase one's social standing in Viking culture.",
