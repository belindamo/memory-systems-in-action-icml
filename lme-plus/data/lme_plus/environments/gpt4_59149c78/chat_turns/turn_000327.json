  "content": "Having long hair in hot weather can be uncomfortable, so here are some tips for hairstyle that will keep you cool:\n\n1. A classic ponytail or a simple bun can be a practical option for keeping hair off the neck and face. It also looks professional and can be a cute look.\n\n2. You could also try braiding your hair into a simple side braid or fishtail braid, which will not only keep your hair off your neck but also look elegant.\n\n3. Shorter haircuts or layers can help to lighten the weight of your hair making it easier to manage in the heat.\n\n4. You can also try out updos such as top knots or messy buns. They are comfortable, stylish and will keep your hair off your neck and away from your face.\n\n5. If you prefer wearing your hair down, consider getting a haircut that includes layers around your face. These layers help to keep your hair from sticking to your neck.\n\nAlso, don't forget to use hair products that are designed for styling in hot weather to ensure they stay in place and won't make you sweat even more.",
