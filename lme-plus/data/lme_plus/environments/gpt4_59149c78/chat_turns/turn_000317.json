  "content": "There is some evidence to suggest that Vikings did have sauna parties or gatherings. The sweat houses or saunas were often used as a social gathering place, where family and friends could sit together and chat while enjoying the steam and heat. \n\nViking sagas, which are stories about the history and myths of the Viking Age, often describe scenes where characters would gather in a sauna to discuss important matters or celebrate a special event. The sagas also mention that people would sometimes bring food and drink into the sauna, creating a festive atmosphere.\n\nIt is possible that sauna parties were even used as a way to host important meetings or negotiations, as the sauna was seen as a neutral and sacred space that could facilitate communication and healing.\n\nOverall, while we have limited information about sauna parties specifically, it is clear that the sauna was an important gathering place for Vikings and that it held both social and spiritual significance.",
