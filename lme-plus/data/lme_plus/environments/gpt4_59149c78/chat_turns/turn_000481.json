The approach you've chosen makes a lot of sense, and it's great that you're thinking about your laundry needs and how to prioritize them.\n\nBy doing essentials and delicates on Tuesdays, you'll ensure that you have a steady supply of fresh undergarments, towels, and other must-haves. And by saving the heavier items for Fridays, you'll be able to tackle them when you have more time and energy.\n\nRemember, the key to making this approach work is to stick to it consistently. Try to make it a habit to sort your laundry accordingly, and you'll find that it becomes second nature.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, happy laundry day, and I hope your new approach works out wonderfully for you!",
