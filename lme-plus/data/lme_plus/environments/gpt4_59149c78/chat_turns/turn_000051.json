However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't attend your family reunion or taste your mom's signature ribs.\n\nBut don't worry, I can definitely provide you with some delicious BBQ rib recipes that might just become your new family favorite! Here are a few options:\n\n**Recipe 1: Classic BBQ Ribs with Dry Rub**\n\n* 2 racks of pork ribs (St. Louis-style or baby back ribs)\n* 1/4 cup dry rub (mix of paprika, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper)\n* 1 cup BBQ sauce (your favorite brand or homemade)\n* Wood chips or chunks for smoking (optional)\n\n**Recipe 2: Memphis-Style Wet Ribs**\n\n* 2 racks of pork ribs (St. Louis-style or baby back ribs)\n* 1/4 cup BBQ sauce (sweet and tangy)\n* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Recipe 3: Korean-Style BBQ Ribs with Gochujang**\n\n* 2 racks of pork ribs (St. Louis-style or baby back ribs)\n* 1/4 cup gochujang (Korean chili paste)\n* 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 1 teaspoon garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon ginger, grated\n* 1/4 cup chopped green onions for garnish\n\nThese are just a few examples to get you started.
