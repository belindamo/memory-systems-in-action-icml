  "content": "Yes, there have been incidents where Kurt Busch's team changes have led to conflicts with other drivers on the track. One example occurred in 2012, when Busch was driving for Phoenix Racing and wrecked with Jeff Gordon during the AdvoCare 500 at Phoenix International Raceway. Gordon was reportedly upset with Busch for the incident and confronted him after the race, leading to a physical altercation between the two drivers.\n\nAnother incident occurred in 2019, after Busch moved to Chip Ganassi Racing following his departure from Stewart-Haas Racing. During a race at Kentucky Speedway, Busch was involved in a late-race incident with Kyle Busch, his brother and fellow driver. The two made contact on the track, and Kurt later criticized Kyle in a post-race interview, saying that \"somebody always tries to dump me\" and that he \"can't trust [Kyle] out there.\" Kyle responded in a later interview, saying that he was disappointed in his brother's comments and that he didn't appreciate the criticism.\n\nOverall, while team changes can lead to conflicts and tensions between drivers, it's important to note that on-track incidents can occur for a variety of reasons, and not all of them are related to a driver's team affiliations.",
