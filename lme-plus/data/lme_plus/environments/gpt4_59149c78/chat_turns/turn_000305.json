  "content": "During the Viking Age, clothing was made primarily from wool, linen, and animal skin. Clothes were often dyed in bright colors, such as red, blue, and green. \n\nMen typically wore a tunic, which was a long shirt that reached their knees or ankles. These were often belted at the waist and had a split at the front or back to allow for greater flexibility. Over the tunic, they wore a cloak during cold weather. They also wore trousers made of wool or leather, which were often tucked into their boots. \n\nWomen wore similar clothing as men, but their tunics were longer and had tighter sleeves. They also wore apron dresses, which were long dresses with straps over their shoulders and a cloth apron over their front. Women also wore head coverings, such as veils and kerchiefs.\n\nFootwear during the Viking Age was often made of leather, with boots being the most common type of shoes worn. Gloves and mittens were also worn to keep the hands warm during colder weather.\n\nOverall, clothing during the Viking Age was practical and designed to keep people warm and protected during the harsh Northern European climate.",
