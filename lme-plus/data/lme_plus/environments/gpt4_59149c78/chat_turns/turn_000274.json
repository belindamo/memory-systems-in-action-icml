He was a member of the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination and concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the shooting.\nIt's worth noting that there are various conspiracy theories surrounding JFK's death, but none of them have been proven conclusively and the majority of experts and historians accept the Warren Commission's findings that Oswald acted alone in the assassination.",
