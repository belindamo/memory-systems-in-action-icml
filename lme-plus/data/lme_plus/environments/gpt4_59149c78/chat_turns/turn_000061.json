  "content": "Cornbread is a fantastic addition to your BBQ ribs and sides! It's a classic Southern staple that pairs perfectly with the smoky flavor of the ribs.\n\nNow, about making a moist and crumbly cornbread... Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect texture:\n\n1. **Use buttermilk**: Buttermilk adds a tangy flavor and tenderness to the cornbread. If you don't have buttermilk, you can make a substitute by mixing 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using.\n2. **Don't overmix**: Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough cornbread. Mix the wet and dry ingredients separately and gently fold them together until just combined.\n3. **Use the right ratio of cornmeal to flour**: A good ratio is 2 parts cornmeal to 1 part all-purpose flour. This will help maintain the cornbread's texture and prevent it from becoming too dense.\n4. **Add a little extra moisture**: Adding an extra tablespoon or two of butter, oil, or honey can help keep the cornbread moist.\n5. **Don't overbake**: Cornbread is best when it's lightly golden brown and still slightly tender in the center. Check it frequently towards the end of the baking time to avoid overbaking.\n6. **Use the right type of cornmeal**: Stone-ground cornmeal is preferred for cornbread because it has a coarser texture and more flavor than steel-ground cornmeal.\n7. **Add some extra flavor**: Consider adding some diced jalape\u00f1os, chopped scallions, or grated cheese to give your cornbread an extra boost of flavor.\n\nHere's a simple cornbread recipe to get you started:\n\n**Classic Cornbread Recipe**\n\n* 2 cups stone-ground cornmeal\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n* 1 cup buttermilk\n* 2 large eggs\n* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n* Honey or sugar, to taste\n* Optional: diced jalape\u00f1os, chopped scallions, or grated cheese\n\nPreheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish or a 9-inch round cake pan. Mix the wet and dry ingredients separately and gently fold them together until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until lightly golden brown and still slightly tender in the center.\n\nI hope these tips and the recipe help you create a delicious and moist cornbread to accompany your BBQ ribs and sides!\n\n(And, by the way, I'm sure Lucas was the star of the show at the family reunion!)",
