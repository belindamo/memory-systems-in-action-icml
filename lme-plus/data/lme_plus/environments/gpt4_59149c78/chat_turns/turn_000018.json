  "content": "I've been really enjoying my Disney+ subscription, especially the Marvel movies. I've watched all 10 of them so far, and I've been watching them on my commute to work, usually 30-40 minutes a day, 5 days a week. I've also been recommending \"Tiger King\" to all my friends and family, which I finished in one weekend on Netflix. Speaking of Netflix, I've been using it for about two years now, and I've watched a lot of documentaries in the past three months. Do you think either HBO or Hulu has a stronger documentary lineup?",
