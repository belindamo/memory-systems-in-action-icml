And, wow, aerial shots of the lake house sounds like a great way to capture memories!\n\nNow, about using apple wood chips or chunks for smoking: absolutely! Apple wood is a fantastic choice for smoking ribs, and it will complement the dry rub and BBQ sauce flavors beautifully. Apple wood adds a mild, sweet, and fruity flavor that pairs well with the pork and the spices in the dry rub. The sweetness of the apple wood will also balance out the tanginess of the BBQ sauce.\n\nWhen using apple wood chips or chunks, make sure to soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before adding them to the grill. This will help prevent flare-ups and ensure a smooth, consistent smoke flavor.\n\nHere are some general guidelines for using apple wood chips or chunks:\n\n* Apple wood chips: Add 1-2 cups of soaked chips to the grill, and replenish as needed to maintain a steady smoke.\n* Apple wood chunks: Add 2-3 chunks to the grill, and replenish as needed.\n\nYou can also mix apple wood with other types of wood, like hickory or cherry, to create a unique flavor profile. However, if you're new to smoking, it's best to start with a single type of wood to get a feel for how it affects the flavor.\n\nRemember to keep an eye on the temperature and adjust the airflow to maintain a consistent smoke flavor. And don't be afraid to experiment with different wood types and flavor combinations to find your signature taste!\n\nNow, go ahead and get ready to impress your family with those delicious, smoky ribs!",
