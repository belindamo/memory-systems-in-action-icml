  "content": "There is evidence to suggest that Vikings did use perfumes and scents, although they were likely not as popular or widely used as they are today. \n\nOne popular scent during the Viking Age was a type of resin called frankincense, which was often used in religious ceremonies and believed to have healing properties. Other commonly used scents included myrrh, saffron, and cinnamon.\n\nAdditionally, Vikings often used spices and herbs to mask body odor and freshen their breath. Herbs such as sage and thyme were believed to have cleansing properties and were used in a variety of personal hygiene rituals.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Vikings were known for their association with the natural world, and many scents may have come from the environment around them. For example, Vikings may have used fragrant oils made from plants such as lavender and rosemary, which can be found growing in the wild.\n\nOverall, while Vikings did use scents and fragrances as part of their grooming rituals, it is likely that they were much simpler and more natural than the perfumes we use today.",
