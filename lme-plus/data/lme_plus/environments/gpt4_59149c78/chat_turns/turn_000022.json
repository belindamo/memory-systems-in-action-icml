It sounds like they're very focused on quality over quantity, and that they're willing to take risks on unique and innovative ideas. I'm starting to lean more towards HBO, especially since I've been enjoying their documentaries and I'm interested in their sci-fi and fantasy shows. Can you tell me more about their pricing and plans, and how they compare to Hulu?",
