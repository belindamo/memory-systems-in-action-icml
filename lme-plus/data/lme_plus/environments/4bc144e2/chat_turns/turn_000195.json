  "content": "I'd like to ask, what's the best way to get into poetry? I've recently attended a poetry reading event at a local coffee shop, where three local poets read from their latest collections. I was particularly moved by the works of Rachel Wiley, who read from her book \"Fat Girl on a Plane\". I ended up buying her book and getting it signed by her. We chatted briefly about our shared love of poetry and writing.",
