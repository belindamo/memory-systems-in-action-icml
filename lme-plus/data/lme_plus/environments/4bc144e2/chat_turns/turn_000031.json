  "content": "92130 is a great zip code!\n\nFor running shoes, I'd recommend checking out the following stores in your area:\n\n1. Road Runner Sports - Located in La Jolla, about 10-15 minutes from the 92130 zip code. They offer a wide selection of running shoes, knowledgeable staff, and a 90-day guarantee.\n2. Fleet Feet San Diego - With two locations in San Diego, one in University Heights and one in Carmel Valley, Fleet Feet is a popular choice among runners. They offer a wide range of running shoes, accessories, and training programs.\n3. Running Warehouse - Although they're an online retailer, Running Warehouse has a physical store in Sorrento Valley, about 20-25 minutes from the 92130 zip code. They offer a wide selection of running shoes, and their staff is knowledgeable about running and footwear.\n\nAs for your Vans, they might not be the best choice for a long day on your feet at an outdoor concert. While Vans are comfortable, they're not designed for long periods of standing or walking, and they might not provide the necessary arch support or cushioning for your feet.\n\nIf you're planning to be on your feet for an extended period, I'd recommend wearing shoes that are designed for comfort and support, such as sneakers or hiking shoes. You might consider investing in a pair of shoes specifically designed for walking or hiking, or even a pair of comfortable running shoes (like the ones you're looking to buy!).\n\nThat being said, if you do decide to wear your Vans, make sure to break them in beforehand and consider bringing a spare pair of socks to change into if your feet start to get uncomfortable. You might also want to consider bringing a small backpack or tote with some foot care essentials, like band-aids, moleskin, and pain relievers, just in case.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
