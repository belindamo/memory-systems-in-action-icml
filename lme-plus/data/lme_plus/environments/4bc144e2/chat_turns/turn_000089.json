It's great to hear that you're having a wonderful experience with your aquatic hobby.\n\nNeon tetras, harlequin rasboras, and guppies are all peaceful, community-friendly fish, so you've got a good foundation for a thriving tank. When introducing new fish, it's essential to consider their compatibility, size, swimming level, and water requirements. Here are some species that can complement your existing fish:\n\n1. **Corydoras Catfish** (Corydoras spp.): These small, armored catfish are excellent bottom-dwellers that will help clean up food debris. They're peaceful, school in groups, and are easy to care for.\n2. **Dwarf Honey Gouramis** (Colisa chuna): These small, peaceful gouramis are easy to care for and can be kept in small schools. They're not fin-nippers, so they won't bother your guppies.\n3. **Zebra Danios** (Danio rerio): Another active, hardy fish that can be kept in schools. They're tolerant of changes in water conditions and are easy to care for.\n4. **Pygmy Corydoras** (Corydoras pygmaeus): If you want to add more variety to your bottom-dwelling fish, pygmy corydoras are a great choice. They're small, peaceful, and school in groups.\n5. **Hatchetfish** (Gasteropelecidae family): These surface-dwelling fish are very active and can be kept in small schools. They're relatively low-maintenance and don't bother other fish.\n6. **Otto Catfish** (Otocinclus catfish): These small, peaceful catfish are great algae eaters and can be kept in small schools. They're very low-maintenance and won't bother your other fish.\n\nRemember to research each species' specific care requirements, including water temperature, pH, and diet, to ensure they're compatible with your existing fish and tank conditions.\n\nBefore introducing new fish, make sure your tank is stable and able to support the additional bioload. You may also want to consider upgrading your tank's filtration system or performing regular water changes to maintain optimal water quality.\n\nEnjoy your tank and happy fish-keeping!",
