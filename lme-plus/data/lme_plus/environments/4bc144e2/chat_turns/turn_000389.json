  "content": "The House of Horrors is a year-round attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood, so you can definitely experience it during your daytime visit.\n\nThe House of Horrors is a walk-through attraction that's located in the lower lot of the park. It's a dark and eerie experience that takes you through a series of themed rooms and corridors, featuring iconic horror characters and scenes from various Universal horror movies.\n\nThe attraction is designed to create a sense of unease and fear, with special effects, lighting, and sound design all working together to create a spooky atmosphere. You'll encounter characters from classic Universal monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolf Man, as well as more modern horror icons.\n\nThe House of Horrors is a self-guided experience, so you can take your time and explore the different rooms at your own pace. It's a great attraction for horror fans, and it's a good option if you're looking for a more low-key, non-ride experience.\n\nKeep in mind that the House of Horrors is a relatively small attraction, and it's not as intense or scary as some of the mazes you might have experienced during Halloween Horror Nights. However, it's still a fun and atmospheric experience that's worth checking out if you're a horror fan or just looking for something a little different.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with.",
