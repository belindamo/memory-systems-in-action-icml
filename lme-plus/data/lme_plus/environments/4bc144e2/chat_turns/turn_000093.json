Here are some tips and recommendations for keeping cherry shrimp:\n\n**Shrimp Food:**\n\n1. **High-quality commercial pellets:** Look for pellets specifically formulated for shrimp, such as Hikari Shrimp Food or Shirakura Shrimp Food. These pellets are usually rich in nutrients and designed to promote healthy growth and coloration.\n2. **Blanched vegetables:** Cherry shrimp love blanched vegetables like zucchini, spinach, and kale. Simply blanch the veggies in boiling water for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then let them cool before adding them to the tank.\n3. **Algae-based foods:** Algae wafers or algae-based flakes can be a great supplement to your shrimp's diet. They're rich in fiber and help promote a healthy gut.\n4. **Live or frozen foods:** Occasionally, you can offer live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, or mysis shrimp to provide a protein-rich treat.\n\n**Tips for Keeping Cherry Shrimp:**\n\n1. **Water Parameters:** Cherry shrimp prefer soft, slightly acidic water with a pH between 6.5-7.5, temperature around 22-25\u00b0C (72-77\u00b0F), and moderate water hardness (dGH 4-10).\n2. **Water Changes:** Regular water changes (10-20% every week) are crucial to maintain good water quality and prevent the buildup of toxins.\n3. **Tank Mates:** Cherry shrimp are generally peaceful and can be kept with other peaceful, small species like Amano shrimp, snails, or small schooling fish (like White Cloud Mountain minnows).\n4. **Hiding Places:** Provide plenty of hiding places, such as plants, rocks, and driftwood, to help your shrimp feel secure and reduce stress.\n5. **Avoid Overcrowding:** Cherry shrimp can be sensitive to overcrowding, so maintain a reasonable stocking density (about 1-2 shrimp per liter).\n6. **Monitor Water Quality:** Regularly test your water for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels to ensure a healthy environment.\n7. **Avoid Copper:** Cherry shrimp are sensitive to copper, so avoid using copper-based medications or decorations in your tank.\n\nSome popular shrimp-keeping products you might find useful:\n\n* A high-quality shrimp net for catching and handling your shrimp\n* A water conditioner specifically designed for shrimp, like Seachem Prime or API Tap Water Conditioner\n* A shrimp-safe substrate, such as ADA Amazonia or Eco-Complete, that promotes beneficial bacteria growth and helps maintain good water quality\n\nBy following these tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving cherry shrimp tank!",
