  "content": "During the lecture \"Biblical Series XIV: Jacob: Wrestling with God,\" Jordan Peterson references several specific biblical passages, including:\n\n* Genesis 25-36, which contains the story of Jacob's life and his encounters with Esau, Rachel, Leah, and the angel.\n* Genesis 32:22-32, which describes the story of Jacob wrestling with the angel.\n* Genesis 35:9-15, which describes Jacob's encounter with God at Bethel.\n* Exodus 3:14, in which God reveals his name to Moses as \"I am who I am,\" which Peterson connects to the significance of names in ancient Hebrew culture.\n* Psalm 23, which Peterson uses to highlight the theme of the divine shepherd guiding and protecting his flock.\n* Matthew 5:48, in which Jesus instructs his followers to \"be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect,\" which Peterson interprets as a call to strive for self-improvement and personal transformation.\n* Revelation 12:7-9, which describes the battle between the archangel Michael and Satan, which Peterson uses to connect the story of Jacob wrestling with the angel to broader themes of spiritual warfare and the struggle between good and evil.",
