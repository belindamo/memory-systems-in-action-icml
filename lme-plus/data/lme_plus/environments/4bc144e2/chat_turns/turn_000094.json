  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I've already ordered a small 5-gallon tank and some shrimp food, and I'm planning to pick up some shrimp from a local breeder next weekend. I'm thinking of adding some Java moss and Anacharis to the tank for decoration and to provide hiding places for the shrimp. Do you have any experience with those plants, and are there any other plants that you would recommend for a shrimp tank?",
