  "content": "What a wonderful experience! Attending a poetry reading event is a great way to get into poetry, and it's even more special that you got to meet the poet and chat with her about your shared passion.\n\nGetting into poetry can be a personal and intimate experience, and there's no one \"right\" way to do it. However, here are some suggestions to help you deepen your connection with poetry:\n\n1. **Read widely**: Explore different styles, forms, and eras of poetry. Read contemporary poets like Rachel Wiley, as well as classic poets like Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, or Langston Hughes.\n2. **Start with what resonates**: Begin with poems that speak to your emotions, experiences, or interests. Rachel Wiley's work, for example, explores themes of body positivity, identity, and self-acceptance. Find poems that resonate with you, and use them as a gateway to explore more.\n3. **Attend poetry events**: Continue attending poetry readings, open mic nights, or workshops in your local community. These events can be a great way to discover new poets, hear their work, and connect with like-minded people.\n4. **Explore different forms**: Poetry comes in many forms, such as sonnets, free verse, haikus, or spoken word. Experiment with different forms to find what speaks to you.\n5. **Write your own poetry**: Try your hand at writing poetry! It's a great way to tap into your creativity, process your emotions, and develop a deeper appreciation for the craft. Don't worry about being \"good\" \u2013 just enjoy the process.\n6. **Find a poetry community**: Look for online forums, social media groups, or local writing groups that focus on poetry. Sharing your thoughts and work with others can help you stay motivated and inspired.\n7. **Listen to poetry**: Poetry can be a powerful oral tradition. Listen to poetry podcasts, audiobooks, or recordings of poets reading their own work. This can help you appreciate the sound, rhythm, and performance aspects of poetry.\n\nRachel Wiley's \"Fat Girl on a Plane\" is a great starting point. You might also want to explore other contemporary poets who write about themes of identity, body positivity, and social justice, such as:\n\n* Warsan Shire\n* Rupi Kaur\n* Danez Smith\n* Eve L. Ewing\n* Airea D. Matthews\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to approach poetry with an open heart and mind. Allow yourself to be moved, inspired, and challenged by the words and ideas you encounter.",
