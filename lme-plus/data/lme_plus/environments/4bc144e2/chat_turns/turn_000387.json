  "content": "The Terror Tram is not a year-round attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood. It's actually a part of the Halloween Horror Nights (HHN) event, which takes place on select nights from mid-September to early November.\n\nThe Terror Tram is a unique experience that's only available during HHN. It's a terrifying journey that takes you through a haunted area of the backlot, featuring scare zones, live actors, and special effects. The tram ride itself is a big part of the experience, as it's designed to create a sense of unease and fear.\n\nSince you attended HHN on October 22nd and 29th, you might have already experienced the Terror Tram! If so, you know how intense and frightening it can be. If you didn't get a chance to ride it, don't worry \u2013 you can always come back next year and experience it again.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Universal Studios Hollywood during the day, you can explore the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, ride thrilling attractions like the Revenge of the Mummy roller coaster, and experience behind-the-scenes looks at movie magic. However, the Terror Tram is exclusive to Halloween Horror Nights and won't be available during the day.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
