Opting for the full-weekend pass will give you the freedom to explore the festival at your own pace, enjoy all the acts and activities, and take breaks whenever you need to. You'll be able to soak up the atmosphere, try some delicious food, and make new friends.\n\nIt's also fantastic that you're planning to take a few days off work to attend the festival. You deserve a break, and what better way to spend it than enjoying live music and exploring a city you love? Revisiting your favorite spots and discovering new ones will make the experience even more special.\n\nRemember to check the festival's website and social media for any travel and accommodation packages that might be available. Sometimes, festivals partner with local hotels or travel companies to offer special deals for attendees. You might be able to find a package that includes festival tickets, accommodation, and travel arrangements, which could simplify your planning process.\n\nAdditionally, consider reaching out to your hostel from last time to see if they have any availability or special rates for festival-goers. They might be able to offer you a discounted rate or help you book a room with other festival attendees.\n\nGet ready for an amazing adventure, and I'm sure you'll have an incredible time at Panorama Music Festival!",
