  "content": "Shredding the Oaxaca cheese will definitely help distribute its creamy flavor throughout the burrito. \n\nWhen it comes to salsa for a breakfast burrito, you've got a lot of options. Pico de gallo is a great choice, but you might want to consider a few other options to complement the flavors in your burrito. Here are some salsa suggestions:\n\n1. **Mild Salsa Roja**: A classic, smooth salsa made with tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00f1os, and cilantro. It's a great all-purpose salsa that won't overpower the other flavors in your burrito.\n2. **Salsa Verde**: A tangy, herby salsa made with tomatillos, onions, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os. It's a great match for the sweetness of the roasted sweet potatoes and the creaminess of the Oaxaca cheese.\n3. **Avocado Salsa**: A creamy, mild salsa made with ripe avocados, red onions, lime juice, and cilantro. It's a great choice if you want to add more healthy fats and creaminess to your burrito.\n4. **Chipotle Salsa**: A smoky, spicy salsa made with chipotle peppers, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro. It's a great option if you want to add a bold, spicy kick to your burrito.\n5. **Hatch Green Chile Salsa**: A mild to medium-hot salsa made with roasted Hatch green chiles, tomatoes, onions, and garlic. It's a great choice if you want to add a Southwestern twist to your burrito.\n\nAll of these salsa options will complement the flavors in your breakfast burrito. If you want to stick with something familiar, pico de gallo is always a great choice. But if you're feeling adventurous, try one of the other options to add a new dimension to your burrito.\n\nRemember, you can always adjust the level of heat in your salsa by using more or less jalape\u00f1os or other hot peppers. And if you're feeling extra fancy, you can make your own salsa from scratch using fresh ingredients!",
