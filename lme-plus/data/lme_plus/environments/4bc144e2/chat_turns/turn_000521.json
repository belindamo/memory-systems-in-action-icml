Beating your previous time requires a well-structured training plan, and incorporating strength training is a great way to improve your running performance.\n\nAs a beginner, it's essential to start with exercises that target the key muscle groups used in running, such as your legs, glutes, and core. Here are some exercises to get you started:\n\n**Legs:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then bend your knees and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Push back up to the starting position.\n2. **Lunges**: Stand with your feet together, take a large step forward with one foot, and lower your body until your back knee almost touches the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Alternate legs.\n3. **Calf raises**: Stand on the edge of a step or curb with your heels hanging off the edge. Raise up onto your tiptoes, then lower back down.\n\n**Glutes:**\n\n1. **Glute bridges**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Lift your hips up towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top, then lower back down.\n2. **Deadlifts**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend down and grab a weight or resistance band with your hands, and lift up to hip level. Lower the weight back down to the starting position.\n\n**Core:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Start in a push-up position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from head to heels. Hold for 30-60 seconds.\n2. **Russian twists**: Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat. Lean back slightly and lift your feet off the ground. Twist your torso from side to side, touching your hands to the ground each time.\n\n**Tips for beginners:**\n\n1. **Start with bodyweight exercises**: You don't need any equipment to get started. Bodyweight exercises are a great way to build strength and endurance.\n2. **Begin with lower reps and sets**: Start with 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps for each exercise. As you get stronger, you can increase the number of sets and reps.\n3. **Focus on proper form**: It's more important to focus on proper form and technique than the number of reps or weight you're lifting. This will help prevent injuries and ensure you're targeting the right muscle groups.\n4. **Incorporate strength training 2-3 times a week**: Aim to do strength training exercises 2-3 times a week, with at least one day of rest in between.\n5. **Start slow and progress gradually**: Don't try to do too much too soon. Start with exercises that feel comfortable, and gradually increase the intensity and difficulty as you get stronger.\n\nRemember to always warm up before strength training with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching. It's also essential to listen to your body and rest when needed.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to get started with strength training?",
