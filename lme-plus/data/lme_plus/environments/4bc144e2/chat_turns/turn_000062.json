I've heard great things about LR Baggs and their products are specifically designed for acoustic guitars. The Pedaltrain Nano Acoustic pedalboard looks like a great option too, it's compact and has a built-in DI box which would simplify my setup. Do you have any other recommendations for acoustic guitar accessories that could help improve my tone and playing experience?",
