  "content": "I was really impressed by how down-to-earth and humble Neil Gaiman came across, despite being such a famous author. He shared some great insights into his writing process and his latest book, The Ocean at the End of the Lane. I'm definitely going to re-read some of his works after that event. Based on your recommendations, I think I'll start with Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood. I've heard great things about his writing style. Can you tell me more about his background and what inspired him to write that book?",
