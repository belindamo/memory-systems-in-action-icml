Was it recently, or do you think it was a few months ago?\n\nIf you're not sure, we can try to estimate based on the typical oil change interval for your car. According to the Honda Civic's maintenance schedule, oil changes are usually recommended every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. If you don't remember the last oil change, we can assume it might be due soon.\n\nLet me know if you have any ideas or if you'd like to investigate further!",
