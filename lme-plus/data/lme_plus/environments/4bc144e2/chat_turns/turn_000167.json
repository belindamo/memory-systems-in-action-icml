  "content": "Yeah, I think I'll give \"The Silent Patient\" a try. I love a good psychological thriller, and the fact that it's a debut novel makes it even more intriguing. Since I just reorganized my bookshelf, I'm excited to add a new title to my collection. Speaking of which, I also donated around 20 books to the local library last weekend. It felt great to declutter and make some space for new stories and authors.",
