I'll create separate notebooks for different categories of recipes, like appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Within each notebook, I'll create individual notes for each recipe, including the ingredients, instructions, and stories associated with each dish. I'll also add tags and keywords to make it easy to search and filter the recipes.\n\nI might also consider using a recipe management tool like Paprika Recipe Manager or BigOven, which are specifically designed for organizing and tagging recipes. They have features like meal planning, grocery lists, and nutritional analysis, which could be useful for meal planning and cooking.\n\nIn addition to the digital archive, I might also create a physical binder or scrapbook with printed copies of the recipes, photos, and stories. This way, I can have a physical keepsake that I can flip through and share with family members.\n\nWhat do you think about using a physical binder or scrap",
