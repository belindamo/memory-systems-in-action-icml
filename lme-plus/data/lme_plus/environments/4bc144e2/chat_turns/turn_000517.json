  "content": "Plato and Pythagoras were ancient Greek philosophers who made significant contributions to the development of Western philosophy and mathematics. While they did not propose any hypothetical substances that were specifically fictional in nature, they did propose various philosophical ideas and concepts that have been influential in the development of Western thought.\n\nPlato, for example, proposed the concept of \"Forms\" or \"Ideas,\" which he believed to be eternal, unchanging, and perfect abstractions that exist independently of the material world. He also proposed the concept of the \"soul,\" which he believed to be immortal and separate from the body, and the concept of \"recollection,\" which he believed to be the process by which the soul remembers knowledge that it has acquired before birth.\n\nPythagoras, on the other hand, is known for his contributions to mathematics, particularly his theorem stating that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. He also believed in the concept of \"harmony\" and the idea that the universe is governed by mathematical principles.\n\nWhile these concepts and ideas were not specifically proposed as hypothetical substances in the way that the items on the list you provided earlier were, they have had a significant influence on the development of Western thought and continue to be studied and debated by philosophers and scholars today.",
