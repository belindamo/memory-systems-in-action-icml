Let's focus on tracking your car maintenance expenses.\n\nTo make it easier to track your expenses, I'll create a simple table for you:\n\n| Date | Description | Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Feb 10 | Replaced air filter | $25 |\n|  |  |  |\n\nFeel free to add more entries as you remember or receive new maintenance services. If you have any gas fill-ups or other car-related expenses, you can add those as well.\n\nDo you remember any other maintenance services or car-related expenses from the past few months?",
