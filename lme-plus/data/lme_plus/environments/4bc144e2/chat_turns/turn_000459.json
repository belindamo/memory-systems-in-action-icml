Have you had either of those done recently? Do you remember when you last had your tires rotated or brake pads replaced?\n\nIf you're not sure, we can assume they might be due soon. We can also check your car's maintenance schedule or consult with a mechanic to determine when these services are typically recommended.\n\nLet me know if you have any ideas or if you'd like to investigate further!",
