  "content": "That sounds like a blast! Giving a speech at a wedding can be a nerve-wracking experience, but it's great that you had fun with it. And photo booths are always a hit at weddings, aren't they? I'm sure you and your aunt had a wonderful time taking silly photos together.\n\nIt's lovely that you have such fond memories of the wedding and the bride's family's B&B. Reaching out to them about staying at their B&B is a great idea. Since you've already experienced their hospitality, you know you'll be in good hands.\n\nWhen you do reach out, don't hesitate to mention your connection to the bride and your experience at the wedding. It's possible they might offer you a special rate or package deal as a thank you for being part of their special day. Plus, it's always nice to support family friends and their business ventures.\n\nRemember to ask about any packages or promotions they might be offering, especially since it's your anniversary. You might be able to score a romantic getaway package with extras like a candlelit dinner or a couples' massage.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you have a wonderful time at the B&B!",
