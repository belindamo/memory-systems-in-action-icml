I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to keep track of your schedule or personal events.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general advice on how to find out about the venue's seating arrangements!\n\nFor the concert on May 1st, I recommend checking the venue's website, social media, or contacting their customer service directly to ask about the seating arrangements. They should be able to provide you with information on whether the event is standing room only, has reserved seating, or offers a mix of both.\n\nYou can also check your ticket or confirmation email to see if it mentions anything about seating. If you're still unsure, you could reach out to the event organizer or the concert promoter to get more information.\n\nRemember to plan ahead, arrive early, and be prepared for the venue's policies and rules. Have a great time at the concert!",
