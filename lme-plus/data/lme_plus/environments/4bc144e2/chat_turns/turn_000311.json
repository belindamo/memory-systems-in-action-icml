  "content": "The Original Farmers Market is a great spot! You can definitely find similar Middle Eastern-inspired dishes at some of the restaurants I mentioned earlier. Here are a few options:\n\n**Middle Eastern-inspired options:**\n\n1. **Coni'Seafood** (approx. 2 miles from LAX) - While they're known for their seafood, they also have a variety of Mexican-inspired dishes, including a Shawarma-style Carne Asada Tacos.\n2. **Eggslut** (approx. 1.5 miles from LAX) - They have a \"Fairfax\" sandwich that features lamb bacon, which might scratch that Middle Eastern itch.\n3. **Pitfire Pizza** (approx. 2 miles from LAX) - They offer a \"Lamb Meatball\" pizza that might remind you of the flavors you enjoyed at The Original Farmers Market.\n\nIf you're craving something more specific, like a chicken shawarma wrap, you might want to consider:\n\n**Special mentions:**\n\n1. **Mama's Falafel** (approx. 2.5 miles from LAX) - A small, family-owned spot serving authentic Middle Eastern cuisine, including shawarma, falafel, and gyro wraps.\n2. **Sahara Falafel** (approx. 3 miles from LAX) - Another highly-recommended spot for Middle Eastern cuisine, including shawarma, falafel, and hummus.\n\nKeep in mind that these options might not be as close to LAX as some of the other restaurants I mentioned earlier. However, they're still within a reasonable driving distance or a short Uber ride away.\n\nIf you're short on time, you could also consider ordering take-out or delivery from one of these spots. Many of them offer online ordering and delivery services.\n\nI hope this helps you find your next delicious shawarma fix!",
