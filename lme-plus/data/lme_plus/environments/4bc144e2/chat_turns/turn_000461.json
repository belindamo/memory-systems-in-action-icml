To get started, could you please tell me:\n\n1. Which concerts or artists are you interested in seeing?\n2. What's your preferred venue or location for the concert?\n3. Are you flexible with dates or do you have a specific date in mind?\n4. What's your budget for the tickets?\n5. Are you looking for a specific type of ticket, such as floor seats or VIP packages?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some guidance on finding the best deals on tickets.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time ticket inventory, but I can give you tips on how to find deals, suggest websites to check, and offer advice on how to navigate the ticket-buying process.",
