  "content": "Yes, you're correct. Nagpur was among the first cities in India to implement a ban on single-use plastics, including plastic bags, cutlery, and other items. The ban was enforced in 2018 and has since then helped in reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainable living. The government has also implemented fines and penalties for violators of the ban to ensure its effectiveness. It is an excellent initiative towards reducing plastic pollution and shows how a city can take significant steps towards promoting sustainability. It is hoped that other cities follow Nagpur's example and take similar steps towards reducing single-use plastics.",
