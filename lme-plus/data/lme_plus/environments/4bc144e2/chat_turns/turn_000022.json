  "content": "Georgetown University has a dedicated Center for Social Justice, Research, Teaching, and Service (CSJ), which provides students with resources and assistance to find internships in politics, government, and the non-profit sector.\n\nTo find out more about internships on political campaigns, a good place to start is by visiting the CSJ's website and looking for the Campaign & Advocacy Opportunities program. This program lists a variety of opportunities for students to work on political campaigns at the local, state, and national level, as well as advocacy organizations that work on issues such as immigration, healthcare, and civil rights.\n\nIn addition to the CSJ, Georgetown has several student-run clubs and organizations that focus on politics and government, such as the Georgetown University College Democrats or Republicans, where you can inquire about campaign internship opportunities. It might also be useful to network with alumni who have worked on political campaigns, and to attend events hosted by the Political Science Department or other campus organizations where you can meet professionals in the field.",
