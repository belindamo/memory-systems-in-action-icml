  "content": "Panorama Music Festival typically offers single-day passes, in addition to full-weekend passes. However, the availability of single-day passes might be limited, and they usually go on sale after the full-weekend passes.\n\nIn previous years, the festival has offered the following ticket options:\n\n1. **Full-Weekend Passes:** These passes grant access to all three days of the festival, typically from Friday to Sunday.\n2. **Single-Day Passes:** These passes are available for individual days, allowing you to attend the festival on either Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.\n3. **VIP Passes:** These premium passes offer additional perks, such as exclusive viewing areas, priority entry, and access to VIP-only bars and restrooms.\n\nSingle-day passes are usually available in limited quantities, and they tend to sell out quickly. If you're interested in attending only one day of the festival, be prepared to act fast when single-day passes go on sale.\n\nKeep in mind that the festival's ticketing policy might change from year to year, so it's essential to check the official Panorama Music Festival website or social media channels for the most up-to-date information on ticket options and availability.\n\nAs a pro tip, if you're planning to attend the festival with friends, consider buying full-weekend passes together. It might be more cost-effective, and you'll have the freedom to explore the festival without worrying about single-day pass limitations.",
