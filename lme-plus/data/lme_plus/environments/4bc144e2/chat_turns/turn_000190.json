Here's some background on him and the book:\n\nHaruki Murakami was born in 1949 in Kyoto, Japan. He grew up in a traditional Japanese family, but his parents were also influenced by Western culture, which exposed him to Western literature and music from an early age. This blend of Eastern and Western cultural influences is a hallmark of his writing style.\n\nMurakami's early life was marked by a sense of disconnection and alienation, which would later become a theme in his writing. He felt like an outsider in his own country, drawn to Western culture and values. He studied literature at Waseda University, where he developed a passion for magic realism, a literary style that blends fantastical elements with realistic descriptions of everyday life.\n\nAfter college, Murakami opened a small jazz club in Tokyo, which became a gathering place for artists and intellectuals. During this time, he began writing fiction, drawing inspiration from his own experiences, dreams, and interests in philosophy, psychology, and mythology.\n\nNorwegian Wood, published in 1987, was Murakami's breakthrough novel. It's a coming-of-age story set in the 1960s, exploring themes of identity, love, loss, and the search for meaning. The novel follows Toru Watanabe, a young college student, as he navigates his relationships with two women, Naoko and Midori, and grapples with the death of his best friend, Kizuki.\n\nThe book was inspired by Murakami's own experiences growing up in Japan during the 1960s, a time of great social change and cultural upheaval. He drew on his own feelings of alienation and disconnection, as well as his fascination with Western culture, particularly the music of The Beatles (the title \"Norwegian Wood\" is a reference to the Beatles' song \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\").\n\nMurakami's writing style in Norwegian Wood is characterized by:\n\n1. Magical realism: Murakami blends fantastical elements with realistic descriptions of everyday life, creating a dreamlike atmosphere.\n2. Stream-of-consciousness narration: The novel is written in a fluid, introspective style, which mirrors the protagonist's inner thoughts and emotions.\n3. Exploration of identity: The novel explores the search for identity, particularly in the context of Japanese culture, where tradition and modernity collide.\n4. Use of symbolism: Murakami employs symbolism throughout the novel, drawing on Japanese mythology, literature, and cultural references.\n\nNorwegian Wood is a beautifully written, haunting novel that explores the complexities of human relationships, identity, and the search for meaning. I think you'll find it a great introduction to Murakami's work, and it will likely leave you wanting to read more of his books.\n\nWhat do you think you'll be looking for in Norwegian Wood? Are there any specific themes or elements you're interested in exploring?",
