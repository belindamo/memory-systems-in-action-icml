  "content": "That's great to hear! The Jabbawockeez are an amazing group, and their performances are always high-energy and lots of fun. They're a great addition to the Halloween Horror Nights lineup.\n\nI'm glad you got to experience some of the scare zones and live shows during your visits. The scare zones are a big part of the Halloween Horror Nights experience, and they really add to the overall atmosphere of the event. The live shows, like the Jabbawockeez performance, are a great way to take a break from the scares and enjoy some entertainment.\n\nIt's great that you got to experience Halloween Horror Nights on two different nights, too. The event is always changing, with new scares and surprises each night, so I'm sure you had a different experience each time you attended.\n\nNow, I'm excited for you to experience the Universal Studios Tour and see the behind-the-scenes magic of the studio. It's a completely different experience from Halloween Horror Nights, but it's just as fun and exciting in its own way. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with!",
