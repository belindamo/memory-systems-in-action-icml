Both the Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof and the Keen Targhee II Mid WP are excellent options, but they have some differences that might make one more suitable for your needs than the other.\n\n**Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof:**\n\n* Known for their breathability and moisture-wicking properties, making them a great choice for warm and wet conditions.\n* Feature a Vibram TC5+ outsole, which provides excellent traction and durability on various terrain.\n* Have a slightly more aggressive tread pattern, which can help with stability on uneven ground.\n* The Moab 2 Mid has a more snug, comfortable fit, with a roomy toe box and a supportive ankle collar.\n* Weight: approximately 2 lbs 1 oz (935g) per pair.\n\n**Keen Targhee II Mid WP:**\n\n* Offer a more relaxed fit, with a wider toe box and a comfortable, cushioned ride.\n* Feature a Keen.Dry waterproof membrane, which provides excellent protection against water and wet conditions.\n* Have a lugged outsole with a more moderate tread pattern, which provides good traction on a variety of surfaces.\n* The Targhee II Mid has a slightly more minimalist design, which can make them feel lighter and more agile.\n* Weight: approximately 1 lb 13 oz (820g) per pair.\n\n**Comparison and Recommendation:**\n\nBoth boots are high-quality, waterproof, and designed for mid-cut ankle support. The main differences lie in their fit, tread pattern, and weight.\n\nIf you:\n\n* Prefer a snugger fit and more aggressive tread pattern, the Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof might be the better choice.\n* Need a more relaxed fit and a lighter, more agile feel, the Keen Targhee II Mid WP could be the way to go.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you make a decision:\n\n* What's the terrain like on your trip? If you'll be hiking on rough, uneven ground, the Merrell Moab 2 might be a better choice. For smoother trails, the Keen Targhee II might be sufficient.\n* How important is weight and agility to you? If you want a lighter, more comfortable boot, the Keen Targhee II might be the better option.\n* Do you tend to have wider or narrower feet? If you have wider feet, the Keen Targhee II might provide a more comfortable fit.\n\nUltimately, both boots are excellent choices, and you can't go wrong with either one. If possible, try on both pairs to see which one feels more comfortable and suits your needs better.",
