  "content": "Both Hulu and Amazon Prime have a decent selection of classic movies, but the quality and quantity of their collections vary.\n\n**Hulu:**\n\nHulu's classic movie selection is somewhat limited compared to other streaming services. They have a rotating selection of classic films, but it's not as extensive as some other platforms. You can find some notable titles, such as:\n\n* Classic Universal monster movies (e.g., Dracula, Frankenstein)\n* Some Alfred Hitchcock films (e.g., Psycho, Rear Window)\n* A few classic Westerns (e.g., The Searchers, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid)\n* A limited selection of classic comedies (e.g., Some Like It Hot, His Girl Friday)\n\nHulu's strength lies in its TV show offerings, so if you're primarily interested in classic movies, you might find their selection lacking.\n\n**Amazon Prime:**\n\nAmazon Prime, on the other hand, has a more extensive collection of classic movies. They've acquired rights to a large library of films from various studios, including:\n\n* Paramount Pictures: This deal brought a wealth of classic titles, such as:\n\t+ Roman Polanski's Chinatown\n\t+ Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather trilogy\n\t+ Classic Westerns like True Grit and The Shootist\n* Warner Bros.: Amazon Prime offers a range of classic WB films, including:\n\t+ Casablanca\n\t+ The Maltese Falcon\n\t+ The Philadelphia Story\n* Columbia Pictures: You can find some classic Columba titles, such as:\n\t+ Lawrence of Arabia\n\t+ A Man for All Seasons\n\t+ The Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nAmazon Prime also has a rotating selection of classic movies, with new titles added regularly. They often feature themed collections, like \"Classic Rom-Coms\" or \"Hitchcock Classics,\" which can be a great way to discover new old favorites.\n\n**Additional Options:**\n\nIf you're specifically looking for a vast collection of classic movies, you might consider supplementing your Hulu or Amazon Prime subscription with other services like:\n\n* The Criterion Channel: A streaming service dedicated to art-house and classic films, with a vast library of restored and curated titles.\n* TCM (Turner Classic Movies): A cable channel and streaming service focused on classic movies, with a large collection of titles and regular themed programming.\n* Kanopy: A free streaming service (with a library card or university login) offering a vast collection of classic films, documentaries, and indie titles.\n\nKeep in mind that the availability of classic movies on these platforms can change over time, so it's always a good idea to check their current offerings before committing to a subscription.",
