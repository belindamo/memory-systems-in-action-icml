  "content": "Sure, here are some examples of things a parent can do for a child per year from ages 0-3 to set them up for wealth and good money management, while building their own finances from scratch:\n\nAge 0:\n\n* Open a savings account for your child and make regular deposits. This can help teach your child the importance of saving and help you build a nest egg for their future.\n\nAge 1:\n\n* Teach your child the value of sharing and giving by starting a \"giving jar\" where you and your child can contribute spare change and donate it to a charity of your choice.\n\nAge 2:\n\n* Introduce your child to the concept of delayed gratification by setting small savings goals for them, such as saving for a toy they want. This can help teach them the value of saving for what they want rather than buying impulsively.\n\nAge 3:\n\n* Give your child a piggy bank or clear jar where they can see their money grow. This can help them learn about the different denominations of money and give them a sense of ownership over their savings.\n\nIn terms of building your own finances from scratch, you can start by creating a budget and tracking your expenses to get a better understanding of your financial situation. Look for ways to reduce expenses and increase your income, such as by picking up a side hustle or negotiating a raise at work. Consider investing in a retirement account or other investment vehicles to help grow your wealth over time.",
