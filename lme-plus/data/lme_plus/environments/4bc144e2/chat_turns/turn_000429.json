If you prefer a chewier texture, use old-fashioned oats. For a smoother texture, use rolled oats.\n* Almond butter: You can substitute almond butter with peanut butter, cashew butter, or sunflower seed butter. If you're using a natural peanut butter with oil separation, make sure to stir it well before using.\n* Honey: You can replace honey with maple syrup, agave nectar, or coconut sugar. Keep in mind that honey has antibacterial properties, so it's a great choice if you're looking for a natural preservative.\n* Salt: Add a pinch of salt to balance the sweetness and enhance the flavors.\n* Add-ins: Mix in your favorite ingredients to create different flavor combinations. Some ideas include:\n\t+ Chocolate chips for a sweet treat\n\t+ Chopped nuts (walnuts, almonds, or pecans) for added crunch\n\t+ Dried fruits (cranberries, raisins, or cherries) for natural sweetness\n\t+ Seeds (chia, flax, or hemp) for an extra nutritional boost\n\t+ Coconut flakes for a tropical flavor\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats and salt.\n2. In a separate bowl, mix together the almond butter and honey until smooth.\n3. Add the almond butter mixture to the oat mixture and stir until well combined.\n4. Fold in your desired add-ins (if using).\n5. Cover the mixture and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set.\n6. Once set, use a small cookie scoop or your hands to form the mixture into balls, about 1-inch in diameter. You should end up with around 12-15 energy bites.\n7. Store the energy bites in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze for up to 2 months.\n\nRemember, the key to making these no-bake energy bites is to use the right ratio of oats to nut butter to honey. If the mixture is too dry, add a bit more honey. If it's too sticky, add a bit more oats. Experiment with different combinations to find your perfect blend!",
