  "content": "You are correct that there may be limited information available on churches or Christian schools of thought that promote a sex-positive, non-stigmatizing approach to sexuality. However, there are some resources that may be helpful.\n\nOne organization that promotes a positive and inclusive approach to sexuality is the Religious Institute. They provide resources and training for religious leaders and communities to promote sexual health, education, and justice. They have also developed a guide called \"Sexuality and Our Faith: A Companion to Our Whole Lives\" that provides a faith-based approach to sexuality education.\n\nAnother organization that promotes a positive and affirming approach to sexuality is the Reformation Project. They work to promote LGBTQ inclusion and affirmation in Christian communities through education, training, and advocacy.\n\nThere are also some authors and theologians who have written about sexuality from a non-stigmatizing, sex-positive perspective. Some examples include:\n\n* Dr. Tina Schermer Sellers, a sex therapist and author who has written about sexuality and spirituality from a Christian perspective.\n* Matthew Vines, author of \"God and the Gay Christian,\" which presents a case for LGBTQ inclusion in the church.\n* Nadia Bolz-Weber, a Lutheran pastor and author who has written about sexuality and Christianity in a non-stigmatizing way.\n\nWhile these resources may not be widely known or easily accessible, they do exist and can provide a helpful starting point for individuals who are seeking a more positive and inclusive approach to sexuality within a Christian context.",
