  "content": "Panorama Music Festival is a fantastic event, and I'm sure you'll have a blast if you end up attending.\n\nTypically, Panorama Music Festival announces their lineup and tickets in a staggered release. Here's what you can expect:\n\n1. **Lineup Announcement:** The festival usually announces their lineup in late January or early February, about 4-5 months before the festival dates. They often release the lineup in phases, with the headliners and top-tier acts announced first, followed by the rest of the lineup.\n2. **Ticket On-Sale:** Tickets usually go on sale shortly after the lineup announcement, often within a week or two. You can expect tickets to be available in different tiers, including General Admission, VIP, and single-day passes.\n3. **Tiered Ticket Pricing:** Panorama Festival often uses a tiered pricing system, where ticket prices increase as the festival approaches. The earlier you buy your tickets, the cheaper they'll be.\n\nTo stay ahead of the game, I recommend following Panorama Music Festival's social media accounts and signing up for their newsletter to get notified about lineup announcements, ticket on-sale dates, and any special promotions.\n\nAdditionally, you can also set up price alerts on ticketing websites like Ticketmaster or AXS to notify you when tickets go on sale or when prices drop.\n\nBy being prepared, you'll be able to snag tickets to Panorama Music Festival and enjoy an amazing weekend of music, food, and fun in the city!",
