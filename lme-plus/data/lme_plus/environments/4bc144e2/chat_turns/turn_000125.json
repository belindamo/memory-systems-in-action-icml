  "content": "The Beremeal Bannock is indeed delicious and definitely worth trying! While it originated in Caithness and is closely associated with the region's culinary traditions, you may be able to find it in other parts of Scotland as well.\n\nBeremeal is a specialty grain that is primarily grown in the north of Scotland, so it is more widely available in the country's northern regions. Some artisanal bakers and specialty food shops throughout Scotland may also stock it or use it in their products.\n\nIf you are visiting Scotland or interested in trying Beremeal Bannock, it's worth seeking out local bakeries or specialty stores that may carry it. Alternatively, you can also try making it yourself using Beremeal flour, which can be ordered online or purchased in some specialty stores.",
