I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to keep track of your personal items or schedule.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general advice on concert-going attire!\n\nIf you're planning to wear a pair of shoes to a concert, it's always a good idea to consider the venue and the event type. If the concert is outdoors or in a venue that's prone to mud or dirt, it's a good idea to wear shoes that can withstand the conditions. Vans are a great choice for a casual concert, but you might want to consider bringing a spare pair of socks, just in case!\n\nAdditionally, you might want to dress in layers, as concert venues can get hot and crowded. Wear comfortable clothes that allow you to move around easily, and don't forget to bring any necessary items like earplugs, a phone charger, and some cash.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and enjoy the concert!",
