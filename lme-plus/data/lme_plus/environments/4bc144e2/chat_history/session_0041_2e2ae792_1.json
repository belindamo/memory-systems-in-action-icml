The opening act was this really cool indie rock band that I had never heard of before, but they were so good! And at \"Summer Sounds\", we saw some amazing acts, including The 1975, Panic! At The Disco, and Lizzo. One of the highlights of the festival was when Lizzo brought out a bunch of dancing seniors on stage during her set - it was so inspiring and fun!"
