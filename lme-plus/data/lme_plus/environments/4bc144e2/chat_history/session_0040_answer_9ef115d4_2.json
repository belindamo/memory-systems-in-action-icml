To get started, can you please provide me with some information about your car and the maintenance costs you've incurred over the past few months? Please provide the following details:\n\n1. Make and model of your car\n2. Mileage of your car (approximate)\n3. List of maintenance costs you've incurred over the past few months, including:\n\t* Date of each expense\n\t* Description of the service or repair (e.g. oil change, tire rotation, brake pads replaced, etc.)\n\t* Cost of each expense\n\nYou can share this information with me, and I'll help you organize it into a clear and easy-to-understand format. If you have any receipts or records, feel free to share those as well.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start or don't have all the information readily available, don't worry!

Oh, and by the way, I also got a parking ticket on January 5th near my work for $50, but that's not exactly a maintenance cost, I guess.",
