      "content": "Oaxaca cheese is a great addition to a breakfast burrito. \n\nWhen it comes to adding Oaxaca cheese to your burrito, you can use it in a few different ways, depending on the texture you prefer. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Shred it**: Shredding the Oaxaca cheese will help it melt more evenly and distribute its creamy flavor throughout the burrito. You can use a box grater or a food processor to shred the cheese.\n2. **Crumble it**: Crumbling the Oaxaca cheese will give you a more rustic texture and a slightly more distinct flavor. Simply break the cheese into small pieces and sprinkle them throughout the burrito.\n3. **Slice it**: If you want to add a bit of texture and visual appeal to your burrito, you can slice the Oaxaca cheese into thin strips or medallions. This works well if you're using a larger burrito tortilla.\n\nRegardless of which method you choose, be sure to add the Oaxaca cheese towards the end of the burrito-building process. This will help it melt slightly and bind the flavors together.\n\nHere's a rough guide to follow:\n\n1. Add the scrambled eggs, roasted sweet potatoes, and saut\u00e9ed spinach and garlic to the tortilla.\n2. Sprinkle the shredded or crumbled Oaxaca cheese over the top of the filling.\n3. Add any additional toppings, such as salsa, sour cream, or cilantro.\n4. Fold the bottom edge of the tortilla up over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll the burrito up tightly.\n\nIf you're slicing the Oaxaca cheese, you can add it on top of the filling before adding any additional toppings.\n\nRemember, the key is to balance the flavors and textures. With the creamy Oaxaca cheese, sweet roasted sweet potatoes, and savory eggs and spinach, you'll have a delicious and satisfying breakfast burrito!"

      "content": "Shredding the Oaxaca cheese will definitely help distribute its creamy flavor throughout the burrito. \n\nWhen it comes to salsa for a breakfast burrito, you've got a lot of options. Pico de gallo is a great choice, but you might want to consider a few other options to complement the flavors in your burrito. Here are some salsa suggestions:\n\n1. **Mild Salsa Roja**: A classic, smooth salsa made with tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00f1os, and cilantro. It's a great all-purpose salsa that won't overpower the other flavors in your burrito.\n2. **Salsa Verde**: A tangy, herby salsa made with tomatillos, onions, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os. It's a great match for the sweetness of the roasted sweet potatoes and the creaminess of the Oaxaca cheese.\n3. **Avocado Salsa**: A creamy, mild salsa made with ripe avocados, red onions, lime juice, and cilantro. It's a great choice if you want to add more healthy fats and creaminess to your burrito.\n4. **Chipotle Salsa**: A smoky, spicy salsa made with chipotle peppers, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro. It's a great option if you want to add a bold, spicy kick to your burrito.\n5. **Hatch Green Chile Salsa**: A mild to medium-hot salsa made with roasted Hatch green chiles, tomatoes, onions, and garlic. It's a great choice if you want to add a Southwestern twist to your burrito.\n\nAll of these salsa options will complement the flavors in your breakfast burrito. If you want to stick with something familiar, pico de gallo is always a great choice. But if you're feeling adventurous, try one of the other options to add a new dimension to your burrito.\n\nRemember, you can always adjust the level of heat in your salsa by using more or less jalape\u00f1os or other hot peppers. And if you're feeling extra fancy, you can make your own salsa from scratch using fresh ingredients!"
