      "content": "Children can start learning about money management and basic financial concepts as early as three years old. At this age, they can start to understand the concept of money and its uses, such as buying things they want, and saving money for later.\n\nAs children get older, they can learn more advanced financial concepts, such as budgeting, saving, and investing. Parents can start to introduce these concepts to their children around the age of six or seven, depending on their individual development.\n\nIt's important for parents to teach their children about finances early on, as it can help them develop good money habits and a healthy relationship with money. This can also set them up for financial success in the future."

      "content": "Sure, here are some examples of things a parent can do for a child per year from ages 0-3 to set them up for wealth and good money management, while building their own finances from scratch:\n\nAge 0:\n\n* Open a savings account for your child and make regular deposits. This can help teach your child the importance of saving and help you build a nest egg for their future.\n\nAge 1:\n\n* Teach your child the value of sharing and giving by starting a \"giving jar\" where you and your child can contribute spare change and donate it to a charity of your choice.\n\nAge 2:\n\n* Introduce your child to the concept of delayed gratification by setting small savings goals for them, such as saving for a toy they want. This can help teach them the value of saving for what they want rather than buying impulsively.\n\nAge 3:\n\n* Give your child a piggy bank or clear jar where they can see their money grow. This can help them learn about the different denominations of money and give them a sense of ownership over their savings.\n\nIn terms of building your own finances from scratch, you can start by creating a budget and tracking your expenses to get a better understanding of your financial situation. Look for ways to reduce expenses and increase your income, such as by picking up a side hustle or negotiating a raise at work. Consider investing in a retirement account or other investment vehicles to help grow your wealth over time."
