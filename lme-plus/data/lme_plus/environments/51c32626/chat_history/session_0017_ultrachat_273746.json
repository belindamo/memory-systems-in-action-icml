However, England won the match by the virtue of scoring more boundaries than New Zealand in the entire match. It was their first-ever World Cup win and they became the third country, after West Indies and India, to win the World Cup at home."

      "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but England has a strong and well-rounded team, so they certainly have the potential to do well in the next World Cup as well. However, cricket is a game of uncertainties, and it's difficult to predict anything with certainty. Various factors, such as injury, form, and opposition, can impact a team's performance in a tournament. So, we will have to wait and see how things shape up for England in the next World Cup."
