I'm a text-based AI assistant, and our conversation just started, so I don't have any knowledge about your past purchases.\n\nBut I can help you make a list of your devices if you'd like! You can tell me about the devices you've purchased in the past few months, and I can help you organize them into a list. Just let me know the devices you remember buying, and I'll help you add them to the list.\n\nIf you need help remembering, you can try checking your:\n\n1. Email inbox for receipts or order confirmations\n2. Credit card statements or bank accounts for purchase records\n3. Online marketplaces like Amazon or Best Buy for your order history\n4. Physical receipts or packaging from the devices\n\nLet me know when you're ready to start making your list, and I'll be happy to assist you!"
