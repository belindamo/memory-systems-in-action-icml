Original design and construction (1958): The stadium, initially called the National Stadium, was designed by architect Kenzo Tange and constructed to host the 1964 Summer Olympics.\n\n2. First expansion (1964): In preparation for the Olympics, the stadium underwent its first major expansion, increasing its capacity from 48,000 to 71,000 seats.\n\n3. Renamed and redesignated (1984): In 1984, the stadium was renamed the Tokyo National Stadium and redesignated as a national symbol sports facility.\n\n4. Second expansion (1990): The stadium underwent another major renovation between 1986 and 1990, expanding its capacity to more than 70,000 seats and adding a retractable roof.\n\n5. Demolition and reconstruction (2015-2019): In 2015, the stadium was demolished to make way for a new, modern facility designed by architect Kengo Kuma. The new stadium retains the original bowl-shaped design and can accommodate up to 68,000 spectators.\n\nOverall, the Tokyo National Stadium has evolved to meet the changing needs and demands of modern sports and entertainment events, while retaining its status as a symbol of Japanese architecture and design."
