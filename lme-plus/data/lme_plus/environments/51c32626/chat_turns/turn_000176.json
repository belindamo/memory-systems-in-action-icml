  "content": "The greenhouse effect and global warming are two related but distinct phenomena related to climate change.\n\nThe greenhouse effect is a naturally occurring process where greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and regulate the planet's temperature. This effect is essential for maintaining a stable climate and is responsible for the Earth's ability to support life.\n\nHowever, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to an enhancement of the greenhouse effect. This enhancement is known as global warming.\n\nGlobal warming refers to the long-term rise in the average surface temperature of the Earth due to human activities and the resulting increase in greenhouse gas emissions. This rise in temperature has significant impacts on the planet, including rising sea levels, more frequent and intense heat waves, changes in precipitation patterns, and the loss of biodiversity.\n\nIn conclusion, the greenhouse effect is a naturally occurring process that is vital for life on Earth, while global warming is the result of human activities that are enhancing the greenhouse effect and leading to negative impacts on the environment and society.",
