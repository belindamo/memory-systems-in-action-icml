  "content": "The amount of text that fits on a single page of a book can vary depending on a number of factors, including the size of the book, the font size and type, and the margins. In general, a standard page of a novel contains around 250-300 words, but this can vary depending on the specific requirements of the book. For example, a book with a larger font size or wider margins may have fewer words per page, while a book with a smaller font size or narrower margins may have more words per page.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the concept of a \"page\" can be different in an electronic book (e-book) than in a physical book. In an e-book, the number of words per page may vary based on the device on which the book is being read and the settings chosen by the reader.\n\nI hope this helps to give you a sense of the general guidelines for the number of words per page in a book. Remember that these are just rough estimates and that the most important thing is to present your text in a way that is clear, coherent, and easy to read for the reader.",
