Today, Making Strides has grown into a national event, with over 1 million participants in more than 200 locations across the United States.\n\n**The Event:**\nMaking Strides Against Breast Cancer is a 5K walk/run event that takes place in July and August, with some locations hosting events in October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

Thanks to events like Making Strides, the ACS has contributed to a 39% decline in breast cancer deaths in the US since 1990.\n\n**Getting Involved:**\nIf you're interested in participating in a Making Strides Against Breast Cancer event, you can:\n\n1. **Register:** Find an event near you and register online.\n2. **Form a Team:** Gather friends, family, or colleagues to form a team and raise funds together.\n3. **Fundraise:** Set a fundraising goal and spread the word about your participation to raise funds.\n4. **Volunteer:** Help with event logistics, registration, or other tasks to support the event.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the \"Walk for Hunger\" 5K walk in February!
