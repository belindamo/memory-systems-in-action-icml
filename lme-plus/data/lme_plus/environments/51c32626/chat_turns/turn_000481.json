Adding new throw pillows that match your new area rug can definitely help tie the room together. It's a great way to add a pop of color and texture to the space. Plus, it'll create a cohesive look and make the room feel more put together.\n\nWhen choosing the throw pillows, consider the following:\n\n* Match the color scheme: Select pillows that complement the colors in your area rug, walls, and furniture. You can choose a dominant color or a secondary color to add some contrast.\n* Mix and match textures: Combine different textures like velvet, linen, or cotton to add depth and interest to the space.\n* Consider the pattern: If your area rug has a bold pattern, you might want to opt for solid-colored pillows or a subtle pattern to avoid overwhelming the space.\n* Don't forget about comfort: Choose pillows that are comfortable and inviting, so you and your sister can snuggle up and enjoy your next TV marathon!\n\nRemember, it's all about creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere that makes you feel happy and relaxed. Have fun shopping for those throw pillows, and I hope they turn out great!",
