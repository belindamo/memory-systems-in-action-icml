  "content": "Based on the rule of thumb I mentioned earlier, you'll want to allocate around 10-15 square feet per guest. For 10-12 guests, that would be:\n\n10 guests x 12.5 sq ft/guest (avg. of 10-15 sq ft) = 125 sq ft\n12 guests x 12.5 sq ft/guest = 150 sq ft\n\nAs you can see, you'll need a total of around 125-150 square feet of space for your guests to move around comfortably.\n\nYour raised bed is 32 square feet, which is a nice focal point for your garden party, but you'll want to ensure you have additional space around it for your guests. You might consider setting up tables, chairs, and other furniture in a way that creates a flow and allows guests to move around comfortably.\n\nYou might want to consider the following:\n\n* Leave a 3-4 foot path around the raised bed to allow guests to walk by and admire your plants.\n* Set up tables and chairs in a way that creates a flow and doesn't block the path.\n* Consider setting up a few smaller gathering areas or \"stations\" to encourage mingling and conversation.\n* Don't forget to leave some open space for guests to stand and socialize.\n\nBy planning your layout thoughtfully, you can create a beautiful and functional space for your garden party.\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any other questions or concerns about planning your party?",
