I've got a couch (about 8 feet long), an armchair, a coffee table (I got it from IKEA for $50 on sale, and it's really nice), a TV stand, and a bookshelf. There's one window on one of the longer walls, and the door is on one of the shorter walls. I'd like to have a nice flow between the furniture, and I've been thinking of maybe painting the walls a lighter color to brighten up the space.",
