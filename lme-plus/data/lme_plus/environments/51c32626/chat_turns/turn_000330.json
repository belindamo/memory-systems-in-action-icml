Here's a step-by-step guide to make cashew sour cream:\n\n**Cashew Sour Cream Recipe (Instant Pot Yogurt Function)**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 cup of cashews\n* 1/2 cup of water\n* 1 tablespoon of lemon juice\n* 1/2 teaspoon of salt\n* Optional: probiotic powder (see notes)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Soak the cashews:** Rinse the cashews and soak them in water for at least 4 hours or overnight. This will help to soften them and make them blendable.\n2. **Drain and rinse:** Drain the soaked cashews and rinse them with fresh water.\n3. **Add to Instant Pot:** Place the drained cashews, water, lemon juice, and salt in the Instant Pot.\n4. **Yogurt function:** Close the lid and make sure the valve is set to \"Sealing\". Press the \"Yogurt\" button and select \"Normal\" mode. Set the time to 8-10 hours. Yes, you read that right - 8-10 hours! This will allow the cashews to ferment and create a creamy, tangy sour cream.\n5. **Wait and chill:** Let the Instant Pot do its magic. After the yogurt cycle is complete, remove the pot from the base and let it cool to room temperature. Then, refrigerate it for at least 4 hours or overnight to chill and thicken.\n6. **Blend and strain:** Once chilled, blend the cashew mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth and creamy. Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or a nut milk bag to remove any remaining cashew pulp. Squeeze the cheesecloth or bag to extract as much cream as possible. Discard the pulp.\n7. **Use or store:** Your cashew sour cream is now ready to use in recipes or as a dip. You can store it in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\n**Optional: Adding Probiotics**\n\nIf you want to create a probiotic-rich sour cream, you can add a probiotic powder (containing 1-2 billion CFU) to the cashew mixture before fermenting. This will help to support gut health and create a more tangy, fermented flavor.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* For a thicker sour cream, add more cashews or reduce the water amount.\n* Experiment with different flavorings like garlic, onion powder, or dried herbs to create unique flavor profiles.\n* Use this cashew sour cream as a substitute in recipes that call for traditional sour cream or yogurt.\n* You can also use this method to make cashew-based yogurt, cheese, or butter by adjusting the fermentation time and ingredients.\n\nNow that you have the cashew sour cream recipe, you can create the Southwestern Quinoa Bowl by combining it with roasted vegetables, quinoa, black beans, diced tomatoes, avocado, and any other toppings you like!",
