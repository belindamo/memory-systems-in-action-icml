  "content": "1. Has the fund put in place internal policies or guidelines regarding ESG/SDG integration? If yes, provide details.\n\nYes, the ART has put in place internal policies and guidelines regarding ESG/SDG integration. The fund's Responsible Investment Policy provides a framework for integrating ESG considerations into its investment decision-making processes. The policy outlines the ART's approach to sustainable investing, including its commitment to the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).\n\nThe Responsible Investment Policy also sets out the ART's expectations for its investment managers and advisors with respect to ESG considerations. The fund requires its investment managers and advisors to have their own ESG policies and practices, which must be consistent with the ART's Responsible Investment Policy.\n\nIn addition to the Responsible Investment Policy, the ART has established a number of other internal policies and guidelines to support ESG integration. These include guidelines on ESG integration in the selection and monitoring of external managers, guidelines on proxy voting and engagement with companies on ESG issues, and guidelines on the management of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n1. Is any international ESG/SDG-related standard, taxonomy, or benchmark employed in the investment decision-making process? If so, which ones?\n\nYes, the ART employs international ESG/SDG-related standards, taxonomies, and benchmarks in its investment decision-making process. The fund uses the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) as a framework for its sustainable investing approach. The PRI provides a set of principles for incorporating ESG considerations into investment decision-making processes.\n\nThe ART also uses various ESG-related standards, taxonomies, and benchmarks to guide its investment decisions. For example, the fund uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards to assess the sustainability performance of companies in its investment portfolio. The GRI standards provide a framework for companies to report on their sustainability performance across a range of ESG factors.\n\nIn addition, the ART uses the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework for identifying investment opportunities that contribute to sustainable development. The fund considers the SDGs when assessing the impact of its investments and when engaging with companies on ESG issues.\n\n1. Does the fund provide clarity on efforts it has made to meet relevant national/regional/international ESG-related regulations? Which ones?\n\nYes, the ART provides clarity on its efforts to meet relevant national/regional/international ESG-related regulations. The fund's Responsible Investment Policy outlines the ART's commitment to complying with all relevant laws and regulations related to ESG factors.\n\nThe ART also discloses its compliance with relevant ESG-related regulations in its annual report and other public disclosures. For example, the fund's 2021-2022 Sustainable Investment Report discloses its compliance with the Australian Government's Modern Slavery Act 2018 and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.\n\nIn addition, the ART engages with regulatory bodies and industry associations on ESG-related issues to promote the adoption of sustainable investing practices. The fund is a member of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), which promotes ESG integration in the Australian superannuation industry, and the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), which advocates for climate action by investors.",
