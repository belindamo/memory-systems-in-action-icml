  "content": "Got it! I'll keep that in mind while suggesting some On1 Salsa studios in the city center.\n\nIt's great that you're open to trying out different styles, but it's also good that you have a foundation in On1 to build upon. Breaking down moves into smaller parts is a great teaching technique, and I'll look for instructors who use a similar approach.\n\nHere are a few studios in the city center that offer On1 Salsa classes:\n\n1. **Salsa Fusion Studio**: Located in the heart of downtown, Salsa Fusion offers On1 classes for all levels. Their instructors are known for their clear teaching style and focus on technique.\n2. **Rhythm & Motion**: This studio is just a block away from the city center and offers On1 classes, as well as other styles like Bachata and Kizomba. They have a variety of instructors, so you can try out different teaching styles.\n3. **Salsa Academy**: With two locations in the city center, Salsa Academy offers On1 classes for beginners and advanced dancers. They also have a strong focus on musicality and expression.\n4. **DanceSpace**: This studio is a bit smaller, but they offer a range of Salsa classes, including On1. Their instructors are known for their patience and attention to detail.\n\nWould you like me to provide more information about these studios, such as their schedules, prices, and reviews? Or would you like me to suggest a few more options?",
