  "content": "That's a great idea! Asking about Ethan's birth weight and length is a thoughtful gesture, and I'm sure your sister-in-law will be happy to share those details with you. And, of course, holding him is a wonderful way to bond with your new nephew! Just remember to follow the tips I shared earlier about holding a newborn safely.\n\nDon't hesitate to ask your sister-in-law any questions you have about Ethan or his care. She'll appreciate your interest and enthusiasm, and it's a great way to show your support and love for her and her baby.\n\nEnjoy your visit and cherish the time you spend with your sister-in-law, her baby, and the rest of your family!",
