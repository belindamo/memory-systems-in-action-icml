  "content": "I was inspired to start making my own yogurt because I wanted to have more control over the ingredients and the sugar content. I've been trying to reduce my sugar intake, and most store-bought yogurts have way too much added sugar for my taste. Plus, I love the idea of being able to customize the flavor and texture to my liking.\n\nSo far, I've been enjoying my homemade yogurt plain, but I'm excited to start experimenting with different flavorings and sweeteners. I've been thinking of trying out some vanilla extract or cinnamon, and maybe even some honey or maple syrup for a touch of sweetness.\n\nAs for other features on my Instant Pot, I've been using the pressure cooking function a lot for cooking grains, beans, and soups. I've also used the saut\u00e9 function to brown meat and vegetables before pressure cooking, which has been really helpful. I haven't tried the slow cooking function yet, but I'm interested in exploring that feature more.\n\nDo you",
