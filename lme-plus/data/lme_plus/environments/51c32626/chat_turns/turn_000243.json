A memory box with your dad's tools will be a beautiful way to honor his legacy and add a personal touch to your garage.\n\nNow, let's talk about organizing your new coffee table! Congratulations on the new addition to your living room! IKEA is great for providing functional and affordable furniture, but it can be a challenge to keep it organized. Here are some tips to help you keep your coffee table tidy and functional:\n\n**1. Purge and declutter**: Start by removing everything from the table and sorting items into categories (e.g., remotes, magazines, books, decorations). Be ruthless \u2013 if you don't need it, consider donating or recycling it.\n\n**2. Designate zones**: Divide the table into zones or areas for specific activities, such as:\n\t* A \"launching pad\" for keys, wallets, and other personal items\n\t* A \"reading nook\" for books, magazines, and newspapers\n\t* A \"snack station\" for coffee cups, snacks, and coasters\n\t* A \"decorative zone\" for vases, candles, or other decorative items\n\n**3. Use storage containers**: Use small storage bins, baskets, or trays to corral small items like remotes, batteries, or coasters. Label each container so you can easily find what you need.\n\n**4. Invest in a tray or placemat**: A tray or placemat can help contain spills and messes, making cleanup easier. Plus, it adds a decorative touch to your table.\n\n**5. Keep it minimal**: Resist the urge to overcrowd your coffee table. Leave some empty space to create a sense of breathing room and visual calm.\n\n**6. Create a \"landing strip\"**: Designate a specific area of the table as a \"landing strip\" for items that need to be dealt with, such as mail, bills, or receipts.\n\n**7. Make it a habit**: Set aside time each week to tidy up your coffee table and maintain your organizational system.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your new coffee table while keeping it organized and functional.\n\nRemember, organization is a process, and it might take some time to figure out what works best for you. Be patient, and don't hesitate to experiment until you find a system that suits your lifestyle and preferences.",
