I'll take out everything and sort items into three piles: keep, donate/sell, and discard. I'll be ruthless about getting rid of items that don't fit, are worn out, or don't make me feel confident and comfortable.\n\nI've also been thinking about creating a spreadsheet to track my wardrobe and keep an inventory of the items I have. This way, I can see what I have, what I'm missing, and what I can mix and match to create different outfits. Do you think that's a good idea?",
