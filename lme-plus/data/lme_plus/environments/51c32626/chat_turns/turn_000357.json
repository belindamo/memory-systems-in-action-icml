  "content": "I did find the game's storyline to be very impactful, especially the way it explores the characters' emotions and relationships. The game's themes of loss, grief, and revenge really resonated with me. There were several moments that stood out to me, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't played it.\n\nAs for the difficulty, I found the game to be challenging, but not frustratingly so. The combat and stealth sections were tough, but they were also very rewarding when I finally managed to overcome them. I did get stuck on a particular level for a few days, but it was more due to my own mistakes than the game's difficulty. Overall, I think the game struck a great balance between challenge and reward.\n\nBy the way, have you heard about the new Cyberpunk 2077 game? I've been waiting for it for months, and I'm really hyped about its cyberpunk setting and RPG elements.",
