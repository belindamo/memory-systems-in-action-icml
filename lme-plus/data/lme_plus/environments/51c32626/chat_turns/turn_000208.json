You can enter the park's address or a nearby landmark in the trip planner or bus route finder tool, and it should give you a list of bus routes that stop near the park.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check the website for other useful information such as:\n\n* Bus schedules and frequencies\n* Route maps and directions\n* Fares and payment options\n* Service alerts and updates\n\nRemember to bookmark the website or save it to your favorites for future reference. You can also consider downloading the transit agency's mobile app, if available, for easy access to transit information on-the-go.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
