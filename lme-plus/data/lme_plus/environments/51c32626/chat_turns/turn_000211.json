  "content": "8. \"Noumena\" - In Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" noumena is a concept that refers to the thing-in-itself, or the true reality that exists independent of our perception of it. He argues that noumena is unknowable and that all we can know is the way in which we perceive the world through our senses, which is known as the \"phenomena.\"\n9. \"A priori\" - In Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" the concept of a priori refers to knowledge that is independent of experience. He argues that there are certain concepts and principles that are known independently of experience, such as mathematical and logical principles, which are known a priori.\n10. \"A posteriori\" - In Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" the concept of a posteriori refers to knowledge that is dependent on experience. He argues that there are certain concepts and principles that are known only through experience, such as empirical knowledge, which is known a posteriori.\n11. \"Synthetic judgments\" - In Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" synthetic judgments refers to judgments that go beyond the concepts contained within them, and introduce new information. He argues that synthetic judgments are not known a priori, but are known through experience and are necessary for knowledge of the world.\n12. \"Analytic judgments\" - In Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" analytic judgments refers to judgments that are true by virtue of the concepts contained within them, and do not introduce new information. He argues that analytic judgments are known a priori, and are necessary for logical reasoning and consistency of knowledge.",
