If you're not, consider leveling up by completing other quests, killing monsters, and exploring the surrounding area.\n2. **Gear up**: Ensure you have decent gear, including a good sword, armor, and potions. You can craft or purchase potions that provide bonuses to damage, defense, or regeneration.\n3. **Choose the right signs**: Select signs that complement your playstyle. For this quest, consider using Quen (shield) to absorb damage, Igni (fire) to damage the witches, or Yrden (trap) to immobilize them.\n\n**Tactics for defeating the witches**\n\n1. **Use your surroundings**: The swampy environment can be your ally. Lure the witches into the water or near explosive barrels to gain an advantage.\n2. **Take them one by one**: Focus on one witch at a time. Use your signs and abilities to isolate and defeat each one before moving on to the next.\n3. **Dodge and roll**: The witches have powerful attacks, so make sure to dodge and roll frequently to avoid taking unnecessary damage.\n4. **Use your potions wisely**: Conserve your potions for when you need them most. Use them to heal, buff, or debuff the witches as needed.\n5. **Parry and counterattack**: Learn the witches' attack patterns and parry their blows. Counterattack when they're stunned or vulnerable.\n\n**Additional tips**\n\n1. **Save often**: Save your progress frequently, especially before engaging the witches. You never know when you might need to reload.\n2. **Explore the area**: Before facing the witches, explore the surrounding swamp to gather resources, find hidden items, and get familiar with the terrain.\n3. **Consider a different approach**: If you're still struggling, try a different approach. For example, you can try to sneak past the witches or use your signs to create a diversion.\n\nWith these tips, you should be able to overcome the witches and complete \"The Whispering Hillock\" side quest.
