For this dataset, I haven't tried any preprocessing techniques yet, but I'm open to exploring different methods. As for feature extraction, I was thinking of using TF-IDF, since it's worked well for me in the past. The class balance in my dataset is relatively even, with around 55% positive reviews and 45% negative reviews. In terms of evaluation metrics, I'm mostly interested in accuracy and F1-score.",
