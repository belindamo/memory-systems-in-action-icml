  "content": "I'd like to explore more on how cultural norms and expectations influence our beliefs about relationships and commitment. I've been having some intense conversations with my partner about our beliefs on relationships and commitment, and I'm realizing that my beliefs have been shaped by societal expectations and cultural norms, rather than my own values and desires. Can you help me find some information on how to separate my own values and desires from societal expectations in relationships?",
