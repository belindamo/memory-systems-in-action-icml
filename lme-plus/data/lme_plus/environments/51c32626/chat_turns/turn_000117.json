You mentioned earlier that Ethan is 3 weeks old, so if your sister-in-law was having contractions at your family gathering a few weekends ago, that would mean Ethan was likely born around that time. Congratulations to your sister-in-law and her family on the new addition!\n\nIt's wonderful that you're excited to visit and spend time with them. I'm sure Ethan will bring so much joy to your family gatherings from now on!",
