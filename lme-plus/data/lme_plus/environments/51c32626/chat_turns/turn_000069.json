I'd be happy to help you with some eyeshadow storage ideas.\n\nHere are some popular and practical options to consider:\n\n1. **Eyeshadow Palette Holders**: These are designed to hold multiple palettes and can be found in various sizes. Some popular brands include Z-Palette, Makeup Geek, and Sephora Collection.\n2. **Stackable Containers**: Use small, stackable containers or drawers to store individual eyeshadows or smaller palettes. You can find these at craft stores, like Michaels or Hobby Lobby, or online at Amazon.\n3. **Magnetic Boards**: Adhesive magnetic strips can be attached to a board or a metal surface, allowing you to store individual eyeshadows or palettes with magnetic backing.\n4. **Drawer Dividers**: Use drawer dividers or inserts to separate your eyeshadows within a larger storage container or drawer. This keeps them organized and prevents them from getting jumbled.\n5. **Travel Cases**: If you have a lot of single eyeshadows or smaller palettes, consider storing them in a travel case or pouch. This keeps them protected and easy to transport.\n6. **DIY Storage**: Think outside the box (or palette)! Use an old CD case, a wooden or plastic craft box, or even a small tackle box to store your eyeshadows. Get creative and customize it to fit your style!\n7. **Adjustable Trays**: Look for adjustable trays or inserts that can be customized to fit your eyeshadow collection. These can be found at beauty supply stores or online.\n\nBefore choosing a storage solution, consider the following factors:\n\n* Space: How much space do you have available for storage?\n* Size: What's the size of your eyeshadow collection?\n* Accessibility: Do you want easy access to your most-used shades?\n* Protection: Do you need to protect your eyeshadows from dust, moisture, or breakage?\n\nI hope these ideas help you find the perfect storage solution for your eyeshadow collection!\n\n(P.S. Yay for using that $20 gift card to make your new palette purchase more affordable!)",
