      "content": "Great taste! Gillian Flynn is a master of crafting dark, twisted, and unsettling stories that keep readers on the edge of their seats. If you're looking for more psychological thrillers with a similar vibe, here are some book recommendations that you might enjoy:\n\n1. **The Silent Wife** by A.S.A. Harrison: A marriage turns toxic in this psychological thriller, where a wife's secrets and lies lead to a deadly outcome.\n2. **The Girl on the Train** by Paula Hawkins: A commuter becomes obsessed with a perfect couple, only to discover that their lives are not as they seem. This one has a similar atmosphere of suspense and twists to \"Gone Girl\".\n3. **The Couple Next Door** by Shari Lapena: A baby goes missing, and a couple's seemingly perfect life unravels, revealing dark secrets and lies.\n4. **The Woman in the Window** by A.J. Finn: A recluse witnesses a crime while spying on her neighbors, but no one believes her. This one has a similar sense of unease and unreliability.\n5. **The Last Mrs. Parrish** by Liv Constantine: A woman will stop at nothing to claim the life she feels she deserves, even if it means destroying others.\n6. **The Poison Tree** by Erin Kelly: A family's dark past is revealed when a woman returns to her childhood home, and secrets and lies begin to surface.\n7. **The Devil Crept In** by Ania Ahlborn: A young boy goes missing in a small town, and the truth behind his disappearance is more sinister than anyone imagined.\n8. **The Other Mrs. Miller** by Allison Dickson: A woman discovers her husband is leading a double life, and she'll do whatever it takes to uncover the truth.\n9. **The Wife Between Us** by Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen: A twisted marriage, secrets, and lies lead to a shocking conclusion in this domestic thriller.\n10. **The Last Time I Lied** by Riley Sager: A woman returns to the summer camp where her friends disappeared 15 years earlier, only to find herself in the middle of a new mystery.\n\nThese books share some of the same themes and elements that made \"Gone Girl\" so compelling, such as complex characters, dark secrets, and unexpected twists. I hope you find your next psychological thriller obsession among these recommendations!\n\nWhat do you think? Would you like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., focus on female protagonists, small-town settings, etc.)?"

I've actually been reading a lot of books lately, and I just finished \"The Hating Game\" by Sally Thorne, which was a nice break from the dark thrillers I've been reading. But I'm always up for a good psychological thriller. Do you think any of these books would be available as audiobooks? I've been listening to audiobooks during my morning runs and it's been really convenient."

      "content": "Great to hear that you're an avid reader and audiobook listener!\n\nYes, many of the books I recommended are available as audiobooks.

The audiobook is narrated by two voices, which adds to the suspense.\n2. **The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle** by Stuart Turton - A unique, complex murder mystery that takes place at a British manor house. The audiobook is expertly narrated, making it easy to follow the multiple storylines.\n3. **The Stranger Diaries** by Elly Griffiths - A modern take on the Sherlock Holmes story, with a writer of horror stories becoming embroiled in a real-life murder mystery. The audiobook has a great narrator who brings the characters to life.\n\nThese audiobooks are all engaging, well-narrated, and will keep you on the edge of your seat during your morning runs!\n\nDo you have a preferred narrator or a specific accent you enjoy listening to?
