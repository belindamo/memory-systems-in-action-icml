Teachers can use the PGCPS Language Arts Curriculum Framework for grade 3, which aligns with the Maryland College and Career Ready Standards for English/Language Arts (Standard 2: Reading). According to the framework, students should be able to \"use text features to locate information, including headings, subheadings, bold type, and captions,\" and \"use knowledge of the author's purpose and text structure to locate information and gain meaning from text\" (pg. 10).\n\nModel how to use graphic organizers to represent the organization of complex texts. Teachers can use the PGCPS Language Arts Curriculum Framework for grade 3, which aligns with the Maryland College and Career Ready Standards for English/Language Arts (Standard 2: Reading). According to the framework, students should be able to \"organize and represent information using graphic organizers, such as webs, Venn diagrams, and charts\" (pg. 9). The use of graphic organizers can help students to visually represent the structure and organization of a text, which can in turn help them to better understand and remember the information presented in the text.\n\nStandards:\n\n* Maryland College and Career Ready Standards for English/Language Arts (Standard 2: Reading) - <https://mdk12.msde.maryland.gov/standards/ela>\n* PGCPS Language Arts Curriculum Framework for Grade 3 - <https://www.pgcps.org/cms/lib/MD01914076/Centricity/Domain/85/ELA%20Grade%203.pdf>"

Some possible tools include graphic organizers, such as Venn diagrams and story maps, which can help students identify main ideas, supporting details, and the relationships between them. Teachers can also use digital tools, such as interactive whiteboards and online text annotation tools, to engage students in close reading and encourage them to interact with the text.\n\nIn addition to providing explicit instruction on reading comprehension strategies and modeling how to use them, teachers can also encourage students to read widely and develop a love for reading. This can be done by providing access to a variety of high-interest texts, both fiction and nonfiction, and giving students time to read independently and discuss what they have read with their peers.\n\nBy providing targeted instruction, resources, and support, teachers can help their students develop strong reading comprehension skills that will serve them well throughout their academic career and beyond."

      "content": "Month 6-7: Encouraging Close Reading\n\nClose reading is an important skill for developing strong reading comprehension abilities. Teachers can provide opportunities for students to engage in close reading of complex texts and model how to annotate texts for deeper understanding and to make connections between ideas. Students can learn to look closely at text, consider multiple perspectives, and analyze the meaning of words and phrases within the text.\n\nStandards:\n\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.1: Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.4: Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.7: Explain how specific aspects of a text's illustrations contribute to what is conveyed by the words in a story (e.g., create mood, emphasize aspects of a character or setting).\n\nMonth 8-9: Applying Comprehension Strategies\n\nIn months 8-9, teachers can provide explicit instruction on how to apply comprehension strategies to support reading comprehension. They can provide opportunities for students to practice using comprehension strategies such as summarizing, questioning, predicting, and clarifying. Students can learn to identify the main idea of a text, recognize supporting details, and distinguish between important and unimportant information.\n\nStandards:\n\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.2: Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.3: Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.3.1: Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n\nOngoing: Assessment and Progress Monitoring\n\nFormative assessments can be used to monitor student progress and adjust instruction as needed. Teachers can provide opportunities for students to practice reading and comprehending texts across all subject areas. Students can be encouraged to use comprehension strategies in their independent reading and engage in discussions about texts in class.\n\nStandards:\n\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.3.3.A: Identify and know the meaning of the most common prefixes and derivational suffixes.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.3.2: Determine the main idea of a text; recount the key details and explain how they support the main idea.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.3.4: Determine the meaning of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases in a text relevant to a grade 3 topic or subject area.\n\nBy the end of the school year, students should have a solid foundation in reading comprehension skills and be able to comprehend more complex texts with greater ease. Continued reinforcement and practice of these skills throughout the student's academic career will lead to further development and mastery of this critical CCSS skill."

      "content": "Scoring 18% on the ELA MSA means that there is a significant gap between the 3rd-grade students' current level of proficiency and the mastery level required for the test. To bridge this gap and improve students' performance, a 3rd-grade teacher would need to take a number of steps, including:\n\n1. Analyze the test results: The teacher should thoroughly analyze the test results to identify specific areas of weakness and prioritize which skills need to be focused on for mastery.\n2. Provide targeted instruction: Based on the analysis of test results, the teacher should provide targeted instruction on the identified areas of weakness. For example, if the students struggled with reading comprehension, the teacher could provide explicit instruction on strategies for identifying main ideas, making inferences, and summarizing text.\n3. Increase student engagement: The teacher should work to increase student engagement by incorporating interactive, hands-on activities that focus on building students' critical thinking, reading, and writing skills.\n4. Use formative assessments: The teacher should use formative assessments to track students' progress and adjust instruction as needed.\n5. Provide extra support: For students who need additional support, the teacher could provide one-on-one or small-group instruction, or utilize intervention programs that target specific areas of weakness.\n6. Set high expectations: The teacher should set high expectations for all students and encourage a growth mindset, emphasizing that with hard work and practice, they can improve their skills and achieve success.\n7. Communicate with parents: The teacher should communicate regularly with parents to update them on their child's progress and provide recommendations for how they can support their child's learning at home.\n\nBy taking these steps and implementing a comprehensive plan, a 3rd-grade teacher could work towards improving their students' performance on the ELA MSA and helping them reach mastery of the required skills."
