      "content": "The Jagannath Temple in Puri is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Jagannath (a form of Lord Krishna), his sister Subhadra and his older brother Balabhadra. The temple is considered one of the holiest shrines in India and is a major pilgrimage destination for Hindus.\n\nThe annual Rath Yatra festival, also known as the Chariot Festival, is one of the biggest festivals in India and is celebrated in Puri. During the festival, the deities of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra are taken out of the temple and placed on three huge chariots, which are pulled by thousands of devotees through the streets of Puri. The chariots are made of wood and are decorated with bright colors and flowers.\n\nThe significance of the Rath Yatra festival is that it is believed to be the day when the deities of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra visit their aunt's temple, the Gundicha Temple, which is about 3 km away from the Jagannath Temple. The festival is also a symbol of unity and equality, as people from all castes and creeds come together to participate in the procession.\n\nOverall, the Jagannath Temple and the annual Rath Yatra festival have great religious and cultural significance for Hindus and is a major event in Indian culture."

      "content": "Yes, witnessing the Rath Yatra festival at the Jagannath Temple is considered a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many people. If you are planning to visit the temple during the festival, there are several rituals and customs that you should be aware of:\n\n1. Snana Yatra - Before the Rath Yatra festival, the deities are taken out of the temple and bathed with 108 pots of water in a ritual called the Snana Yatra. The bathing ceremony is performed with great grandeur and is considered to be a purification ritual for the deities.\n\n2. Bahuda Yatra - On the ninth day of the Rath Yatra festival, the deities are brought back to the Jagannath Temple in a procession called Bahuda Yatra. It is considered an equally grand procession as the Rath Yatra and devotees often gather in large numbers to witness it.\n\n3. Niladri Bije - On the last day of the festival, the deities are taken inside the Jagannath temple in a ritual called Niladri Bije. The deities are dressed in new attire and are placed on the Ratna Simhasana, the throne of jewels. Legend has it that the Lord is angry with his Sudarsana Chakra and will not allow anyone to touch him until he is pacified by his brother Balabhadra.\n\n4. Chhera Pahara - Chhera Pahara is another important ritual of the Rath Yatra festival where the Gajapati King, who is considered the chief servitor of Lord Jagannath, sweeps the road in front of the chariots with a broom made of gold.\n\nThese are some of the significant rituals and customs that are associated with the Rath Yatra festival at the Jagannath Temple in Puri."
