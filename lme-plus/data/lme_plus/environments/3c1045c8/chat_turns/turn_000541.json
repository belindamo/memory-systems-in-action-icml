  "content": "Yes, witnessing the Rath Yatra festival at the Jagannath Temple is considered a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many people. If you are planning to visit the temple during the festival, there are several rituals and customs that you should be aware of:\n\n1. Snana Yatra - Before the Rath Yatra festival, the deities are taken out of the temple and bathed with 108 pots of water in a ritual called the Snana Yatra. The bathing ceremony is performed with great grandeur and is considered to be a purification ritual for the deities.\n\n2. Bahuda Yatra - On the ninth day of the Rath Yatra festival, the deities are brought back to the Jagannath Temple in a procession called Bahuda Yatra. It is considered an equally grand procession as the Rath Yatra and devotees often gather in large numbers to witness it.\n\n3. Niladri Bije - On the last day of the festival, the deities are taken inside the Jagannath temple in a ritual called Niladri Bije. The deities are dressed in new attire and are placed on the Ratna Simhasana, the throne of jewels. Legend has it that the Lord is angry with his Sudarsana Chakra and will not allow anyone to touch him until he is pacified by his brother Balabhadra.\n\n4. Chhera Pahara - Chhera Pahara is another important ritual of the Rath Yatra festival where the Gajapati King, who is considered the chief servitor of Lord Jagannath, sweeps the road in front of the chariots with a broom made of gold.\n\nThese are some of the significant rituals and customs that are associated with the Rath Yatra festival at the Jagannath Temple in Puri.",
