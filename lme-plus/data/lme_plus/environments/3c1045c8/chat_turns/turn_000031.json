Investing in renewable energy: As mentioned earlier, Turkmenistan is investing in renewable energy projects, including solar, wind and hydropower, to diversify its energy mix and reduce its reliance on natural gas.\n\n2. Improving energy efficiency: The government has implemented programs aimed at improving energy efficiency in buildings, industries, and transportation.\n\n3. Developing nuclear power: Turkmenistan is exploring the possibility of developing nuclear power as an alternative to natural gas.\n\n4. Promoting energy-saving technologies: The government is promoting the use of energy-saving technologies, such as efficient lighting and appliances, to reduce energy consumption.\n\n5. Offering incentives for energy efficiency: The government is offering incentives to businesses and households that invest in energy-efficient technologies, including tax breaks and subsidies.\n\nIt is worth noting that while Turkmenistan is making efforts to reduce its reliance on natural gas, this is a gradual process and the country is likely to remain a major natural gas producer and exporter for the foreseeable future.",
