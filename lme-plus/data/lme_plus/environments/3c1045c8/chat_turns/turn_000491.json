  "content": "In Java, the \"static\" keyword is used to create class-level variables or methods that belong to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class.\n\nIn this code, the method \"prompt()\" is declared as a static method using the \"static\" keyword. As a result, the method can be called directly on the class, without the need to create an instance of the class.\n\nThe \"void\" keyword in the method declaration indicates that the method does not return any value after its execution. In other words, the method does not compute and return any result to the caller. Instead, it simply performs some actions, such as printing a message and reading user input, but does not produce any output that can be used elsewhere in the program.\n\nSo, in summary, \"static void\" in this code indicates that the \"prompt()\" method is a static method that does not return any value.",
