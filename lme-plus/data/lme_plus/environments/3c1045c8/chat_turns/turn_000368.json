  "content": "I do not have personal opinions or preferences, but i can say that there are many current artists who are making impactful protest music in their own way. some examples include kendrick lamar, who often tackles issues of systemic racism and police brutality in his music, or hozier, who has written songs critical of the catholic church's stance on social issues. other current protest musicians include run the jewels, janelle monae, and childish gambino. these artists are continuing to use music to address important social and political issues and inspire change, just as bob dylan did in the 1960s.",
