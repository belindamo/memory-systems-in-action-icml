  "content": "The code you provided defines a class named \"StudentGradeCalculator\" with a static method named \"prompt()\" that asks the user for their English marks and reads the input from the standard input stream.\n\nSince this class does not have any instance variables or a constructor, there is no need to create an instance of this class. Instead, we can simply call the \"prompt()\" method directly on the class using the dot notation:\n```scss\nStudentGradeCalculator.prompt();\n```\nThis statement calls the \"prompt()\" method of the \"StudentGradeCalculator\" class, which displays a message and reads the user input for English marks from the console. Note that we do not need to create an instance of the class because the \"prompt()\" method is declared as static, which means it belongs to the class itself and can be called directly on the class without the need for an object.",
