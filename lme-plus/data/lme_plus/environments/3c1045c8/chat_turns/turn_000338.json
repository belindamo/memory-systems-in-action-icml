  "content": "Using blockchain technology in real estate portals like Magicbricks can help ensure secure and transparent transactions between buyers, sellers, and realtors. One way to implement blockchain in a real estate portal is by using it as a decentralized ledger to store property ownership information, transaction history, and other relevant data.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use the Python programming language to implement blockchain in a real estate portal:\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport json\nfrom time import time\nfrom uuid import uuid4\n\nimport requests\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n\nclass Blockchain:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.chain = []\n        self.current_transactions = []\n        self.nodes = set()\n\n        # Create the genesis block\n        self.new_block(previous_hash=1, proof=100)\n\n    def new_block(self, proof, previous_hash=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Create a new Block in the Blockchain\n        :param proof: The proof given by the Proof of Work algorithm\n        :param previous_hash: Hash of previous Block\n        :return: New Block\n        \"\"\"\n        block = {\n            'index': len(self.chain) + 1,\n            'timestamp': time(),\n            'transactions': self.current_transactions,\n            'proof': proof,\n            'previous_hash': previous_hash or self.hash(self.chain[-1]),\n        }\n\n        # Reset the current list of transactions\n        self.current_transactions = []\n\n        self.chain.append(block)\n        return block\n\n    def new_transaction(self, buyer, seller, property_id, value):\n        \"\"\"\n        Creates a new transaction to go into the next mined Block\n        :param buyer: Address of the buyer\n        :param seller: Address of the seller\n        :param property_id: ID of the property being bought or sold\n        :param value: The value of the transaction\n        :return: The index of the Block that will hold this transaction\n        \"\"\"\n        self.current_transactions.append({\n            'buyer': buyer,\n            'seller': seller,\n            'property_id': property_id,\n            'value': value,\n        })\n\n        return self.last_block['index'] + 1\n\n    @property\n    def last_block(self):\n        return self.chain[-1]\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def hash(block):\n        \"\"\"\n        Creates a SHA-256 hash of a Block\n        :param block: Block\n        \"\"\"\n        block_string = json.dumps(block, sort_keys=True).encode()\n        return hashlib.sha256(block_string).hexdigest()\n\n    def proof_of_work(self, last_proof):\n        \"\"\"\n        Simple Proof of Work Algorithm:\n         - Find a number p' such that hash(pp') contains leading 4 zeroes, where p is the previous p'\n         - p is the previous proof, and p' is the new proof\n        :param last_proof:\n        \"\"\"\n        proof = 0\n        while self.valid_proof(last_proof, proof) is False:\n            proof += 1\n\n        return proof\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def valid_proof(last_proof, proof):\n        \"\"\"\n        Validates the Proof: Does hash(\n```",
