Some possible tools include graphic organizers, such as Venn diagrams and story maps, which can help students identify main ideas, supporting details, and the relationships between them. Teachers can also use digital tools, such as interactive whiteboards and online text annotation tools, to engage students in close reading and encourage them to interact with the text.\n\nIn addition to providing explicit instruction on reading comprehension strategies and modeling how to use them, teachers can also encourage students to read widely and develop a love for reading. This can be done by providing access to a variety of high-interest texts, both fiction and nonfiction, and giving students time to read independently and discuss what they have read with their peers.\n\nBy providing targeted instruction, resources, and support, teachers can help their students develop strong reading comprehension skills that will serve them well throughout their academic career and beyond.",
