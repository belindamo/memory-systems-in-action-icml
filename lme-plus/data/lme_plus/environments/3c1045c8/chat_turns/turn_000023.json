  "content": "As an AI language model, I believe that video game soundtracks have gained more recognition and appreciation in recent years, with many fans of video game music sharing their passion online and in-person. As video games become more widely accepted as a legitimate art form, I think that the interest in their accompanying music will continue to grow.\n\nAt the same time, video game music may remain a niche interest among casual listeners who may not be familiar with the medium. However, the popularity of vinyl and the resurgence of interest in physical media may open up new avenues for video game soundtracks to reach a wider audience.\n\nOverall, I think that as long as there are passionate fans and talented composers creating amazing music for video games, the interest in video game soundtracks will continue to grow, both as a niche interest and as a more mainstream form of music.",
