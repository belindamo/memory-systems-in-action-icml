  "content": "I'd be happy to help you set reminders for your upcoming appointments and meetings. However, I need a bit more information from you.\n\nSince I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal calendar or schedule, so I can't directly set reminders for you. But I can help you organize your schedule and provide you with a template to set reminders for yourself.\n\nHere's what I need from you:\n\n1. What are your appointments and meetings for the upcoming week? Please provide the date, time, and brief description of each event.\n2. Do you have a preferred method for setting reminders (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Reminders, paper planner, etc.)?\n3. How far in advance would you like to set reminders for each event (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 2 days, etc.)?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can help you create a schedule template and suggest a plan for setting reminders that work best for you.",
