The denim jacket, however, might be worth saving if you can remove the coffee stain.\n\nRemoving stains from clothes can be a challenge, but it's definitely possible. Here are some tips to help you remove the coffee stain from your denim jacket:\n\n1. **Act fast**: The sooner you treat the stain, the better. Coffee stains can set over time, making them more difficult to remove.\n2. **Blot, don't rub**: Gently blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to remove as much of the excess coffee as possible. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can push it deeper into the fabric.\n3. **Pre-treat with a stain remover**: Apply a stain remover like Shout or OxiClean directly to the stain. Follow the product's instructions and make sure to test a small, inconspicuous area of the jacket first.\n4. **Try a homemade solution**: If you don't have a stain remover, you can try making a paste with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Apply the paste to the stain and let it sit for about an hour. Then, rinse the jacket with cold water and wash it as usual.\n5. **Soak the jacket**: If the stain is still present after pre-treating, try soaking the jacket in cold water with a laundry detergent specifically designed for removing tough stains. Let it soak for several hours or overnight.\n6. ** Launder the jacket**: Wash the jacket in cold water using a mild laundry detergent. Check to see if the stain is still visible before putting it in the dryer. If the stain remains, you may need to repeat the pre-treatment and soaking process.\n7. **Consider professional cleaning**: If the stain is particularly stubborn, you may want to take the jacket to a professional cleaner who specializes in removing tough stains.\n\nRemember to always follow the care label instructions for your denim jacket, and test any cleaning solutions or products on an inconspicuous area first to ensure they won't damage the fabric.\n\nBy the way, it's great to hear that you've been enjoying your daily walks with your new sneakers!",
