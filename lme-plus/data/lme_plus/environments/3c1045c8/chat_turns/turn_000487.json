  "content": "Chapter 1: Introduction\n\nAutonomous and partially-autonomous systems are poised to revolutionize transportation and other industries on Earth, but they also have the potential to greatly benefit deep space missions. As missions move further away from Earth, communication barriers will make it difficult to control every aspect of spacecraft operation from an Earth-based mission control. This means that crews will need to be more autonomous and able to manage, plan, and execute the mission on their own, as well as respond to unanticipated system failure and anomalies. Additionally, autonomous and cognitive agent architectures can greatly benefit unmanned vehicles on Earth by allowing them to respond to emergent situations without human intervention.\n\nChapter 2: Benefits of Autonomous and Cognitive Agents\n\nCognitive agents can provide valuable assistance for many tasks performed by humans on a deep space mission. These tasks include spacecraft and systems health, crew health, maintenance, consumable management, payload management, and activities such as food production and recycling. Additionally, cognitive agents can collaborate with the crew on general operational tasks such as training, inspections, and mission planning. Furthermore, autonomous agents can increase the mission's resilience to hazardous events by responding to certain events and providing assistive services such as fault diagnosis, contingency analysis, and mission replanning.\n\nChapter 3: Challenges of Implementing Cognitive Agents\n\nImplementing cognitive agents for deep space missions poses several challenges. First, these agents will need to take on a significant amount of responsibility for mission operations while still operating under crew directives. This will require them to share resources and hardware, and to coordinate their goals and instructions with those of human operators. Additionally, the agents will need to be able to take action autonomously while still allowing for effective crew control of the vehicle, manual intervention when needed, and autonomous and manual coordination of agent goals and tasks.\n\nChapter 4: Adaptation in Long-Duration Spaceflight\n\nLong-duration spaceflight is likely to uncover new challenges that will require some level of adaptation. Whether it is due to known low-probability hazardous events or unplanned \"unknown unknown\" situations, cognitive agents will need to have the capacity for \"graceful extensibility\" - the ability to adapt and learn from new situations as they arise. This will require the agents to have a high degree of autonomy, as well as the ability to communicate with the crew and other agents in order to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nChapter 5: Conclusion\n\nThe use of autonomous and cognitive agents in deep space missions offers numerous benefits, including improved mission resilience, reduced cognitive load on the crew, and increased efficiency in mission operations. However, implementing these agents also poses significant challenges, particularly in terms of software architecture and adaptability to new and unforeseen circumstances. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of these agents make them worth further research and development.",
