  "content": "Another Welsh myth that would make an interesting painting is the story of Bran the Blessed. Bran was a giant and a king of Britain, who possessed a magical cauldron that had the power to revive the dead. He and his followers sailed to Ireland in a giant ship, but Bran was killed in battle. His head was cut off and buried under the White Mount, in London, with the instructions that it should face towards France, so it could continue to protect Britain. It is said that as long as the head remained, Britain would be safe from invasion. A painting depicting Bran and his ship, with his head buried in the background, could be a powerful and evocative image.",
