  "content": "Nate Diaz's professional mixed martial arts career began before he even turned 18 years old. In July 2002, he participated in a bare knuckle fight against Robert Limon, which is believed to be his first competitive experience in the sport. Footage of the fight has since emerged, showcasing Diaz's natural talent and determination even at such a young age.\n\nAfter this fight, Diaz began competing in the World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) organization, where he quickly made a name for himself as a formidable opponent. In 2006, he had the opportunity to fight for the WEC Lightweight Championship against Hermes Fran\u00e7a at WEC 24. Despite his best efforts, Diaz was ultimately defeated by submission in the second round. This defeat was a setback, but it did not deter Diaz from continuing to pursue his dreams in the sport.\n\nThis fight was also significant because it marked the last event held by the WEC before it was acquired by Zuffa, LLC, the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). This acquisition would eventually lead to Diaz joining the UFC and competing at the highest level of mixed martial arts. Despite the challenges he faced early on in his career, Diaz's perseverance and dedication to the sport have allowed him to become one of the most respected and successful fighters in the UFC.",
