Doing laundry can be a chore, but with some tips and tricks, you can make it more efficient and reduce the time spent on it. Here are some suggestions to help you get started:\n\n1. **Sort and prep in advance**: Sort your laundry into whites, colors, and delicates as soon as you take them off. This saves time when it's time to do laundry and prevents mistakes like washing a red sock with your whites.\n2. **Prioritize**: Focus on washing the essentials like socks, underwear, and activewear first, so you have a steady supply of clean clothes for your daily walks and daily activities.\n3. **Use the right detergent**: Choose a high-efficiency detergent that's designed for your washing machine's capacity. This ensures you're using the right amount of detergent and reduces waste.\n4. **Maximize your washer's capacity**: Fill your washing machine to its capacity to reduce the number of loads you need to do. Just be sure not to overload it, as this can lead to poor washing results and damage to your clothes.\n5. **Use the delay start feature**: If your washing machine has a delay start feature, use it to schedule your laundry to run during off-peak hours, like overnight or during the day when you're out on a walk.\n6. **Fold and put away immediately**: To avoid the dreaded \"laundry mountain,\" try to fold and put away your clean clothes as soon as the cycle is complete. This saves time in the long run and keeps your closet organized.\n7. **Consider a laundry sorter**: Invest in a laundry sorter or a divided hamper to separate lights and darks, making it easier to do laundry and reducing the risk of mistakes.\n8. **Use a 'one-touch' rule**: Try to put away clothes in their designated place as soon as you're done wearing them, rather than throwing them on the floor or leaving them in the laundry basket.\n9. **Schedule laundry days**: Set a specific day and time for laundry, so it becomes a habit and you're more likely to stay on top of it.\n10. **Take advantage of technology**: If you have a smart washing machine or a laundry app, use it to monitor your laundry progress, receive notifications, and even control your washer remotely.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you'll be able to do your laundry more efficiently, reduce the time spent on it, and have more time for your daily walks and other activities you enjoy!\n\nRemember, every little bit helps, so start with one or two changes and see how it goes. Happy walking and happy laundry day!",
