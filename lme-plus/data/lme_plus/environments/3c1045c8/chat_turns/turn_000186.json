  "content": "During the Age of Exploration, there were some efforts made to address the mistreatment of indigenous peoples by some Protestant groups. However, these efforts were limited and often inconsistent.\n\nFor example, some missionaries, such as the Jesuits and the Quakers, sought to protect indigenous peoples from harm and promote their rights. They advocated for treaties, laws, and regulations to protect native peoples from land seizures, forced labor, and violence. They also established mission schools to teach native peoples the skills they would need to integrate into colonial society and promoted the preservation of their cultures and languages.\n\nBritish colonial authorities also established laws and regulations that sought to protect the rights of indigenous peoples. In some cases, these laws were more far-reaching than those established in other colonies. For example, the British Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which recognized the rights of indigenous peoples to their traditional lands and established a framework for relations between colonizers and native peoples. However, these laws and regulations were often not enforced, and their effectiveness was limited by the policies of individual settlers and traders.\n\nDespite these efforts, mistreatment of indigenous peoples continued in many Protestant colonies throughout the Age of Exploration. It was not until much later that systematic efforts to address these issues and promote indigenous rights gained widespread support.",
