  "content": "Turkmenistan's infrastructure and public works projects have not significantly contributed to global sustainability and environmental conservation efforts. While the country has invested in renewable energy projects such as wind and solar power, the majority of its energy production still comes from natural gas, which is not a sustainable resource. The government has also been criticized for building large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the Ashgabat Olympic Complex, that are widely seen as wasteful and unsustainable. Additionally, Turkmenistan has been accused of ignoring environmental concerns related to the construction of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline, which has the potential to harm local ecosystems and communities. Overall, while Turkmenistan has made some efforts towards sustainability and conservation, much more needs to be done in order to contribute meaningfully to global environmental goals.",
