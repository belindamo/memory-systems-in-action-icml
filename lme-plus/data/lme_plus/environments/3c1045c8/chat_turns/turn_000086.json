Be careful not to soak the boots, as this can cause damage to the materials.\n3. **Leather cleaner**: If your boots are made of leather, use a leather cleaner to gently remove dirt and grime. Apply the cleaner to a clean cloth and rub it into the boots in a circular motion. Let it dry completely before buffing with a clean cloth.\n4. **Conditioner**: Apply a leather conditioner to the boots to moisturize the leather and prevent cracking. Follow the instructions on the conditioner for application and drying times.\n\nTo remove mold and mildew from your boots:\n\n1. **Let them air out**: Take the boots out of storage and let them air out for a few hours. This can help reduce the moisture that's contributing to the mold and mildew.\n2. **Baking soda**: Sprinkle baking soda liberally over the affected areas and let it sit for 24-48 hours. The baking soda can help absorb the moisture and neutralize the mold and mildew.\n3. **Vinegar**: Mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the affected areas and let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour. The acid in the vinegar can help break down the mold and mildew.\n4. **Dry completely**: Once you've treated the boots, make sure to dry them completely with a clean towel. You can also use a fan or a hair dryer on a low setting to speed up the drying process.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Store your boots in a well-ventilated area to prevent moisture from building up.\n* Consider using silica gel packets or moisture-absorbing products to control humidity in your storage area.\n* If your boots are made of suede or nubuck, you may need to use specialized cleaning products and techniques to avoid damaging the material.\n* Regularly cleaning and conditioning your boots can help prevent mold and mildew from forming in the first place.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to remove dust, dirt, mold, and mildew from your boots and get them looking and feeling like new again!",
