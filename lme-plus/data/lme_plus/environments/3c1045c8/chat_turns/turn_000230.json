  "content": "Month 6-7: Encouraging Close Reading\n\nClose reading is an important skill for developing strong reading comprehension abilities. Teachers can provide opportunities for students to engage in close reading of complex texts and model how to annotate texts for deeper understanding and to make connections between ideas. Students can learn to look closely at text, consider multiple perspectives, and analyze the meaning of words and phrases within the text.\n\nStandards:\n\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.1: Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.4: Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.7: Explain how specific aspects of a text's illustrations contribute to what is conveyed by the words in a story (e.g., create mood, emphasize aspects of a character or setting).\n\nMonth 8-9: Applying Comprehension Strategies\n\nIn months 8-9, teachers can provide explicit instruction on how to apply comprehension strategies to support reading comprehension. They can provide opportunities for students to practice using comprehension strategies such as summarizing, questioning, predicting, and clarifying. Students can learn to identify the main idea of a text, recognize supporting details, and distinguish between important and unimportant information.\n\nStandards:\n\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.2: Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.3: Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.3.1: Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n\nOngoing: Assessment and Progress Monitoring\n\nFormative assessments can be used to monitor student progress and adjust instruction as needed. Teachers can provide opportunities for students to practice reading and comprehending texts across all subject areas. Students can be encouraged to use comprehension strategies in their independent reading and engage in discussions about texts in class.\n\nStandards:\n\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.3.3.A: Identify and know the meaning of the most common prefixes and derivational suffixes.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.3.2: Determine the main idea of a text; recount the key details and explain how they support the main idea.\n* CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.3.4: Determine the meaning of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases in a text relevant to a grade 3 topic or subject area.\n\nBy the end of the school year, students should have a solid foundation in reading comprehension skills and be able to comprehend more complex texts with greater ease. Continued reinforcement and practice of these skills throughout the student's academic career will lead to further development and mastery of this critical CCSS skill.",
