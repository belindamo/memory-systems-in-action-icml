  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to watch movies and assess human emotions. However, I can provide general information on how set design can impact the emotional engagement of the audience with the characters in a movie.\n\nSet design can play a crucial role in creating the mood and tone of a movie. It can help set the time, place, and atmosphere of the story, engaging the audience with the world created by the filmmakers. In the case of Double Platinum, the set design could have helped create the emotional atmosphere in which the characters interacted, making it easier for the audience to connect with them.\n\nIf the set design was well-executed and complemented the story's theme and characters, it could have enhanced the audience's emotional investment in the plot. On the other hand, if it failed to reflect the emotions and actions of the characters, it could have created a disconnect between the audience and the story.\n\nOverall, set design can have a significant impact on the emotional engagement of the audience with the movie's characters. However, this is just one element that contributes to the overall narrative and execution of the film.",
