The Garlyk Potash Plant: This facility is one of the world\u2019s biggest potash production plants, located in the Lebap Province. The plant uses modern, energy-efficient technologies to reduce emissions, and relies on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.\n\n2. The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline: The TAPI project is a 1,814 km long natural gas pipeline that is being built to transport natural gas from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. The project includes a number of sustainable features, including carbon offsets and the use of environmentally safe equipment.\n\n3. Renewable energy projects: Turkmenistan is investing in renewable energy projects, including a 100 MW solar power plant that is being built in the Karakum Desert.\n\n4. Ashgabat\u2019s public transportation system: In the capital city of Ashgabat, the government has invested in a modern public transportation system that includes a fleet of electric buses.\n\n5. The Turkmenistan National Programme on Climate Change: This program outlines a range of measures aimed at promoting sustainable development, including the use of renewable energy, energy efficiency measures, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhile these projects show a commitment to sustainability, it is important to note that there are still concerns about the environmental impact of some of the government's infrastructure projects, and more work is needed to ensure that sustainability is a top priority in all planning and development efforts.",
