  "content": "Sure, here's a modified idea based on your preferences:\n\nCreate a program where professionals in the photography and video industry can sign up to collaborate with your business on generating photography and video assets. The program will have pre-set negotiation terms, including compensation, credit, and exposure.\n\nAs part of the program, you will also host a \"Collaborator Day\" where potential collaborators can schedule a day to visit your business and capture photography and video assets. This will help them gain a better understanding of your brand, products, and services, and enable them to create content that aligns with your vision.\n\nTo apply for the program, potential collaborators will need to submit their information, portfolio, and a brief explanation of why they would be a good fit for the program. Once selected, you will provide them with a detailed brief outlining the scope of the project, the desired outcome, and any other relevant information.\n\nDuring the collaboration, you will establish deadlines and milestones to ensure that the project stays on track and meets your objectives. You will also review and approve the final content before publishing and promoting it on your website, social media, and other relevant channels. Proper credit will be given to the collaborators to showcase their work.\n\nOverall, this modified idea can help you create high-quality photography and video assets that align with your brand vision and values. It can also help you build relationships with other professionals in the industry and create opportunities for future collaborations.",
