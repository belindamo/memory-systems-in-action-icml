  "content": "The Jagannath Temple in Puri is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Jagannath (a form of Lord Krishna), his sister Subhadra and his older brother Balabhadra. The temple is considered one of the holiest shrines in India and is a major pilgrimage destination for Hindus.\n\nThe annual Rath Yatra festival, also known as the Chariot Festival, is one of the biggest festivals in India and is celebrated in Puri. During the festival, the deities of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra are taken out of the temple and placed on three huge chariots, which are pulled by thousands of devotees through the streets of Puri. The chariots are made of wood and are decorated with bright colors and flowers.\n\nThe significance of the Rath Yatra festival is that it is believed to be the day when the deities of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra visit their aunt's temple, the Gundicha Temple, which is about 3 km away from the Jagannath Temple. The festival is also a symbol of unity and equality, as people from all castes and creeds come together to participate in the procession.\n\nOverall, the Jagannath Temple and the annual Rath Yatra festival have great religious and cultural significance for Hindus and is a major event in Indian culture.",
