The problem is that marginalized communities have historically been excluded from opportunities, resulting in systemic inequalities that make it more challenging for them to get hired.\n\nFor instance, if a particular profession has traditionally been male-dominated, women may be less likely to have had the same access to education, mentorship, or networking opportunities as their male peers. Given this, companies that prioritize diversity and inclusion recognize that they may need to take certain steps to address these inequalities and create a more level playing field.\n\nIt's important to note that diversity and inclusion don't necessarily come at the expense of merit or qualifications. Rather, they enhance them, as a more diverse workforce can bring different perspectives, ideas, and experiences that can drive innovation and creativity in the workplace.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may take more effort to create a diverse and inclusive hiring process, it can ultimately lead to a stronger and more innovative company culture.",
