Audible (Amazon)\n2. Audiobooks.com\n3. Libro.fm (supports independent bookstores)\n4. Google Play Books\n5. Apple Audiobooks\n6. OverDrive (library borrowing)\n\nYou can search for the book titles I mentioned, and chances are, you'll find them available as audiobooks. If you're unsure, you can also check the authors' or publishers' websites for audiobook information.\n\nSince you mentioned you've been listening to audiobooks during your morning runs, I thought I'd suggest a few more psychological thrillers that are particularly well-suited for audiobook format:\n\n1. **The Silent Patient** by Alex Michaelides - A psychological thriller about a famous painter who's accused of murdering her husband and refuses to speak. The audiobook is narrated by two voices, which adds to the suspense.\n2. **The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle** by Stuart Turton - A unique, complex murder mystery that takes place at a British manor house. The audiobook is expertly narrated, making it easy to follow the multiple storylines.\n3. **The Stranger Diaries** by Elly Griffiths - A modern take on the Sherlock Holmes story, with a writer of horror stories becoming embroiled in a real-life murder mystery. The audiobook has a great narrator who brings the characters to life.\n\nThese audiobooks are all engaging, well-narrated, and will keep you on the edge of your seat during your morning runs!\n\nDo you have a preferred narrator or a specific accent you enjoy listening to? I can try to recommend more audiobooks based on your preferences!",
