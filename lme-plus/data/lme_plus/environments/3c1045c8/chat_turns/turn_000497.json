  "content": "The code you provided does not seem to be returning a type error for 'students'. However, there is a declaration of the 'students' variable at the beginning of the code that is not initialized.\n```swift\npublic static LinkedList<Student> students; // List of all the students\n```\nTo fix this error, you should initialize the 'students' variable to an empty linked list. You can do this in the main method after declaring the variable:\n```typescript\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    // Initialize the students list\n    students = new LinkedList<Student>();\n    \n    // Rest of the code\n    ...\n}\n```\nThis will initialize the 'students' variable to an empty linked list and resolve the error.",
