Have you noticed any differences in your riding style or preferences since switching to the road bike?\n\nRoad biking can be a great way to improve your endurance and speed, and it's awesome that you're getting more comfortable on the road. Are you finding that you're enjoying the road bike more than you expected, or are you looking forward to getting your mountain bike back and hitting the trails again?\n\nAlso, what's the story with your mountain bike being in the repair shop? Was it a routine maintenance issue or did something unexpected happen during a ride?",
