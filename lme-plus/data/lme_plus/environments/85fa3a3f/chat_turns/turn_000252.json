  "content": "It looks like you are using the `QUERY` function to search for rows in the 'Masterfile 12/1/2022' sheet where column A (zip\\_code) contains the value in cell C2. If you want to include postal codes that contain letters or have spaces in the search, you can modify the `WHERE` clause of the `QUERY` function to use the `REGEXMATCH` function.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify the `WHERE` clause to include postal codes with letters or spaces:\n```bash\n=QUERY('Masterfile 12/1/2022'!A:Q,\"Select * Where REGEXMATCH(A, \"\"\"&$C$2&\"\"\")\")\n```\nThis will search for rows where the value in column A matches the regular expression in cell C2. The regular expression `\".*\"&$C$2&\".*\"` will match any string that contains the value in cell C2, regardless of whether it contains letters or spaces.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more information.",
