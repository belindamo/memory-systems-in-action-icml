  "content": "Romantic artists viewed their role in society as being not only creators of art but also social and political commentators. They believed that art had the power to inspire and educate people, and that it could effect positive change in society. Therefore, they saw themselves as agents of change and advocates for social justice.\n\nIn terms of their beliefs about the relationship between art and politics, Romantic artists believed that art should be free from the constraints of politics and society. They argued that art should be a reflection of individual self-expression, and that it should not be subject to government censorship or control.\n\nHowever, Romantic artists were also passionate about social and political issues, and many believed that art could be used to raise awareness and provoke change. They were particularly concerned with issues of social inequality, poverty, and oppression, and they often used their art to draw attention to these issues and promote social justice. They saw themselves as advocates for the marginalized and oppressed, and believed that art could help bring about a more just and enlightened society.",
