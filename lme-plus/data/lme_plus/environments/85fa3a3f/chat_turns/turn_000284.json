  "content": "I love the Spicy Roasted Chickpeas recipe, I actually tried something similar last week and it turned out amazing! I've been on a savory snack kick for the past two weeks, and I've been stocking up on Kettle Brand chips, especially the Spicy Thai flavor, which I've had for lunch three days this week with hummus. Do you have any recommendations for healthy snack subscription boxes that can help me discover new savory snacks?",
