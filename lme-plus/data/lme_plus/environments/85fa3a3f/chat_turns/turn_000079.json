Dental chews: $10/month\n\nTotal recurring expenses: $50 + $10 = $60/month\n\n**One-time expenses:**\n\n1. Dog bed: $40 (one-time expense, not included in monthly average)\n\nSince the dog bed was a one-time expense, we won't include it in the monthly average.\n\nSo, the average monthly cost of Max's supplies is **$60**.\n\nDoes this look about right to you? Are there any other expenses you've been tracking that we haven't accounted for?",
