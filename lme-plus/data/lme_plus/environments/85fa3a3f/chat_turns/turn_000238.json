  "content": "Based on the information you provided, we can calculate the turnover rate using the formula:\n\nTurnover rate = (Number of employees who left / Average number of employees) x 100%\n\nTo find the average number of employees, we add the number of employees at the beginning of the period (January 22) and the number of employees at the end of the period (December 22), and divide by 2:\n\nAverage number of employees = (741 + 809) / 2 = 775\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the formula to get:\n\nTurnover rate = (169 / 775) x 100%\nTurnover rate = 21.81%\n\nSo the turnover rate for the period covered by this data is approximately 21.81%. This means that about 22% of the workforce left the company and needed to be replaced during the period.",
