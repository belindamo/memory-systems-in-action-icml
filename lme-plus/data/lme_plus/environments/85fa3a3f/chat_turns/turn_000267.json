It's great that it's made you more mindful of taking care of your belongings.\n\nRegarding the Note Sleeve, I completely understand your hesitation about the price. $100 is a significant investment for a wallet, but I'd like to offer some perspective:\n\n**Quality and Durability:** Bellroy wallets are renowned for their exceptional quality and durability. The Note Sleeve is built to last, with premium leather and robust stitching that will withstand daily wear and tear. With proper care, it can easily last for 5-10 years or more.\n\n**Functionality and Convenience:** The Note Sleeve's design and features are carefully crafted to provide a high level of functionality and convenience. The dedicated ID window, cash compartment, and RFID protection make it an excellent choice for someone with multiple cards.\n\n**Value for Money:** While $100 might seem steep, consider the cost per year of ownership. If the Note Sleeve lasts for 5-10 years, the cost per year would be around $10-$20. That's a relatively small amount for a high-quality wallet that will serve you well for many years.\n\n**Alternative Options:** If you're not ready to invest in a premium wallet like the Note Sleeve, you might consider other options. However, keep in mind that cheaper wallets might not offer the same level of quality, durability, and functionality. You might end up replacing them more frequently, which could ultimately cost you more in the long run.\n\n**Personal Value:** As someone who's invested in a luxury watch, you might appreciate the value of owning a high-quality, well-crafted product that reflects your personal style and attention to detail. The Note Sleeve is a premium wallet that can complement your luxury watch and other high-end accessories.\n\nUltimately, the decision to invest in the Note Sleeve depends on your personal priorities and budget. If you value quality, durability, and functionality, and are willing to invest in a premium product, the Note Sleeve might be an excellent choice. However, if budget is a significant concern, you might consider exploring other options or waiting for a sale.\n\nHow do you feel about the value proposition of the Note Sleeve? Is there anything else you'd like to consider or discuss?",
