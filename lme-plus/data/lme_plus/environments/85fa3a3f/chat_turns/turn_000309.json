  "content": "Energy monitoring is a fantastic feature that can help you track and manage the energy consumption of your devices. Here's how it works:\n\n**Energy Monitoring:**\n\nSmart plugs with energy monitoring capabilities can track the power consumption of the devices connected to them in real-time. This information is usually displayed in the accompanying app, providing you with insights into:\n\n1. **Real-time energy usage**: See how much energy your device is consuming at any given moment.\n2. **Daily/Weekly/Monthly usage**: View your device's energy consumption over different time periods.\n3. **Total energy cost**: Estimate the total cost of energy consumed by your device based on your local electricity rates.\n4. **Standby power consumption**: Identify devices that continue to draw power even when turned off or in standby mode.\n\nThis information can help you:\n\n* Identify energy-hungry devices and replace them with more energy-efficient alternatives.\n* Optimize your device usage to reduce energy waste and lower your electricity bills.\n* Set energy budgets and receive alerts when you exceed them.\n\nNow, let's see which of the recommended smart plugs have energy monitoring features:\n\n1. **Belkin WeMo Insight Smart Plug**: This smart plug has advanced energy monitoring capabilities, providing detailed information on real-time energy usage, daily/weekly/monthly usage, and total energy cost. It also estimates standby power consumption and provides energy usage forecasts.\n2. **TP-Link Smart Plug (HS110)**: The HS110 model has energy monitoring features, including real-time energy usage, daily/weekly/monthly usage, and total energy cost. It also supports energy usage forecasting and alerts.\n3. **iDevices Switch**: This smart plug tracks energy usage in real-time and provides daily/weekly/monthly usage reports. It also estimates standby power consumption and offers energy usage forecasts.\n4. **Eufy Smart Plug Mini**: This smart plug has basic energy monitoring features, including real-time energy usage and daily/weekly/monthly usage reports.\n\nThe other recommended smart plugs (Amazon Smart Plug, Anker Smart Plug) do not have built-in energy monitoring features. However, they may still be great options if you're looking for a simple and affordable smart plug solution.\n\nKeep in mind that some smart plugs may require you to input your local electricity rates to estimate energy costs accurately. Additionally, the accuracy of energy monitoring data may vary depending on the smart plug's hardware and software.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!",
