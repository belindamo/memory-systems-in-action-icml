  "content": "Here is an example of an ABC music file that uses whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, and eighth notes:\n```\nX:1\nT:My Tune\nM:4/4\nL:1/4\nK:C\nC2 D2 E2 F2 | G2 A2 B2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 |\nC2 D2 E2 F2 | G2 A2 B2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 |\nC2 D2 E2 F2 | G2 A2 B2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 |\nC2 D2 E2 F2 | G2 A2 B2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 |\n```\nThis file describes a simple melody in the key of C with a 4/4 time signature. The melody consists of whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, and eighth notes, indicated by the length of the notes. The vertical lines (|) indicate measures.\n\nTo create a tune using these note lengths, you can simply replace the letters in the melody with different notes. For example, to create a melody using only the notes C, D, E, and F, you could replace the letters in the melody with those notes, like this:\n```\nX:1\nT:My Tune\nM:4/4\nL:1/4\nK:C\nC2 D2 E2 F2 | G2 A2 B2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 |\nC2 D2 E2 F2 | G2 A2 B2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 |\nC2 D2 E2 F2 | G2 A2 B2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 |\nC2 D2 E2 F2 | G2 A2 B2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 | C2 C2 C2 C2 |\n```\nYou can continue to modify the melody by changing the notes and their lengths, as well as adding chords and other elements to create a more complex and interesting tune.",
