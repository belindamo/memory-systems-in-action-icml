Here's how:\n\n**Amazon Echo Integration:**\n\nThe Ecobee SmartThermostat and Room Sensors are compatible with Amazon Alexa, which means you can control your thermostat and access its features using voice commands. You can:\n\n* Adjust the temperature using voice commands (e.g., \"Alexa, set the temperature to 72\u00b0F\")\n* Ask Alexa to report the current temperature and humidity levels in each room\n* Use Alexa routines to automate your thermostat and other smart devices\n\n**Smart Plug Integration:**\n\nThe Ecobee SmartThermostat and Room Sensors can also integrate with your smart plugs, allowing you to create custom automations and scenes. For example:\n\n* When you leave a room, the room sensor can trigger the smart plug to turn off the lights or TV\n* When you enter a room, the room sensor can trigger the smart plug to turn on the lights or adjust the temperature\n* You can create custom scenes that adjust multiple smart devices, including your thermostat, lights, and plugs, with a single voice command or tap on your smartphone\n\n**Smart Home Hub Integration:**\n\nThe Ecobee SmartThermostat and Room Sensors can also integrate with popular smart home hubs, such as:\n\n* Samsung SmartThings\n* Wink Hub\n* Apple HomeKit (via the Ecobee HomeKit-enabled thermostat)\n\nThis allows you to control your Ecobee devices alongside other smart devices in your hub, creating a more seamless and integrated smart home experience.\n\n**IFTTT (If This Then That) Integration:**\n\nEcobee also supports IFTTT, which enables you to create custom applets that connect your Ecobee devices with other smart devices and services. For example:\n\n* If the room sensor detects that you've left the room, then turn off the lights and adjust the thermostat\n* If the weather forecast shows a hot day ahead, then adjust the thermostat to a cooler temperature\n\nOverall, the Ecobee Room Sensors can integrate with your existing smart home setup, allowing you to create a more automated, comfortable, and energy-efficient home.",
