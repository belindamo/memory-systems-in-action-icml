Here's some guidance to get you started:\n\n**Determining Fair Market Value**\n\n1. **Research the market**: Look at recent sales of similar condos in your building, complex, or neighborhood. You can use online real estate platforms like Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com to get an idea of what similar properties are selling for.\n2. **Get a professional appraisal**: Hire a licensed appraiser to provide an independent evaluation of your condo's value. This can cost around $300-$500, but it can give you a more accurate estimate of your condo's value.\n3. **Consult with a real estate agent**: A local real estate agent can provide valuable insights into the market and help you determine a fair market value for your condo.
