Since you have a deadline in two weeks, we can create a plan to complete the report in smaller chunks.\n\nHere's a suggested plan to help you finalize the report:\n\n**Week 1:**\n\n* **Task 1: Review and organize data** (estimated time: 2-3 hours)\n\t+ Review all the data and information you've collected for the report\n\t+ Organize the data into sections or categories\n\t+ Identify any gaps or areas that need more research\n\tReminders: Set a reminder for Wednesday to work on Task 1 for 1.5 hours, and another reminder for Friday to complete the remaining 1-1.5 hours.\n* **Task 2: Outline the report structure** (estimated time: 1-2 hours)\n\t+ Create an outline for the report, including the introduction, body, and conclusion\n\t+ Determine the key points to cover in each section\n\tReminders: Set a reminder for Thursday to work on Task 2 for 1 hour.\n\n**Week 2:**\n\n* **Task 3: Write the report content** (estimated time: 4-5 hours)\n\t+ Start writing the report content, following the outline created in Task 2\n\t+ Focus on one section at a time to ensure quality and consistency\n\tReminders: Set reminders for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of next week to work on Task 3 for 1.5 hours each day.\n* **Task 4: Review, edit, and finalize the report** (estimated time: 2-3 hours)\n\t+ Review the entire report for content, grammar, and consistency\n\t+ Make any necessary edits or revisions\n\t+ Finalize the report and prepare it for submission\n\tReminders: Set reminders for Thursday and Friday of next week to work on Task 4 for 1-1.5 hours each day.\n\nThis plan allows you to work on the report in smaller chunks, making it more manageable and reducing the likelihood of feeling overwhelmed. You can adjust the time allocations based on your work style and pace.\n\nRemember to take breaks and give yourself some buffer time in case any tasks take longer than expected. You got this!\n\nHow does this plan sound? Do you have any questions or need further adjustments?",
