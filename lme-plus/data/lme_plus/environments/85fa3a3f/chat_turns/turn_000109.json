  "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, here is some information on the SG&A costs as a percentage of sales for Exact Sciences and Guardant Health:\n\n1. Exact Sciences Corporation (EXAS)\nIn 2020, Exact Sciences reported SG&A expenses of approximately $1.03 billion, which was around 81.2% of their net sales of $1.27 billion. This relatively high percentage is partly due to significant investments in sales and marketing to promote their Cologuard and Oncotype DX diagnostic tests, as well as the acquisition of Thrive Earlier Detection and Base Genomics in 2020.\n2. Guardant Health, Inc. (GH)\nIn 2020, Guardant Health had SG&A expenses of about $227 million, which was approximately 66.1% of their net sales of $343 million. This percentage reflects their continued investment in sales, marketing, and infrastructure to support the growth of their liquid biopsy tests, Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI.\n\nPlease note that these percentages are based on historical data and may have changed since then. Additionally, smaller and mid-cap companies like Exact Sciences and Guardant Health often have higher SG&A costs as a percentage of sales compared to larger, more established companies. This is because they are generally in growth phases and investing heavily in sales and marketing to expand their market share.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information on these companies, consult their latest financial statements or annual reports.",
