  "content": "**Single Supplement Fee:**\n\nThe single supplement fee is a common practice in the travel industry, where solo travelers are charged an additional fee to cover the cost of a single room. This fee can vary depending on the tour operator, accommodation type, and duration of the tour.\n\nIn the case of Intrepid Travel's Tokyo to Kyoto tour, the single supplement fee is around $500-$700 USD. This fee is added to the tour price if you prefer to have a single room throughout the tour.\n\n**Waiving the Single Supplement Fee:**\n\nYes, it is possible to waive the single supplement fee if you're willing to share a room with another solo traveler of the same gender. This is often referred to as \"twin share\" or \"room sharing.\"\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Room Share Request:** When you book your tour, let Intrepid Travel know that you're willing to share a room with another solo traveler. They'll add your name to their room share list.\n2. **Matching Roommates:** Intrepid Travel will try to match you with another solo traveler of the same gender who is also willing to share a room. If they find a match, you'll be notified, and the single supplement fee will be waived.\n3. **No Guarantee:** Please note that Intrepid Travel cannot guarantee a roommate match. If they're unable to find a suitable match, you'll need to pay the single supplement fee.\n\n**Benefits of Room Sharing:**\n\n1. **Cost Savings:** You'll save money by not paying the single supplement fee.\n2. **Social Aspect:** You'll have the opportunity to meet and travel with another solo traveler, which can enhance your overall tour experience.\n3. **Flexibility:** If you're open to sharing a room, you may have more flexibility with your tour dates, as Intrepid Travel can try to match you with someone on a specific departure.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Book Early:** To increase your chances of finding a roommate, book your tour as early as possible.\n2. **Be Flexible:** Be open to sharing a room with someone of a similar age and travel style.\n3. **Communicate:** If you're matched with a roommate, make sure to communicate with each other before the tour to ensure you're comfortable with the arrangement.\n\nRemember to check with Intrepid Travel's customer service team for the most up-to-date information on their room share policy and single supplement fees.",
