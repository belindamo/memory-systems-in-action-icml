Physical barrier: The skin is made up of multiple layers of cells that act as a physical barrier, protecting the body from physical damage, harmful substances, and microorganisms.\n\n2. Chemical barrier: The skin produces natural antibiotics and other chemicals that protect against harmful microorganisms.\n\n3. Temperature regulation: The skin helps regulate body temperature by controlling the flow of heat and moisture from the body.\n\n4. Sensory response: The skin contains sensory receptors that detect pain, pressure, and temperature changes, alerting the body to potential danger.\n\n5. UV protection: The skin produces melanin, a pigment that helps protect against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.\n\nOverall, the skin plays a critical role in protecting the body from a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological assaults.",
