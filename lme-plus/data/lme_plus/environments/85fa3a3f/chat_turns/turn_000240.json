For example:\n\n* What are the projects you're working on, and what are the tasks you need to complete for each project?\n* What are the deadlines for each project or task?\n* Are there any specific tasks that you need to prioritize or focus on this week?\n* Do you have any recurring tasks or meetings that you need to schedule around?\n\nAlso, considering you took a half-day off on Monday and are feeling a bit behind, are there any tasks that you had planned to complete on Monday that you need to reschedule or catch up on?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your projects, tasks, and deadlines, I can help you set reminders and create a plan to get you back on track for the week.",
