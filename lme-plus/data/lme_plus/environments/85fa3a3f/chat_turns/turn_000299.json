  "content": "Both durable squeaky balls and rubber toys with holes are excellent options for Max.\n\nRegarding using a rubber toy with holes as a treat dispenser for his grain-free kibble, I'd say it's a great idea! Rubber toys with holes are perfect for stuffing with treats, and they can provide a fun and challenging way for Max to get his kibble.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Size of the holes**: Make sure the holes in the rubber toy are large enough for Max's kibble to fit through. You don't want him to get frustrated if the kibble gets stuck.\n2. **Type of kibble**: Since Max is on a grain-free diet, you'll want to ensure the kibble is small enough to fit through the holes and isn't too crumbly or prone to breaking apart.\n3. **Moisture content**: If Max's kibble is too moist or oily, it might not work well in a rubber toy with holes. Look for kibble that's dry and easy to dispense.\n4. **Supervise**: As with any treat-dispensing toy, supervise Max when he's using it to ensure he's not getting frustrated or trying to chew on the toy itself.\n\nUsing a rubber toy with holes as a treat dispenser can help:\n\n* Slow down eating: By making Max work for his kibble, you can slow down his eating pace and reduce gobbling.\n* Provide mental stimulation: Problem-solving and figuring out how to get the kibble out can be mentally stimulating and engaging for Max.\n* Encourage interactive play: A rubber toy with holes can encourage Max to play and engage with you, promoting bonding and exercise.\n\nIf you decide to go with a rubber toy with holes, I hope Max enjoys it!",
