  "content": "While specific percentages can vary between companies and over time, as a general guideline, we can roughly break down SG&A costs into Sales & Marketing (S&M) and General & Administrative (G&A) expenses for diagnostic companies:\n\n1. Sales & Marketing (S&M) expenses: These costs typically include expenses related to promoting, selling, and delivering products and services, such as advertising, sales force salaries and commissions, and trade show expenses. For diagnostic companies, S&M expenses often range from 10% to 25% of sales. However, this can vary depending on the company's size, competitive landscape, and sales strategy.\n2. General & Administrative (G&A) expenses: These costs cover the expenses incurred in the day-to-day operations of the business, such as salaries and wages for management and support staff, office rent, insurance, and legal fees. G&A expenses for diagnostic companies generally range from 10% to 20% of sales, but this can also vary depending on the company's size, efficiency, and the complexity of its operations.\n\nKeep in mind that these figures are approximate and may not be applicable to all diagnostic companies. For specific companies, it's essential to review their financial statements or consult recent industry reports for more accurate and up-to-date information on SG&A cost breakdowns.",
