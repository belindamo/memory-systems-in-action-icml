Congratulations on building a new trellis for your climbing peas and cucumbers - it's great that you're taking the time to provide them with a supportive structure to thrive.\n\nNow, let's talk about companion planting for your heirloom tomatoes! Companion planting is the practice of growing different plants together to improve their growth, health, and productivity. Here are some excellent companion plants that can benefit your heirloom tomatoes:\n\n1. **Basil**: A classic combination! Basil repels pests that target tomatoes, such as whiteflies and aphids, and adds flavor to many tomato-based dishes.\n2. **Borage**: Attracts beneficial insects, like bees, and improves tomato flavor and texture. Its tall stems can also provide shade for tomato plants.\n3. **Chives**: Repels aphids and other pests, and their onion-like scent can improve tomato growth.\n4. **Marigold**: Repels nematodes, which can harm tomatoes, and attracts beneficial insects.\n5. **Oregano**: A natural fungicide, oregano can help prevent diseases like early blight and septoria leaf spot in tomatoes.\n6. **Parsley**: Repels carrot flies, which can also target tomatoes, and adds nutrients to the soil.\n7. **Radish**: Can help to repel cucumber beetles, which can spread bacterial wilt to tomatoes.\n8. **Comfrey**: Acts as a fertilizer plant, adding nutrients to the soil that benefit tomatoes.\n9. **Calendula**: Attracts beneficial insects and can help to repel pests that target tomatoes.\n10. **Dill**: Repels aphids and other pests, and its tall stems can provide shade for tomato plants.\n\nRemember to plant these companions around the perimeter of your tomato bed or intersperse them among your tomato plants. Keep in mind that some of these plants, like marigold and calendula, can spread quickly, so be prepared to prune or divide them regularly.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy gardening!",
