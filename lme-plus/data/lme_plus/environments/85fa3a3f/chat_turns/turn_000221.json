  "content": "I'll keep those tips in mind when structuring and promoting my promotion. I think I'll go with a \"spend and save\" promotion, where customers get 10% off their entire purchase if they spend $50 or more. I'll also offer a free travel-sized candle with every purchase of a soap and lotion set. I'll make sure to clearly communicate the promotion through social media, email marketing, and in-booth signage.\n\nBy the way, I was thinking of offering a special loyalty program for customers who frequent my booth at the craft fair. Do you have any advice on how to structure a loyalty program and what kind of rewards to offer?",
