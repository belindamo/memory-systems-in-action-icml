Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Tomatoes: Plant them 2-3 feet (60-90 cm) apart, depending on the variety. Indeterminate tomatoes, which will continue to grow and produce fruit throughout the season, may need more space than determinate varieties, which stop growing once they reach a certain height.\n* Basil: Plant 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) away from tomatoes.\n* Borage: Plant 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) away from tomatoes.\n* Chives: Plant 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) away from tomatoes.\n* Marigold: Plant 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) away from tomatoes.\n* Oregano: Plant 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) away from tomatoes.\n* Parsley: Plant 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) away from tomatoes.\n* Radish: Plant 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) away from tomatoes.\n* Comfrey: Plant 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) away from tomatoes.\n* Calendula: Plant 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) away from tomatoes.\n* Dill: Plant 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) away from tomatoes.\n\n**Depth:**\n\nPlant companions at the same depth as your tomatoes, or slightly shallower. This ensures that the roots of the companion plants don't compete with your tomatoes for water and nutrients. Here are some specific guidelines:\n\n* Basil and parsley: Plant at the same depth as tomatoes, about 1/4 inch (6 mm) deeper than the soil surface.\n* Borage and comfrey: Plant slightly shallower than tomatoes, about 1/2 inch (1 cm) below the soil surface.\n* Chives, marigold, oregano, and calendula: Plant at the same depth as tomatoes, about 1/4 inch (6 mm) deeper than the soil surface.\n* Radish: Plant about 1/2 inch (1 cm) shallower than tomatoes.\n* Dill: Plant about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deeper than tomatoes.\n\nRemember to plant companions around the perimeter of your tomato bed or intersperse them among your tomato plants. This will allow for good air circulation and sunlight penetration, which are essential for healthy plant growth.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.",
