However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or real-time information about gyms in your area. But I can provide you with some general guidance and suggestions on how to find a gym that suits your preferences.\n\nSince you're looking for a mix of cardio and weightlifting equipment, a mid-range to budget-friendly gym with a variety of equipment and group classes would be a good fit. Here are a few options you could consider:\n\n1. Planet Fitness: Known for their affordable membership prices (around $10-20/month) and Judgement-Free Zone atmosphere, Planet Fitness offers a range of cardio and weightlifting equipment, as well as group classes like yoga and Pilates.\n2. Anytime Fitness: With 24/7 access and a wide range of equipment, Anytime Fitness is a convenient option for those with non-traditional schedules. They also offer group classes and personal training. Membership prices vary by location, but expect to pay around $20-40/month.\n3. LA Fitness: LA Fitness offers a variety of equipment, group classes, and personal training. They often have promotions and discounts, and membership prices range from $20-40/month.\n4. Local YMCA or Community Centers: Many YMCAs and community centers offer affordable membership options, group classes, and a range of equipment. They may not have all the bells and whistles, but they're a great option for those on a budget.\n\nTo find gyms near your specific location, I recommend trying online directories like Google Maps, Yelp, or online review sites like Health Club Ratings. You can filter your search by location, price, and amenities to find the best fit for you.\n\nAs for your commute, it's great that you're adjusting to the new bus ride! You might consider using the time to listen to podcasts, audiobooks, or even do some stretching exercises to get you ready for your gym sessions.\n\nRemember to research and visit a few gyms before committing to a membership. This will give you a feel for the atmosphere, equipment, and classes they offer. Good luck, and happy gym-hunting!",
