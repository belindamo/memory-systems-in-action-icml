It's great that you're adjusting well to the change.\n\nAs for your gym search, having a mix of cardio and weightlifting equipment is an excellent starting point! This will give you a solid foundation for a well-rounded workout routine. Cardio equipment like treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes can help improve your cardiovascular health and burn calories, while weightlifting equipment like free weights, machines, and kettlebells can help build strength and muscle tone.\n\nHaving a mix of both will allow you to create a workout routine that suits your goals and preferences. You can start with cardio exercises to get your heart rate up and then move on to weightlifting to build strength. Or, you can alternate between cardio and weightlifting days to keep your workouts interesting and prevent plateaus.\n\nSome gyms may also offer group fitness classes that incorporate cardio and strength training, such as HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) or boot camp-style workouts. These classes can be a great way to mix up your routine and get a full-body workout.\n\nRemember to consider other factors when choosing a gym, such as cleanliness, hours of operation, and staff availability. It's also essential to find a gym with a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel motivated to work out regularly.\n\nKeep in mind that many gyms offer free trials or guest passes, so you can try out a gym before committing to a membership. This can be a great way to get a feel for the gym's equipment, atmosphere, and staff before making a decision.",
