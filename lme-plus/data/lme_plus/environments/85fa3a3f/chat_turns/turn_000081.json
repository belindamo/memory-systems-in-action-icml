Dental chews: $10/month\n\nTotal recurring expenses: $50 + $10 = $60/month\n\n**One-time expenses:**\n\n1. Dog bed: $40 (one-time expense)\n2. Flea and tick collar: $20 (one-time expense)\n\nSince both the dog bed and flea and tick collar are one-time expenses, we won't include them in the monthly average.\n\nThe average monthly cost of Max's supplies is still **$60**.\n\nIf you're tracking expenses over a longer period, you might want to consider factoring in the one-time expenses to get a more accurate picture of your annual or quarterly expenses. But for now, the monthly average remains the same.",
