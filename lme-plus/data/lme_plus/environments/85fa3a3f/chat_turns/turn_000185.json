Marinating olives is a simple process, but it does require some planning ahead. Here are some tips to help you create deliciously marinated olives:\n\n**Choosing the right olives:**\n\n* Select a mild to medium-strength olive variety, like Cerignola, Castelvetrano, or Gaeta. Avoid strong, salty olives like Kalamata or Ni\u00e7oise.\n* You can use either green or black olives, but green olives tend to absorb flavors better.\n\n**Basic Marinating Process:**\n\n1. **Rinse and dry the olives**: Rinse the olives with water, then pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.\n2. **Create the marinade**: In a bowl, combine the ingredients for your marinade (e.g., olive oil, lemon juice, thyme, rosemary, garlic, salt, and pepper).\n3. **Add olives to the marinade**: Place the olives in a clean glass jar or airtight container, then pour the marinade over them. Make sure the olives are completely covered by the marinade.\n4. **Refrigerate and wait**: Store the jar in the refrigerator and let the olives marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight (8-12 hours). The longer they marinate, the more flavorful they'll become.\n5. **Serve**: Once the olives have marinated, remove them from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature. Serve them alongside your Paper Plane cocktails.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Use a flavorful oil**: Choose a high-quality olive oil with a mild flavor to avoid overpowering the other ingredients.\n* **Don't over-marinate**: While longer marinating times can enhance flavor, be careful not to overdo it. Olives can become too salty or bitter if left in the marinade for too long.\n* **Add aromatics**: In addition to thyme and rosemary, you can add other aromatics like garlic, bay leaves, or citrus zest to the marinade for added depth.\n* **Experiment with citrus**: Try using different citrus juices, like orange or grapefruit, to create a unique flavor profile.\n* **Make ahead**: You can prepare the marinade and store it in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Simply add the olives when you're ready to marinate them.\n\nHere's a sample marinade recipe to get you started:\n\n**Citrus-Herb Olive Marinade**\n\n* 1/2 cup olive oil\n* 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme\n* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary\n* 1 clove garlic, minced\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\nCombine all ingredients in a bowl, then add the olives and marinate according to the basic process above.\n\nI hope this helps you create delicious citrus-marinated olives to pair with your Paper Plane cocktails!",
