That's a great experience to have under your belt.\n\nRegarding your question, it's a common debate among screenwriters whether to focus on a specific genre or experiment with different genres and styles. Here are some pros and cons of each approach to help you decide:\n\n**Focusing on a specific genre:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Depth over breadth**: By concentrating on a single genre, you can delve deeper into its conventions, tropes, and audience expectations, becoming an expert in that area.\n2. **Building a brand**: Focusing on a specific genre can help you establish a reputation as a writer within that genre, making it easier to attract producers, agents, and collaborators who are interested in similar projects.\n3. **Efficient use of time**: By specializing in a genre, you can develop a shorthand for storytelling, character development, and plot structures, allowing you to write more efficiently.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Limited opportunities**: If you only write in one genre, you might limit your opportunities to work on other projects or collaborate with industry professionals outside of that genre.\n2. **Stagnation**: Focusing too much on a single genre can lead to a lack of creative growth and innovation, as you may rely too heavily on familiar tropes and formulas.\n\n**Experimenting with different genres and styles:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Creative freedom**: Exploring various genres and styles can help you discover your unique voice and tone, allowing you to express yourself more freely.\n2. **Versatility**: Being able to write in multiple genres can make you a more attractive collaborator, as you can adapt to different projects and audiences.\n3. **Cross-pollination**: Working in different genres can help you bring fresh ideas and perspectives to each project, preventing stagnation and keeping your writing fresh.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Jack-of-all-trades, master of none**: Spreading yourself too thin across multiple genres can prevent you from developing a deep understanding of any one genre, making it harder to stand out.\n2. **Lack of focus**: Experimenting with too many genres and styles can lead to a lack of focus, making it difficult to develop a consistent body of work or establish a clear brand.\n\nUltimately, the approach you take depends on your goals, interests, and writing style. Here's a possible middle ground:\n\n1. **Start with a focus**: Begin by focusing on a specific genre that resonates with you, allowing you to develop a deep understanding of its conventions and audience expectations.\n2. **Experiment and branch out**: Once you've established a foundation in one genre, experiment with other genres and styles to expand your creative horizons and versatility.\n3. **Find your niche**: As you explore different genres, you may discover a specific niche or sub-genre that combines elements of multiple genres, allowing you to create a unique voice and brand.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to write what excites and challenges you, and to continually work on developing your craft.",
