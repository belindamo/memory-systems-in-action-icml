Dental chews: $10/month\n\nTotal recurring expenses: $50 + $10 = $60/month\n\n**One-time expenses:**\n\n1. Dog bed: $40 (one-time expense, not included in monthly average)\n\nSince the dog bed was a one-time expense, we won't include it in the monthly average.\n\nSo, the average monthly cost of Max's supplies is **$60**.\n\nDoes this look about right to you?

Dental chews can be a helpful addition to a dog's oral care routine, as they can help reduce tartar and plaque, freshen breath, and promote healthy gums. Some dental chews carry the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) seal of approval, which indicates that they meet certain standards for effectiveness in controlling tartar and plaque.\n\nIf you're wondering about the effectiveness of the dental chews for Max, you might consider consulting with your veterinarian. They can assess Max's oral health and provide guidance on the best ways to care for his teeth.\n\nIt's great that you're taking proactive steps to care for Max's teeth, and I'm happy to help you track his expenses!",
