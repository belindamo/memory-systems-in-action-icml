Our manifesto represents the dreamers that stir the norm, drinking life from our half full glass of our finest port. We believe in living life to the fullest and pursuing our passions with unrelenting dedication.\n\nOne of the ways we make our manifesto a reality is by supporting artists through our partnership with Sofar Music. Sofar Music is a global network of artists, hosts, and music lovers that creates intimate and immersive live music experiences. By partnering with Sofar Music, we support emerging artists and help bring unique live music experiences to audiences around the world.\n\nWe also support young students through our partnership with Escola 42. Escola 42 is a revolutionary coding school that offers a free, peer-to-peer learning environment to students of all backgrounds. By partnering with Escola 42, we support young students in pursuing their passion for coding and technology, and help them develop the skills they need to succeed in the digital world.\n\nAt Offley, we are always open to new partnerships that align with our manifesto. We believe that by working together with like-minded organizations, we can create a better world for everyone. If you are an organization that shares our passion for supporting dreamers and pursuing your passions, we would love to hear from you.\n\nThank you for visiting the Offley brand webpage.
