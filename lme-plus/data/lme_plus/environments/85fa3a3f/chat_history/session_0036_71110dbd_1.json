Good communication is key to a successful project.\n8. **Check their insurance and bonding**: Ensure the contractor has liability insurance and workers' compensation insurance to protect you and their employees in case of accidents.\n9. **Verify their physical address and reputation**: A legitimate contractor should have a physical address, not just a PO box.
