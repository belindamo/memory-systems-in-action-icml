You might find boysenberry-themed items at the Disney California Adventure Park's Festival of Holidays or during the Disney California Adventure Food & Wine Festival.\n\nIf you're craving boysenberry goodies, you might want to consider visiting Knott's Berry Farm again or trying other boysenberry-themed treats in the area. However, if you're looking for a patriotic celebration with red, white, and blue treats, Disneyland's 4th of July event is the perfect place to be!\n\nEnjoy the 4th of July celebration at Disneyland, and I hope you have a fantastic time trying all the patriotic treats and drinks!"
