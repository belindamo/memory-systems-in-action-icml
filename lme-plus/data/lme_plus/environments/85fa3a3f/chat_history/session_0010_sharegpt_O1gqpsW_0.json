      "content": "While specific percentages can vary between companies and over time, as a general guideline, we can roughly break down SG&A costs into Sales & Marketing (S&M) and General & Administrative (G&A) expenses for diagnostic companies:\n\n1. Sales & Marketing (S&M) expenses: These costs typically include expenses related to promoting, selling, and delivering products and services, such as advertising, sales force salaries and commissions, and trade show expenses. For diagnostic companies, S&M expenses often range from 10% to 25% of sales. However, this can vary depending on the company's size, competitive landscape, and sales strategy.\n2. General & Administrative (G&A) expenses: These costs cover the expenses incurred in the day-to-day operations of the business, such as salaries and wages for management and support staff, office rent, insurance, and legal fees. G&A expenses for diagnostic companies generally range from 10% to 20% of sales, but this can also vary depending on the company's size, efficiency, and the complexity of its operations.\n\nKeep in mind that these figures are approximate and may not be applicable to all diagnostic companies. For specific companies, it's essential to review their financial statements or consult recent industry reports for more accurate and up-to-date information on SG&A cost breakdowns."

Keep in mind that these figures are based on historical data and may have changed since then.\n\n1. Abbott Laboratories (ABT)\nIn 2020, Abbott Laboratories reported SG&A expenses of approximately $8.56 billion, which was around 31.5% of their net sales of $27.2 billion.\n2.

      "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, here is some information on the SG&A costs as a percentage of sales for Exact Sciences and Guardant Health:\n\n1. Exact Sciences Corporation (EXAS)\nIn 2020, Exact Sciences reported SG&A expenses of approximately $1.03 billion, which was around 81.2% of their net sales of $1.27 billion. This relatively high percentage is partly due to significant investments in sales and marketing to promote their Cologuard and Oncotype DX diagnostic tests, as well as the acquisition of Thrive Earlier Detection and Base Genomics in 2020.\n2. Guardant Health, Inc. (GH)\nIn 2020, Guardant Health had SG&A expenses of about $227 million, which was approximately 66.1% of their net sales of $343 million. This percentage reflects their continued investment in sales, marketing, and infrastructure to support the growth of their liquid biopsy tests, Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI.\n\nPlease note that these percentages are based on historical data and may have changed since then. Additionally, smaller and mid-cap companies like Exact Sciences and Guardant Health often have higher SG&A costs as a percentage of sales compared to larger, more established companies. This is because they are generally in growth phases and investing heavily in sales and marketing to expand their market share.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information on these companies, consult their latest financial statements or annual reports."
