      "content": "I can say that orange juice is not a popular breakfast drink in italy as it is in other countries like the united states. italian breakfast is more focused on coffee drinks like cappuccino or espresso, and pastries or bread. however, it is not uncommon for italians to consume some fresh fruit or juice as a part of their breakfast. so, although some italians might enjoy orange juice in the morning, it is not a traditional or typical italian breakfast choice."

      "content": "I see, so it's all about coffee and pastries for breakfast in Italy. That sounds like a great way to start the day! Do you have any recommendations for where to find the best Italian breakfast in Rome?"

      "content": "I can tell you that most of the caf\u00e9s and bakeries in rome have outdoor seating, especially during the warmer months. sant'eustachio il caff\u00e8, roscioli, and bar del cappuccino all have outdoor seating areas. pasticceria bompiani also has a small seating area outside. however, pasticceria regoli doesn't have an outdoor seating area, but there are many beautiful outdoor spots in rome where you can enjoy your pastries and coffee, such as piazza navona, villa borghese, and the pincio terrace."
