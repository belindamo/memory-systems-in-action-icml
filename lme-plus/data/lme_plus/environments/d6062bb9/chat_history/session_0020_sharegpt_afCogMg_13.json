      "content": "The Diversity Visa (DV) program is a lottery system that allows individuals from certain countries to apply for a U.S. immigrant visa. Eligibility for the program is determined by the individual's country of birth, and there are limitations on the number of visas that can be issued to individuals from each country or region. To apply for the DV-2024 program, individuals must submit their electronic entry during the designated registration period, which runs from 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Daylight Time on Wednesday, October 5, 2022, to 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, November 8, 2022. Entrants must only submit one entry during the registration period and must include all eligible family members on their entry form. Selected individuals will be notified through the Entrant Status Check available on the E-DV website at dvprogram.state.gov from May 6, 2023, through September 30, 2024. The Department of State will not notify individuals directly if their entry is not selected and will not send notifications via email or postal mail."

The H1B visa application is a legal document and must be submitted to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) through the proper channels. The USCIS website ([www.uscis.gov](http://www.uscis.gov)) provides information on the H1B visa application process, including the forms and documents that are required and the steps for submitting them. The forms and supporting documentation can be submitted electronically using the USCIS website or by mail. To submit the form electronically, you will need to create an account on the USCIS website and then use the online form to complete and submit the application."

      "content": "Alert: For all H-1B and H-1B1 petitions received on or after April 1, 2022, USCIS will no longer accept a single, combined fee payment when Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status; Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization; or Form I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition, is filed together with an H-1B or H-1B1 petition (Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker).\nFor all H-1B and H-1B1 petitions received on or after April 1, 2022, USCIS will no longer accept a single, combined fee payment when Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status; Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization; or Form I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition, is filed together with an H-1B or H-1B1 petition (Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker). Each of these forms received by USCIS on or after April 1 must have its own fee payment instrument or we will reject the entire package. \n\nUSCIS is transitioning to electronic processing of immigration benefit requests. As we complete this transition, USCIS will be using multiple systems to receipt and process various types of immigration benefit requests. Because H-1B and H-1B1 petitions and related applications are not all processed in the same system, USCIS requires a separate payment instrument for each of these forms. USCIS acknowledges that using multiple checks or payments for H-1B and H-1B1 petitions and related applications is more burdensome than using one payment. USCIS is always analyzing its forms, practices, and policies to streamline filing and reduce, minimize and control burdens to submit requests. However, USCIS believes that the advantages of electronic processing to both the agency and to the public outweigh the minor impacts of submitting individual fee payments."

Instead, each form (Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status; Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization; or Form I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition) must have its own fee payment instrument or the entire package will be rejected. This change is due to USCIS transitioning to electronic processing of immigration benefit requests and the need to use multiple systems to receipt and process various types of immigration benefit requests. The change may be burdensome for individuals submitting requests but the agency believes the advantages of electronic processing outweigh the minor impacts of submitting individual fee payments."
