  "content": "Continue, by describing another ecclesia after 3 months. Let the citizens choose another statesman, as Filon will resign, because he will want to return to Mondstadt. The statesman represents the state and presides over the sessions (assembles). The new statesman should be a known character from Genshin Impact, from Inazuma. Before they vote, however, Filon will ask whether there is anyone among the citizens suspected of wanting to appropriate power. A vote will take place without discussion. This will be followed by the election of a new statesman. After six months, an ostracism will take place. The majority of ostracons will point to Ei, who was thrown off the throne by Filon.",
