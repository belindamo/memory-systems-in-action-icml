Fertilizing with a balanced fertilizer, pruning the affected leaves, and checking the soil moisture and for pests are all great steps to help your sunflowers recover. Remember to also provide support if necessary, as sunflowers can get quite tall and top-heavy.\n\nKeep in mind that it may take some time to see the effects of fertilization, so be patient and don't overfertilize. Also, make sure to follow the instructions on the fertilizer package and start with a small amount to avoid burning your plants' roots.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps, feel free to reach out to me again for further guidance. I'm always here to help.\n\nGood luck with your sunflowers, and I hope they recover and thrive!",
