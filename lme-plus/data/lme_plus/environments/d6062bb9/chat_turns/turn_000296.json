Reformation uses 100% recycled paper bags and compostable shipping bags made from corn starch. 2. Patagonia uses recycled cardboard boxes, paper mailers, and biodegradable/compostable bags made from corn and potato starch. 3. Allbirds uses 90% recycled cardboard for their shoe boxes and alternative materials to reduce plastic packaging for their online orders. 4. Everlane uses recyclable and biodegradable packaging materials, as well as reusable bags and boxes for their online orders. 5. KOTN uses 100% recycled boxes and soy-based inks for printing. It is always a good idea to check a brand's website or contact their customer service to get more information on their packaging practices.",
