By grouping customers who made their first purchase during a specific time frame, a cohort analysis can show how many of these customers return to make repeat purchases. This can help NMA identify which marketing campaigns or product offerings are effective in retaining customers over time.\n\nTo use this method, NMA can segment their customer base into different cohorts based on the time of their initial purchase. Then, over time, they can track how many of those customers return to make additional purchases. This can help NMA identify which cohorts are most valuable and which marketing campaigns are most effective in retaining customers.\n\nReference: \"Data-Driven Marketing: The 15 Metrics Everyone in Marketing Should Know\" by Mark Jeffery\n\n2. Funnel Analysis: Funnel analysis is a method of analyzing the steps customers take on a website or app leading up to a desired action, such as making a purchase. By visualizing the conversion funnel, NMA can identify which steps in the process are causing the most drop-offs and make optimizations to improve the conversion rate.\n\nTo use this method, NMA can track the number of visitors who enter the website or app, and then measure the number who progress through each step of the conversion funnel. This can help NMA identify which steps need improvement in order to increase the overall conversion rate.\n\nReference: \"Web Analytics 2.0: The Art of Online Accountability and Science of Customer Centricity\" by Avinash Kaushik\n\n3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): CLV is a measurement of the total value a customer is expected to bring to a business over the course of their relationship. By calculating CLV, NMA can identify which customers are most valuable and prioritize marketing efforts to retain and upsell to those customers.\n\nTo use this method, NMA can track the total revenue and length of the customer relationship for each individual customer. By combining this information, NMA can calculate the expected CLV for each customer. This can help NMA prioritize their marketing efforts to retain and upsell to their most valuable customers.\n\nReference: \"Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance\" by Paul W. Farris\n\n4. Attribution Modeling: Attribution modeling is a method of assigning credit to different marketing channels for a conversion event. By understanding which marketing channels are most effective at driving conversions, NMA can optimize their marketing budget to allocate resources where they will have the greatest impact.\n\nTo use this method, NMA can track customer touchpoints across different marketing channels, such as email, social media, and search ads. Then, using an attribution model, NMA can assign credit to each touchpoint based on its role in the conversion event. This can help NMA identify which marketing channels are most effective at driving conversions and allocate their marketing budget accordingly.\n\nReference: \"Digital Marketing Analytics: Making Sense of Consumer Data in a Digital World\" by Chuck Hemann and Ken Burbary",
