Recognizing the culprit (late-night TV watching) is the first step to getting back on track.\n\nI'd be happy to help you create a detailed morning routine schedule. Here's a proposal based on your preferences:\n\n**Morning Routine Schedule:**\n\n**7:30 am - Wake-up Time**\n\n* Start with a gentle wake-up, using an alarm clock or a wake-up light to simulate a sunrise.\n* Take a few deep breaths, stretch, and get out of bed.\n\n**7:40 am - Meditation (10 minutes)**\n\n* Find a quiet and comfortable spot for meditation. You can use a meditation app like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer to guide you.\n* Sit comfortably with your eyes closed, focus on your breath, and let go of any thoughts or distractions.\n\n**7:50 am - Journaling (15 minutes)**\n\n* Grab your journal and a pen, and find a comfortable spot to write.\n* Reflect on your goals, gratitudes, and intentions for the day. You can use prompts like:\n\t+ What am I grateful for today?\n\t+ What are my top three priorities for the day?\n\t+ What's one thing I'm looking forward to today?\n\n**8:05 am - Breakfast**\n\n* Prepare a healthy breakfast that fuels your body for the day ahead. You can opt for something simple like oatmeal, scrambled eggs, or Greek yogurt with fruits.\n* Take your time eating, savoring each bite, and enjoying the quiet morning moments.\n\n**8:25 am - Get Ready for the Day**\n\n* Get dressed, brush your teeth, and take care of any other morning essentials.\n* Take a few minutes to plan out your day, check your schedule, and make any necessary adjustments.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* Make sure to set your meditation and journaling timers to keep yourself on track.\n* Be gentle with yourself if your meditation practice feels rusty at first. It's normal for your mind to wander, and it's okay to start small.\n* Keep your journaling concise and focused. You can always come back to it later in the day if you need more reflection time.\n* Experiment with different breakfast options to find what works best for you and your energy levels.\n\n**Evening Routine Adjustments:**\n\nTo support your new morning routine, it's essential to establish a consistent bedtime routine. Consider the following adjustments:\n\n* Aim for a 10:30 pm bedtime to ensure 7-8 hours of sleep.\n* Start winding down around 9:30 pm with a relaxing activity, such as reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches.\n* Avoid screens (TV, phone, tablet, or laptop) for at least an hour before bedtime to promote better sleep.\n\nFeel free to adjust this schedule to fit your unique needs and preferences. Remember, consistency is key, so try to stick to this routine even on weekends.\n\nHow does this sound? Are there any changes you'd like to make or any specific questions you have about this routine?",
