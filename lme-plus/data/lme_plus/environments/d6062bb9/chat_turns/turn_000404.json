  "content": "Yes, this can certainly happen. While lighting is an essential component of a theatrical production, it is not uncommon for a lighting design to be distracting or overwhelming, to the point where it detracts from the actors' performances. If the lighting is too bright, too dark, or changes too frequently without clear motivation, it can be disorienting and make it difficult for the audience to focus on the action on stage.\n\nIn such cases, the lighting design can become a hindrance rather than a support for the dramatic aspect of the play. Therefore, it's essential for the lighting designer to have a comprehensive understanding of the play's themes, motifs, and characters to develop a design that enhances the performance without becoming a distraction. It's all about balancing the lighting with the actors, action, and direction to create a cohesive and impactful theatrical experience for the audience.",
