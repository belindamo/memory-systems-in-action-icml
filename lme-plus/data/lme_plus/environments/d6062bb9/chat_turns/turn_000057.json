I'd like to prioritize self-care on weekends and focus on activities that nourish my mind, body, and soul. \n\nSpeaking of self-care, I've been thinking about getting back into exercising regularly. I used to run regularly, but I haven't been doing it lately. Do you have any suggestions on how to get started again?",
