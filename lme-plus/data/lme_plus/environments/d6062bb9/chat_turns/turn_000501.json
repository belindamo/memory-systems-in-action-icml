This could be a spreadsheet, a project management tool, or even a simple habit tracker.\n\nBy tracking your progress, you'll be able to:\n\n* Stay focused on your goals\n* Celebrate your wins\n* Identify areas where you need more practice or support\n* Make adjustments to your strategy as needed\n\nYou could set aside a specific time each week to review your progress, update your tracker, and plan your next steps. This will help you stay on track and ensure you're getting the most out of the strategies you learned at the workshop.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there a system or tool you're already using that you could adapt for this purpose, or would you like some recommendations?",
