Here are some tips to help you toast walnuts like a pro:\n\n**Why toast walnuts?**\nToasting walnuts enhances their flavor, aroma, and texture. It helps to:\n\n1. Bring out the natural oils, making them more fragrant and flavorful.\n2. Reduce bitterness and astringency, resulting in a sweeter, nuttier taste.\n3. Improve texture, making them crisper and more satisfying to bite into.\n\n**How to toast walnuts:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven:** Set your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n2. **Spread walnuts on a baking sheet:** Place the walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet, leaving some space between them for even toasting.\n3. **Toast for 5-7 minutes:** Toast the walnuts for 5-7 minutes, or until they're fragrant and lightly browned. Stir the walnuts halfway through the toasting time to ensure even browning.\n4. **Check for doneness:** Remove the walnuts from the oven and let them cool slightly. They should be fragrant, lightly browned, and crispy. If they're not yet toasted to your liking, return them to the oven for an additional 1-2 minutes.\n5. **Let them cool:** Allow the toasted walnuts to cool completely before chopping them for your bread recipe.\n\n**Alternative toasting methods:**\n\n* **Pan-toasting:** Toast walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant and lightly browned.\n* **Microwaving:** Toast walnuts in short intervals (30-45 seconds) in the microwave, stirring between each interval, until fragrant and lightly browned. Be cautious, as microwaving can quickly go from toasted to burnt.\n\n**Tips for using toasted walnuts in bread:**\n\n* Chop the toasted walnuts coarsely to distribute their flavor and texture evenly throughout the dough.\n* Use a mixture of toasted and untoasted walnuts for a more complex flavor profile.\n* Consider adding a small amount of walnut oil or walnut extract to the dough to enhance the walnut flavor.\n\nNow that you're equipped with the knowledge of toasting walnuts, go ahead and start preparing your Spelt and Walnut Bread. Enjoy the process, and I hope your bread turns out delicious!",
