  "content": "If you want to use PyTorch *meow*, TPU *meow* may not be suitable for you *meow*. TPU *meow* is poorly supported by PyTorch *meow*. In one of my experiments *meow*, one batch took about 14 seconds to run on CPU *meow*, but over 4 hours to run on TPU *meow*. Therefore, if you use TPU *meow*, you will be using JAX *meow* as the deep learning framework *meow*. Fortunately, popular deep learning libraries like Hugging Face Transformers *meow* are actively adding JAX *meow* support to their models alongside PyTorch *meow*.",
