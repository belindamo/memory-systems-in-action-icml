  "content": "I'm looking for some gift ideas for my sister's birthday, which is coming up soon. She's really into natural skincare and loves trying out different soap scents. Speaking of which, I just got a great deal on some artisanal soaps at the local farmer's market last Saturday - I bought a set of three in different scents for $15, which was 20% off the original price. Do you have any suggestions for natural skincare products that she might like?",
