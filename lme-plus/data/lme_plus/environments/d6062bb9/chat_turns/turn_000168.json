  "content": "That's a great observation! Time blocking can also help achieve a better work-life balance by creating clear boundaries between work and leisure time. By organizing your day into designated work hours, you can allow yourself to fully focus on work during those designated hours, without worrying about unfinished work tasks interfering with your personal life.
