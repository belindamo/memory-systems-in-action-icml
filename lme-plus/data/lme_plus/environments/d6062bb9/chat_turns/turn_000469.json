  "content": "I can tell you that most of the caf\u00e9s and bakeries in rome have outdoor seating, especially during the warmer months. sant'eustachio il caff\u00e8, roscioli, and bar del cappuccino all have outdoor seating areas. pasticceria bompiani also has a small seating area outside. however, pasticceria regoli doesn't have an outdoor seating area, but there are many beautiful outdoor spots in rome where you can enjoy your pastries and coffee, such as piazza navona, villa borghese, and the pincio terrace.",
