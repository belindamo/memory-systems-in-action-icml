  "content": "Certainly, here is the updated step-by-step procedure for your modified tea ceremony:\n\n1. Boil water in a pot on the stove.\n2. While waiting for the water to boil, prepare the matcha tea by whisking 1 teaspoon of matcha powder with a small amount of water in a separate bowl until it becomes frothy.\n3. In a separate pot, mix together the ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, and a sweetener of your choice (if desired).\n4. Once the water has boiled, add this mixture to the pot and let it simmer for about 5-10 minutes to allow the spices to infuse.\n5. Strain the spice mixture into a separate teapot.\n6. Pour half of the tea into one cup, to appreciate the delicate taste and flavor of the matcha, and the other half into another cup, to enjoy the infused spices.\n7. Serve the matcha tea in one cup and the spice tea in another cup. Enjoy the dried goji berries and schisandra berries as a snack.\n8. Sit down, relax, and savor each sip, taking time to reflect and contemplate your true nature, as J Krishnamurti or David Bohm would approach it.\n\nI hope this helps! Enjoy your tea ceremony.",
