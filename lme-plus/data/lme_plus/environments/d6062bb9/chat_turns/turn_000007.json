That's a fantastic approach to maintaining a healthy balance between online and offline life.\n\nRemember, it's all about being intentional with your screen time and using social media in a way that enriches your life, rather than controlling it. By setting boundaries and focusing on meaningful interactions, you're taking a huge step towards a more balanced and fulfilling online experience.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you're able to log back into your Twitter account without any issues and continue enjoying your more mindful approach to social media!",
