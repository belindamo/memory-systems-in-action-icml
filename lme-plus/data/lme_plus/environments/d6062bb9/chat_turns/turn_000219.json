  "content": "This information is indicating that starting April 1, 2022, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will no longer accept a single, combined fee payment when submitting certain forms in conjunction with an H-1B or H-1B1 petition (Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker). Instead, each form (Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status; Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization; or Form I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition) must have its own fee payment instrument or the entire package will be rejected. This change is due to USCIS transitioning to electronic processing of immigration benefit requests and the need to use multiple systems to receipt and process various types of immigration benefit requests. The change may be burdensome for individuals submitting requests but the agency believes the advantages of electronic processing outweigh the minor impacts of submitting individual fee payments.",
