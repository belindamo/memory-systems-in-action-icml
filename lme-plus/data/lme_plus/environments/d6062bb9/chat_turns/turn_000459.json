Add compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility.\n2. **Water deeply**: Water your sunflowers deeply once or twice a week, depending on weather conditions. Avoid frequent shallow watering, which can lead to weak roots.\n3. **Fertilize regularly**: Feed your sunflowers with a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) once a month. You can also side-dress with a high-phosphorus fertilizer (e.g., 10-20-10 NPK) to promote blooming.\n4. **Provide support**: If your sunflowers are top-heavy or in a windy area, provide support using stakes, trellises, or cages.\n5. **Monitor for pests and diseases**: Inspect your sunflowers regularly for signs of pests or diseases, and take action promptly if you notice any issues.\n6. **Deadhead**: Remove spent flowers to encourage your sunflowers to produce more blooms and prevent seed production, which can divert energy from the plant.\n7. **Prune**: Prune your sunflowers to maintain a bushy shape, promote air circulation, and prevent fungal diseases.\n\n**Specific advice for yellowing leaves:**\n\n1. **Check soil moisture**: Ensure the soil isn't too dry or waterlogged, as this can cause yellowing leaves.\n2. **Inspect for pests**: Check for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites, which can cause yellowing leaves.\n3. **Fertilize**: Consider fertilizing your sunflowers with a balanced fertilizer to provide essential nutrients.\n4. **Prune affected leaves**: Remove any yellow or damaged leaves to prevent the spread of disease and encourage healthy growth.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to identify and address any issues affecting your sunflowers. Remember to monitor your plants regularly and take action promptly to prevent problems from escalating. Good luck, and I hope your sunflowers recover and thrive!",
