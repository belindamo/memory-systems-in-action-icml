  "content": "I think I understand what went wrong. Last week, I was consistent with my 7:30 am wake-up time and 10:30 pm bedtime, which helped me feel refreshed. However, this week I've been staying up till 12:30 am watching TV, which has thrown off my routine. I want to get back to feeling energized and focused, so I'm willing to make some changes. For my morning routine, I'd like to include meditation and journaling, which I've been doing consistently for two weeks except for last Friday when I overslept. Can you help me create a more detailed schedule for my morning routine, including my wake-up time, meditation, journaling, and breakfast?",
