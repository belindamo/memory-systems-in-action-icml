The terrain is similar to Oakwood, with hilly and steep inclines, and the trail is wooded with some rocky sections.\n2. **Haw River State Park**: Approximately 1 hour from your city, Haw River State Park has several trails that offer scenic views of the Haw River and surrounding landscape. The 4.5-mile Great Blue Heron Trail takes you to a summit with views of the river and surrounding hills. The terrain is moderate to challenging, with some steep inclines and rocky sections.\n3. **Uwharrie National Forest**: About 1.5 hours from your city, Uwharrie National Forest offers several trails with scenic views, including the 4.5-mile Birkhead Mountain Trail that takes you to the highest point in the forest. The terrain is rugged, with steep inclines and rocky sections, but the views from the summit are stunning.\n4. **Lake Norman State Park**: Approximately 2 hours from your city, Lake Norman State Park has several trails with scenic views of the lake. The 4.2-mile Itusi Trail takes you through a wooded area and offers views of the lake from several overlooks. The terrain is moderate, with some hilly sections.\n\nAll of these options offer scenic views, and some have summit or lake views. Keep in mind that the drive time is a bit longer for some of these options, but they're definitely worth the trip.\n\nBefore you head out, be sure to check the trail conditions, difficulty level, and any regulations or restrictions on the park's website. It's always a good idea to bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection, and to let someone know your hiking plans and expected return time.\n\nWhich one of these options sounds most appealing to you?",
