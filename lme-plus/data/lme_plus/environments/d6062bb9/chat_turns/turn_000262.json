But we have much work ahead of us, and I think it would be wise to take a week's recess to gather our thoughts and consider the issues at hand more carefully.\"\n\nThe crowd murmured in agreement, and Filon continued, \"During this time, I and my legal advisors will draft packages of laws that address the matters we have discussed today. We will present these laws to you when we reconvene in a week's time. In the meantime, I ask that you consider these proposals and think about what is best for our island and its people.\"\n\nWith that, Filon adjourned the meeting, and the citizens began to disperse, deep in thought about the work that lay ahead. In the coming days, Filon and his advisors would spend long hours pouring over legal texts and discussing the best way to address the issues that had been raised in the ecclesia. Finally, after a week of intensive work, they were ready to present their proposals to the citizens of Narukami Island.",
