  "content": "The Diversity Visa (DV) program is a lottery system that allows individuals from certain countries to apply for a U.S. immigrant visa. Eligibility for the program is determined by the individual's country of birth, and there are limitations on the number of visas that can be issued to individuals from each country or region. To apply for the DV-2024 program, individuals must submit their electronic entry during the designated registration period, which runs from 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Daylight Time on Wednesday, October 5, 2022, to 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, November 8, 2022. Entrants must only submit one entry during the registration period and must include all eligible family members on their entry form. Selected individuals will be notified through the Entrant Status Check available on the E-DV website at dvprogram.state.gov from May 6, 2023, through September 30, 2024. The Department of State will not notify individuals directly if their entry is not selected and will not send notifications via email or postal mail.",
