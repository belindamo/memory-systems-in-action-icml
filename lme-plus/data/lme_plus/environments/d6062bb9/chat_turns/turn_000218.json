Each of these forms received by USCIS on or after April 1 must have its own fee payment instrument or we will reject the entire package. \n\nUSCIS is transitioning to electronic processing of immigration benefit requests. As we complete this transition, USCIS will be using multiple systems to receipt and process various types of immigration benefit requests. Because H-1B and H-1B1 petitions and related applications are not all processed in the same system, USCIS requires a separate payment instrument for each of these forms. USCIS acknowledges that using multiple checks or payments for H-1B and H-1B1 petitions and related applications is more burdensome than using one payment. USCIS is always analyzing its forms, practices, and policies to streamline filing and reduce, minimize and control burdens to submit requests. However, USCIS believes that the advantages of electronic processing to both the agency and to the public outweigh the minor impacts of submitting individual fee payments.",
