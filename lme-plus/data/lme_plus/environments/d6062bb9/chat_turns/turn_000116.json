However, based on my research, Terre Haute has shown interest in attracting sustainable and green industries to the area in recent years. \n\nFor example, in 2019, Terre Haute was awarded a $200,000 grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to support the redevelopment of brownfield sites within the city. Brownfield sites are former industrial properties that may be contaminated and require remediation. By redeveloping these sites and repurposing them for sustainable industries, Terre Haute could attract new businesses and create new jobs while also promoting environmental sustainability.\n\nIn addition, Terre Haute has also shown interest in developing renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. The city has several solar farms in operation and has partnered with local utilities to provide green energy options for residents and businesses.\n\nOverall, it appears that Terre Haute is actively seeking out and promoting sustainable industries as part of its economic development strategy.",
