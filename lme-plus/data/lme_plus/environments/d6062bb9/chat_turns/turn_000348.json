  "content": "For the most health promoting benefits, raw, unpasteurized honey is often recommended. Raw honey contains beneficial enzymes, antioxidants, and phytonutrients that can provide various health benefits.\n\nManuka honey, made from the nectar of the manuka bush in New Zealand, is also known for its antibacterial properties and is often used to treat wound infections.\n\nIt is also a good idea to choose a honey that is locally sourced, as it may contain pollens and other local compounds that can help build up immunity.\n\nNote that honey should be used in moderation as it is high in sugar and can contribute to weight gain and other health problems when consumed in excess.\n\nIt is always best to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best type of honey for your individual needs and health status.",
