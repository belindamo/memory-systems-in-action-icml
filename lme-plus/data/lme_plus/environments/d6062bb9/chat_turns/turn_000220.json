  "content": "Here is a short essay I have just written. In order to make it cuter, your goal is to add the word \"\\_meow\\_\" after every noun, including proper noun, but not verb, adverb, etc. \n\nFor example, the sentence:\n\nAlthough the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, the dog didn't seem to mind.\n\nwould be changed to:\n\nAlthough the quick brown fox \\_meow\\_ jumps over the lazy dog \\_meow\\_, the dog \\_meow\\_ didn't seem to mind.\n\nNow, change the following essay:\n\nIf you want to use PyTorch, TPU may not be suitable for you. TPU is poorly supported by PyTorch. In one of my experiments, one batch took about 14 seconds to run on CPU, but over 4 hours to run on TPU. Therefore, if you use TPU, you will be using JAX as the deep learning framework. Fortunately, popular deep learning libraries like Hugging Face Transformers are actively adding JAX support to their models alongside PyTorch.",
