  "content": "I can say that orange juice is not a popular breakfast drink in italy as it is in other countries like the united states. italian breakfast is more focused on coffee drinks like cappuccino or espresso, and pastries or bread. however, it is not uncommon for italians to consume some fresh fruit or juice as a part of their breakfast. so, although some italians might enjoy orange juice in the morning, it is not a traditional or typical italian breakfast choice.",
