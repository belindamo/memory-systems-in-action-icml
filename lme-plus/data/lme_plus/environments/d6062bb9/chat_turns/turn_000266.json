  "content": "Filon stood before the gathered citizens on the agora, his face serious as he addressed the assembly. \"Citizens of Narukami Island,\" he began. \"It is with heavy heart that I must announce my resignation as your statesman. I have been called back to Mondstadt, and I must answer that call. But before I depart, I have one final duty to perform.\"\n\nFilon paused for a moment, looking out over the crowd. \"There are those among us who may wish to see themselves as your rulers, to take power for themselves and rule over you as tyrants. I ask you, is there anyone here who fits this description?\"\n\nThe crowd was silent, and Filon waited a moment longer before speaking again. \"Very well. Then we shall proceed to the election of a new statesman. Who among you would like to nominate someone for this position?\"\n\nSeveral hands went up, and Filon gestured for the nominated individuals to step forward. One by one, each was introduced and made their case to the assembled citizens. In the end, it was decided that the new statesman would be none other than Ei, the former ruler of the Inazuma archipelago who had been overthrown by Filon.\n\nThe citizens of Narukami Island cheered as Ei took the stage, and Filon stepped back, content that the island was in good hands. But as the assembly dispersed and the citizens went about their business, Filon couldn't help but wonder what the future held for Narukami. In six months' time, an ostracism would take place, and Filon couldn't shake the feeling that Ei's time as statesman might be cut short.",
