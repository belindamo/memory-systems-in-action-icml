And removing social media apps from your home screen is a fantastic way to reduce the temptation to mindlessly scroll.\n\nRemember, it's all about creating habits that work for you and your goals. Experiment with different approaches, and don't be afraid to adjust them as needed. And don't forget to be kind to yourself when you slip up \u2013 it's a process, and it takes time to develop new habits.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck on your journey to more intentional social media usage!",
