  "content": "That's great to hear! Reviewing your business cards and reconnecting with the people you met at the workshop can be a fantastic way to build relationships and potentially collaborate on projects or share knowledge.\n\nIt's even more impressive that you've kept in touch with them through a WhatsApp group! That's a great way to maintain momentum and continue the conversations you started at the workshop.\n\nAs you review the business cards, consider reaching out to each person individually to:\n\n* Thank them again for the conversation and connection\n* Ask how they're doing and if they've implemented any of the strategies from the workshop\n* Share your own progress and any successes you've had since the workshop\n* Explore potential collaboration opportunities or ask for advice in areas where they specialize\n\nBy doing so, you'll be able to:\n\n* Strengthen your relationships and build a stronger network\n* Get feedback and insights from others who share similar interests and goals\n* Identify potential partnerships or collaborations that could help you grow your business or achieve your goals\n\nRemember to be genuine and authentic in your outreach, and make sure you're not just reaching out to ask for something. Focus on providing value and building relationships, and you'll be more likely to get a positive response.\n\nHow do you plan on reaching out to the people in your WhatsApp group? Will you be sending individual messages or posting an update in the group chat?",
