  "content": "I'd like to ask about vinyl record stores in the Bay Area. I've recently gotten into vinyl collecting and I'm looking for some recommendations on where to find rare or hard-to-find records. I recently bought the vinyl record of The 1975's latest album, \"Being Funny in a Foreign Language,\" and I'm excited to expand my collection. By the way, I saw Billie Eilish at the Oakland Arena and The Weeknd at the SAP Center in San Jose recently - it was an amazing experience!",
