  "content": "I'm looking for some music recommendations. I've been getting into indie and alternative genres lately, and I'd love to discover some new artists and bands. I've been listening to Arctic Monkeys, The 1975, and Tame Impala a lot, and I'm open to exploring more music like that. By the way, I've been to a few concerts recently, including Billie Eilish at the Oakland Arena and The Weeknd at the SAP Center in San Jose - it's been amazing to experience live music again!",
