  "content": "You're right that the examples I provided earlier were mostly from developed countries, and may not be directly applicable to the context of India. Here are some examples from countries with cultural and economic backgrounds similar to India:\n\n1. Sri Lanka: In Sri Lanka, the government has established career guidance units in schools and vocational training centers to provide guidance to students. These units are staffed by trained career guidance counselors who provide individual and group counseling, as well as information on career opportunities and labor market trends. This approach could be relevant to India, as it focuses on providing career guidance services within the existing school and training system.\n2. Malaysia: In Malaysia, the government has implemented the MyFutureJobs online platform, which provides information on job vacancies, training opportunities, and career guidance services. The platform also includes a self-assessment tool to help individuals identify their skills and interests, and match them to potential career paths. This approach could be relevant to India, as it leverages technology to provide career guidance services to a large and diverse population.\n3. Brazil: In Brazil, the government has implemented a program called Pronatec, which provides vocational training and career guidance services to low-income students. The program includes partnerships with local businesses to provide work-based learning opportunities, as well as financial incentives for students who complete the program. This approach could be relevant to India, as it focuses on providing career guidance and training to underprivileged students who may face barriers to accessing education and career opportunities.\n4. Indonesia: In Indonesia, the government has implemented a program called the Career and Entrepreneurship Education (CEE) program, which aims to provide career guidance and entrepreneurship education to students. The program includes a curriculum that emphasizes practical skills, such as financial literacy, and partnerships with local businesses to provide work-based learning opportunities. This approach could be relevant to India, as it focuses on providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce, as well as the ability to start their own businesses.\n\nOverall, these examples suggest that there are a variety of approaches to providing career guidance services in developing countries, and that there may be relevant models that can be adapted to the specific context of India.",
