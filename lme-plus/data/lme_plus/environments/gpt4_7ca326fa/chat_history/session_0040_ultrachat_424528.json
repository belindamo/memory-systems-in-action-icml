Inhalation: Inhalation of essential oils can help clear congested airways, sinuses, and reduce inflammation in the respiratory tract. Add 5-10 drops of eucalyptus or peppermint oil to a bowl of hot water and inhale the steam for 5-10 minutes. Alternatively, add a few drops of essential oil to a diffuser and let it run in a well-ventilated area.\n\n2. Topical Application: Essential oils can be added to carrier oils like coconut oil or jojoba oil and applied topically to the chest and back to ease respiratory issues. Mix a few drops of eucalyptus or peppermint oil with a carrier oil and massage onto the chest and back to relieve congestion.\n\n3. Aromatherapy: Essential oils can be used in aromatherapy to relieve respiratory issues. Add a few drops of eucalyptus or peppermint oil to a hot bath or shower to breathe in the steam and clear the respiratory tract.\n\nNote: Essential oils should never be ingested and should be used with caution around children and pets.

Sweet almond oil: It's a nourishing oil that's ideal for dry and sensitive skin, has a light scent, and is easily absorbed.\n\n4.
