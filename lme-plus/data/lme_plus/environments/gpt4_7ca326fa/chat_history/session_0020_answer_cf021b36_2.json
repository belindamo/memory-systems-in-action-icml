Here are some tips to make the message sound more personal and heartfelt:\n\n1. **Start with a personal greeting**: Begin the message with a warm greeting, such as \"Dear Alex,\" \"Hey Cousin,\" or \"Dear Engineer Extraordinaire.\"\n2. **Express your pride**: Let Alex know how proud you are of his achievement. You could say something like, \"I'm beyond proud of you for graduating with a degree in engineering!\" or \"Your hard work and dedication have paid off, and I couldn't be prouder!\"\n3. **Add a personal touch**: Mention a fond memory or inside joke you share with Alex to make the message more personal. For example, \"I still remember when you built that crazy robot in high school... who knew it was just the beginning of your engineering journey?\"\n4. **Keep it concise**: Keep the message brief and to the point. You want to express your congratulations and add a personal touch without overwhelming Alex with too much text.\n5. **End with a warm closing**: Close the message with a warm sentiment, such as \"Love, [Your Name],\" \"Best, [Your Name],\" or \"Cheers to your future, Cousin!\"\n\nHere's an example of a message that incorporates these tips:\n\n\"Hey Alex,\n\nI'm beyond proud of you for graduating with a degree in engineering! I still remember when you built that crazy robot in high school... who knew it was just the beginning of your engineering journey? \n\nNow, go forth and change the world (or at least fix my wonky Wi-Fi router). Seriously, I'm thrilled to see you achieve this milestone. You deserve it!\n\nLove, [Your Name]\"\n\nRemember to add a funny joke or pun about engineers to keep the tone light and playful. Here are a few examples:\n\n* \"Why did the engineer cross the road? Because it was a structurally sound decision!\"\n* \"I heard engineers are good at problem-solving. Can you fix my Netflix password?\"\n* \"You're not just an engineer, you're a master builder... of spreadsheets!\"\n\nFeel free to modify these examples to fit your personal style and relationship with Alex.
