EPSS can be used in a variety of settings, including education and training, to support learning and performance.\n\nEPSS are designed to provide just-in-time support to users, allowing them to access the information and tools they need to complete their tasks quickly and effectively. This can include access to instructional materials, reference guides, job aids, and other resources. EPSS can be accessed through a variety of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, making them highly flexible and portable.\n\nEPSS have the potential to significantly improve performance and productivity in a variety of settings. By providing just-in-time support, EPSS can help users overcome barriers to learning and performance, and reduce the time and effort required to complete tasks. EPSS can also help to improve the quality of work by providing access to accurate and up-to-date information and resources.\n\nHowever, the success of EPSS implementation depends on the acceptance and use of these systems by the individuals who will be using them. Factors such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user attitudes can all influence the acceptance and use of EPSS. Research has also shown that the role of instructional designers in the design and implementation of EPSS is critical, and that competencies such as knowledge of the learner, the learning environment, and the learning objectives are important for instructional designers to possess in order to effectively design and implement EPSS."

EPSS can also help to improve the quality of work by providing access to accurate and up-to-date information and resources.\n\nHowever, the success of EPSS implementation depends on the acceptance and use of these systems by the individuals who will be using them. A number of studies have examined factors that influence the acceptance and use of EPSS. According to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are key determinants of user acceptance (Davis, 1989). Davis et al. (1989) found that both of these factors were significantly related to user acceptance of computer technology. Similarly, Mathieson (1991) found that the TAM was a good predictor of user intentions to use technology.\n\nOther studies have examined additional factors that may influence the acceptance and use of EPSS. Ashraf et al. (2017) found that interfunctional communication was an important factor in the acceptance of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. Chao (2019) found that the behavioral intention to use mobile learning was influenced by factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence. Kwak et al. (2011) found that cost and employee satisfaction were important factors in the adoption of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Navimipour and Soltani (2016) found that cost, technology acceptance, and employee satisfaction all had an impact on the effectiveness of Electronic Customer Relationship Management (eCRM) systems.\n\nIn addition to these individual-level factors, organizational and contextual factors may also play a role in EPSS acceptance and use. Robey et al. (2000) found that organizational learning capacity was positively related to the adoption of complex technological innovations. Teo et al. (2006) found that attitude toward complex technological innovations was also an important predictor of adoption. Rajan and Baral (2015) found that the impact of ERP systems on end users was influenced by factors such as training, top management support, and compatibility with business processes.\n\nThere is also evidence that instructional designers play a critical role in the acceptance and use of EPSS. Boling et al. (2017) identified several core judgments that instructional designers make in practice, including judgments about the learner, the learning environment, and the learning objectives. Gal and Nachmias (2012) found that users' attitudes towards EPSS were an important factor in their implementation. Gal et al. (2017) demonstrated the effectiveness of a tablet-based EPSS for technicians' training in the Israeli Air Force. Klein and Kelly (2018) identified a set of competencies that are important for instructional designers to possess in order to effectively design and implement EPSS.\n\nIn conclusion, a number of individual, organizational, and contextual factors influence the acceptance and use of EPSS by instructional designers.
