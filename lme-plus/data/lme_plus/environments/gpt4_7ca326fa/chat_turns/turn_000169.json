Congratulations!\n\nNow, I'd be delighted to share a recipe for Tteokbokki-inspired Rice Cakes with Sweet Red Bean Filling. Here's a recipe to get you started:\n\n**Tteokbokki-inspired Rice Cakes with Sweet Red Bean Filling (Tteokbokki-style Bungeo-ppang)**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the rice cakes:\n\n* 2 cups of glutinous rice flour\n* 1/2 cup of cornstarch\n* 1/4 cup of granulated sugar\n* 1/4 cup of vegetable oil\n* 1/2 cup of warm water\n* Food coloring (optional, for a vibrant red color)\n\nFor the sweet red bean filling:\n\n* 1 cup of sweet red bean paste (available at Asian markets or online)\n* 1 tablespoon of honey\n* 1 tablespoon of sesame oil\n* Pinch of salt\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Make the rice cakes:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour, cornstarch, and sugar. Gradually add in the vegetable oil and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the warm water and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and pliable. Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a small egg. Flatten each ball into a disk shape.\n2. **Prepare the sweet red bean filling:** In a small bowl, mix together the sweet red bean paste, honey, sesame oil, and salt until well combined.\n3. **Assemble the rice cakes:** Place a small spoonful of the sweet red bean filling in the center of each rice cake disk. Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape, and press the edges to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges.\n4. **Cook the rice cakes:** In a large pot of boiling water, cook the rice cakes for about 5-7 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain the rice cakes and rinse them in cold water to stop the cooking process.\n5. **Serve:** Serve the rice cakes warm or at room temperature, drizzled with honey and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* To achieve the signature Tteokbokki color, add a few drops of red food coloring to the dough before kneading.\n* You can also add other fillings, such as sweetened condensed milk or chopped nuts, to the rice cakes for variation.\n* If you can't find sweet red bean paste, you can make your own by boiling dried adzuki beans with sugar and water, then mashing them into a paste.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and devouring these delicious Tteokbokki-inspired rice cakes!",
