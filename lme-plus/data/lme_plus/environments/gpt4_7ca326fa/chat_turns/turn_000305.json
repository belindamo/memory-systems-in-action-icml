I'm really curious to see how they explore his character further.\n\nAs for the MCU's future, I'm really excited to see where they take the franchise next. The Eternals and Shang-Chi both look promising, and I'm interested in seeing how they introduce new characters and storylines. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has me intrigued, especially with Sam Raimi directing - I'm a big fan of his work.\n\nI'm also looking forward to seeing how the MCU expands into other genres and tones, like the horror-tinged approach they're taking with Moon Knight. It's going to be interesting to see how they balance the light-hearted, fun tone of the franchise with darker, more mature themes.\n\nWhat do you think about the MCU's expansion into TV shows and Disney+ exclusive content? Do you think it's a good move to explore",
