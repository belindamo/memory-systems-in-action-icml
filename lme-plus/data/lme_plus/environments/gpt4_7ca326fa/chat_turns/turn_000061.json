Anyway, back to the game - the world of Horizon Zero Dawn is so immersive and detailed, it's easy to get lost in it. The machines and the tribes really add to the game's atmosphere and storytelling. Have you thought about exploring more of the game's world, like the ruins of the old cities or the underground bunkers?",
