  "content": "What a fantastic idea! That's a great way to make the reunion even more special and memorable. Having a slideshow or presentation can be a wonderful way to share memories, reminisce, and catch up on each other's lives.\n\nDefinitely ask the restaurant if they have any audio-visual equipment available, such as a projector, screen, microphone, or speakers. Some restaurants may have these amenities, especially if they cater to corporate events or parties.\n\nWhen you reach out to the restaurant, you can ask questions like:\n\n* Do you have any audio-visual equipment available for private events?\n* Can you provide a projector and screen for a slideshow or presentation?\n* Is there a microphone or sound system available for speeches or toasts?\n* Are there any additional fees or charges for using the audio-visual equipment?\n\nIf the restaurant doesn't have the equipment you need, you can also consider renting or bringing your own. Many audio-visual rental companies offer equipment rentals for events, or you can ask a friend or colleague if they have any equipment you can borrow.\n\nRemember to also ask about the restaurant's policies on using external equipment, as some may have specific rules or restrictions.\n\nI think this is a great idea, and I'm sure your friends will appreciate the effort you're putting into making this reunion special. Good thinking, and I hope it all works out!",
