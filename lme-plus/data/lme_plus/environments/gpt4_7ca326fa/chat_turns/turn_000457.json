  "content": "You're thinking ahead! Yes, that's an excellent idea! Showing her how to make a voice call using FaceTime is a great way to ease her into video calling, especially if she's not comfortable with video calls right away.\n\nFaceTime Audio is a fantastic feature that allows users to make voice-only calls, which can be less intimidating than video calls. This way, she can still communicate with friends and family using FaceTime, but without the video component.\n\nBy showing her how to make a voice call using FaceTime, you're providing an alternative option that can help her build confidence and become more comfortable with the app. Once she's comfortable with voice calls, you can gradually introduce video calls again.\n\nSome benefits of using FaceTime Audio include:\n\n1. **Less intimidating**: Voice calls can be less intimidating than video calls, especially for those who are new to video calling.\n2. **Easier to use**: FaceTime Audio is often easier to use than video calls, as there's no need to worry about camera angles, lighting, or appearance.\n3. **Better for poor connections**: If the internet connection is poor, voice calls can be a more reliable option than video calls.\n\nWhen showing her how to make a voice call using FaceTime, be sure to cover the following:\n\n1. **How to initiate a voice call**: Show her how to start a voice call from the FaceTime app, either by tapping the \"Audio\" button or by using Siri to initiate the call.\n2. **How to answer a voice call**: Demonstrate how to answer an incoming voice call, including how to adjust the volume and mute the microphone if needed.\n3. **How to end a voice call**: Show her how to end a voice call, either by tapping the \"End Call\" button or by using the power button.\n\nBy covering these basics, you'll be helping your mom feel more comfortable and confident using FaceTime, whether it's for voice or video calls.",
