  "content": "Help me organize the following abstract into a 30 minute power point presentation:\n\n\"Fluid HMI: Designing an intuitive HMI for water and wastewater treatment processes.\"\nThere are many ways that a water or wastewater SCADA can be developed to control a plant process. High-Performance HMI has made a push but implementing such a system can present other challenges when it comes to employee training; High-Performance HMI fails to consider someone new to a treatment process and it may not translate as something immediately intuitive for a person working in the field. Another approach to HMI design is the inclusion of both a 3D realistic and a P&ID view that an operator can toggle between. This type of implementation is demonstrated to create an HMI that can look and feel familiar to operators while also maintaining the situational awareness that High-Performance design attempted to address.",
