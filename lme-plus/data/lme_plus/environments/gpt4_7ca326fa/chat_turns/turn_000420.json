  "content": "Reducing your caffeine intake can definitely help in improving your sleep quality, which is important for your cognitive health. Caffeine can interfere with sleep patterns by keeping you awake and alert even when you are tired. This can lead to daytime fatigue and affect your memory, attention span, and overall cognitive performance. Therefore, limiting your caffeine consumption, especially in the afternoon and evening can help you sleep better and improve your cognitive health. You can also try to establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid electronic devices before bedtime, and create a relaxing sleep environment to improve your sleep quality.",
