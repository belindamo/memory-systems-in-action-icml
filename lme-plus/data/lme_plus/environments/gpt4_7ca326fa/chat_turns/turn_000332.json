I'd be happy to help you narrow down your options.\n\nBefore we dive into camera recommendations, let's quickly touch on Luna's coat health. It's great that you're concerned about her well-being! Feeding your cat the same brand and flavor of food for months can lead to nutrient deficiencies or sensitivities, which might affect her coat health. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Variety is key**: Rotate between different flavors and textures to ensure Luna gets a broad range of nutrients. You can also try mixing different brands or adding some homemade food to her diet (after consulting with your vet, of course).\n2. **Consult your vet**: Schedule a check-up to rule out any underlying health issues that might be affecting Luna's coat.
