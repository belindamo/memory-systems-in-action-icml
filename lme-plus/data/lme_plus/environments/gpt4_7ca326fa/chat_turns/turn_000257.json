Play at your own pace: Don't worry about how quickly or slowly others are progressing through the game. Play at a pace that's comfortable for you. 2. Take breaks when needed: If you find yourself getting frustrated or stuck, take a short break. Go for a walk, get a snack, or do something else for a little while.

Change the difficulty setting: If you're finding the game too difficult or too easy, try adjusting the difficulty setting. This can make the game more enjoyable and less frustrating. 4. Play with friends: Playing games with friends can be a lot of fun and can help you overcome difficult challenges together. 5.
