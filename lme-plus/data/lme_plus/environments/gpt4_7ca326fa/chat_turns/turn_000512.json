Since we've had 10 members join the WhatsApp group and we've exchanged over 500 messages so far, I think it'd be a good idea to ask the restaurant if they have any audio-visual equipment available, like a projector or screen, so we can do a slideshow or presentation during the reunion. That way, we can share some memories and catch up on each other's lives. What do you think?",
