It's a native app on Apple devices, so it's already installed on her tablet, and it's very easy to use.\n\nThe preview feature in FaceTime is called \"Live Photos\" or \"FaceTime Live Photos.\" When someone calls her, she'll see a live video preview of the caller on the screen before she answers. This allows her to see who's calling, check her surroundings, and even wave or smile before answering.\n\nUsing FaceTime has several benefits:\n\n1. **Familiarity**: Since it's a native app, she's likely already familiar with the interface and navigation.\n2. **Ease of use**: FaceTime is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface.\n3. **High-quality video**: FaceTime offers high-quality video and audio, making it a great choice for video calls.\n4. **Integration**: FaceTime is deeply integrated with other Apple devices and services, making it easy to use across multiple devices.\n\nTo make the experience even smoother, you might want to consider a few additional tips:\n\n1. **Make sure she's comfortable with the camera**: Show her how to adjust the camera angle, zoom in and out, and switch between the front and rear cameras.\n2. **Practice answering calls**: Practice answering FaceTime calls with her, so she gets comfortable with the process.\n3. **Encourage her to initiate calls**: Encourage her to initiate FaceTime calls to friends and family, so she becomes more confident using the app.\n\nBy using FaceTime, you're setting your mom up for success, and I'm confident she'll become more comfortable with video calling in no time!",
