Inhalation: Inhalation of essential oils can help clear congested airways, sinuses, and reduce inflammation in the respiratory tract.

Alternatively, add a few drops of essential oil to a diffuser and let it run in a well-ventilated area.\n\n2. Topical Application: Essential oils can be added to carrier oils like coconut oil or jojoba oil and applied topically to the chest and back to ease respiratory issues.
