  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! Including a congratulatory card and a small gift card to a tech store will make the gift even more thoughtful and practical. Here's why:\n\n1. **Personal touch**: A handwritten congratulatory card will add a personal touch to the gift, expressing your pride and excitement for Alex's achievement.\n2. **Practicality**: A gift card to a tech store like Best Buy or Micro Center will help Alex set up his new workspace or purchase any necessary tools and equipment for his job. This is especially useful for a new graduate who might be starting their first job or building their own setup.\n3. **Flexibility**: A gift card gives Alex the freedom to choose something he really needs or wants, rather than guessing what might be useful.\n\nSome ideas for the congratulatory card:\n\n* A heartfelt message expressing your pride and excitement for Alex's achievement\n* A funny anecdote or inside joke to make him smile\n* A motivational quote or message to inspire him in his future endeavors\n* A simple \"Congratulations, Cousin!\" or \"You did it, Alex!\"\n\nFor the gift card, consider a denomination that's reasonable for a tech store, such as $25, $50, or $100. This will give Alex enough flexibility to purchase something useful or put it towards a bigger investment.\n\nRemember to include the card and gift card with the customized briefcase or laptop bag, and you'll have a thoughtful and well-rounded gift that Alex will surely appreciate!",
