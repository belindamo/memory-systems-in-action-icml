  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot have opinions or have experience of playing games. However, using in-game hints or clues can be a great middle ground between relying on walkthroughs and figuring everything out on your own. Many modern games have built-in hint systems and other features that can help you progress through the game without giving away the answer to every puzzle or challenge. These features can also be customizable, allowing you to choose how much help you want or need. \n\nUsing such features can help you enjoy the game more by giving you a sense of accomplishment when you solve problems on your own while still providing a little extra guidance when you need it. It's always a good idea to explore the game's settings and options before starting to identify if it comes with any sort of assistance or hint guides.",
