  "content": "As an OpEx and Transformation Leader and in-house consultant, my task is to identify areas where the large academic research database and information services company can improve its translation processes to automate translation scale, speed, and quality. Currently, the company's translation process is manual, time-consuming, and cost-prohibitive. The marketing and engineering teams are burdened with low-value-add translation tasks, and the company lacks a Translation Management System (TMS).\n\nCurrent State:\nThe current translation process involves manual work and is highly dependent on human translation, which is time-consuming and costly. The marketing and engineering teams are responsible for translation tasks, which are low-value-add activities that take away from their primary responsibilities. The lack of a TMS makes it difficult to manage the translation process and optimize workflows. The current process is not scalable and does not allow for fast turnaround times or high-quality translation outputs.\n\nIdeal State:\nThe ideal state is a technology-powered translation strategy that includes the implementation of a TMS. The TMS will provide a centralized platform for managing translation workflows, automating processes, and reducing manual work. The TMS will also include translation memory, which will allow for the reuse of previously translated content, reducing costs and increasing speed. Additionally, the ideal state includes the implementation of machine translation and natural language processing technologies to automate low-value-add translation tasks, freeing up the marketing and engineering teams to focus on their core responsibilities.\n\nGap Analysis:\n\nObjective: Automate translation scale, speed, and quality to improve the overall translation process.\n\nKey Results:\n\n1. Reduce manual translation work by 50%: Implement a TMS and machine translation technologies to automate translation processes.\n2. Increase translation speed by 30%: Introduce a centralized translation platform that allows for the management of workflows and the optimization of translation processes.\n3. Improve translation quality by 20%: Use translation memory to ensure consistency and accuracy in translations.\n4. Reduce translation costs by 40%: Utilize machine translation and natural language processing technologies to automate low-value-add translation tasks.\n\nAction Plan:\n\n1. Research and select a TMS that meets the organization's requirements and integrates with existing systems.\n2. Develop a strategy for introducing machine translation and natural language processing technologies to automate low-value-add translation tasks.\n3. Train marketing and engineering teams on the new TMS and translation process.\n4. Implement a centralized translation platform that allows for the management of workflows and optimization of translation processes.\n5. Monitor progress against key results and adjust the action plan as necessary.\n6. Regularly assess the effectiveness of the new translation processes and make improvements as needed.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the current manual and cost-prohibitive translation process at the large academic research database and information services company can be greatly improved by implementing a technology-powered translation strategy. By introducing a TMS, machine translation, and natural language processing technologies, the translation process can be automated, reducing manual work, increasing speed, and improving quality. The implementation of a centralized translation platform will allow for the management of workflows and optimization of translation processes, while also freeing up the marketing and engineering teams to focus on their core responsibilities. The gap analysis and action plan provide a clear roadmap for achieving the desired objective of automating translation scale, speed, and quality.",
