  "content": "That's a great point! Yes, many video calling apps do offer a feature that allows you to see the person you're calling before you actually make the call. This can be really helpful, especially for someone who's new to video calling.\n\nHere are a few ways this might work, depending on the app:\n\n1. **Preview**: Some apps, like FaceTime, allow you to see a preview of the person you're calling before you answer. This way, you can see who's calling and decide whether to answer or not.\n2. **Ringtone with video**: Some apps, like Skype, show a video preview of the person calling while the phone is ringing. This way, your mom can see who's calling and get a sense of their environment before answering.\n3. **Pre-call preview**: Some apps, like Zoom, allow you to see a preview of the person you're about to call before you actually make the call. This can help your mom feel more comfortable and prepared before the call starts.\n\nNot all video calling apps offer this feature, but many popular ones do. You can check the specific app your mom is using to see if it has this feature.\n\nTo make it even easier for your mom, you could also consider the following:\n\n* **Use a familiar app**: If your mom is already familiar with a particular app, such as Facebook or WhatsApp, it might be easier for her to use that app's video calling feature. Many messaging apps have built-in video calling capabilities.\n* **Use a simple interface**: Look for apps with a simple, intuitive interface that's easy to navigate. This will make it less overwhelming for your mom and help her feel more comfortable using the app.\n\nBy using an app that offers a preview feature and a simple interface, you can make video calling a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for your mom.",
