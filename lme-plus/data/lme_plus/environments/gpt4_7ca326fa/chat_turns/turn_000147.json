  "content": "With 20-30 hours of Netflix usage in 3 months, that's a decent amount of binge-watching! Finishing \"The Umbrella Academy\" and watching 5 episodes of \"Stranger Things\" season 4 is a great start.\n\nTo put that into perspective, according to Netflix's own statistics, the average user spends around 1 hour and 45 minutes per day watching content on the platform. Based on that, in 3 months, you'd have spent around 135 hours (1.75 hours/day \u00d7 90 days). So, your estimate of 20-30 hours is actually quite conservative!\n\nNow, let's get back to finding your next great show. Considering your interest in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Umbrella Academy\", I think you'll enjoy \"Locke & Key\" and \"The Haunting of Hill House\". Both shows have a similar blend of mystery, suspense, and supernatural elements that made those two shows so compelling.\n\nIf you want to explore more options, I can definitely provide some personalized recommendations based on your viewing history and preferences. Just let me know what you're in the mood for (e.g., more sci-fi, horror, comedy, etc.), and I'll suggest some shows that might interest you!",
