  "content": "Yes, here are some common carrier oils that you can mix with essential oils for topical application:\n\n1. Coconut oil: It's an excellent carrier oil that's easy to find, has a neutral scent, and is readily absorbed by the skin.\n\n2. Jojoba oil: It's a lightweight oil that's good for all skin types, has a long shelf life, and is easily absorbed by the skin.\n\n3. Sweet almond oil: It's a nourishing oil that's ideal for dry and sensitive skin, has a light scent, and is easily absorbed.\n\n4. Olive oil: It's a versatile carrier oil that's inexpensive and easy to find, but it has a strong scent that may not be appealing to everyone.\n\n5. Grapeseed oil: It's a lightweight oil that's good for oily and acne-prone skin, has a neutral scent, and is easily absorbed.\n\nRemember to always dilute the essential oil in a carrier oil before applying it to your skin. A general rule of thumb is to use a 2-3% dilution ratio, which means adding 6-10 drops of essential oil to every 1 ounce of carrier oil.",
