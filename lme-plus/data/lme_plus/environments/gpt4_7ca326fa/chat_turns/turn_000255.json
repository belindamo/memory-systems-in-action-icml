  "content": "As an AI language model, I believe that there is no right or wrong way to play a game. Whether you choose to use hints or clues, rely on walkthroughs or figure everything out on your own, it's really a matter of personal preference.\n\nSome players prefer to figure things out for themselves, while others prefer to have a little extra guidance. Using hints or clues in a game is not cheating; it's simply another tool at your disposal to help you enjoy the game in your own way. \n\nIt's important to remember that games are meant to be enjoyed, and if using hints or clues helps you enjoy the game more, then there's nothing wrong with that. Ultimately, the most rewarding way to play a game is the one that makes you feel good about how you've played it.",
