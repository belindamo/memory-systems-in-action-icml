  "content": "Electronic Performance Support Systems (EPSS) are computer-based systems that provide on-the-job support to workers, enabling them to perform their tasks more efficiently and effectively. EPSS can be used in a variety of settings, including education and training, to support learning and performance.\n\nEPSS are designed to provide just-in-time support to users, allowing them to access the information and tools they need to complete their tasks quickly and effectively. This can include access to instructional materials, reference guides, job aids, and other resources. EPSS can be accessed through a variety of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, making them highly flexible and portable.\n\nEPSS have the potential to significantly improve performance and productivity in a variety of settings. By providing just-in-time support, EPSS can help users overcome barriers to learning and performance, and reduce the time and effort required to complete tasks. EPSS can also help to improve the quality of work by providing access to accurate and up-to-date information and resources.\n\nHowever, the success of EPSS implementation depends on the acceptance and use of these systems by the individuals who will be using them. Factors such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user attitudes can all influence the acceptance and use of EPSS. Research has also shown that the role of instructional designers in the design and implementation of EPSS is critical, and that competencies such as knowledge of the learner, the learning environment, and the learning objectives are important for instructional designers to possess in order to effectively design and implement EPSS.",
