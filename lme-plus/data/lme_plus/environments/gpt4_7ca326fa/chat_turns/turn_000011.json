I'm here to provide information and assist with your questions to the best of my abilities.\n\nBut I'm glad you brought up the topic of emergency lights and candles! It's an important topic, especially for preparedness and safety during power outages. If you're looking for recommendations or advice on emergency lights and candles, I'd be happy to provide some information and options.\n\nFor emergency lights, you may want to consider battery-powered LED lights, which are energy-efficient and can provide reliable lighting during power outages. You can also look into solar-powered lights or flashlights with hand-crank generators.\n\nFor candles, make sure to choose ones that are safe and stable, with a sturdy base to prevent tipping over. You may also want to consider candles with a longer burning time or those that are specifically designed for emergency use.\n\nRemember to always follow safety guidelines when using candles or any open flames, and make sure to keep them out of reach of children and pets.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss.",
