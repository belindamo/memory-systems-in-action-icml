  "content": "The American Revolution had a significant impact on Native American tribes. Many tribes were forced to choose sides in the conflict between the American colonists and Great Britain. Some tribes, such as the Oneida and Tuscarora, allied with the Americans, while others, such as the Cherokee and Iroquois, supported the British.\n\nNative American tribes also saw their lands and resources threatened by the conflict. The British offered to protect Native lands in exchange for their support, while the Americans often claimed Native lands as their own without compensation. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the war in 1783, ceded much of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region to the United States, further reducing Native lands.\n\nAdditionally, the American Revolution set in motion a long process of westward expansion by the United States, which displaced and often forcibly removed Native tribes from their ancestral lands. Despite efforts by some American leaders to establish peaceful relationships with Native American tribes, the overall impact of the American Revolution on Native Americans was a loss of land, resources, and autonomy.",
