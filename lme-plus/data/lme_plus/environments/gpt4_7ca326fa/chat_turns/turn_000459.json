Showing her how to use the speakerphone feature is a great idea, as it can give her more freedom to move around while talking, which can be especially helpful if she needs to multitask or move around the room.\n\nBy using the speakerphone feature, she can:\n\n1. **Move around freely**: She can walk around the room, get a drink, or do some light stretching while still being able to talk to her friends and family.\n2. **Use her hands**: She can use her hands to do other tasks, like cooking, cleaning, or even playing with her grandkids while still being able to chat.\n3. **Reduce fatigue**: Holding a device to her ear for extended periods can be tiring. The speakerphone feature can help reduce fatigue and make calls more comfortable.\n\nAnd, as you mentioned, it's essential to remind her that she can always switch between speakerphone and regular audio by tapping the \"Speaker\" button. This way, she can easily switch between the two modes depending on her needs.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind when showing her how to use the speakerphone feature:\n\n1. **Volume control**: Remind her that she can adjust the volume of the speakerphone using the volume buttons on the side of the tablet.\n2. **Mic placement**: Encourage her to place the tablet at a comfortable distance from her mouth to ensure her voice is picked up clearly.\n3. **Background noise**: Warn her that the speakerphone can pick up background noise, so she may want to find a quiet spot to talk or use a headset if she's in a noisy environment.\n\nBy covering these points, you'll be helping your mom get the most out of the speakerphone feature and making her video calling experience even more comfortable and enjoyable.",
