(Source: National Science Foundation, 2020)\n* In the tech industry specifically, women make up around 26% of the workforce. (Source: Gartner, 2020)\n* Only 14% of engineers are women, and only 25% of computing occupations are held by women. (Source: National Science Foundation, 2020)\n* Women of color are even more underrepresented, with only 3% of computing occupations held by African American women, 2% by Latina women, and 1% by Native American women. (Source: National Science Foundation, 2020)\n\n**Trends and Challenges:**\n\n* While the number of women in tech has increased in recent years, the growth rate is slow, and the industry still faces significant challenges in attracting and retaining women. (Source: McKinsey, 2020)\n* The \"leaky pipeline\" phenomenon persists, where women are more likely to leave the tech industry than men, especially at mid-career levels. (Source: Harvard Business Review, 2020)\n* Bias, stereotypes, and a lack of role models and mentors contribute to the underrepresentation of women in tech. (Source: National Academy of Engineering, 2020)\n* The pandemic has also disproportionately affected women in tech, with many facing increased caregiving responsibilities and experiencing a higher rate of job loss. (Source: Women Who Code, 2020)\n\n**Positive Developments:**\n\n* There are more organizations and initiatives focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech than ever before.\n* Many companies are actively working to increase diversity and inclusion, with some making significant progress.\n* The number of women in tech startups has increased, with women founding 21% of startups in 2020, up from 17% in 2019. (Source: Crunchbase, 2020)\n\nThese statistics highlight the ongoing need for efforts to promote gender equality and diversity in the tech industry. By getting involved with organizations like the ones I mentioned earlier, you can contribute to creating a more inclusive and equitable industry for everyone.",
