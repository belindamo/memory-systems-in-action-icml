  "content": "Can you help me understand how diffusion models for image generation work? I understand the basic idea--that a model is trained to remove noise added to an image and then later uses that same training data to construct an image from pure noise. I understand that this is done using a Markov model but I don't understand Markov models well enough to have a conceptual understanding of how this works",
