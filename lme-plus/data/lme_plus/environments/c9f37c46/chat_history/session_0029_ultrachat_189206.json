Remember that you're not alone: Many pastors are interested in social justice issues and are seeking to connect with others who share their passion. You're not the only one!\n\n2. Focus on your shared values: When you meet with other pastors, focus on the shared values that brought you together, such as a desire for equity or a commitment to justice. This will provide a strong foundation for your relationship and help you feel more comfortable in discussing difficult issues.\n\n3. Be honest: It's okay to admit that you're nervous or unsure when reaching out to other pastors. This can actually help to build rapport and lay the groundwork for more genuine and honest conversations.\n\n4. Start small: If you're hesitant about reaching out to someone you've never met before, consider starting with pastors you already know or have worked with in the past. This can help to build confidence and ease you into connecting with new people.\n\n5. Take the initiative: Don't wait for other pastors to reach out to you. Take the initiative to organize a meeting or event, and invite them to participate. This can give you more control over the situation and help you feel more comfortable.\n\nRemember that building connections with other pastors takes time, effort, and patience. It's okay to start small and work your way up. The most important thing is to stay committed to your values and passions and always keep an open mind."
