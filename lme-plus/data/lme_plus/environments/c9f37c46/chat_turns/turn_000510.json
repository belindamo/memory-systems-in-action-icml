  "content": "Fleets is a feature on Twitter that allows users to share short-form, ephemeral content similar to Instagram and Snapchat stories. With Fleets, users can share tweets, photos, videos, and GIFs that disappear after 24 hours.\n\nFleets are a way for users to share their thoughts, feelings, and daily updates in a more informal and less permanent way than traditional tweets. This can make it a great way to share your \"Quantum Voice\" illustrations and messages, as it allows you to share them in a more casual and less formal way.\n\nSome advantages of using fleets are that they are less permanent than tweets, so users feel more free to share thoughts, images and videos that might not be polished or final. They also help with engagement and increase the chances of having your content seen by more people.\n\nAdditionally, you can use Twitter's live-streaming feature, Twitter Live, to share your illustrations in real-time and connect with your followers.",
