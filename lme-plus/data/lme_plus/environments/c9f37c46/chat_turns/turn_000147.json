It is a term used in building contracts that indicates when the works under the contract have been completed to the extent that the owner can occupy and use the building for its intended purpose. Practical completion is defined as the point in time when all building works are completed except for minor defects that do not prevent the building from being used for its intended purpose. At this stage, the responsibility for the building passes from the builder to the owner, and the owner can take possession of the property.",
