  "content": "The cash back rewards from Rakuten are a great perk, and it's essential to account for them in your budget.\n\nThere are a few ways to handle cash back rewards in your budget, and it ultimately depends on your personal preference. Here are two approaches:\n\n**Method 1: Subtract from Total Spending**\n\nYou can subtract the cash back rewards from your total spending in each category. For example, if you spent $50 in the \"Family Gifts\" category and earned $5 cash back from Rakuten, you would subtract $5 from the \"Spent\" column, making it $45.\n\n**Method 2: Keep Cash Back Separate**\n\nAlternatively, you can keep the cash back rewards separate from your total spending. You can add a new column to your spreadsheet, such as \"Cash Back Earned,\" and track the rewards earned in each category. This way, you can see the total amount you've spent and the amount you've earned back separately.\n\nHere's an updated template that includes a \"Cash Back Earned\" column:\n\n**Updated Holiday Shopping Budget Tracker Template**\n\n| **Category** | **Budget** | **Spent** | **Cash Back Earned** | **Remaining** | **Notes** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Family Gifts | $100 | $50 | $5 | $50 |  |\n| Friend Gifts | $50 | $20 | $2 | $30 |  |\n| Coworker Gifts | $20 | $10 | $1 | $10 |  |\n| Decorations | $50 | $30 | $3 | $20 |  |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nBy keeping the cash back rewards separate, you can see the total amount you've earned back and adjust your budget accordingly. You might consider using the cash back rewards to offset future purchases or save them for a rainy day.\n\nWhich method do you think you'll use to track your cash back rewards?",
