  "content": "Reaching practical completion is not only important for the financial aspects of the project, but also for insurance and warranty purposes. In New South Wales, the statutory warranty period under the Home Building Act 1989 and insurance under the Home Building Compensation Fund (HBCF) both commence from the date of practical completion. The HBCF is designed to provide cover to homeowners for loss caused by defective or incomplete residential building work in the event that the builder is insolvent, has disappeared, or has died. Therefore, it is crucial that practical completion is reached before the warranty and insurance periods commence.\n\nIf there are any defects or incomplete work after practical completion, the builder is still responsible for rectifying these issues during the defects liability period. However, the defects liability period only starts once practical completion has been achieved. During this period, the builder is liable to repair any defects that arise and are reported by the owner. This is why it is essential for developers to ensure that practical completion is achieved before the warranty and insurance periods commence, to minimize the risk of any additional costs or claims arising.",
