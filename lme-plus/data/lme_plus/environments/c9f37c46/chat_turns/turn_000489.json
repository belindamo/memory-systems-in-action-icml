Fresh air and a short walk can do wonders for your productivity and overall well-being.\n\nGiven your schedule, you can try fitting in a shorter podcast episode during your lunch break, making sure to leave enough time for your walk and lunch. Here's a revised plan:\n\n* 12:00 PM - 12:20 PM: Take a 20-minute walk outside to clear your head and get some fresh air\n* 12:20 PM - 12:40 PM: Eat your lunch and relax for a bit\n* 12:40 PM - 1:00 PM: Listen to a shorter podcast episode (20-30 minutes)\n* 1:00 PM - 1:30 PM: Get ready for your meeting and review any necessary materials\n\nThis schedule allows you to fit in a shorter podcast episode while still having time for your walk, lunch, and preparation for your meeting. You can adjust the timing as needed to fit your personal preferences and pace.\n\nRemember to choose a podcast that's engaging and easy to follow, so you can make the most of your limited time. You might consider podcasts with shorter episodes, like the ones I mentioned earlier, or try a podcast with a more relaxed, conversational tone that's easy to follow.\n\nEnjoy your walk, lunch, and podcast time!",
