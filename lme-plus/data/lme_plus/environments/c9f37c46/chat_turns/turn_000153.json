  "content": "Failing to meet practical completion can have significant consequences for property developers. One of the primary consequences is that the builder may be entitled to liquidated damages for the delay. Liquidated damages are a predetermined amount of money that the builder can claim for each day that the project is delayed beyond the agreed practical completion date.\n\nIn addition to the financial impact, failing to meet practical completion can also delay the commencement of the warranty period and insurance coverage. This can expose developers to the risk of having to pay for repairs to any defects that arise during this time.\n\nFurthermore, if practical completion is not reached within a reasonable time, the owner may have the right to terminate the contract. This could result in a loss of investment for the developer and potential legal action.\n\nIt is important for property developers to understand the potential consequences of failing to meet practical completion and to work closely with their builder to ensure that the project is completed on time and to the required standard.",
