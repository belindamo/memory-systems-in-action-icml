Here's why:\n\n1. **Focus on the most valuable coins first**: By focusing on the rarest and most valuable coins, you'll get a better understanding of their worth and potential sale prices. This will help you make informed decisions about which coins to sell, hold, or consider grading and authenticating.\n2. **Expert attention**: By presenting the most valuable coins first, you'll likely get the undivided attention of the coin expert or appraiser. They'll be able to devote more time and resources to evaluating these coins, which can lead to a more accurate appraisal.\n3. **Efficient use of time**: If you bring in your entire collection, the appraisal process might take longer, and the expert might not be able to give each coin the attention it deserves.
