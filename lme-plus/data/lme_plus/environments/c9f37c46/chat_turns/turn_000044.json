  "content": "Mediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) where an independent third party facilitates the negotiation between disputing parties. This can be done through a court order, a contractual agreement, or through mutual consent. Unlike litigation, where a judge or arbitrator makes the final decision, in mediation, the parties themselves decide on the outcome. The role of the mediator is to assist the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution. Mediators do not take sides, nor do they make decisions for the parties involved. They may suggest options, provide information, and help parties identify areas of agreement and disagreement. Mediation is often a faster, less expensive, and less formal process than litigation, making it suitable for resolving many types of disputes.",
