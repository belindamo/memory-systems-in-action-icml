Having a good instructor like Rachel can make all the difference in creating a supportive and nourishing environment for your practice.\n\nRestorative yoga is an excellent way to cultivate relaxation, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being. The use of props, gentle sequencing, and mindful breathing can help quiet the mind and rejuvenate the body. It's fantastic that you're experiencing the benefits firsthand!\n\nAttending a class in-person can also provide a sense of community and accountability, which can be motivating and help you stay consistent with your practice. Having a regular practice can also help you develop greater body awareness, improve your sleep, and increase your overall sense of calm and clarity.\n\nI'm curious, what is it about Rachel's teaching style or the class itself that resonates with you? Is there something specific that you look forward to or find particularly helpful in her classes?\n\nRemember to continue listening to your body and honoring its needs, especially in a restorative yoga practice.
