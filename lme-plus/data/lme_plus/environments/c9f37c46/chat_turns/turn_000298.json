  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to the specific details of Pink's recording process for \"Who Knew,\" but I can provide some general information on the topic of balancing instrumentals with vocals during recording.\n\nBalancing the level of instrumentals, such as drums, guitars, keyboards or other accompanying instruments, with the lead vocal is crucial to creating a well-produced song. This is achieved through mixing, where engineers adjust the levels, frequencies and panning of each track in the recording. \n\nIn the case of vocals, engineers use compression, equalization, and reverb to enhance the sound quality, and ensure it sits nicely on top of the mix. EQ helps to remove unwanted frequencies in the vocal track, while compression evens out the dynamic range to keep the vocal level consistent. Reverb creates the illusion of space around the vocal, making it sound more natural and full. \n\nThe lead vocal should always be clear and intelligible, without being overpowered by the instrumentals. The placement of the vocal in the mix is also important, making sure it is not too far forward or too far back, but sits just right depending on the genre and style of music. \n\nIn summary, the process of balancing instrumentals with vocals involves skillful mixing, and the use of a range of tools and techniques to create a well-rounded and cohesive sound.",
