  "content": "For property developers, reaching practical completion is an essential milestone in the building process. It marks the end of the construction phase and the beginning of the handover process. Practical completion determines when the defects liability period starts, when the builder's liability to pay liquidated damages ends, and when the builder gets final payment. It also triggers the commencement of both the statutory warranty period under the Home Building Act 1989 and insurance under the Home Building Compensation Fund (HBCF), which protects property developers against defects in their building work. Reaching practical completion ensures that developers can start marketing and selling their properties, which is essential for their business operations. Overall, practical completion is an essential aspect of the construction process that property developers should carefully consider and plan for to ensure that their projects are completed on time, on budget, and to a high standard.",
