That's a great way to keep track of when you last had your shoes polished, cleaned, or repaired. This can help you:\n\n* Keep your shoes looking their best\n* Plan ahead for future maintenance\n* Identify shoes that might need more frequent cleaning or attention\n* Make informed decisions about when to retire or replace shoes\n\nI'd be happy to add a \"Last Maintenance\" column to your inventory. Here's an updated version:\n\n**Shoe Inventory**\n\n| **Shoe #** | **Type** | **Brand** | **Style** | **Color** | **Size** | **Condition** | **Notable Features** | **Last Maintenance** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Boots | Clarks | Black leather boots | Black | 9 (maybe 8.5) | Gently used | Comfortable, worn 3 times |  |\n| 2 | Sneakers | Nike | Old trusty sneakers | White and blue | 7.5 | Worn out | Worn every Friday to work for 10 weeks |  |\n| 3 | Sandals | Adidas | Casual sandals | Brown | 8 | Good | Lent to sister, returned on Jan 15th |  |\n| 4 | Loafers | [Brand] | Brown loafers | Brown | [Size] | Good | Polished on Jan 20th | Jan 20th |\n\nPlease fill in the brand and size for your brown loafers, and I'll update the inventory accordingly.\n\nHow often do you think you'll update the \"Last Maintenance\" column? Will you update it each time you clean or polish a pair, or only for more significant maintenance tasks like repairs or conditioning?",
