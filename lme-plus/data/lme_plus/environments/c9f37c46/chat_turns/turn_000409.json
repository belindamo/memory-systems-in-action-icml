I'm glad I could help.\n\nKeeping the cash back rewards separate is a great idea, as it will give you a clear picture of your total spending and the rewards you've earned.

Otherwise, happy shopping and happy tracking!\n\nRemember to regularly review your budget and adjust as needed. You got this!\n\n(And don't forget to redeem those cash back rewards when the time comes!)",
