Exciting!\n\nFinding the best deals and discounts on furniture can be a challenge, but I've got some tips to help you score some amazing deals:\n\n1. **Research, research, research**: Before making a purchase, research the item you want to buy. Check out reviews, compare prices, and look for any discounts or promotions.\n2. **Sign up for newsletters and follow social media**: Sign up for newsletters and follow your favorite furniture stores on social media to stay informed about upcoming sales, promotions, and exclusive deals.\n3. **Use online deal platforms**: Websites like RetailMeNot, Coupons.com, and Slickdeals aggregate deals and discounts from various retailers. You can find promo codes, coupons, and cash back offers for your desired furniture items.\n4. **Check for price matching policies**: Many retailers offer price matching policies. If you find a lower price elsewhere, they'll match it. This can be a great way to ensure you're getting the best deal.\n5. **Look for bundle deals**: Sometimes, buying multiple items together can be cheaper than purchasing them separately. Keep an eye out for bundle deals or package discounts.\n6. **Consider refurbished or used items**: Refurbished or gently used furniture can be a cost-effective option. Just make sure you're buying from a reputable seller and inspect the item carefully before making a purchase.\n7. **Check for floor models or display items**: Floor models or display items are often discounted because they've been used in-store. They might have minor cosmetic damage, but they're usually in great condition and can be a steal.\n8. **Negotiate**: If you're buying from a physical store, don't be afraid to negotiate. Some retailers might be willing to lower the price or throw in some extras if you ask.\n9. **Use cash back apps**: Cash back apps like Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates), TopCashback, or BeFrugal offer a percentage of your purchase back as cash or credit.\n10. **Keep an eye on holiday sales**: Major holidays like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Labor Day often bring significant discounts on furniture. Plan your purchases around these events to score the best deals.\n11. **Check for manufacturer's closeout sales**: Sometimes, manufacturers clear out old inventory to make room for new products. Keep an eye on manufacturer's websites or authorized dealers for closeout sales.\n12. **Use a price tracker**: Websites like CamelCamelCamel or Keepa track price histories, so you can see if the item you want has been cheaper in the past. This can help you determine if the current price is a good deal.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to find some amazing deals on your coffee table and outdoor furniture.\n\nDo you have a specific brand or retailer in mind for your purchases?",
