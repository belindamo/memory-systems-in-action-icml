  "content": "It is indeed true that most words ending in \u301c\u3044 are adjectives in Japanese. However, I found an example of a kanji with the \u56d7 (kunigamae) radical and a noun formed with an okurigana \u301c\u3044:\n\nThe kanji is \u56f2 (\u3044) with the kun'yomi (Japanese reading) of \u3044. The noun formed with this kanji is \u56f2\u3044 (\u304b\u3053\u3044), which means \"enclosure\" or \"fence.\" In this case, the \u301c\u3044 functions as part of a noun rather than forming an adjective.",
