It's a character-driven drama with a similar atmosphere to Ozark, but with a more subtle tone and a focus on relationships and family dynamics.\n2. **Sharp Objects**: Another HBO series, based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, follows a journalist (Amy Adams) who returns to her hometown to cover a series of murders. It's a slow-burning, atmospheric show that explores themes of family, trauma, and small-town secrets, but with a more introspective and emotional tone than Ozark.\n3. **Killing Eve**: This BBC America spy thriller, starring Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer, follows a cat-and-mouse game between an MI6 agent and a psychopathic assassin. It's a tense and suspenseful show, but with a more playful and witty tone than Ozark.\n4. **Billions**: This Showtime series, starring Damian Lewis and Paul Giamatti, explores the world of finance and politics, pitting a ruthless hedge fund manager against a brilliant prosecutor. It's a smart, fast-paced show with a similar theme of power struggles, but with a more satirical and humorous tone.\n5. **Ray Donovan**: This Showtime series, starring Liev Schreiber, follows a fixer for a powerful law firm, dealing with the dark side of Hollywood and the wealthy elite. It's a character-driven drama with a similar atmosphere to Ozark, but with a more laid-back, California-cool tone.\n\nThese shows all have some elements of Ozark's complexity and suspense, but with a lighter tone and more emphasis on character development and relationships. Give one a try and see if it's more to your liking!",
