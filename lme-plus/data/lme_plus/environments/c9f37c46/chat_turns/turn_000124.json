  "content": "Pacific Coin Exchange is a well-established and reputable dealer in the Bay Area.\n\nAccording to their website and online reviews, Pacific Coin Exchange welcomes walk-ins, but they do recommend making an appointment to ensure a coin expert is available to assist you. This is especially important if you have a large collection or rare coins that require specialized attention.\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n* **Walk-ins**: They do accept walk-ins, but be prepared for a possible wait, as appointments take priority.\n* **Appointments**: It's recommended to schedule an appointment in advance to ensure a dedicated expert is available to evaluate your coins. You can call them at (415) 781-5171 or email [info@pacificcoinexchange.com](mailto:info@pacificcoinexchange.com) to schedule a meeting.\n* **Evaluation process**: When you visit, their experts will evaluate your coins, provide an appraisal, and discuss potential sale options. Be prepared to provide any relevant documentation, such as provenance or certificates of authenticity.\n\nBefore visiting, you may also want to:\n\n* **Check their website**: Review their website for any specific guidelines or requirements for bringing in coins for appraisal.\n* **Call ahead**: If you have a large collection or specific questions, call them before visiting to confirm their policies and availability.\n\nBy making an appointment, you'll likely have a more efficient and productive experience. However, if you're in the area and have a few coins you'd like to get appraised, walking in might still be an option.\n\nRemember to stay organized, and don't hesitate to ask questions during your visit. Good luck, and I hope you receive a fair and helpful appraisal for your grandpa's coin collection!",
