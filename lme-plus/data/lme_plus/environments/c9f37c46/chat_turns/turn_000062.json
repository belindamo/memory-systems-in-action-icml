Nevertheless, it's worth noting that moral standards have undoubtedly shifted since the time of the Crusades. What was deemed moral and acceptable then may not be the same as what is considered today.\n\nThe Crusades are an example of a time when different moral and ethical standards were accepted, and the actions and behaviors of people were influenced by those standards. As such, it can be challenging to judge the Crusaders solely based on our modern moral standards.\n\nHowever, it's essential to recognize that some of the actions taken during the Crusades, such as the killing of innocent civilians and the indiscriminate use of violence, are universally considered immoral and unjustifiable by modern standards. As such, while it may be challenging to judge the Crusaders based on our modern moral standards, it's still important to critically and objectively examine their actions, beliefs, and motivations.",
