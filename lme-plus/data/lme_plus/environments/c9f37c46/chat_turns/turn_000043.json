  "content": "Based on our previous conversation, can you help me write the content for section 2 about What is Mediation?\n\nDefinition of mediation\nHow mediation works\nTypes of disputes suitable for mediation\nBenefits of mediation over litigation\n\nFor your reference, here is the old content to rewrite:\nWhat is Mediation?\nMediation is an alternative dispute resolution facilitated by an independent third party. This can be done due to the court\u2019s order, an agreement written in the building contract or both parties volunteering to resort to this resolution. This is more like a negotiation between both parties which all of them must agree once they come up with a resolution.\nFor this type of dispute resolution, the mediator must not decide for both parties nor take sides. Instead the mediator may suggest or even come up with facts that might not have been considered by either party. The important thing is, they must reach to an agreement and all parties must agree with that settlement. In addition, most mediators are senior or retired lawyers and judges.\n\nPlease adjust the word count to 150 words. I intend to give you the next section so do not give a summary or conclusion yet.\n\nPlease respond to me in Australian English.",
