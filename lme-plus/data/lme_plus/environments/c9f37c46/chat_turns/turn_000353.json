Here are some healthy dinner ideas that are high in protein to add some variety to your routine:\n\n**Protein-rich main courses:**\n\n1. **Turkey or chicken burgers**: Made with lean ground meat, these can be grilled or pan-seared and served with whole-grain buns, avocado, and veggies.\n2. **Grilled shrimp**: Marinate them in olive oil, garlic, and herbs, and serve with quinoa or brown rice and steamed asparagus.\n3. **Lentil or chickpea curry**: High in protein and fiber, these legumes can be cooked with lean ground meat or tofu for added protein. Serve with brown rice or whole-grain naan.\n4. **Pork tenderloin**: Marinate it in a protein-rich sauce like teriyaki or BBQ, and serve with roasted sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli.\n5. **Tofu stir-fry**: Marinate and stir-fry tofu with veggies like bell peppers, mushrooms, and snow peas, and serve with brown rice or quinoa.\n\n**Protein-rich sides:**\n\n1. **Greek yogurt**: Top with honey, nuts, and fruit for a protein-rich dessert or snack.\n2. **Edamame**: Boil or steam these soybeans and season with sea salt and chili powder.\n3. **Cottage cheese**: Mix with fruit or nuts for a high-protein snack or side dish.\n4. **Hard-boiled eggs**: Keep them in the fridge for a quick protein-rich snack or add to salads.\n5. **Chickpea or black bean salad**: Mix with olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs, and serve as a side dish.\n\n**Other protein-rich ingredients:**\n\n1. **Nuts and seeds**: Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and hemp seeds are all high in protein and can be added to salads or used as toppings.\n2. **Protein-rich grains**: Amaranth, farro, and bulgur are all high in protein and can be used in place of quinoa or brown rice.\n3. **Vegetables**: While not as high in protein as animal products, veggies like spinach, kale, and broccoli do contain some protein, so be sure to include them in your meals.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Experiment with different marinades**: Try using olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs to add flavor to your protein-rich meals.\n2. **Incorporate healthy fats**: Nuts, seeds, avocado, and olive oil are all great sources of healthy fats that can support muscle growth and recovery.\n3. **Don't forget about post-workout snacks**: Aim for a balanced snack with protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats within 30-60 minutes after your workout to support muscle recovery.\n\nI hope these ideas help you mix up your protein-rich dinner routine!",
