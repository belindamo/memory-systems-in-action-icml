  "content": "I've been trying to write jokes about my everyday experiences, but I'm struggling to make them funny. Last month, I finally worked up the courage to attend an open mic night at a local comedy club, and it was amazing to see people trying out their material in front of a live audience. I've been trying to apply what I learned from that experience to my own writing, but I'm still having trouble finding the humor in mundane situations. Do you have any tips on how to make my jokes more relatable and funny?",
