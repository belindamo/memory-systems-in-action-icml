I actually have some experience with online book clubs, having participated in one for \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" by Taylor Jenkins Reid a while back. It was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to finding more communities like that. Anyway, I should probably get going - I have to finish getting ready for Rachel's book launch event today!",
