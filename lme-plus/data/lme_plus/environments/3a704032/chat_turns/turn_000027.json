  "content": "Too much salt can be a common issue in kimchi, but don't worry, there are ways to adjust the salt content. Here are some tips to help you rescue your kimchi:\n\n**Rinse the kimchi**: If you've added too much salt, try rinsing the kimchi under cold running water to remove excess salt. Gently massage the kimchi with your hands to help release the salt. This method works best if you catch the issue early, before the kimchi has fermented too much.\n\n**Add more vegetables**: If the kimchi is still in the early stages of fermentation, you can try adding more vegetables to dilute the salt content. This will also help to balance out the flavors. Make sure to massage the new vegetables with a bit of salt to help them release their juices and blend with the existing kimchi.\n\n**Add a desalting agent**: In some cases, you can add a small amount of a desalting agent like rice vinegar, Korean chili paste (gochujang), or even a splash of water to help balance out the saltiness. However, be cautious when adding liquids, as this can affect the fermentation process.\n\n**Use a salt-reducing technique**: If the kimchi has already fermented, you can try a salt-reducing technique called \"salt-breaking\" (, geom-sul). This involves soaking the kimchi in cold water for several hours or overnight, then rinsing it under cold running water. Repeat this process a few times to help remove excess salt. Keep in mind that this method may affect the texture and flavor of the kimchi.\n\n**Start over (if necessary)**: If your kimchi is severely over-salted and none of the above methods work, it might be best to start over with a new batch. Don't worry, it's all part of the kimchi-making process, and you'll learn from your mistakes!\n\n**Prevention is the best cure**: To avoid over-salting in the future, make sure to:\n\n* Use the right type and amount of salt for your recipe.\n* Taste the kimchi as you go and adjust the seasoning accordingly.\n* Keep an eye on the fermentation process and monitor the salt content regularly.\n\nRemember, kimchi is a flexible and forgiving fermented food, and with a little patience and practice, you'll develop the skills to create a perfectly balanced and delicious kimchi.",
