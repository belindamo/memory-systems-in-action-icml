  "content": "I think Monique is a great narrator for the story, she brings a nice outside perspective to Evelyn's life and experiences. I like how she's not just a passive listener, but an active participant in uncovering Evelyn's secrets and stories. It's interesting to see how Monique's own life and biases influence her perceptions of Evelyn and her story.",
