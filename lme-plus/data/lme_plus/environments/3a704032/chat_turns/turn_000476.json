The power outlets are Type A, which are compatible with Japanese plugs (100V, 50Hz).\n\nHere's what you can expect:\n\n* Ordinary Cars: Each seat has a single power outlet, located between the seats or under the seat in front of you.\n* Green Cars: Each seat has two power outlets, one on each side of the seat.\n\nKeep in mind that the power outlets might not be available on all seats, so it's a good idea to check when you board the train. You can also ask the train staff if you're unsure.\n\nIf you're traveling from a country with different plug types, don't forget to bring a suitable travel adapter for Japan (Type A). You might also consider packing a portable power bank to keep your devices charged during the trip.\n\nNow, you can relax and enjoy your journey to Narita Airport, knowing you'll have a reserved seat and a way to keep your devices powered up!\n\nDo you have any other questions about the N'EX train or your journey to the airport?",
