Here are some tips to help you optimize your space:\n\n1. **Categorize and group**: Divide your instruments and equipment into categories (e.g., guitars, keyboards, drums, recording gear, etc.). Group similar items together to make them easily accessible.\n2. **Assign a home**: Designate a specific spot for each item, so everything has a designated place to return to. This will help maintain organization and reduce clutter.\n3. **Use vertical space**: Invest in wall-mounted shelves, hooks, or racks to maximize vertical space and keep the floor clear. This is especially useful for guitars, basses, and other instruments.\n4. **Invest in multi-functional furniture**: Consider using furniture with built-in storage, such as a keyboard workstation with a cabinet or a drum throne with storage.\n5. **Utilize corners**: Use corner shelves, carousels, or baskets to make the most of often-wasted corner space.\n6. **Label and sign**: Label each storage area or shelf, and consider creating a sign for your music room to help you and others quickly find what they need.\n7. **Keep it flexible**: Leave some space for future additions or changes in your setup. A music room is a dynamic space, and your needs may evolve over time.\n\n**Shelves and cabinets:**\n\nWhile shelves and cabinets can be useful, they're not the only options. Consider the following alternatives:\n\n1. **Instrument-specific storage**: Use cases, bags, or hardshell containers to store instruments when not in use.\n2. **Stackable crates**: Use stackable crates or boxes to store smaller items like pedals, cables, or accessories.\n3. **Pegboards**: Install a pegboard on a wall or a freestanding board to hang items like guitars, basses, or accessories.\n4. **Mobile storage**: Invest in mobile storage solutions like carts, racks, or workstations with wheels to easily move equipment around the room.\n\n**Selling your Fender Deluxe 90 guitar amp:**\n\nTo determine a fair price for your Fender Deluxe 90 guitar amp, research the market and consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Condition**: The amp's condition, including any cosmetic or functional issues, will impact its value.\n2. **Age and rarity**: The age and rarity of the amp can affect its value. Check the production dates and serial numbers to determine its vintage and scarcity.\n3. **Comparable sales**: Look up recent sales of similar Fender Deluxe 90 amps on online marketplaces like Reverb, eBay, or Craigslist to determine a fair market value.\n4. **Original packaging and accessories**: If you still have the original packaging, manual, and accessories, it can increase the amp's value.\n\nAs a rough estimate, a used Fender Deluxe 90 guitar amp in good condition can fetch between $200-$500. However, prices can vary depending on the factors mentioned above. Take clear, high-quality photos, and provide detailed descriptions of the amp's condition to attract potential buyers.\n\nRemember to stay organized, and happy music-making in your new music room!",
