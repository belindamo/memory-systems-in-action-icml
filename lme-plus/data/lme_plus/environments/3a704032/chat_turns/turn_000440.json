Sometimes, updates can resolve connectivity issues or improve the overall app performance.\n\nRegarding your cable organizers, I'm happy to help you with that too! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific shipping information or tracking details. The delivery time for online orders can vary depending on several factors, such as:\n\n1. Shipping carrier: Different carriers have different delivery times and speeds.\n2. Shipping method: You might have chosen a slower or faster shipping option when you placed the order.\n3. Distance: The distance between the seller's location and your address can impact delivery time.\n4. Weather and holidays: Inclement weather or holidays can cause delays in shipping.\n\nTypically, online orders can take anywhere from 3-10 business days to arrive, but it's not uncommon for it to take longer. I recommend checking the tracking information provided by the seller or the shipping carrier to get a better estimate of the delivery date. You can also reach out to the seller's customer support if you're concerned about the delay.\n\nNow, back to your StreamMax issue! After updating the app, try connecting to StreamMax again and see if the problem persists. If you're still experiencing the \"Authentication Failed\" error, we can explore additional troubleshooting steps.",
