  "content": "Thank you for the details!\n\nI'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the issue. The \"Authentication Failed\" error message typically indicates a problem with your login credentials or the connection between your TV and the streaming service.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, I'd recommend restarting your devices as you mentioned. Sometimes, a simple reboot can resolve connectivity issues. Please restart your:\n\n1. Samsung QLED 4K TV\n2. StreamMax device (if it's a separate device) or the StreamMax app on your TV\n3. Router (just to be thorough)\n\nAfter restarting, try connecting to StreamMax again and see if the issue persists.\n\nRegarding your new router, it's possible that it could be causing the issue, but it's unlikely. Since you've had the router since January 15th, and you're just experiencing the issue now, it's more likely related to the StreamMax service or your TV. However, we can explore router-related issues later if needed.\n\nIf the problem persists after restarting, let's try a few more things:\n\n1. Check your StreamMax account credentials: Ensure your username and password are correct and up-to-date. You can try logging in to the StreamMax website or mobile app to verify your credentials.\n2. Check the StreamMax app version: Make sure the StreamMax app on your TV is updated to the latest version.\n3. Disable and re-enable the StreamMax app: On your TV, go to the app menu, find the StreamMax app, and disable it. Then, re-enable it and try connecting again.\n\nLet me know the outcome after restarting your devices and trying these additional steps. If you're still experiencing issues, we can continue troubleshooting together!",
