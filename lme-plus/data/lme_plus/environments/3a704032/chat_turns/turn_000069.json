  "content": "**Bundling or separate sale:**\n\nIt's a good idea to consider selling your Yamaha PSR-E263 keyboard separately from your Fender Deluxe 90 amp. Here's why:\n\n1. **Different target audiences**: Keyboards and guitar amps appeal to different types of musicians and buyers. By selling them separately, you can target the right audience for each item.\n2. **Pricing flexibility**: If you bundle the items, you'll need to set a single price for the bundle. By selling separately, you can price each item according to its individual value.\n3. **Easier to sell**: Selling separately can make it easier to find buyers, as each item will attract its own pool of potential buyers.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to discount the bundle, you might attract buyers looking for a package deal. Consider offering a discounted bundle price, but make sure you're not underselling either item.\n\n**Tips for taking good photos:**\n\nWhen taking photos of your instruments for online marketplaces, follow these tips to showcase your items in the best light:\n\n1. **Good lighting**: Use natural light or invest in a lightbox or softbox to reduce harsh shadows and reflections.\n2. **Clean and dust-free**: Make sure your instruments are clean and dust-free to showcase their condition.\n3. **High-quality camera**: Use a high-quality camera or smartphone with a good camera to take clear, high-resolution photos.\n4. **Angled shots**: Take photos from different angles to show the instrument's features, such as the front, back, and sides.\n5. **Close-ups**: Take close-up shots of important features, like knobs, buttons, or any unique design elements.\n6. **Show it in use**: Consider taking photos of the instrument in use, such as a photo of the keyboard on a stand or the amp with a guitar plugged in.\n7. **Include accessories**: If you're including any accessories, such as cables, pedals, or manuals, take photos of them as well.\n8. **Be honest**: Show any flaws or cosmetic issues in your photos to build trust with potential buyers.\n9. **Use a plain background**: Avoid cluttered or distracting backgrounds, and opt for a plain, neutral-colored background to make your instrument stand out.\n10. **Edit and resize**: Edit your photos to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation, and resize them according to the marketplace's requirements.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to showcase your instruments in a way that will attract potential buyers and help you sell them quickly and efficiently.",
