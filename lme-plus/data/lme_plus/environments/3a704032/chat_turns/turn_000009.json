  "content": "Using a mixture of water and fertilizer specifically recommended by the nursery is a good starting point. However, it's essential to understand the type of fertilizer and its concentration to ensure it's suitable for your peace lily.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Fertilizer type:** If the mixture contains a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 20-20-20, N-P-K), it should be suitable for your peace lily. However, if it's a bloom-boosting or high-phosphorus fertilizer (e.g., 10-20-10), it may promote blooming but could lead to weak foliage growth.\n2. **Concentration:** Check the label to see if the fertilizer is a concentrated formula or a ready-to-use solution. If it's concentrated, you'll need to dilute it according to the instructions to avoid burning your plant's roots.\n3. **NPK ratio:** Peace lilies prefer a balanced fertilizer with a slightly higher nitrogen content (e.g., 20-15-15 or 20-20-20). If the mixture has a skewed NPK ratio, it might not provide the optimal nutrition for your plant.\n\nTo be on the safe side, you can consider the following options:\n\n1. **Continue using the nursery-recommended mixture:** If you're unsure about the fertilizer's composition or concentration, you can continue using it as directed. Monitor your peace lily's response, and adjust as needed.\n2. **Switch to a balanced fertilizer:** Consider switching to a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20 or similar) specifically formulated for indoor plants. This will provide a broad spectrum of nutrients for your peace lily's overall health.\n3. **Dilute the fertilizer:** If you decide to continue using the nursery-recommended mixture, consider diluting it to half the recommended strength to avoid over-fertilizing.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to fertilizing your plants. Over-fertilization can be more harmful than under-fertilization.\n\nKeep in mind that your succulent may have different fertilizer requirements than your peace lily. Be sure to research the specific needs of your succulent species to ensure you're providing the best nutrition.",
