Here's a suggested folder structure for each course:\n\n**Python for Data Science**\n\n* **Course Materials:**\n\t+ Syllabus.pdf\n\t+ Lecture Notes (folder with separate files for each week or topic)\n\t+ Assignments (folder with separate files for each assignment)\n* **Assignments:**\n\t+ Assignment 1: Introduction to Python (folder with code files, e.g., .py, .ipynb)\n\t+ Assignment 2: Data Cleaning and Visualization (folder with code files, e.g., .py, .ipynb)\n\t+ ...\n* **Notes:**\n\t+ Week 1: Introduction to Python (notes from lectures, readings, and assignments)\n\t+ Week 2: Data Structures and File I/O (notes from lectures, readings, and assignments)\n\t+ ...\n* **Resources:**\n\t+ Python documentation (PDF or bookmarked webpage)\n\t+ Additional tutorials or resources (e.g., DataCamp, edX, or YouTube tutorials)\n* **Projects:**\n\t+ Final Project: [Project Name] (folder with code files, reports, and any other project-related files)\n\n**Introduction to Machine Learning**\n\n* **Course Materials:**\n\t+ Syllabus.pdf\n\t+ Lecture Notes (folder with separate files for each week or topic)\n\t+ Assignments (folder with separate files for each assignment)\n* **Assignments:**\n\t+ Assignment 1: Linear Regression (folder with code files, e.g., .py, .ipynb)\n\t+ Assignment 2: Decision Trees (folder with code files, e.g., .py, .ipynb)\n\t+ ...\n* **Notes:**\n\t+ Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (notes from lectures, readings, and assignments)\n\t+ Week 2: Supervised Learning (notes from lectures, readings, and assignments)\n\t+ ...\n* **Resources:**\n\t+ scikit-learn documentation (PDF or bookmarked webpage)\n\t+ Additional tutorials or resources (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch tutorials)\n* **Projects:**\n\t+ Final Project: [Project Name] (folder with code files, reports, and any other project-related files)\n\nFor each course, you can create a root folder with the course name, and then create subfolders for course materials, assignments, notes, resources, and projects. This structure will help you keep your files organized and make it easier to find specific information or review course materials.\n\nRemember to customize the folder structure to fit your learning style and needs. You may want to add additional subfolders or files as you progress through the courses.",
