  "content": "Getting to the airport from Shibuya can be a bit of a trek, but there are several convenient options. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Train (Narita Express + JR Train)**:\nTake the JR Yamanote Line from Shibuya Station to Tokyo Station ( approx. 10-15 minutes, \u00a5200). Then, transfer to the Narita Express (N'EX) train to Narita Airport ( approx. 60 minutes, \u00a53,020). You can reserve seats on the N'EX in advance.\n2. **Train (Keisei Skyliner + Keisei Electric Railway)**:\nTake the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line from Shibuya Station to Ueno Station ( approx. 20 minutes, \u00a5240). Then, transfer to the Keisei Electric Railway to Keisei Ueno Station, and take the Keisei Skyliner to Narita Airport ( approx. 40 minutes, \u00a52,500).\n3. **Bus (Airport Limousine)**:\nTake the Airport Limousine bus from Shibuya Mark City (next to Shibuya Station) to Narita Airport ( approx. 60-90 minutes, \u00a53,000-4,000). You can buy tickets online in advance or at the bus stop.\n4. **Taxi**:\nTaxis are readily available outside Shibuya Station, but this option is more expensive ( approx. \u00a515,000-20,000, depending on traffic). Make sure to use a taxi with a fixed fare or metered fare to avoid any surprises.\n5. **Private Car or Ride-hailing**:\nYou can book a private car or ride-hailing service like Uber or Japan Taxi, but prices may vary depending on the provider and traffic.\n\nFor Haneda Airport (HND), you can take the Tokyo Monorail from Shibuya Station to Hamamatsucho Station, then transfer to the Keikyu Line to Haneda Airport ( approx. 30-40 minutes, \u00a5650-820).\n\nDouble-check the schedules, prices, and travel times for your preferred option before heading to the airport. It's also a good idea to leave some extra time for unexpected delays or traffic.\n\nWhich option do you think you'll choose?",
