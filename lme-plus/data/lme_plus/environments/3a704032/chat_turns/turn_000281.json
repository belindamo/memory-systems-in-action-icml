They're both amazing at absorbing the flavors of the spices and herbs.\n\nNow, about that naan bread... Yes, it can be a bit finicky, but with some tips and tricks, you can achieve that perfect, pillowy-soft, slightly charred naan. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Use a yeast starter**: Naan bread relies on yeast for its rise, so make sure you have a good yeast starter going. You can use active dry yeast or instant yeast.\n2. **Use the right flour**: Naan bread typically uses a type of flour called \"atta\" or \"chapati\" flour, which is a type of whole wheat flour. You can also use all-purpose flour, but you might need to adjust the water content.\n3. **Don't overwork the dough**: Mix the dough just until the ingredients come together in a shaggy mass. Then, let it rest for 10-15 minutes before kneading. Overworking the dough can make the naan tough.\n4. **Let it rise**: Give the dough enough time to rise, about 1-2 hours, depending on the temperature and yeast activity.\n5. **Use the right rolling technique**: Roll out the dough into balls, then flatten them slightly into disks. Use a rolling pin to shape the naan into a teardrop shape.\n6. **Cook it at the right temperature**: Cook the naan in a hot skillet or tava over medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C). You want the naan to puff up and char slightly.\n7. **Brush with ghee or oil**: Brush the naan with ghee or oil before cooking to give it a rich, buttery flavor.\n8. **Don't overcrowd**: Cook the naan one by one, so they have enough room to cook evenly.\n\nSome additional tips:\n\n* Use a cast-iron skillet or a tava to cook the naan, as they retain heat well.\n* If you don't have a tava, you can use a baking steel or a pizza stone in your oven to achieve a similar effect.\n* Don't be discouraged if your first few naan don't turn out perfectly. It takes practice to get the technique right!\n\nWith these tips, you should be able to make some delicious, homemade naan to serve with your curry. Good luck, and have fun experimenting!",
