Your current range of 65\u00b0F to 70\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 21\u00b0C) is well within the acceptable range, so you're doing great!\n\nHowever, it's essential to keep in mind that peace lilies can tolerate a wider temperature range, but they might not thrive outside of their ideal range. Here are some guidelines to consider:\n\n* ** Ideal temperature:** 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) to 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C) - This range promotes healthy growth, blooming, and overall plant happiness.\n* **Acceptable temperature:** 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) to 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C) - Your peace lily can still thrive in this range, but it might not be as happy as it would be in the ideal range.\n* **Temperature extremes:** Avoid placing your peace lily in areas with temperatures below 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) or above 85\u00b0F (29\u00b0C), as this can cause stress, yellowing leaves, and reduced growth.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Avoid drafts:** Peace lilies don't like sudden temperature changes or drafts, so try to keep them away from windows, air conditioning vents, and heating radiators.\n* **Monitor temperature fluctuations:** If you live in an area with significant temperature fluctuations, consider using a thermometer to monitor the temperature and adjust the plant's location accordingly.\n* **Consider the pot's material:** If your peace lily is in a ceramic or terra cotta pot, it may be more susceptible to temperature extremes. Consider using a pot with good insulation or moving the plant to a pot with better temperature regulation.\n\nYou're doing a great job so far, and with these temperature guidelines, you'll be able to provide your peace lily with the perfect environment to thrive!",
