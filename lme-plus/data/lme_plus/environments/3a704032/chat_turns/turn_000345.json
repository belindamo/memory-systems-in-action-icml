  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on winter fashion. I recently bought a new winter coat during the pre-Black Friday sale event at Macy's, where I got 40% off, and a pair of boots with a buy one get one 50% off deal, saving me $30 in total. I was thinking of getting some new gloves and a scarf to match, do you have any recommendations?",
