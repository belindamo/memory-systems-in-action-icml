However, I can tell you about some popular recent movies and books that feature excellent use of flashbacks and backstories:\n\n- The Midnight Library by Matt Haig (book, 2020) - The book uses flashbacks to explore the protagonist's regrets and missed opportunities in her life, and an alternative life that she could have had if she had made different choices. The flashbacks serve to add depth to the character's motivations while providing an alternate reality where the protagonist can learn and grow.\n\n- A Star is Born (movie, 2018) - A Star is Born uses flashbacks to reveal the tragic backstory of the main character, Jackson Maine. The flashbacks serve to provide context for his actions in the present as he struggles with addiction and a failing career.\n\n- Westworld (TV series, 2016-2020) - Westworld uses flashbacks to reveal the backstories of its characters, particularly the hosts. The flashbacks serve to provide insight into their motivations and emotions while they navigate the events of the show.\n\n- Before We Were Yours by Lisa Wingate (book, 2017) - This historical fiction novel uses flashbacks to tell the story of siblings who were separated and sent to an abusive orphanage in the 1930s, and their later attempts to reunite as adults. The flashbacks serve to add emotional depth and historical context.\n\nI hope these examples help!",
