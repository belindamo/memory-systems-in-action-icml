It's an excellent way to stay on top of your plant care routine.\n\nSince you're already using a mixture of water and fertilizer, you can adjust the watering frequency based on the fertilizer's instructions and your peace lily's response. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* **Watering frequency:** Water your peace lily when the top 1-2 inches of the soil feel dry to the touch. This is usually every 7-10 days during the spring and summer months when the plant is actively growing. During the fall and winter, you can reduce watering to every 10-14 days, as the plant grows slower.\n* **Fertilizer frequency:** Since you're using a fertilizer mixture, you can follow the instructions on the label for application frequency. Typically, you'll want to fertilize your peace lily every 1-2 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) and reduce frequency to once a month during the dormant season (fall and winter).\n* **Soil moisture:** Make sure to check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. If it's already moist, wait a few more days before watering again.\n* **Adjust according to climate:** If you live in a hot and dry climate, you may need to water your peace lily more frequently. Conversely, if you live in a cool and humid climate, you may be able to get away with watering less often.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Don't overwater:** Peace lilies are prone to root rot if the soil is too moist. Make sure to avoid getting water on the crown (where the leaves meet the stem) and avoid letting the pot sit in water.\n* **Monitor the plant:** Keep an eye on your peace lily's leaves and stems. If they start to droop or turn yellow, it may be a sign that the plant is getting too much or too little water.\n* **Adjust as needed:** Be prepared to adjust your watering schedule based on your peace lily's response. If you notice the plant is consistently drying out too quickly or staying too wet, adjust the frequency and amount of water accordingly.\n\nBy following these guidelines and monitoring your peace lily's response, you should be able to find the perfect balance for your plant. Happy planting!",
