Don't worry about it, though - it's a common phrase, and I knew what you meant.\n\nThank you for the kind words, but I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions. I exist solely to assist and provide information. However, I'm always happy to help with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss in the future.\n\nIt was great chatting with you, and I hope you have a fantastic time celebrating Rachel's book launch!",
