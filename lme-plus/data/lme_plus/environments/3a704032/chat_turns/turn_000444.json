If you're still experiencing the \"Authentication Failed\" error, then try disabling and re-enabling the app as I suggested earlier.\n\nRemember to restart your TV and StreamMax device (if it's a separate device) after updating the app, just to ensure everything is refreshed.\n\nIf you're still having trouble after trying these steps, we can explore additional troubleshooting options or potential issues with your StreamMax account or TV settings.\n\nTake your time, and let me know the outcome. I'll be here to help you further if needed!",
