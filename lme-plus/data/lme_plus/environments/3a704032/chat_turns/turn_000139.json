Make sure it's not placed in direct sunlight, which can cause leaf scorch. If you're unsure, observe the light in your space and adjust the plant's position accordingly.\n2. **Watering:** Overwatering is a common mistake that can cause leaf drop. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. Water thoroughly, but make sure the pot drains well to prevent waterlogged soil.\n3. **Humidity:** Peace lilies prefer a humid environment, typically above 50%. You can increase the humidity around your plant by placing it on a tray filled with water and pebbles or using a humidifier.\n4. **Temperature:** Peace lilies prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C). Avoid placing your plant near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n5. **Fertilization:** Feed your peace lily with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n6. **Pruning:** Remove any dead or dying leaves to prevent the spread of disease and encourage new growth. Cut the leaf at the base, making a clean cut with a pair of scissors or pruning shears.\n7. **Pest control:** Inspect your plant for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale. If you notice any, treat the plant with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n8. **Potting mix:** If you repotted your peace lily recently, the new potting mix might be the culprit. Peace lilies prefer well-draining potting mixes with a slightly acidic pH. Consider repotting your plant in a mix specifically designed for tropical plants.\n9. **Acclimation:** Give your peace lily time to adjust to its new environment. It may take a few weeks for the plant to recover from the shock of being moved.\n10. **Monitor and adjust:** Keep a close eye on your plant's condition, and adjust its care accordingly. If you're unsure about any aspect of care, research or consult with a local nursery or gardening expert.\n\nSince you've recently added new plants to your collection, it's possible that one of them might be introducing pests or diseases to your peace lily. Keep an eye out for any signs of trouble and isolate your plants if necessary.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to help your peace lily recover and thrive in its new home. Good luck, and happy planting!",
