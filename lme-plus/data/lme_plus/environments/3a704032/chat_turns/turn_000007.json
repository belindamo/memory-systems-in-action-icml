  "content": "Congratulations on your new peace lily! Losing a few leaves is indeed normal, especially when the plant is adjusting to its new environment. Here are some general tips to help keep your peace lily healthy and thriving:\n\n1. **Lighting:** Peace lilies prefer bright, indirect light but not direct sunlight, which can cause leaf scorch. East- or west-facing windows are ideal. Avoid placing it in a spot with low light, as it may not bloom.\n2. **Watering:** Overwatering is the most common cause of death in peace lilies. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. Water only when the soil feels dry to the touch. Water thoroughly, making sure the pot drains well to prevent waterlogged soil.\n3. **Humidity:** Peace lilies prefer a humid environment, but they can adapt to average humidity levels. To keep your plant happy, you can place the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier nearby.\n4. **Temperature:** Keep your peace lily in a spot with a consistent temperature between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C). Avoid placing it near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n5. **Fertilization:** Feed your peace lily with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n6. **Potting mix:** Use a well-draining potting mix to prevent waterlogged soil. A mix specifically designed for tropical plants or orchids would be a good choice.\n7. **Pruning:** Remove dead or dying leaves and flowers as needed. This will help prevent the spread of disease and encourage healthy growth. Use clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears to prevent spreading diseases.\n8. **Repotting:** Peace lilies typically don't need to be repotted often, but if the plant has outgrown its container or is showing signs of nutrient deficiency, repot it in the spring or summer using a slightly larger pot and fresh potting mix.\n9. **Pest control:** Check your plant regularly for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale. If you notice any, treat the plant with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n10. **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on your plant's overall health, and adjust your care routine as needed. If you're unsure about anything, consult with a local nursery or gardening expert.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your peace lily happy and thriving. Remember, it's normal for your plant to adjust to its new environment, and it may take some time to settle in.\n\nAs for your succulent, succulents have different care requirements than peace lilies. Make sure to research specific care tips for your succulent species to ensure it receives the right amount of water, light, and nutrients.",
