Here are some steps you can take to navigate this situation:\n\n1. Express your concerns: Share your worries with your partner and explain why you're feeling uncertain about their commitment to rebuilding trust. Be specific about the behaviors or actions that are causing your concern.\n\n2. Listen to their perspective: Give your partner the opportunity to share their thoughts and feelings about the situation. Listen actively and try to understand their perspective without interrupting or assuming.\n\n3. Review the expectations: Review your expectations for rebuilding trust and clarify your partner's commitments. Make sure you both have a clear understanding of what is expected of each other, and ensure that there are clear consequences for not following through.\n\n4. Develop a plan: Collaborate with your partner to develop a plan for rebuilding trust that works for both of you. Identify specific actions that each of you will take and time frames for completion.\n\n5. Reassess the relationship: If your partner is not fully committed to rebuilding trust or they continue to engage in behaviors that breach your trust, you may need to reassess the future of your relationship. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and emotional health, and to be honest with yourself about whether the relationship is worth continuing.\n\nRemember that rebuilding trust in a long-distance relationship takes time and effort from both partners.
