  "content": "The $t$ distribution is a probability distribution that is used to make inferences about the population mean when the sample size is small and/or the population standard deviation is unknown. It is a bell-shaped distribution that is similar to the standard normal distribution, but has heavier tails. The shape of the $t$ distribution depends on the degrees of freedom, which is equal to the sample size minus one.\n\nThe $t$ distribution is often used in hypothesis testing to test whether the sample mean is significantly different from a known or hypothesized population mean. In this case, a $t$-test is used to calculate a test statistic, which is then compared to critical values from the $t$ distribution to determine the p-value and make a decision about the null hypothesis.\n\nThe $t$ distribution is also used in confidence interval estimation. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population mean with a certain level of confidence. The $t$ distribution is used to calculate the width of the confidence interval, which depends on the sample size, sample mean, and sample standard deviation.\n\nThe $t$ distribution is similar to the standard normal distribution in that it is symmetric about the mean, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for the standard $t$ distribution. However, as the degrees of freedom increase, the $t$ distribution approaches the standard normal distribution.",
