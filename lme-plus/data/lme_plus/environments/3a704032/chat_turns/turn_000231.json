  "content": "| Concept | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Seeds | The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. |\n| --seed | Accepts whole numbers 0\u20134294967295. Only influences the initial image grid. Model Versions 1, 2, 3, test, and testp are non-deterministic and will produce similar, not identical, images. Using the same prompt+seed+parameters in Model Versions 4 and niji will produce identical images. |\n| --sameseed | Accepts whole numbers 0\u20134294967295. Creates a single large random noise field applied across all images in the initial grid. Compatible with Model Versions 1, 2, 3, test, and testp. Produces very similar generated images. |\n| Example | Jobs run three times with random seeds: prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher. An example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed. Jobs run two times with --seed 123: prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher --seed 123. An example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed. Jobs run three times with --seed 123 using Midjourney Model Version 3: prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher --seed 123 --v 3. Even with the same seed number, early Midjourney Model Versions are non-deterministic, so generated images will look different. |\n| Finding a Job's Seed Number | Use a Discord Emoji Reaction: Find the seed number of a Job in discord by reacting with an \u2709\ufe0f envelope emoji to a Job. Use The Show Command to Bring Back Old Jobs: To get the seed number for a past image, copy the job ID and use the /show <Job ID #> command with that ID to revive the Job. You can then react to the newly regenerated Job with an \u2709\ufe0f envelope emoji. |\n| Changing Seed Numbers | Use the --seed or --sameseed Parameter: Add --seed <value> or --sameseed <value> to the end of your prompt.
