  "content": "I've been sticking to the classics like broccoli and carrots, but I've also been experimenting with roasting other veggies like Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. They add a nice sweetness to the dish that complements the curry nicely.\n\nI haven't tried adding any toppings or garnishes yet, but those are some great ideas! I think a dollop of yogurt or sour cream could really help balance out the spiciness of the curry. And I love the idea of adding some toasted nuts or seeds for crunch.\n\nSpeaking of crunch, I've also been meaning to try making some homemade naan bread to serve with my curry. Do you have any tips for making a good naan? I've heard it can be a bit finicky to get right.",
