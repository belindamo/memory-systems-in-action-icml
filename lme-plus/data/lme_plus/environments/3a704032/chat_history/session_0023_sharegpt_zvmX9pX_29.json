      "content": "| Concept | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Seeds | The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. |\n| --seed | Accepts whole numbers 0\u20134294967295. Only influences the initial image grid. Model Versions 1, 2, 3, test, and testp are non-deterministic and will produce similar, not identical, images. Using the same prompt+seed+parameters in Model Versions 4 and niji will produce identical images. |\n| --sameseed | Accepts whole numbers 0\u20134294967295. Creates a single large random noise field applied across all images in the initial grid. Compatible with Model Versions 1, 2, 3, test, and testp. Produces very similar generated images. |\n| Example | Jobs run three times with random seeds: prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher. An example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed. Jobs run two times with --seed 123: prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher --seed 123. An example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed. Jobs run three times with --seed 123 using Midjourney Model Version 3: prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher --seed 123 --v 3. Even with the same seed number, early Midjourney Model Versions are non-deterministic, so generated images will look different. |\n| Finding a Job's Seed Number | Use a Discord Emoji Reaction: Find the seed number of a Job in discord by reacting with an \u2709\ufe0f envelope emoji to a Job. Use The Show Command to Bring Back Old Jobs: To get the seed number for a past image, copy the job ID and use the /show <Job ID #> command with that ID to revive the Job. You can then react to the newly regenerated Job with an \u2709\ufe0f envelope emoji. |\n| Changing Seed Numbers | Use the --seed or --sameseed Parameter: Add --seed <value> or --sameseed <value> to the end of your prompt.

Lower values will result in blurrier, less detailed results. | /imagine prompt splatter art painting of acorns --stop 90 |\n| N/A | The --stop parameter does not affect a Job while upscaling. However, stopping will produce a softer, less detailed initial image that will influence the level of detail in the final upscaled result. | N/A |\n| 20 | Comparison of the initial grid image and the upscaled version of an image using stop 20 | --stop 20 |\n| 80 | Comparison of the initial grid image and the upscaled version of an image using stop 80 | --stop 80 |\n| 90 | Comparison of the initial grid image and the upscaled version of an image using stop 90 | --stop 90 |\n| 100 | Comparison of the initial grid image and the upscaled version of an image using stop 100 | --stop 100 |\n\nNote:\n\n* The table is based on the information provided and I have rephrased it a bit for clarity.\n* The last two rows of the table are examples of how the stop parameter affects the upscaling process.\n* The Animated Gif showing how the Midjourney Stop parameter is typed could not be added to table format as it's not text but a visual representation."

The --stylize or --s parameter influences how strongly this training is applied. Low stylization values produce images that closely match the prompt but are less artistic. High stylization values create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt.\n--stylize's default value is 100 and accepts integer values 0\u20131000 when using the default [V4 model].\n\nDifferent Midjourney Version Models have different stylize ranges.\n\nVersion 4 Version 3 Test / Testp niji\nStylize default 100 2500 2500 NA\nStylize Range 0\u20131000 625\u201360000 1250\u20135000 NA\nCommon Stylize Settings\nprompt example: /imagine prompt illustrated figs --s 100\n\n--stylize 50\nMidjourney style parameter example.
