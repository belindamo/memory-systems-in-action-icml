She has also made a mark as a singer and composer, creating a unique lyrical and melodic style that complements her bass playing.\n\nChristian McBride has established himself as one of the most prolific and respected bassists of his generation, having played with numerous jazz legends and leading his own bands. His signature sound is characterized by a mix of influences ranging from bebop, funk, and fusion to traditional swing, and his technical skills are widely admired.\n\nJohn Patitucci has built a reputation as a virtuoso bassist who consistently pushes the boundaries of jazz, experimenting with complex rhythms and harmonies while maintaining a strong groove. He has also been recognized for his work as a composer and arranger, contributing to many notable albums in the jazz world."
