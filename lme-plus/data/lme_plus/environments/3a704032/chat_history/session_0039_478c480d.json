Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Social Media**: Try searching for Emily on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn. You can use her name, college, and graduation year to narrow down the search. If you find her, send her a friend request or a message.\n2. **Alumni Directory**: Reach out to your alma mater's alumni association and ask if they have a directory or a way to connect with fellow alumni. They might have Emily's contact information or be able to forward a message to her.\n3. **Classmate Connections**: Think about other friends or acquaintances you had in common with Emily during college. Reach out to them and ask if they have Emily's contact information or know how to get in touch with her.\n4. **Attend Future Alumni Events**: If you're able to attend future alumni events, such as homecoming or reunions, you might be able to run into Emily again or meet someone who can connect you with her.\n5. **People Search Websites**: You can try using people search websites like Whitepages, Pipl, or Spokeo to find Emily's contact information. Keep in mind that these services might not always be accurate, and some may require a subscription or payment.\n6. **Reach Out to Mutual Friends**: If you have mutual friends who are still in touch with Emily, ask them to pass along a message or introduce you two again.\n\nRemember to respect Emily's privacy and boundaries if you do manage to get in touch with her. It's possible she might not have the same contact information or might not want to reconnect.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you're able to reconnect with your old friend!"
