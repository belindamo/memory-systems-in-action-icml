They're both easy to use, accessible on multiple devices, and can send you reminders and notifications to help you stay on track.\n\nHere's a suggested setup for you:\n\n**Google Calendar (or Apple Calendar) Setup:**\n\n1. Create a new calendar or use an existing one.\n2. Set up the following recurring events:\n\t* **Morning Social Media Check**: 7:15 am - 7:45 am (30 minutes)\n\t* **Exercise**: 7:30 am - 8:00 am (30 minutes)\n\t* **Lunch Break**: 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm (1 hour)\n\t* **Focused Work**: 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm (2 hours)\n\t* **Evening Social Media Check**: 9:00 pm - 9:30 pm (30 minutes)\n3. Set reminders for each event:\n\t* You can set reminders 15-30 minutes before each event to ensure you're on track.\n\t* For example, set a reminder at 7:00 am for your morning social media check and exercise.\n4. Customize your notification settings:\n\t* Choose how you want to receive notifications (e.g., pop-ups, emails, or mobile notifications).\n\t* Set the notification time and frequency to fit your preferences.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider setting a \"Do Not Disturb\" mode on your phone or computer during your focused work hours to minimize distractions.\n* You can also use a website blocker or app like Freedom, SelfControl, or StayFocusd to limit your social media access during certain times of the day.\n* Review your schedule regularly and adjust as needed to ensure it continues to work for you.\n\nWhich digital calendar do you prefer to use, Google Calendar or Apple Calendar? Or would you like me to recommend a task management app like Todoist or Trello instead?",
