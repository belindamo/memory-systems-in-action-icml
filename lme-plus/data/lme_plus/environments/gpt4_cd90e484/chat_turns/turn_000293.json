  "content": "I'm glad you're enthusiastic about the book and the author, even if you can't quite recall the title. Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific author events or schedules. However, I can suggest a few ways to help you find out about upcoming author events in your area:\n\n1. **Check the library's website or social media**: Since you attended the event at the local library, they might have a calendar of upcoming events or a newsletter that lists author readings and signings. You can also try checking their social media pages for updates.\n2. **Look up local bookstores**: Independent bookstores, in particular, often host author events, readings, and signings. You can visit their websites, social media, or give them a call to ask about upcoming events.\n3. **Author event calendars**: Websites like **BookTour.com**, **AuthorsOnTour.com**, or **LiteraryHub.com** list author events and readings across various cities. You can filter by location and author to find relevant events.\n4. **Follow local literary organizations**: Many cities have literary organizations, writing groups, or festivals that host author events. Look for these organizations in your area and follow their social media or sign up for their newsletters to stay informed.\n5. **Reach out to the author**: If you're unable to find information about the author's schedule, you can try contacting them directly through their website or social media. They might be able to provide you with information about upcoming events or readings.\n\nRemember to also try to recall any details about the book or the author's reading that might help you identify the title or find similar authors. Good luck, and I hope you get to attend more author events and discover new books!",
