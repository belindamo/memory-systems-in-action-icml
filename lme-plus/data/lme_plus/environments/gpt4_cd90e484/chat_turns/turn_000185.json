  "content": "I really like the idea of a zone-based design and incorporating multi-functional elements to maximize space. I think it's essential to have a clear path for circulation between each zone, and I appreciate the suggestion to consider sightlines and sunlight when placing the herb garden. I'm also intrigued by the idea of adding a water feature, like a small fountain or birdbath, to create a soothing atmosphere. \n\nCan you provide more information on how to incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into my patio design? I'm interested in learning more about the different types of systems available and how to integrate them into my outdoor space.",
