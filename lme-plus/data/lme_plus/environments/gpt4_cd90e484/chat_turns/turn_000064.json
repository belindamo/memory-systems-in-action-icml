In this chapter, we will explore the often-overlooked role of the glutes in back pain and how to use the power in your posterior to alleviate discomfort.\n\nBack pain is a common complaint among people of all ages and lifestyles. It can be caused by various factors, such as poor posture, muscle imbalances, injury, or underlying medical conditions. Many people turn to pain medication, physical therapy, or surgery to manage their symptoms. However, there are other ways to address back pain that involve using the muscles in your buttocks.\n\nThe glutes are the largest and most powerful muscles in your body, comprising the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus. They are responsible for hip extension, abduction, and external rotation, and they work together with the muscles in your core to stabilize your spine and pelvis.\n\nIn this chapter, we will discuss how to activate and strengthen your glutes to support your spine and alleviate back pain. We will also explore common reasons why the glutes may not be functioning properly, such as trigger points or muscle imbalances, and how to address these issues.\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the importance of your glutes in back pain relief and the tools and techniques needed to activate and strengthen them. So, let's get started!",
