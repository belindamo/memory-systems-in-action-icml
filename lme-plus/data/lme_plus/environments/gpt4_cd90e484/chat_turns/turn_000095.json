  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot make decisions for you as I don't know your specific situation. However, I can tell you that prioritizing one over the other will depend on many factors such as your work-life balance needs, career aspirations, and relationship needs. Your relationship and your work are both important aspects of your life, so it's best to find a balance between them that works for you. I would suggest that you communicate with your partner about your work commitments and create a plan to balance your time between work and your relationship. Keep in mind that what works for one person may not work for another, so it is important to find a balance that works best for your unique situation.",
