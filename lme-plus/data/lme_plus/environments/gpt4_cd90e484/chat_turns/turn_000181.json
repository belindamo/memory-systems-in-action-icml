  "content": "I think I'm still undecided, but I'm definitely considering how a patio area could be designed to accommodate both adults and kids. I like the idea of having a space that's flexible and can be used for different activities. For my sister and brother-in-law's property, I think a themed play area like a fairy garden or a pirate ship would be amazing for their future kids. Do you have any suggestions on how to incorporate composting into their outdoor space, since I've been doing it in my own backyard and it's been really rewarding?",
