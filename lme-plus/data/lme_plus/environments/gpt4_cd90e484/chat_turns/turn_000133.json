  "content": "I think what I enjoy most about watercolor painting is the sense of calm and relaxation it brings me. It's a great way for me to unwind after a long day, and I love the feeling of creating something beautiful from scratch.\n\nI've tried a few different types of watercolor paper, but I'm still experimenting to find my favorite. I've heard that cold press paper is great for beginners, but I've also been curious about trying hot press paper for more detailed work. Do you have any recommendations for paper brands or types that are good for beginners?\n\nAlso, I've been thinking about investing in a watercolor palette. Do you think it's worth it, or can I just stick with the pans of paint I have for now?",
