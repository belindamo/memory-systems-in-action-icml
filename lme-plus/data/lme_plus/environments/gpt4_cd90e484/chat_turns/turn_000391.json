Here are some tips to help you find the perfect necklace:\n\n**1. Identify the dominant color:** Take a closer look at your Urban Decay eyeshadow palette and identify the dominant color that you love the most. Is it a bold, bright shade or a more subtle, neutral tone?\n**2. Determine the undertones:** Consider the undertones of the eyeshadow color. Is it warm, cool, or neutral? This will help you find a necklace that complements the color rather than clashes with it.\n**3. Look for similar hues:** Search for necklaces that feature similar hues to your eyeshadow color. You can search online or visit a local jewelry store to find options.\n**4. Consider the finish:** Think about the finish of the necklace. Do you prefer a bold, shiny finish or a more subtle, matte finish? This can affect how the necklace interacts with the eyeshadow color.\n**5. Don't be afraid to experiment:** Don't be limited to an exact match. Experiment with different shades and tones to find a necklace that complements the eyeshadow color without matching it exactly.\n\nSome popular online destinations for finding jewelry that matches eyeshadow colors include:\n\n* **ASOS**: They have a vast selection of jewelry in various colors and finishes.\n* **BaubleBar**: This online jewelry retailer offers a wide range of bold, statement pieces that might match your eyeshadow color.\n* **Etsy**: If you're looking for a unique, handmade piece, Etsy is a great place to find one-of-a-kind jewelry that matches your eyeshadow color.\n\nWhen searching online, use keywords like \"teal necklace\" or \"coral pink jewelry\" to find relevant results. You can also try searching for \"jewelry inspired by [brand name]\" or \"makeup-inspired jewelry\" to find pieces that are specifically designed to match popular eyeshadow colors.\n\nRemember, the goal is to find a necklace that complements your eyeshadow color, not to match it exactly. Have fun experimenting and finding the perfect piece to complete your look!",
