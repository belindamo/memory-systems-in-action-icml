  "content": "I really like the ideas, especially the one with the denim jacket. I've been looking for ways to dress down my dresses for casual events. By the way, I got the dresses at a great price too - I picked up a few summer dresses from the Who What Wear collection at Target, and they were all super affordable. Now, I'm thinking of adding some sandals to my collection. Do you have any recommendations for comfortable and affordable sandals that would go well with these dresses?",
