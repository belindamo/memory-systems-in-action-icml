It's possible that she's a self-published or emerging poet, or the name might be incorrect.\n\nHowever, based on your description of her poetry, I can suggest some poets and collections that might resonate with you. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Mary Oliver**: Known for her lyrical and evocative poetry, Oliver often explores themes of nature, identity, and the human experience. Try her collection \"Wild Geese\" or \"Devotions\".\n2. **Aimee Nezhukumatathil**: This Indian-American poet writes about identity, social justice, and the natural world. Her collection \"Oceanic\" is a great example of her lyrical and evocative style.\n3. **Ada Lim\u00f3n**: Lim\u00f3n's poetry often explores themes of identity, family, and social justice, with a strong focus on the natural world. Her collection \"Bright Dead Things\" is a great starting point.\n4. **Danez Smith**: Smith's poetry is known for its lyricism and exploration of identity, race, and social justice. Their collection \"Homie\" is a powerful and evocative read.\n5. ** Warsan Shire**: A British-Somali poet, Shire's work often explores themes of identity, displacement, and social justice. Her collection \"Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth\" is a powerful and moving read.\n\nThese poets and collections might not be an exact match to Emily Patel's style, but they share some similarities with the themes and styles you mentioned. I hope you find something that resonates with you!",
