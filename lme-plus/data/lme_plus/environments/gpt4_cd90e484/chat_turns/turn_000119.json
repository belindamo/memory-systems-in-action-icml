  "content": "A man walks into a pub and says, \"Give me three pints of Guinness, please.\"\n\nSo the bartender brings him three pints and the man proceeds to alternately sip one, then the other, then the third until they're gone.\n\nHe then orders three more and the bartender says, \"Sir, I know you like them cold, so you can start with one and I'll bring you a fresh one as soon as you're low.\"\n\nThe man says, \"You don't understand. I have two brothers, one in Australia and one in the States. We made a vow to each other that every Saturday night we'd still drink together. So right now, my brothers have three Guinness Stouts too and we're drinking together.\"\n\nThe bartender thinks it's a wonderful tradition and every week he sets up the guy's three beers as soon as he enters in the bar. Then one week, the man comes in and orders only two. He drinks them, then orders two more. The bartender sadly says, \"Knowing your tradition, I'd just like to just say that I'm sorry that one of your brothers died.\"\n\nThe man replies, \"Oh, my brothers are fine \u2013 I just quit drinking.\"",
