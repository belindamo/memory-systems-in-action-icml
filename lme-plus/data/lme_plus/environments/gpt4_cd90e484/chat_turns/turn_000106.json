Let's make sure that the `jobs` variable in `main.py` contains the sample data and is being passed correctly.\n\nPlease double-check your `main.py` file to ensure it has the following content:\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\njobs = [\n    {\n        'title': 'Web Developer',\n        'company': 'Tech Co.',\n        'description': 'We are looking for an experienced Web Developer to join our team.'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Graphic Designer',\n        'company': 'Design Inc.',\n        'description': 'We are seeking a creative Graphic Designer to work on various projects.'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Data Analyst',\n        'company': 'Analytics Ltd.',\n        'description': 'We are looking for a skilled Data Analyst to help us make data-driven decisions.'\n    }\n]\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef job_posting():\n    return render_template('job_posting.html', jobs=jobs)\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=3000, debug=True)\n```\nAfter verifying that the `main.py` file is correct, save it and restart your Flask application. Refresh the page in your browser, and you should now see the example job postings.\n\nIf you still only see the \"No jobs found\" message, please let me know, and I will help you troubleshoot the issue further.",
