The Steep Ravine Trail is a fantastic choice, and I'm excited for you!\n\nRegarding your question, the view from the summit of Mount Tamalpais is indeed breathtaking, but the visibility of the Pacific Ocean can vary depending on several factors.\n\n**What to Expect:**\n\n* **On a clear day:** If the weather is clear, you'll have an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean from the summit. You'll be able to see the coastline stretching from the Marin Headlands to the north, all the way to the Santa Cruz Mountains to the south. It's a truly stunning sight!\n* **With fog or haze:** If there's fog or haze, the view might be limited. The Pacific Ocean might be visible, but it might be shrouded in mist, reducing visibility. This is more common during the summer months or when a high-pressure system is dominant.\n* **With clouds:** If there are clouds, you might not be able to see the Pacific Ocean at all. However, the clouds can add a dramatic touch to the scenery, making for some amazing photos!\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* **Time your hike:** Try to reach the summit around late morning or early afternoon when the sun is high, and the air is usually clearer.\n* **Check the weather forecast:** Before you head out, check the weather forecast to increase your chances of having a clear view.\n* **Be prepared:** Bring layers, as the summit can be windy and chilly, even on a clear day.\n\nRemember, the view from the summit is just one part of the experience. The Steep Ravine Trail offers stunning scenery throughout, with lush forests, waterfalls, and unique rock formations.\n\nEnjoy your hike, and I hope you get to witness the majestic view of the Pacific Ocean from the summit of Mount Tamalpais!",
