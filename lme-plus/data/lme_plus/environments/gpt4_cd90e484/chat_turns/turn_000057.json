  "content": "going to correct this in a day or a week. Keep working at it. Eventually, your glutes will \u201cwake up,\u201d you will be able to do these exercises and movements, and your back (and your life) will be much better. Combined with the daily core exercises, these are the foundations for your recovery, if you have a glute problem. You have to do the exercises in Chapter 10 (core) and this one religiously. Read the rest of the book but make these chapters the heart of your routine. \nIf you did struggle with this chapter, the next chapter may help. \u201cTrigger points,\u201d spasms or \u201cknots\u201d in the muscles of your butt, can be a significant barrier to waking up and using the glutes. Read about them and see if that\u2019s part of your problem. Then come back and try this chapter again.",
