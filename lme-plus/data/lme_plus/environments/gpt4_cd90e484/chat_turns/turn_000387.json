In fact, sandals and jeans are a great combo for a casual, summer outfit. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:\n\n**1. Balance the volume:** If you're wearing a loose-fitting pair of jeans, balance the volume with a more fitted top. If you're wearing a skinnier pair of jeans, you can opt for a flowier top.\n**2. Play with proportions:** Pairing sandals with jeans can create a fun, playful contrast between the casual, open-toe shoe and the more substantial pant. Emphasize this contrast by pairing a flowy top with a pair of distressed or boyfriend jeans.\n**3. Add a pop of color:** Sandals are a great opportunity to add a pop of color to your outfit. Choose a bold, bright color or a fun pattern to add some visual interest to your overall look.\n**4. Accessorize wisely:** Keep jewelry to a minimum, as the focus should be on your sandals and jeans. A simple necklace or a pair of stud earrings will suffice.\n**5. Own the look:** Confidence is key! Walk into that casual summer gathering feeling comfortable and confident in your outfit, and you'll be sure to turn heads.\n\nSome popular ways to style sandals with jeans include:\n\n* A flowy white or pastel-colored top with distressed denim jeans\n* A graphic tee with a pair of high-waisted, straight-leg jeans\n* A lightweight blouse with a pair of boyfriend jeans and a denim jacket\n\nRemember, the key is to keep the outfit casual, comfortable, and playful. You can't go wrong with a classic combo like sandals and jeans!",
