By starting with lower weights and higher reps, you'll be able to build endurance and strength without putting too much stress on your muscles.\n\nIncorporating exercises that mimic running movements, such as step-ups and lunges, will also help improve your running form and efficiency. These exercises will target the specific muscle groups used in running, including your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves.\n\nRemember to also focus on exercises that target your core and hip stabilizers, such as planks, side planks, and glute bridges. These exercises will help improve your running posture, balance, and stability, which can reduce your risk of injury and improve your overall running performance.\n\nPrioritizing stretching and foam rolling is also crucial to improve your flexibility and reduce muscle soreness. Make sure to stretch your major muscle groups, including your hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, and hip flexors, after your runs and strength training sessions. Foam rolling can also help reduce muscle soreness and improve recovery by increasing blood flow and reducing inflammation.\n\nHere's an example of a lower body and core strength training workout you can follow:\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\n* 5-10 minutes of light cardio (jogging, jumping jacks, etc.)\n* Dynamic stretching (leg swings, lunges, etc.)\n\n**Squats:**\n\n* 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n* Focus on keeping your back straight, engaging your core, and lowering your body down slowly\n\n**Lunges:**\n\n* 3 sets of 12-15 reps (per leg)\n* Focus on keeping your front knee behind your toes, engaging your core, and lowering your body down slowly\n\n**Step-ups:**\n\n* 3 sets of 12-15 reps (per leg)\n* Focus on keeping your back straight, engaging your core, and stepping up slowly\n\n**Glute bridges:**\n\n* 3 sets of 12-15 reps\n* Focus on squeezing your glutes and lifting your hips up slowly\n\n**Plank:**\n\n* 3 sets of 30-60 seconds\n* Focus on engaging your core, keeping your back straight, and holding the position for the entire duration\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\n* 5-10 minutes of stretching (focusing on your lower body and core)\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust your workout routine as needed. It's also important to incorporate rest days and cross-training to avoid overtraining and prevent injuries.\n\nHow does this workout routine sound? Are there any modifications or changes you'd like to make?",
