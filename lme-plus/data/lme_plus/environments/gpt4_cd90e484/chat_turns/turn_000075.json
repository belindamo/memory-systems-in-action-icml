  "content": "I think it's a great idea to propose a charity event that focuses on literacy, given the organizations I'm interested in support educational resources for underprivileged kids. I'll definitely highlight the benefits of the event, such as raising awareness about the importance of literacy and education, providing tangible resources, and engaging the local community. Do you think it would be a good idea to also propose a volunteer opportunity for the event, such as having volunteers help sort and package books for the book drive or assist with the literacy fair?",
