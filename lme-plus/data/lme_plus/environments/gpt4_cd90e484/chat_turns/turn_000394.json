  "content": "I'm looking for some tips on improving my bird identification skills. I've been listening to bird calls online for about a month now, and it's been helping, but I'm still not confident in my abilities. By the way, I did manage to sneak in some birding time a week ago when I took a walk around my neighborhood after dinner. I saw a few common birds like robins and sparrows, but nothing too exciting. Except, I did notice that the American goldfinches seem to be returning to the area, which is always a nice sign of spring.",
