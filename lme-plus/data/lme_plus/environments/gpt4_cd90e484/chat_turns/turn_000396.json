  "content": "I think the most challenging part of bird identification for me is when I see a bird that's not a clear match to any species in my field guide. Sometimes the pictures don't quite match what I'm seeing, or the bird is at an angle that makes it hard to get a good look. That's when I wish I had a better understanding of bird anatomy and could identify it based on its shape and size.",
