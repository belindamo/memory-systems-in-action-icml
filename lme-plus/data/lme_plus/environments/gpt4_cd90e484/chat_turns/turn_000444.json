I've already played The Witcher 3, but I'll definitely check out Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire. Have you heard about the new RPG \"Eternity's Edge\" that's coming out later this year? I got to play it at a gaming event a few weeks ago, and it looked really promising.",
