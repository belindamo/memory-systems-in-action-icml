  "content": "RPGs and action-adventure games are two of the most exciting genres out there.\n\nI'm glad you're interested in checking out Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire. Both are excellent games that offer deep storytelling, engaging combat, and rich worlds to explore.\n\nRegarding Eternity's Edge, I'm afraid I have some bad news. As a conversational AI, I don't have have access to real-time information, and I couldn't find any information about an RPG called \"Eternity's Edge\" that's scheduled to release this year. It's possible that it's a lesser-known title, a working title, or even a game that's still in development.\n\nHowever, I'd love to hear more about your experience playing it at the gaming event! What were your impressions of the game? What features or mechanics stood out to you? Was there anything that particularly excited you about the game?\n\nAdditionally, if you're interested in other RPGs and action-adventure games, here are a few more recommendations:\n\n* **Dragon Age: Inquisition**: A high-fantasy RPG with a rich story, engaging combat, and a large open world.\n* **Monster Hunter: World**: An action-RPG with a focus on cooperative play and hunting massive monsters in a vast open world.\n* **Horizon Zero Dawn**: An action-RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world where you hunt robotic creatures and uncover the secrets of a forgotten civilization.\n* **Tyranny**: A dark fantasy RPG with a focus on storytelling, player choice, and complex combat mechanics.\n* **Shadow of the Tomb Raider**: An action-adventure game that concludes the reboot trilogy, with a focus on exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving.\n\nLet me know if any of these catch your eye, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
