  "content": "Sending a spacecraft to measure the distance of stars would be highly impractical, if not impossible. Even the nearest star to us, Proxima Centauri, is more than four light-years away. This means that it would take a spacecraft more than four years just to reach that star, and then it would have to travel back another four years to transmit any data it collected. Additionally, designing a spacecraft to collect data on distances of stars specifically would be highly complex and require advanced technology that hasn't been developed yet.\n\nParallax measurements, while complex, can be done with observation equipment that is relatively accessible to astronomers. By making precise measurements of the apparent shift in a star's position over time, astronomers can use trigonometry to calculate its distance. While it may take time to measure from different points, the data collected is highly accurate and reliable. Plus, parallax measurements can be done from Earth, which is much more cost-effective than sending a spacecraft into deep space.",
