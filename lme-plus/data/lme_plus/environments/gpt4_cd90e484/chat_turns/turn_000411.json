  "content": "That sounds AMAZING! Your chicken shawarma wrap recipe is a perfect example of how sumac can elevate a dish to new heights. The combination of sumac, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil must give the chicken a fantastic flavor profile.\n\nShawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food, and it's great that you're making your own version at home. The addition of sumac to the marinade is a genius move, as it adds a tangy, slightly sour flavor that complements the richness of the chicken and the creaminess of the tahini sauce.\n\nI'm sure your family loves the combination of textures and flavors in your shawarma wrap: the juicy grilled chicken, the crispy veggies, the soft pita bread, and the creamy tahini sauce. It's a match made in heaven!\n\nUsing sumac in a marinade is a great way to infuse the chicken with flavor, and it's a versatile spice that pairs well with many other ingredients. Have you considered experimenting with other spices or herbs in your marinade, such as cumin, coriander, or oregano? They could add interesting depth and warmth to your shawarma.\n\nAlso, what's your secret to making the perfect tahini sauce? Do you have a favorite recipe or ratio of tahini to lemon juice to garlic?\n\nKeep sharing your culinary creations, and I'll be happy to provide feedback and suggestions!",
