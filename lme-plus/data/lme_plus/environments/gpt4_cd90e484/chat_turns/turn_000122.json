  "content": "The punchline of the joke subverts our expectations by revealing that the man has actually quit drinking, which goes against what we might expect based on his previous behavior of ordering and drinking three pints of Guinness every week. This sudden change in the man's behavior is unexpected and catches us off guard, which is part of what makes the punchline funny.\n\nIn addition to the unexpected twist in the punchline, the joke also uses misdirection by leading us to believe that the man's brothers have died, only to reveal that they are actually still alive. This further adds to the surprise and humor of the joke.\n\nOverall, the punchline of the joke relies on a combination of unexpected twists and misdirection to create a sense of surprise and humor.",
