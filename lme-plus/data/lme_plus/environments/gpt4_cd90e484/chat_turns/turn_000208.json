  "content": "The Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro do support wireless charging, which is a convenient feature that allows you to recharge your earbuds without having to deal with cables.\n\nThe Galaxy Buds Pro support Qi-compatible wireless charging, which means you can use a Qi-certified wireless charging pad or a wireless power bank like your Anker portable charger.\n\nTo confirm, I checked the specifications of your Anker portable charger, and it appears to be a Qi-compatible charger. As long as your Anker charger supports wireless charging and has enough power to charge the Galaxy Buds Pro, you should be able to use it to charge your earbuds wirelessly.\n\nHere are some details to keep in mind:\n\n* The Galaxy Buds Pro case supports wireless charging at up to 5W.\n* Your Anker portable charger has a 10,000mAh capacity, which should be more than enough to charge the Galaxy Buds Pro case multiple times.\n* To charge the Galaxy Buds Pro wirelessly, simply place the earbuds case on the wireless charging surface of your Anker charger. Make sure the case is aligned properly and the charger is turned on.\n* Wireless charging may take a bit longer than charging via a cable, but it's a convenient option when you're on-the-go.\n\nBefore you try wireless charging, ensure that your Anker charger is compatible with the Galaxy Buds Pro by checking the following:\n\n* Look for the Qi logo on your Anker charger to confirm it supports Qi wireless charging.\n* Check the charger's specifications to ensure it supports 5W wireless charging, which is the maximum power required by the Galaxy Buds Pro case.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can always consult the user manuals or contact Anker's customer support for more information.\n\nI hope this helps, and you'll be able to enjoy wireless charging with your Galaxy Buds Pro and Anker portable charger!",
