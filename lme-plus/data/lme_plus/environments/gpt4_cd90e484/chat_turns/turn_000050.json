  "content": "Parallax is the apparent displacement or shift in the position of an object when viewed from two different points. In astronomy, parallax is used to determine the distance of objects that are too far away to measure directly, such as stars.\n\nWhen astronomers observe a star from two different points in Earth's orbit around the sun, they will see the star appear to shift slightly. The amount of the shift depends on the distance between the two observation points (which is known as the baseline), as well as the distance to the star. By measuring the angular shift in the star's position and knowing the baseline, astronomers can calculate the star's distance using trigonometry.\n\nIn the case of Regulus, astronomers used parallax to measure its distance from Earth by observing the star from two points six months apart. The baseline used was the distance between Earth's position in its orbit when it is closest to Regulus and when it is farthest away. The angular shift observed was small, but the precise measurements conducted by astronomers allowed them to determine that Regulus is approximately 79 light-years away from Earth.",
