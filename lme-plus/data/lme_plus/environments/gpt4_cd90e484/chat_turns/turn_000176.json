  "content": "I'm glad you're excited about poetry! However, I have to clarify again that I couldn't find any information on a poet named Emily Patel or her books. It's possible that she's an emerging poet or not well-known, or maybe there's a mistake in the name.\n\nThat being said, I think taking a broad-based course is a great idea! It will give you a solid foundation in writing principles and help you develop your skills in various genres. From there, you can focus on poetry or any other genre that interests you.\n\nAs you explore poetry, you might find it helpful to read works from different poets and styles to broaden your understanding and appreciation of the genre. You can also try writing exercises and prompts to help you develop your own unique voice and style.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of learning and growing as a writer!",
