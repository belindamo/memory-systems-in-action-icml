  "content": "For field guides, I highly recommend the following:\n\n1. **\"Birds of Costa Rica\" by Richard Garrigues and Robert Dean**: This is a comprehensive and authoritative guide, covering over 850 species found in Costa Rica. It's an excellent resource for identifying birds, with detailed descriptions, range maps, and illustrations.\n2. **\"The Sibley Guide to Birds\" by David Allen Sibley**: While not exclusively focused on Costa Rica, this guide covers the birds of Central America, including Costa Rica. It's a valuable resource for its detailed illustrations, range maps, and identification tips.\n\nAs for apps, here are some popular ones that can help you identify birds in the field:\n\n1. **Merlin Bird ID** (free): This app, developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, uses AI-powered identification tools to help you identify birds. It's available for both iOS and Android devices.\n2. **iBird Pro** (paid): This app offers comprehensive coverage of North and Central American birds, including Costa Rica. It features detailed descriptions, range maps, and high-quality images.\n3. **Birds of Costa Rica** (paid): This app, developed by Audubon Guides, covers over 850 species found in Costa Rica. It includes detailed descriptions, range maps, and images, as well as audio recordings of bird calls.\n4. **eBird Mobile** (free): While not exclusively a field guide app, eBird Mobile allows you to record and submit your bird sightings, which can be helpful for tracking your observations and contributing to citizen science projects.\n\nWhen choosing a field guide or app, consider the following factors:\n\n* Coverage: Does the guide or app cover the specific region you'll be visiting (in this case, Costa Rica)?\n* Species coverage: Does it include all the species you're likely to encounter, or is it more focused on common or iconic birds?\n* Image quality: Are the images high-quality and helpful for identification?\n* User interface: Is the guide or app easy to navigate, with intuitive menus and search functions?\n* Updates: Are the guide or app regularly updated to reflect new research, species discoveries, or changes in bird ranges?\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to have multiple resources at your disposal, as different guides and apps may offer unique insights or perspectives that can aid in identification. Happy birding!",
