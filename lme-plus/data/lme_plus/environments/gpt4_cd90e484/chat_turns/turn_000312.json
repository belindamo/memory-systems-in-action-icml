  "content": "I'm thinking of starting with 2 strength training sessions per week and focusing on exercises that target my lower body and core. I want to improve my overall running efficiency and reduce my risk of injury. I'll start with lower weights and higher reps and gradually increase the intensity as I build strength. I'll also make sure to incorporate exercises that mimic running movements, such as step-ups and lunges. Additionally, I'll prioritize stretching and foam rolling to improve my flexibility and reduce muscle soreness.",
