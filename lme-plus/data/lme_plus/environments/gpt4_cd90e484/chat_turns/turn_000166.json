It's possible that she's an emerging poet or not well-known, or maybe there's a mistake in the name.\n\nIf you could provide me with more context or details about Emily Patel's poetry, such as the titles of the books you bought, the themes or styles of her work, or what you enjoy about her poetry, I can try to suggest similar poets or collections that might resonate with you.\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to exploring other poets and styles, I can offer some general recommendations based on popular and acclaimed poetry collections. Let me know!",
