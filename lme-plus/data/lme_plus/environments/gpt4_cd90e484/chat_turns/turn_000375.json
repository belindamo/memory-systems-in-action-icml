  "content": "Crusty bread or crackers are the perfect accompaniment to soak up the flavorful broth of your Indian-inspired lentil soup. Here are some suggestions:\n\n**Crusty Bread:**\n\n1. **Naan bread:** A classic Indian flatbread, naan is a perfect match for this soup. You can find naan bread at most Indian grocery stores or make your own at home.\n2. **Baguette:** A crusty baguette is a great substitute for naan bread. Look for a day-old baguette for the best results.\n3. **Ciabatta:** This Italian bread has a slightly firmer texture than baguette and a slightly sweet flavor that pairs well with the spices in the soup.\n\n**Crackers:**\n\n1. **Naan crisps:** If you can't find naan bread, naan crisps are a great alternative. They're crunchy, flavorful, and pair perfectly with the soup.\n2. **Papadum:** Thin, crispy papadum is a popular Indian snack that pairs well with the soup. You can find papadum at most Indian grocery stores.\n3. **Cracked wheat thins:** A crunchy, whole-grain cracker that pairs well with the earthy flavors of the lentils.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n1. **Rice:** If you prefer a more traditional Indian pairing, serve the soup with a side of basmati rice or brown rice.\n2. **Roti:** A type of Indian flatbread, roti is a great option if you can find it in your area.\n3. **Flatbread crackers:** Look for flatbread crackers made with whole grains like whole wheat, oats, or barley for a nutritious and flavorful pairing.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Toast or grill the bread:** Toasting or grilling the bread gives it a crispy texture that's perfect for dipping into the soup.\n2. **Add a dollop of yogurt:** A dollop of yogurt or raita (a yogurt-based side dish) can help cool down the spiciness of the soup and add a tangy flavor.\n3. **Garnish with fresh herbs:** Add a sprinkle of fresh cilantro, parsley, or scallions to the soup for a fresh, herbaceous flavor.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find the perfect accompaniment to your Indian-inspired lentil soup!",
