Here are some recommendations for you:\n\n**Things to consider before choosing a brush set:**\n\n1. **Natural or Synthetic Hair:** Natural hair brushes (e.g., sable, squirrel, mongoose) are ideal for watercolor, as they hold a lot of water and pigment.

Look for a set that includes round, flat, and mop brushes.\n3. **Quality of Construction:** A well-made brush will last longer and perform better.

      "content": "The age-old debate: natural hair vs synthetic hair brushes! Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these differences will help you choose the right brushes for your watercolor journey.\n\n**Natural Hair Brushes:**\n\nNatural hair brushes are made from animal hair, typically from sable, squirrel, or mongoose. These hairs are prized for their unique characteristics, which make them ideal for watercolor painting:\n\n1. **Excellent water-holding capacity:** Natural hair brushes can hold a tremendous amount of water, allowing for smooth, even washes and subtle color gradations.\n2. **Flexibility and spring:** Natural hair brushes have a unique flexibility, which enables them to absorb and release water and pigment evenly.\n3. **Pointed tips:** The natural hair tips are extremely fine, allowing for precise, delicate lines and details.\n4. **Soft, gentle touch:** Natural hair brushes are gentle on the paper, reducing the risk of scratching or damaging the surface.\n\nHowever, natural hair brushes also have some drawbacks:\n\n1. **Expensive:** High-quality natural hair brushes can be quite expensive, especially those made from rare or exotic materials.\n2. **Delicate:** Natural hair brushes are more prone to damage from wear and tear, and require careful cleaning and storage to maintain their performance.\n3. **Sensitive to temperature and humidity:** Natural hair brushes can be affected by changes in temperature and humidity, which may impact their performance.\n\n**Synthetic Hair Brushes:**\n\nSynthetic hair brushes, on the other hand, are made from man-made materials, such as nylon, polyester, or Taklon. While they may not match the performance of natural hair brushes, they have their own advantages:\n\n1. **Affordable:** Synthetic hair brushes are generally less expensive than natural hair brushes, making them a more accessible option for many artists.\n2. **Durable:** Synthetic hair brushes are more resistant to wear and tear, and can withstand rough handling and cleaning.\n3. **Easy to clean:** Synthetic hair brushes are often easier to clean and maintain than natural hair brushes.\n4. **Less sensitive to temperature and humidity:** Synthetic hair brushes are less affected by changes in temperature and humidity.\n\nHowever, synthetic hair brushes also have some limitations:\n\n1. **Limited water-holding capacity:** Synthetic hair brushes may not hold as much water as natural hair brushes, which can affect their performance in certain techniques.\n2. **Stiffer, less flexible:** Synthetic hair brushes tend to be stiffer and less flexible than natural hair brushes, which can make them less suitable for delicate, precise work.\n3. **May shed or lose shape:** Synthetic hair brushes can shed or lose their shape over time, which can affect their performance.\n\n**Hybrid Brushes:**\n\nSome manufacturers offer hybrid brushes that combine natural and synthetic materials. These brushes aim to offer the best of both worlds, with the durability and affordability of synthetic materials and the performance of natural hair.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nNatural hair brushes are ideal for watercolor artists who:\n\n* Value exceptional water-holding capacity and flexibility\n* Need precise, delicate lines and details\n* Are willing to invest in high-quality brushes and take care of them properly\n\nSynthetic hair brushes are suitable for watercolor artists who:\n\n* Are on a budget or looking for an affordable option\n* Need durable, easy-to-clean brushes\n* Don't require the highest level of precision or water-holding capacity\n\nUltimately, the choice between natural and synthetic hair brushes comes down to your personal preferences, painting style, and budget."

You can definitely stick with the pans of paint you have for now and experiment with different color combinations.\n\nHowever, if you find that you're enjoying watercolor painting and want to take your skills to the next level, investing in a palette might be worth considering. You can start with a small, portable palette and gradually build up your collection of paints.\n\nSome popular watercolor palette options for beginners include:\n\n1. **Winsor & Newton Cotman**: A compact, affordable palette that's perfect for beginners.\n2. **Daniel Smith**: A high-quality, compact palette that's ideal for traveling or studio work.\n3. **Schmincke**: A German-made palette that's known for its excellent quality and durability.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of creating!"
