Can TripIt also help me with booking flights and hotels, or is it mainly just for tracking and organizing my itineraries?"

      "content": "United Airlines is a great choice! TripIt can definitely help you track your miles with United, and it's just one of the many features that make it an excellent travel companion.\n\nWhile TripIt is primarily known for its itinerary organization and tracking features, it also offers some booking capabilities, although they're limited compared to a traditional online travel agency (OTA) like Expedia or Kayak. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Flight Booking:**\n\n1. **Book flights**: TripIt allows you to book flights directly within the app or website, but only for select airlines, including United Airlines.\n2. **Price tracking**: You can set up price alerts for specific flights or routes, and TripIt will notify you when prices drop.\n3. **Flight search**: TripIt provides a basic flight search feature, but it's not as comprehensive as a dedicated flight search engine like Google Flights or Skyscanner.\n\n**Hotel Booking:**\n\n1. **Book hotels**: TripIt partners with booking sites like Booking.com, Hotels.com, and Expedia to offer hotel booking capabilities.\n2. **Hotel search**: You can search for hotels within TripIt, but the selection might be limited compared to a dedicated hotel booking site.\n\n**Other Booking Features:**\n\n1. **Car rentals**: TripIt allows you to book car rentals through partners like Expedia and Orbitz.\n2. **Activities and experiences**: You can book activities, tours, and experiences through TripIt's partnerships with companies like GetYourGuide and Viator.\n\nWhile TripIt's booking capabilities are convenient, they're not the primary focus of the platform. If you're looking for a more comprehensive booking experience, you might want to use a dedicated OTA or meta-search engine like Kayak or Hipmunk.\n\nHowever, if you're already using TripIt for itinerary organization and tracking, the booking features can be a nice added convenience. Plus, when you book through TripIt, your itinerary will be automatically updated, making it easy to keep track of your travel plans.\n\nDo you usually book your flights and hotels separately, or do you prefer to book package deals?"

Last month, I was traveling from New York to Boston on the Acela Express, and we got stuck at a station for over an hour due to mechanical issues. It was frustrating, but I was able to get updates from the train staff and TripIt's real-time alerts helped me stay informed.\n\nTo make the most of the delay, I ended up catching up on some work and responding to emails. I also took advantage of the delay to grab a snack and stretch my legs. When we finally arrived in Boston, I was able to adjust my schedule accordingly and make the most of my time.\n\nDelays can be frustrating, but I've learned to roll with the punches and make the most of the situation.
