    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's a great question! It really depends on your personal preference. If you enjoy shopping and exploring new places with company, then bringing a friend along can be a lot of fun. You can bounce ideas off each other and get a second opinion on potential purchases. On the other hand, if you prefer to take your time and explore at your own pace, going solo can have its benefits too. You can take your time exploring shops and boutiques without feeling rushed, and you can focus solely on what you're interested in. Ultimately, it's up to you whether you prefer to bring a friend or go solo."
