A floppy hat and simple jewelry will add a lovely touch to your outfit.\n\nFor the coat, I'd recommend the trench coat over the denim jacket. A trench coat is a timeless, versatile option that will add a sophisticated touch to your outfit. The neutral color will also blend nicely with the white sweater, black jeans, and red bag. A denim jacket might be a bit too casual for this outfit, but it ultimately depends on the style and fit of the jacket. If you have a more fitted, darker-washed denim jacket, it could work.\n\nWhat's the style of your trench coat like? Is it a classic, belted design or a more modern, sleek version?\"\n\nYour turn again!",
