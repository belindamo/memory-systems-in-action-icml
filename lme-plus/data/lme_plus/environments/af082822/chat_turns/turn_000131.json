Rearranging the furniture and adding personal touches like your grandmother's vase can make a huge impact on the overall feel of the space. Here are some suggestions to further improve the room's layout and style:\n\n1. **Balance and Symmetry**: Ensure that the room feels balanced by distributing visual weight evenly. For example, if you have a large piece of furniture on one side of the room, balance it with something similar on the other side. Symmetry can create a sense of harmony, but don't be afraid to break it occasionally to add visual interest.\n2. **Create a Focal Point**: Your grandmother's vase is a great start! A focal point draws the eye to a particular area of the room. Consider adding other statement pieces, like a stunning piece of art, a colorful rug, or a show-stopping light fixture.\n3. **Layer Lighting**: A well-layered lighting scheme can make a room feel cozy and inviting. Combine overhead lighting, table lamps, and floor lamps to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere.\n4. **Textiles**: Add texture and interest with throw pillows, blankets, and rugs in complementary colors and patterns. These elements can tie together the room's color scheme and add depth.\n5. **Define Zones**: Create separate areas within the room for different activities, like a reading nook or a conversation area. This will make the space feel more functional and cozy.\n6. **Consider the 60-30-10 Rule**: Allocate 60% of the room's color scheme to a dominant color, 30% to a secondary color, and 10% to an accent color. This will create a harmonious and visually appealing color scheme.\n7. **Add some Greenery**: Plants can bring life and freshness to a room. Choose low-maintenance plants like succulents or air plants if you don't have a green thumb.\n8. **Personalize with Accessories**: Display personal items like family photos, heirlooms, or collectibles to make the space feel truly yours.\n9. **Rethink the Walls**: Don't be afraid to experiment with wall decor, such as a gallery wall, a large piece of art, or a statement wallpaper.\n10. **Experiment and Have Fun**: Interior design is all about trial and error. Don't be afraid to try out new ideas and move things around until you find a layout and style that feels like you.\n\nRemember, the key to creating a beautiful and functional living room is to make it reflect your personal style and preferences. Have fun with the process, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need more specific advice or guidance!",
