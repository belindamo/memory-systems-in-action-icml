  "content": "Tonkatsu is a fantastic dish, and the right pork cutlet makes all the difference. In Japan, the most commonly used cut for Tonkatsu is the **Loin Cutlet**, also known as **Pork Loin Fillet** or **Pork Tenderloin**. This cut is ideal because it's lean, tender, and has a consistent thickness, which helps it cook evenly and stay juicy.\n\nWhen selecting a pork loin cutlet, look for the following characteristics:\n\n1. **Thickness**: Opt for a cutlet that's about 1-1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) thick. This will ensure it's easy to bread and fry evenly.\n2. **Marbling**: A moderate amount of marbling (fat distribution) is desirable, as it will add flavor and tenderness to the dish.\n3. **Tenderness**: Choose a cutlet that feels firm but not too hard. Avoid cuts with excessive fat or connective tissue.\n\nAs for specific brands, it's not necessary to look for a particular brand, but rather focus on the quality of the pork. Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Wagyu pork**: Known for its exceptional marbling and rich flavor, Wagyu pork is a great choice if you can find it.\n2. **Heritage pork**: Heritage breeds like Berkshire, Tamworth, or Duroc offer rich flavor and tender meat.\n3. **Local or organic pork**: Opt for locally sourced or organic pork from a reputable butcher or grocery store.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding a suitable pork loin cutlet, you can also consider using a **Pork Ribeye Cutlet** or **Pork Sirloin Cutlet**. These cuts are slightly fattier, but still work well for Tonkatsu.\n\nWhen preparing the cutlet, make sure to:\n\n1. **Pound the meat**: Gently pound the cutlet to an even thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin. This helps the breading adhere evenly and promotes even cooking.\n2. **Trim excess fat**: Remove any excess fat from the edges of the cutlet to prevent flare-ups during frying.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to creating an authentic and delicious Tonkatsu dish!\n\nDo you have any questions about breading or frying the Tonkatsu, or would you like some tips on preparing the accompanying sides?",
