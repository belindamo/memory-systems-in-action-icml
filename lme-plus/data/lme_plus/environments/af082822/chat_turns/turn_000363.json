Recognizing and challenging those patterns is a huge step in making progress towards a more positive mindset.\n\nDeveloping positive self-talk and reframing your thoughts in a more positive way can be a game-changer. It's amazing that you're actively working on this and seeing the difference it's making. It's not always easy, as you said, but it's a skill that can be developed with practice and patience.\n\nRemember that it's okay to encounter setbacks or struggles along the way. It's normal to slip back into old thought patterns or habits, but the key is to acknowledge it and gently guide yourself back to a more positive mindset. Don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks \u2013 simply recognize them and keep moving forward.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge and celebrate your small wins, even if it feels like a tiny step forward. Every small victory is a step in the right direction, and it can build momentum towards greater progress.\n\nHow do you find yourself reframing your thoughts in a more positive way? Are there any specific techniques or strategies that Dr. Smith has taught you that have been particularly helpful?",
