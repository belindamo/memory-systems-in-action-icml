  "content": "I'm interested in a mix of genres, but I've been leaning towards fiction lately. I prefer books that are engaging and easy to follow, not too complex or heavy. I've enjoyed some historical fiction, like \"The Nightingale\", and I'm currently reading \"The Hating Game\" which is a rom-com. I don't have a specific time period or setting in mind, but I do like books with strong female protagonists.",
