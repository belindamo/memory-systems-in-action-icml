  "content": "I'm actually going to be using the TV in my living room, and I think a full-motion mount would be perfect. I've been doing some shopping lately and scored some great deals, by the way. Yesterday, I attended a friends and family sale at Nordstrom and picked up a few dresses and tops for 20% off. I also got a $20 gift card for making a purchase over $100, which was a nice bonus. Anyway, back to the TV mount - what do you think about the Sanus VMF408? Is it a good option for my living room?",
