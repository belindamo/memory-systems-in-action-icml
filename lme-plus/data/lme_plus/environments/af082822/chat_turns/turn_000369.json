Since you mentioned you had to take a morning off on Wednesday, February 20th, that means we're currently in the week of February 19-25.\n\nTo plan your doctor's appointment for next week, we can look at the week of February 26 - March 4. Which days of the week do you have available to take off from work? Are you available to take a morning, afternoon, or a full day off?\n\nAlso, do you have any other commitments or appointments already scheduled for next week that we should consider when choosing a day for your doctor's appointment?",
