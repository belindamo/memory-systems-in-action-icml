I recommend contacting the hotels directly to confirm their offerings and to book your stay.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try reaching out to the Tribeca Film Festival's hospitality team to see if they have any recommended hotels or special rates for press delegates. They might have partnerships with specific hotels or be able to offer additional assistance with accommodations.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time at the Tribeca Film Festival!",
