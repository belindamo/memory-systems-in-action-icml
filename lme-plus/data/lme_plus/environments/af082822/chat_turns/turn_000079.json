  "content": "That's great to hear! It's wonderful that you're enjoying your new stylus pen and finding it useful for taking notes and annotating documents. Two weeks is a good amount of time to get comfortable with a new device, so it's puzzling that you're experiencing issues now.\n\nCalibrating the touchscreen might just do the trick to resolve the problem. If you've tried both methods and the issue persists, it's possible that there's a compatibility issue between your stylus pen and your laptop's touchscreen. In that case, you might want to reach out to the manufacturer of your stylus pen or Lenovo's support team for further assistance.\n\nIn the meantime, I have a few more questions to help troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. Have you noticed any specific patterns or scenarios where the stylus pen doesn't respond? For example, is it more likely to happen when you're using a specific app or when the laptop is in a certain mode (e.g., tablet mode)?\n2. Are there any error messages or notifications that appear when the stylus pen doesn't respond?\n3. Have you tried using the stylus pen on a different surface or with a different device to rule out any issues with the pen itself?\n\nPlease let me know your answers to these questions, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot the issue further.",
