However, it might be a bit too early to ask your mom about your aunt's knee replacement surgery, which is still a couple of months away.\n\nYou might want to consider checking in with your aunt directly to ask about her upcoming surgery and how she's feeling. Alternatively, you could ask your mom about it closer to the date of your aunt's surgery, when she might have more information or updates to share.\n\nFor now, focusing on your mom's upcoming surgery on March 15th and offering her support might be the best way to go.",
