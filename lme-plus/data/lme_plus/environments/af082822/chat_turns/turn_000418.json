  "content": "I got a pair of black knee-high boots that are made of leather, and a crew neck sweater that's a medium thickness, it's a dark blue color. My personal style is pretty casual, I like to keep things simple and comfortable. I was thinking of wearing them for everyday wear, maybe to run errands or grab coffee with friends. By the way, I got a great deal on them, 40% off the boots and 20% off the sweater during the Black Friday sale at Macy's, so I'm excited to make the most of my purchase!",
