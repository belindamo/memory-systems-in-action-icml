  "content": "Thanks for the guidance on developing a research methodology. I'll definitely revisit my research questions and objectives to ensure my methodology aligns with them. I've already conducted a pilot study from March 10th to 17th, which helped me refine my survey questions and identify potential issues with my study design. I'm planning to build upon that pilot study and use the feedback from participants to inform my main study. Can you provide some more information on how to select a research design and identify data collection methods?",
