That way, the bag can be the star of the show. And I definitely want to try the monochromatic look too - I have a burgundy sweater that I think would look amazing with the bag.\n\nI'm actually planning to wear the bag to a brunch with friends this weekend. Do you have any tips on how to style it for a casual, daytime look? Should I add any accessories or keep it simple and let the bag be the focus?\"",
