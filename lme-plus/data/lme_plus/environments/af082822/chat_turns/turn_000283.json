Everlane is a great brand, and I've heard great things about their new collection. I think they're really known for their transparency and sustainability efforts, which is awesome. If you're thinking of ordering more items, I'd definitely recommend checking out their new arrivals.\n\nNow, back to the bag! For a bold, statement piece like this, I'd recommend carrying it by the handles to showcase its design and color. The shoulder strap is a great option too, but carrying it by the handles will really make the bag stand out. Plus, it's a great way to add a touch of elegance to your overall look. If you do decide to use the shoulder strap, make sure it's adjusted to a comfortable length so the bag isn't too high or too low on your body.\n\nOne more thing - since the bag is quite bold, you might want to balance it out with a more understated hairstyle. A low bun or a simple, sleek hairstyle would let the bag take center stage. What do you think?\"",
