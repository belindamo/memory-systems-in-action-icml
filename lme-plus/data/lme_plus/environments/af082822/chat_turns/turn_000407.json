  "content": "Mendeley and Evernote are both excellent choices for organizing your sources and notes.\n\nWhen it comes to creating a separate folder or notebook for your literature review, it ultimately depends on your personal preference and workflow. Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Separate Folder/Notebook:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Dedicated space**: Having a separate folder or notebook for your literature review can help you focus on this specific task and keep your research organized.\n2. **Easy to find**: You can quickly locate all your literature review-related materials in one place.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Duplicate organization**: If you already have a research folder or notebook, creating a separate one for your literature review might lead to duplicate organization efforts.\n2. **Information silos**: You might end up with separate silos of information, making it harder to connect ideas and concepts across different projects.\n\n**Tags and Categories within Existing Research Folder:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Integrated organization**: You can leverage your existing folder or notebook structure and simply add tags or categories for your literature review.\n2. **Contextual connections**: You can easily see how your literature review fits into your broader research project and make connections between ideas.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Information overload**: If your research folder or notebook is already cluttered, adding more tags or categories might make it harder to find what you need.\n2. **Difficulty in isolating literature review materials**: You might need to sift through multiple notes and sources to find the ones specific to your literature review.\n\nHere's a potential compromise:\n\n1. **Create a subfolder or sub-notebook**: Within your existing research folder or notebook, create a subfolder or sub-notebook specifically for your literature review. This way, you'll have a dedicated space for your literature review materials while still keeping them connected to your broader research project.\n2. **Use tags and categories**: In addition to the subfolder or sub-notebook, use tags and categories to further organize your literature review materials. This will allow you to quickly filter and find specific sources, notes, or themes.\n\nFor example, in Evernote, you could create a notebook for your research project and then create a sub-notebook for your literature review. Within the literature review sub-notebook, you could use tags like \"literature review,\" \"methodology,\" \"results,\" and \"themes\" to categorize your notes and sources.\n\nIn Mendeley, you could create a separate folder for your literature review and then use tags and keywords to categorize your sources.\n\nUltimately, the approach you choose depends on your personal workflow and preferences. You can experiment with different methods and adapt them as needed to ensure that your organization system works for you.",
