The Tribeca Film Festival takes place at various venues throughout Lower Manhattan, but the main hubs are around Tribeca, SoHo, and the West Village. Here are some hotels that are closest to the festival venues:\n\n1. **The Greenwich Hotel** (5-star) - This hotel is located in the heart of Tribeca, within walking distance to the Tribeca Festival Hub at Spring Studios (50 Varick Street) and the Tribeca Cinemas (54 Varick Street).\n2. **The Roxy Hotel** (4-star) - This hotel is just a 5-minute walk from the Tribeca Festival Hub at Spring Studios and a 10-minute walk from the Tribeca Cinemas.\n3. **Tribeca Grand Hotel** (4-star) - As its name suggests, this hotel is in the heart of Tribeca, close to the festival venues, including the Tribeca Festival Hub and the Tribeca Cinemas.\n4. **The Beekman, a Thompson Hotel** (5-star) - This hotel is located in the Financial District, but it's just a 10-15 minute walk from the Tribeca Festival Hub and a 15-20 minute walk from the Tribeca Cinemas.\n5. **Hotel 50 Bowery** (4-star) - This hotel is in Chinatown, but it's a 10-15 minute walk from the Tribeca Festival Hub and a 15-20 minute walk from the Tribeca Cinemas.\n\nThese hotels are all within a reasonable walking distance to the main festival venues, but keep in mind that the festival also offers shuttle buses between venues, so you may not need to walk everywhere.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following factors when choosing a hotel:\n\n* Proximity to the Press Lounge: The Press Lounge is usually located at the Tribeca Festival Hub, so being close to this venue will make it easier for you to pick up credentials, attend press conferences, and network with other press delegates.\n* Distance to screening venues: While the main festival hub is at Spring Studios, some screenings and events take place at other venues, such as the SVA Theater (333 W 23rd Street) or the BMCC Tribeca Performing Arts Center (199 Chambers Street). If you're planning to attend screenings at these venues, you may want to choose a hotel that's closer to them.\n* Amenities: As a press delegate, you may need to work or file stories during the festival. Look for hotels with reliable Wi-Fi, comfortable workspaces, and amenities like a business center or meeting rooms.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect hotel for your Tribeca Film Festival experience!",
