However, I can share with you some information about the most popular and well-known wines produced in Benevento. \n\nFalanghina is a white wine that is highly regarded from Benevento, known for its crispness and citrus flavors. It pairs well with seafood, light pasta dishes, and salads.\n\nAglianico is a popular red wine that is also produced in the region. It is known for its full-bodied character, high tannins, and dark fruit flavors. It pairs well with red meat dishes, strong cheeses, and spicy foods.\n\nIn addition to Falanghina and Aglianico, other wines produced in the Campania region include Taurasi, Fiano di Avellino, and Greco di Tufo, among others. I would recommend trying one or more of these wines to experience the unique flavors and aromas of Benevento's wines.",
