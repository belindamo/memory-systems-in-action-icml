  "content": "I completely agree. While independent films and certain genres may have more creative freedom to explore diverse gender perspectives, it is crucial that mainstream media and big-budget movies also provide representation to gender-nonconforming people. It is essential to have diverse representation in all types of media to eliminate harmful stereotypes and provide relatable characters to audiences.\n\nBig-budget movies have a large impact on the mainstream audience and have the potential to influence societal views on gender roles and representation. Therefore, the inclusion of gender-nonconforming characters in movies can lead to more acceptance and understanding of gender identities that are often overlooked or stigmatized.\n\nTo achieve this, it is important for media companies to take steps towards inclusivity, provide continued support and equal opportunities to those who identify as gender nonconforming, and recognize the importance of representing a multidimensional approach to characters and their identities.",
