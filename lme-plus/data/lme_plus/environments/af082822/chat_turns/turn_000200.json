  "content": "You make a great point. When gender nonconformity is portrayed as the entirety of a character's identity, it can perpetuate the idea that being different from the norm is somehow abnormal or lesser. It's important to portray gender nonconforming characters as fully realized individuals with complex lives and interests beyond their gender identity.\n\nMoreover, portraying gender nonconformity in a way that does not reduce the character to their gender identity can help normalize the existence of gender diversity. This can lead to greater acceptance and understanding of different gender identities and create a more supportive environment for those who are gender nonconforming.\n\nIt is important to allow gender nonconforming characters to be multi-dimensional, just like any other character. They can have hobbies, interests, fears, and flaws, without their gender identity overshadowing everything else about them.\n\nOverall, it's essential to portray gender nonconformity in a way that highlights the diversity of human experience and adds to the richness and complexity of storytelling.",
