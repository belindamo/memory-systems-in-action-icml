My trench coat is a classic, belted design with a fitted silhouette. It's a beige color that will complement the neutral tones in the outfit nicely. I'm thinking of belting it to accentuate my waist and create a more defined shape.\n\nI'm also wondering about the size of the bag. Should I carry it by the handles or use the shoulder strap? I want to make sure I'm showing off the bag in the best way possible.\"\n\nLet me know your thoughts!",
