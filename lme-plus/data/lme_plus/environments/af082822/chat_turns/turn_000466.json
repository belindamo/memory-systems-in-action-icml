Exploring the game world, battling monsters, looting items, and interacting with other players are all integral parts of MMORPGs, and you can choose to focus on these aspects of the game if that's what you enjoy.\n\nQuests can provide direction and purpose for players who might feel lost or overwhelmed within the game, but if that's not something that interests you, you can choose to ignore them. You can go at your own pace and explore the world in your own way, play with friends or solo, and enjoy the game in your own style.\n\nIn the end, every player has a unique gaming experience based on their preferences, so the choice is always up to you.",
