Creating a subfolder within your existing research folder is a excellent way to strike a balance between keeping your literature review materials organized and connected to your broader research project.\n\nBy doing so, you'll be able to:\n\n1. **Keep your research materials together**: All your research-related files, notes, and sources will be in one place, making it easier to cross-reference and connect ideas.\n2. **Have a dedicated space for your literature review**: The subfolder will provide a clear and separate space for your literature review materials, helping you focus on this specific task and avoid clutter.\n3. **Use tags and categories to further organize**: You can still use tags and categories within your subfolder to organize your literature review materials by theme, methodology, author, or other relevant categories.\n\nRemember to also consider the following tips to make the most of your subfolder:\n\n1. **Use a clear and descriptive name**: Name your subfolder something like \"Literature Review\" or \"Lit Review - [Thesis Topic]\" to make it easily identifiable.\n2. **Set up a consistent folder structure**: Establish a consistent structure within your subfolder, such as creating separate folders for different stages of your literature review (e.g., \"Sources,\" \"Notes,\" \"Analysis\").\n3. **Regularly review and refine**: Periodically review your subfolder's organization and refine it as needed to ensure it remains functional and efficient.\n\nBy implementing this approach, you'll be well on your way to a well-organized literature review that's connected to your broader research project. Good luck, and happy organizing!",
