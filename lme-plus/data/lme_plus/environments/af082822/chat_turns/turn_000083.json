  "content": "It's good that you've had a good experience with the stylus pen until now. Given that it's a relatively new device, it's possible that it's still under warranty. If the issue persists, you may want to reach out to the manufacturer's support team to see if they can assist with troubleshooting or provide a replacement or repair options.\n\nIn the meantime, let's try one more thing:\n\n**Run the Windows Touch Diagnostic tool**: This tool can help identify and fix common touchscreen issues. To run the tool:\n\n1. Press the Windows key + S to open the Search bar.\n2. Type \"touch diagnostic\" and select \"Touch Diagnostic\" from the results.\n3. Follow the on-screen instructions to run the tool.\n\nThis tool may help resolve any software-related issues that could be causing the problem.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there's a hardware problem with your laptop's touchscreen or stylus pen. You may want to consider contacting Lenovo's support team or visiting a authorized service center for further assistance.\n\nI hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you!",
