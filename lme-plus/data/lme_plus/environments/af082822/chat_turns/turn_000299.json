  "content": "That's an interesting situation!\n\nHaving both a Canon and Nikon version of the same lens might seem redundant, but it ultimately depends on your workflow, shooting habits, and goals. Here are some points to consider:\n\nPros of having both:\n\n1. **Convenience**: You can use the Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 with your Canon cameras (if you have any) and the Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 with your Nikon D750, without needing to switch mounts or adapters.\n2. **Brand consistency**: If you're invested in both Canon and Nikon ecosystems, having lenses that match your camera brands can ensure optimal performance, autofocus, and compatibility.\n3. **Lens-specific features**: Each manufacturer's lens might have unique features, coatings, or designs that you prefer. Having both lenses could give you access to these differences.\n\nCons of having both:\n\n1. **Cost**: You'll be duplicating a significant investment, as you'll need to purchase the Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 in addition to the Canon one you already own.\n2. **Storage and maintenance**: You'll need to store and maintain two lenses, which can take up space and add to your overall gear management.\n3. **Lens redundancy**: If you're not using both lenses frequently, it might be more practical to focus on a single lens that can cover your needs across both systems.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n1. How often do you shoot with your Canon cameras, and how essential is it to have a native 24-70mm f/2.8 lens for those cameras?\n2. Are there specific features or advantages in the Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 that you can't replicate with your current Canon lens and a mount adapter (if possible)?\n3. Would the cost of the Nikon lens be better spent on other gear or accessories that could complement your existing setup?\n\nIf you:\n\n* Frequently shoot with both Canon and Nikon cameras and need the convenience of having a native lens for each system\n* Value the unique features or performance differences between the Canon and Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 lenses\n* Have the budget to accommodate the additional expense\n\nThen, having both lenses might make sense for you. However, if you're on a tighter budget or don't see significant benefits in having both lenses, you might consider:\n\n* Selling your Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 and investing in a Nikon lens that complements your D750 (e.g., a Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 or 50mm f/1.4)\n* Using a mount adapter to adapt your Canon lens to your Nikon D750 (if possible)\n* Renting or borrowing a Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 for specific projects or events that require it\n\nUltimately, weigh your needs and priorities to decide whether having both lenses is the best use of your resources.",
