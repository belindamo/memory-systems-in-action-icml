  "content": "Completing quests in CABAL is not always mandatory, but it can be beneficial for many reasons. Quests not only provide rewards, such as experience points and items, but they can also help players progress through the game's story and unlock new areas or abilities.\n\nFurthermore, quests can provide a direction and structure for players who might feel lost or overwhelmed within the game. Completing quests can also provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, leading to a more enjoyable gaming experience.\n\nWhile players can gain experience points and items from killing monsters on their own, the rewards they receive from quests are often much greater and can help players advance much more quickly through the game. Therefore, it's usually worth considering undertaking quests even if they might seem like busy work.",
