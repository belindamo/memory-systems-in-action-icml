Listing the camera body separately and mentioning the tripod availability will give you flexibility and help you gauge interest in a potential bundle.\n\nRegarding camera body accessories, including some extras can definitely make your listing more attractive to buyers. Here are some common accessories that are often sought after:\n\n1. **Batteries and chargers**: Include any spare batteries, the original charger, and any third-party chargers you might have.\n2. **Memory cards**: Add one or two memory cards, especially if they're high-capacity or high-speed cards.\n3. **Lens caps and hoods**: If you have the original lens caps and hoods, include them to protect the lenses during shipping and use.\n4. **Camera strap**: A good-quality camera strap can be a nice addition, especially if it's a third-party strap with extra features.\n5. **Remote shutter release or camera remote**: If you have a remote shutter release or a camera remote, include it to make it easier for the buyer to take photos.\n6. **Screen protectors and body caps**: If you have any screen protectors or body caps, include them to help protect the camera's LCD screen and body.\n7. **Original box and packaging**: If you still have the original box, packaging, and accessories, include them to make the listing more appealing.\n8. **Instruction manual and documentation**: Add the original instruction manual, warranty cards, and any other documentation that came with the camera.\n\nRemember to mention these accessories clearly in your listing, including their condition and any additional costs (if applicable). This will help set buyer expectations and increase the perceived value of your camera body.\n\nWhen deciding which accessories to include, consider the following:\n\n* The type of buyer you're targeting (e.g., beginner, enthusiast, professional)\n* The camera body's age and model (e.g., older models might not have as many accessories)\n* The competition (e.g., what other sellers are including with their listings)\n* Your pricing strategy (e.g., including more accessories might justify a higher price)\n\nBy including some or all of these accessories, you can make your listing more attractive to potential buyers and increase the chances of a sale.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need help with writing your listing!",
