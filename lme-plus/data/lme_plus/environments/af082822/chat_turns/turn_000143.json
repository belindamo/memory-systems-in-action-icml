The area is known for its production of high-quality wines, such as Falanghina and Aglianico, which are highly regarded in Italy and beyond. The olive oil produced in Benevento is also renowned for its distinctive flavor and aroma.\n\nThe agriculture sector in Benevento not only provides direct employment opportunities for farmers but also generates a multiplier effect on other sectors of the economy.
