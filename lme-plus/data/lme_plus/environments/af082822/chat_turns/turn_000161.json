Here are some tips and techniques to get you started:\n\n1. **Experiment with mediums**: Acrylic mediums can greatly impact the texture and consistency of your paint. Try using heavy body acrylics, gel mediums, or thickening agents like modeling paste or heavy gel to create thick, impasto textures.\n2. **Use unconventional tools**: Ditch the brushes and explore other tools like:\n\t* Palette knives: Great for applying thick, chunky textures and creating bold, expressive strokes.\n\t* Sponges: Can create unique, organic patterns and textures.\n\t* Rags: Use them to blot and lift paint, creating soft, muted textures.\n\t* Found objects: Experiment with using objects like leaves, fabric, or paper to create unique textures and patterns.\n3. **Layering and building up**: Build up layers of paint, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next. This will create a textured, dimensional look.\n4. **Scraping and revealing**: Apply a layer of paint, then use a palette knife or scraper to remove some of the paint, revealing underlying layers or textures.\n5. **Glazing**: Mix a small amount of paint with a lot of water or medium to create a thin, transparent glaze. Apply this over a textured surface to add depth and luminosity.\n\nSome recommended resources to explore:\n\n* **YouTube tutorials**: Search for abstract acrylic painting tutorials, and you'll find a wealth of inspiration and guidance. Some popular channels include The Art Sherpa, Artists Network, and Doodlewasher.\n* **Pinterest**: Browse abstract art and acrylic painting boards to get inspiration and ideas.\n* **Books**: Check out books like \"Acrylic Painting: A Complete Guide\" by David Lewis, \"Abstract Art: A Practical Guide\" by Anna Mason, or \"The New Acrylics\" by Rheni Tauchid.\n\nRemember, the key to achieving a textured, abstract look is to experiment, take risks, and have fun! Don't be afraid to try new things and make mistakes \u2013 they can often lead to exciting, unexpected results.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these techniques or resources?",
