  "content": "The breading mixture is a crucial component of Tonkatsu, and the right choice of breadcrumbs can make a big difference. In Japan, **Panko breadcrumbs** are the traditional choice for Tonkatsu, and for good reason. Here's why:\n\n**Panko breadcrumbs vs. regular breadcrumbs:**\n\n1. **Lighter and airier**: Panko breadcrumbs are made from crustless white bread and are lighter and airier than regular breadcrumbs. This helps create a crispy exterior without adding excess weight or density to the Tonkatsu.\n2. **Crisper coating**: Panko breadcrumbs produce a crisper, more delicate coating that adheres well to the meat, whereas regular breadcrumbs can result in a heavier, more dense coating.\n3. **Less oil absorption**: Panko breadcrumbs absorb less oil than regular breadcrumbs, which means your Tonkatsu will be less greasy and more appealing.\n\n**Tonkatsu Breading Mixture:**\n\nFor an authentic Tonkatsu breading mixture, you'll need:\n\n1. **Panko breadcrumbs**: Use Japanese-style Panko breadcrumbs, which are usually found in the Asian food section or online.\n2. **All-purpose flour**: Use a light, all-purpose flour to help the breadcrumbs adhere to the meat.\n3. **Cornstarch**: A small amount of cornstarch helps the breading mixture adhere to the meat and adds crispiness.\n4. **Egg**: Beat an egg lightly to help the breadcrumbs stick to the meat.\n\n**Tonkatsu Breading Mixture Recipe:**\n\n* 1 cup Panko breadcrumbs\n* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n* 1 tablespoon cornstarch\n* 1 egg, lightly beaten\n\nMix the Panko breadcrumbs, flour, and cornstarch in a shallow dish. In a separate dish, beat the egg lightly. Dip the pork cutlet in the egg, coating it completely, then coat in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing the crumbs gently onto the meat to ensure they adhere evenly.\n\n**Tips for achieving the perfect breading:**\n\n1. **Chill the breading mixture**: Refrigerate the breading mixture for at least 30 minutes to allow the starches to absorb excess moisture.\n2. **Use the right amount of egg**: Don't overbeat the egg, as this can create a thick, heavy coating.\n3. **Don't over-bread**: Coat the meat evenly, but avoid over-breading, which can lead to a heavy, greasy Tonkatsu.\n4. **Press the crumbs gently**: Press the breadcrumbs onto the meat gently to ensure they adhere evenly and don't fall off during frying.\n\nBy following these tips and using the right breading mixture, you'll be able to achieve a crispy, golden-brown Tonkatsu that's sure to impress!\n\nDo you have any questions about frying the Tonkatsu or preparing the accompanying sides, such as shredded cabbage and miso soup?",
