A simple necklace and stud earrings will add just the right amount of elegance to the outfit without taking away from the bag. And I love the idea of a floppy hat - I have a black one that I think would look great with the outfit.\n\nI'm also thinking of adding a lightweight, neutral-colored coat to the mix. It's still a bit chilly in the mornings, and I want to make sure I'm prepared for the weather. Do you think a trench coat or a denim jacket would work better with this outfit?\"\n\nLet me know your response!",
