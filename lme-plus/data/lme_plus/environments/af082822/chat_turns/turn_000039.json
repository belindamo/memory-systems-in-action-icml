  "content": "To calculate the standard deviation of the measurement for the liquid, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the sample measurements:\nMean = (95+97+101+102+104)/5 = 99.8 grams\n2. Calculate the variance of the sample measurements:\nVariance = [(95-99.8)^2 + (97-99.8)^2 + (101-99.8)^2 + (102-99.8)^2 + (104-99.8)^2]/(5-1)\n= [(-4.8)^2 + (-2.8)^2 + (1.2)^2 + (2.2)^2 + (4.2)^2]/4\n= 14.5 grams^2\n3. Calculate the standard deviation of the sample measurements by taking the square root of the variance:\nStandard deviation = sqrt(14.5) = 3.8 grams\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the measurement for the liquid is 3.8 grams. This means that the actual weight of the liquid is expected to vary from 99.8 grams by approximately plus or minus 3.8 grams.",
