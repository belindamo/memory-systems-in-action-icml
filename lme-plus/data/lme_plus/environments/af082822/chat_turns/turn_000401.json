Here's why:\n\n1. **Added protection**: A screen protector provides an extra layer of protection against scratches, cracks, and fingerprints.\n2. **Enhanced durability**: With a screen protector, your phone's screen is more resistant to daily wear and tear, which means it will look newer for longer.\n3. **Easy cleaning**: Screen protectors make cleaning your phone's screen a breeze, as they're often designed with easy-cleaning materials.\n4. **Compatibility**: Since you're getting a new phone wallet, a screen protector will ensure that the wallet case fits properly and doesn't interfere with the screen's functionality.\n\nWhen choosing a screen protector, consider the following:\n\n1. **Material**: Tempered glass or high-quality PET film are good options. Tempered glass provides more protection, but PET film is more affordable.\n2. **Thickness**: A thinner screen protector (around 0.3mm) is a good balance between protection and touch sensitivity.\n3. **Oleophobic coating**: This feature helps reduce fingerprints and smudges.\n4. **Compatibility**: Make sure the screen protector is designed specifically for your Samsung S22.\n\nSome popular screen protector brands include:\n\n* Zagg\n* TechArmor\n* Skinomi\n* InvisibleShield\n* Spigen (they also offer screen protectors!)\n\nYou can find screen protectors at various online retailers, such as Amazon, Best Buy, or directly from the manufacturer's website.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you going to get a screen protector to go along with your new phone wallet?",
