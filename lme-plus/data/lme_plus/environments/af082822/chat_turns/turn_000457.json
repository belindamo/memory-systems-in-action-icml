  "content": "I've actually lost about 5 pounds in the past month, which is slow progress, but I'm okay with that. I know I'm building muscle, which is more important to me than just losing weight. I've also noticed that my clothes are fitting better, and I feel more confident in my own skin.\n\nAs for specific goals, I've been focusing on strengthening my core and increasing my flexibility. I've set a goal for myself to be able to do a full split by the end of the year. I know it'll take time and consistency, but I'm willing to put in the work to get there.\n\nWhat do you think about setting specific, measurable goals like that? Do you have any tips for achieving them?",
