Watering frequency depends on several factors, including the type of plants, pot size, soil mix, climate, and time of year. Sunday morning watering might not be the best approach, as it can lead to overwatering or underwatering. Here's a more tailored approach for each of your plants:\n\n1. **Fern:** Ferns prefer moist soil, but not waterlogged. Check the soil daily by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, water thoroughly. You might need to water your fern every 2-3 days, especially in a dry climate or during winter when the air is drier.\n2. **Snake Plant (Sansevieria):** Snake plants are low-maintenance and can survive with neglect. Water them when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch, usually every 7-10 days. Make sure not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot.\n3. **Spider Plant:** Spider plants prefer well-draining soil and consistent moisture. Water them when the top inch of soil feels dry, usually every 5-7 days. Be cautious not to let the soil dry out completely, as this can cause the leaves to turn yellow.\n\nSome general tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Water your plants in the morning, so the pot has a chance to dry out slightly before nightfall.\n* Water at the soil level, avoiding the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.\n* Check the plant's moisture levels by lifting the pot or using a moisture meter.\n* Adjust your watering schedule based on the season. In winter, plants require less water due to lower temperatures and humidity.\n* If you notice any signs of overwatering (yellowing leaves, soft stems, or water pooling around the base), reduce watering frequency.\n\nRegarding your new area rug, it's great that it's brought the room together! Just a heads up: plants can benefit from a layer of mulch or a decorative stone topping to help retain moisture and prevent water from seeping onto the rug.\n\nRemember, observe your plants' responses to your watering schedule and adjust as needed. Happy planting!",
