  "content": "I'd be happy to help you plan out your crafting schedule.\n\nAnd don't worry about the payday reminder - I'm not keeping track of your personal finances or calendar, so feel free to share any details that might help me assist you with your crafting schedule.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your crafting goals and preferences? For example:\n\n1. What type of crafts do you enjoy doing (e.g., knitting, sewing, painting, etc.)?\n2. How many hours per week can you dedicate to crafting?\n3. Are there any specific projects you want to work on or complete within the next few weeks?\n4. Are there any deadlines or events you're crafting for (e.g., birthdays, holidays, etc.)?\n5. Do you have any specific days or times when you prefer to craft (e.g., weekdays, weekends, mornings, evenings)?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your crafting goals and preferences, I can help you create a schedule that works for you!",
