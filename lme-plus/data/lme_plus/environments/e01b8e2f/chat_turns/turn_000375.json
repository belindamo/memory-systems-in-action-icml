As an AI language model, my access to specific information on the camera techniques used in \"Blast\" is limited, but I will do my best to provide you with some more concrete details.\n\nAccording to some online sources, the bomb disposal scenes in \"Blast\" were shot using a combination of close-up shots, medium shots, and wide-angle shots with handheld cameras to create a sense of urgency and danger. The camera work emphasizes the tense situation by building up the suspense gradually through the use of close-ups on the bombs' timers and wires, emphasizing both the need for speed and the danger of errors. Additionally, the low-angle shots of the bomb disposal squad members create a sense of danger and heighten the suspense by showing the bombs from a distorted perspective. The scenes also reportedly use various sound effects, lighting techniques, and blur effects to enhance the overall tension and danger.\n\nOverall, the camera techniques used in \"Blast\" were likely carefully designed and executed in order to build up suspense and create a sense of danger throughout the film's bomb disposal scenes.",
