  "content": "I woke up to the sound of my breathing and the dropship engines. I slowly turned in bed to my right and saw the stars and the night of space outside. I turned back in bed and took comfort in knowing that I was okay. I clutched my blanket and pillow, feeling grateful for the safety and warmth they provided.\n\nA few minutes later, Bellamy and Raven walked into the living quarters, and a few minutes after that, they came over to my room. Bellamy looked at me with a smile and asked, \"How did you sleep?\"\n\nI was still groggy and responded, \"I slept okay, but what time is it?\"\n\nBellamy looked at his watch and said, \"It's morning.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. I then asked, \"Where's Clarke?\"\n\nRaven looked at me with a reassuring expression and said, \"She's on the bridge, Madi. I'll take you to her.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling grateful for Raven's help. I slowly got out of bed, my body still weak and aching. Raven helped me walk to the bridge, where Clarke was.\n\nClarke looked at me with a smile and said, \"Welcome back, Madi. How did you sleep?\"\n\nI smiled back at her and said, \"I slept okay, but I'm still a little weak.\"\n\nClarke nodded and said, \"That's normal, Madi. You've been asleep for 20 years, your body needs to adjust.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling grateful for Clarke's understanding. I looked out the window and saw the stars and the night of space outside. I knew that it would be a long journey ahead, but with Clarke, Bellamy, Raven and the rest of our new family, I knew that we would make it through.\n\nThe end.",
