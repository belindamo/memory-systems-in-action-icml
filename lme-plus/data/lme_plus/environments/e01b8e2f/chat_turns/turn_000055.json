Here are some tips to help you structure your strength training sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays:\n\n**Warm-up and Cool-down:**\n\n* Start with a 5-10 minute warm-up, including light cardio (jogging, jumping jacks, etc.) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, arm circles, etc.).\n* End your session with a 5-10 minute cool-down, including static stretching (focusing on the muscles you worked) and foam rolling.\n\n**Exercise Selection and Order:**\n\n* Choose 3-4 exercises that target your core, glutes, and legs. For example:\n\t+ Tuesday: Squats, lunges, calf raises, and leg press\n\t+ Thursday: Deadlifts, glute bridges, step-ups, and leg extensions\n* Alternate between exercises that target different muscle groups to avoid fatigue and allow for adequate recovery time.\n* Start with compound exercises (e.g., squats, deadlifts) and progress to isolation exercises (e.g., leg extensions, calf raises).\n\n**Sets, Reps, and Weight:**\n\n* Start with 3 sets of 10-12 reps for each exercise. This will help you focus on endurance and muscle endurance.\n* Gradually increase the weight as you get stronger, but maintain the same number of reps.\n* Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets, and 120-180 seconds between exercises.\n\n**Progressive Overload:**\n\n* Increase the weight or reps as you get stronger.\n* Aim to increase the weight by 2.5-5lbs every two weeks, or as soon as you feel you can handle more.\n* Decrease rest time between sets and exercises as you get more comfortable with the exercises.\n\n**Example Strength Training Session:**\n\nHere's an example of what your Tuesday strength training session could look like:\n\n1. Warm-up (5 minutes)\n2. Squats (3 sets of 10 reps)\n\t* Rest for 60 seconds between sets\n3. Lunges (3 sets of 10 reps per leg)\n\t* Rest for 60 seconds between sets\n4. Calf raises (3 sets of 12 reps)\n\t* Rest for 60 seconds between sets\n5. Leg press (3 sets of 10 reps)\n\t* Rest for 60 seconds between sets\n6. Cool-down (5 minutes)\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust the exercises, sets, reps, and weight based on how you feel. It's also essential to focus on proper form and technique to avoid injury. Good luck, and have fun!",
