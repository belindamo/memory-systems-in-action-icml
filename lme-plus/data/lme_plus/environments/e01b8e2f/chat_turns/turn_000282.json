Albus Dumbledore: Rowling has said that the character of Dumbledore was largely inspired by her own headmaster at secondary school, John Nettleship. She has also mentioned her maternal grandfather, who was a powerful influence on her, as a source of inspiration for Dumbledore.\n\n2. Hermione Granger: Rowling has said that she based Hermione's character on herself as a young girl, as well as on her childhood friend, Sean Harris, who was \"the most gifted person in the school\" but also a \"real know-it-all.\"\n\n3. Gilderoy Lockhart: Rowling has said that the character of Lockhart was partly inspired by a real-life acquaintance of hers, whom she describes as \"utterly oblivious to his own lack of talent.\"\n\n4. Severus Snape: Rowling has said that Snape was based on a teacher she had in secondary school whom she \"disliked intensely.\" However, she has also described Snape as a composite of several other people she knew, including a friend's difficult stepfather and a schoolmate who was both \"impressive and intimidating.\"\n\n5. Rubeus Hagrid: Rowling has said that Hagrid was inspired by a combination of people she knew from her childhood, including her father, who was a \"kind and generous\" man, and her close friend Sean Harris, who was \"a big guy.\"",
