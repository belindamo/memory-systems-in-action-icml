However, I can provide some general information on camera angles and lens types that are commonly used in bomb disposal scenes to create a sense of tension, urgency, and danger.\n\nIn bomb disposal scenes, low-angle shots are typically used to make the bomb look more intimidating and to create a sense of danger. Close-up shots of the bomb and the bomb disposal squad's hands and faces can convey the level of expertise and precision required for the task at hand. In addition, wide-angle shots can create a sense of spaciousness, while telephoto lenses can create a sense of compression, making the surroundings seem closer and more claustrophobic.\n\nOverall, the use of camera angles and lenses is an essential part of creating tension and suspense in bomb disposal scenes, and there are many different techniques that can be used to achieve this effect.",
