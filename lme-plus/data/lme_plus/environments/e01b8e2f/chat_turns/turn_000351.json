The Apple Cider Mimosa and Pumpkin Spice Latte will be a hit at your fall dinner party.\n\nFor the Apple Cider Mimosa, you can use any type of apple cider, but I recommend using a high-quality, unfiltered cider with a nice balance of sweetness and tartness. Some popular brands include:\n\n* Angry Orchard\n* Strongbow\n* Woodchuck\n* Crispin\n\nAvoid using a cider that's too sweet or too strong, as it might overpower the champagne. You can also try using a local or craft cider for a unique flavor profile.\n\nFor the whipped cream, I have a few tips to make it extra special:\n\n1. **Use heavy cream**: Heavy cream whips up lighter and fluffier than regular whipping cream.\n2. **Add a pinch of salt**: Salt helps to balance the sweetness of the sugar and brings out the flavors of the spices.\n3. **Use a mix of granulated and brown sugar**: Granulated sugar adds sweetness, while brown sugar adds a rich, caramel flavor.\n4. **Add a dash of pumpkin pie spice**: This will give your whipped cream a warm, spicy flavor that complements the pumpkin puree in the latte.\n5. **Whip until stiff peaks**: Whip the cream until it forms stiff peaks, but be careful not to over-whip, as it can become too stiff and separate.\n\nHere's a simple recipe for Pumpkin Spice Whipped Cream:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n* 1 tablespoon brown sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form.\n2. Gradually add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and pumpkin pie spice.\n3. Continue whipping until stiff peaks form.\n4. Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 2 hours before serving.\n\nI hope these tips help you create a delicious and festive Apple Cider Mimosa and Pumpkin Spice Latte for your fall dinner party!",
