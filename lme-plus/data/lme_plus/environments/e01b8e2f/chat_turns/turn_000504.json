Volunteering at a literary festival is a great way to get involved in the literary community, and it's wonderful that you got to attend some amazing sessions, including Colson Whitehead's keynote speech.\n\nColson Whitehead is a highly acclaimed author, and his work often explores themes of identity, history, and social justice. His insights on the power of storytelling and its impact on society must have been truly thought-provoking. Storytelling has the ability to shape our understanding of the world, challenge our perspectives, and inspire empathy and change.\n\nAs a volunteer, you must have had a unique behind-the-scenes perspective on the festival. What was it like helping to set up the author panels and assisting with crowd control? Did you have any favorite moments or interactions with authors or attendees?\n\nAlso, how did Colson Whitehead's keynote speech resonate with you?
