  "content": "The man is shocked and horrified when he hears the crash and sees the elephant fall through the ceiling of the bar. He quickly runs back inside, his heart racing with fear for the girl's safety. When he reaches the table where the girl was hiding, he sees that it has been crushed by the elephant's massive body.\n\nThe man's heart sinks, and he can't believe what has happened. He feels a wave of grief and despair wash over him, and he falls to his knees beside the table, tears streaming down his face. He knows that there is nothing he can do to save the girl, and he can't bear the thought of her being gone.\n\nThe man stays there for a long time, mourning the loss of the young girl and trying to come to terms with what has happened. He knows that the accident was not his fault, but he can't help feeling guilty and responsible. He wishes that he could have done something to prevent the tragedy, but he knows that it was out of his control.\n\nEventually, the man gets up and walks outside, where he sees that the paramedics and other emergency responders have arrived. He knows that he needs to tell them what happened and let them take care of the situation, and he also knows that he needs to get some help for himself. He is in shock and grief, and he knows that he needs support and care to get through this difficult time.\n\nThe man takes a deep breath and begins to tell the responders what happened, his voice trembling with emotion. He knows that it will be a long and difficult road ahead, but he is determined to get through it and find a way to heal and move on.",
