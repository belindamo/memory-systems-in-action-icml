Here's what she had to say:\n\n**Emily Wilson:** \"Fabric and texture are essential components of my scenic designs. I love experimenting with different materials and techniques to create immersive, tactile environments that draw the audience in. For 'Beauty and the Beast', I wanted to create a sense of opulence and grandeur, so I incorporated a range of fabrics and textures to bring the Beast's castle to life.\n\n**Approach to Fabric and Texture:**\n\n\"When I'm designing a backdrop, I think about the texture and fabric choices that will best evoke the mood and atmosphere of the scene. I consider the weight, drape, and color of the fabric, as well as how it will respond to light and movement. For 'Beauty and the Beast', I used a combination of velvet, lace, tulle, and organza to create a sense of depth and layering in the ballroom scene.\n\n**Fabric Selection:**\n\n\"I choose fabrics that are not only visually appealing but also durable enough to withstand the rigors of a theatrical production. I often opt for fabrics with a bit of texture or sheen to add depth and interest to the design. For the Beast's castle, I selected a rich, velvety fabric for the walls and a lighter, more ethereal fabric for the drapes.\n\n**Texture and Dimension:**\n\n\"I love adding texture and dimension to my backdrops using a range of techniques. For 'Beauty and the Beast', I used fabric manipulation, layering, and draping to create a sense of depth and visual interest. I also incorporated props and set pieces, like candelabras and furniture, to add an extra layer of texture and realism.\n\n**Specific Examples from 'Beauty and the Beast':**\n\n* \"One of my favorite elements of the ballroom scene was the use of tulle to create a sense of misty, dreamlike quality. I draped the tulle across the backdrop, using wire and string to create a sense of movement and flow.\n* \"For the Beast's castle, I used a combination of fabric and paper to create a sense of stone and stonework. I painted the fabric to resemble stone, then layered it with paper to create a sense of texture and dimension.\n* \"In the enchanted forest scene, I used a range of fabrics, including felt, burlap, and velvet, to create a sense of earthy, organic texture. I also incorporated natural elements, like leaves and branches, to add an extra layer of realism.\n\n**Tips and Insights:**\n\n* \"When working with fabric and texture, remember to consider the scale and proportion of the design. What looks great in a small sample may not translate to a large, theatrical backdrop.\n* \"Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. Fabric and texture can be incredibly versatile, and there are often unexpected ways to use them to create a unique and captivating design.\n* \"Collaborate with your team and be open to feedback. The more eyes and brains you have on a project, the more likely you are to come up with something truly innovative and effective.\"\n\nEmily's approach to incorporating fabric and texture into her scenic designs is truly inspiring. Her attention to detail, creativity, and willingness to experiment have resulted in some truly breathtaking backdrops that transport audiences to new and imaginative worlds.",
