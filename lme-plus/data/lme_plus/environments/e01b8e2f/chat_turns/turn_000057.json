It's also essential to listen to your body and take rest days when needed.\n\nRemember, strength training is just one aspect of your overall triathlon training. Make sure to also focus on your swimming, biking, and running, and don't forget to incorporate brick workouts and rest days into your schedule.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your training, and I hope you crush your sprint triathlon in June!",
