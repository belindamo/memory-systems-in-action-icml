  "content": "That's awesome, thanks for the recommendations! I'll definitely check out some of the traditional Irish musicians and bands you mentioned, and I'm interested in attending a seisi\u00fan or two while I'm in Ireland. I've also been thinking about learning some traditional Irish dances, like the jig or the reel. Do you know of any dance schools or instructors in Dublin or Galway that offer classes for beginners? And by the way, speaking of my Italian roots, I've been meaning to ask: are there any Italian cultural events or festivals in Ireland that I should know about?",
