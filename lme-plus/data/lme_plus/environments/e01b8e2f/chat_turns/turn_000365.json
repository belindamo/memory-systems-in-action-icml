Here's a step-by-step guide to her process, along with some specific examples from her work on \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\":\n\n**Step 1: Script Analysis and Research**\n\n\"When I first receive the script, I read it multiple times to absorb the story, characters, and setting. I research the time period, location, and cultural context to get a sense of the overall aesthetic and atmosphere. For 'The Wizard of Oz', I researched the original illustrations by W.W. Denslow and the 1939 film adaptation to get a sense of the iconic imagery associated with the story.\n\n**Step 2: Conceptualization and Sketching**\n\n\"I start brainstorming ideas and sketching out rough concepts for the backdrop. I think about the mood, color palette, and composition that will best capture the essence of each scene. For 'Beauty and the Beast', I knew I wanted to create a sense of grandeur and opulence, so I sketched out ideas for intricate archways, ornate chandeliers, and lavish fabrics.\n\n**Step 3: Collaboration with the Director and Set Designer**\n\n\"I meet with the director and set designer to discuss my concepts and get feedback. We talk about the overall vision for the production, the tone they want to achieve, and any specific requirements for the backdrop. For 'The Wizard of Oz', the director wanted a more whimsical, fantastical feel, so we decided to incorporate more vibrant colors and stylized shapes.\n\n**Step 4: Creating a Scale Model or Mockup**\n\n\"I create a scale model or mockup of the backdrop to test the design and get a sense of how it will look on stage. This is a crucial step, as it allows me to work out any kinks and make adjustments before committing to the full-scale painting. For 'Beauty and the Beast', I created a detailed model of the Beast's castle, complete with intricate stonework and Gothic arches.\n\n**Step 5: Painting the Backdrop**\n\n\"Once the design is finalized, I begin painting the backdrop. I work with a team of assistants to complete the massive canvas, using a combination of techniques and materials to achieve the desired effect. For 'The Wizard of Oz', we used a combination of spray paint, brushwork, and stencils to create the iconic yellow brick road and Emerald City.\n\n**Step 6: Adding Texture and Dimension**\n\n\"I add texture and dimension to the backdrop using various materials and techniques. This could include fabric, paper, or even found objects to create a more tactile, immersive environment. For 'Beauty and the Beast', I used a combination of fabric, lace, and tulle to create a sense of depth and layering in the ballroom scene.\n\n**Step 7: Installation and Final Touches**\n\n\"Once the backdrop is complete, I work with the production team to install it on stage. I make any final adjustments, adding additional details or making tweaks as needed. For 'The Wizard of Oz', we added some final details, like glittering emeralds and a few strategically placed props, to bring the scene to life.\n\n**Step 8: Dress Rehearsal and Opening Night**\n\n\"I attend the dress rehearsal to ensure the backdrop is working as intended, making any last-minute adjustments as needed. On opening night, I'm thrilled to see the backdrop come alive with the actors, lighting, and music. It's a truly magical experience!\"\n\nEmily's process is a great example of how scenic designers approach creating a backdrop, from concept to completion. Her attention to detail, creativity, and collaboration with the production team result in stunning, immersive environments that transport audiences to new worlds.",
