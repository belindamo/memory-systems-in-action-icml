  "content": "In Reiki, the term \"universal life energy\" refers to the energy that forms and sustains all living things in the universe. It is believed that this energy flows through living beings, and that when it is blocked or depleted, it can lead to physical, emotional or spiritual imbalances. The practice of Reiki aims to work with this \"universal life energy\" to heal and harmonize the body, mind, and spirit.\n\nAlthough Reiki has some roots in Japanese Buddhism and Shintoism, it's not a religion, nor is it tied to any particular belief system. Reiki is considered to be a spiritual practice but is not associated with any religious doctrine. It can be viewed as a universal concept that transcends cultural or religious boundaries. Reiki practitioners strive to be open and accepting of all belief systems and cultural backgrounds. \n\nThe practice of Reiki does involve the use of certain symbols and mantras that serve as a focus point or intention for the energy healing. However, these symbols are often viewed simply as tools to help the practitioner connect more deeply with the \"universal life energy\" and are not associated with any specific religious meaning.\n\nOverall, the practice of Reiki can be considered as a form of complementary and alternative medicine that aims to restore balance and harmony in the body, mind, and spirit. It is a versatile practice, ideal for those who value the spiritual aspect of healing or are looking for a complementary technique to more traditional forms of medicine or therapy.",
