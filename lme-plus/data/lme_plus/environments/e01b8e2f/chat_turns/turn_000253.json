  "content": "That's a great idea! Serving a Japanese-inspired dessert will really tie the whole menu together. I think I'll go with the Mochi Brownies - they sound unique and delicious. I've been experimenting with different ingredients in my Japanese cooking classes, and I think I can make a great mochi topping to go with the brownies. Thanks for the suggestion! \n\nCan you give me some tips on how to make a good mochi topping for the brownies? I've worked with mochiko flour before, but I'm not sure how to get the right consistency for a topping.",
