Here's the information I've gathered so far:\n\n**Trip #1: Mountain Getaway with Friends**\n\n* Destination: Mountains (exact location not specified)\n* Dates of travel: Approximately 3 months ago (I'll assume it was a weekend, so Friday to Sunday)\n* Notable events or activities: Hiking, exploring, and reaching the top of a challenging trail with an amazing view\n\nTo make it more specific, can you tell me:\n\n1. Which month was it approximately 3 months ago? (e.g., March, April, or May)\n2. Was it a specific weekend, like a holiday weekend or a random one?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can create a more accurate calendar event for you!",
