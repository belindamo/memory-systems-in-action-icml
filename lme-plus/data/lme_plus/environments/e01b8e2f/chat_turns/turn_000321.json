It's always a good feeling to have a trusty backup bike, especially when you're reliant on your bike for daily commuting.\n\nI'm also glad to hear that you've been feeling safer with the new lights you got in December. Visibility is so important when cycling, especially during the darker months. It's always a good idea to prioritize safety and take steps to make yourself more visible to other road users.\n\nHave you noticed any differences in your daily commute since switching to the hybrid bike? For example, have you found that it's more comfortable or easier to navigate through traffic?",
