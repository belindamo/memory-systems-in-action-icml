  "content": "I think the ankle strap heels would be a great choice for the wedding, especially since you mentioned they're comfortable. I've been trying to take better care of my shoes lately, which reminds me that I got my brown loafers polished at the cobbler near my office for $15 and it made a huge difference. Do you have any tips on how to clean or condition leather sandals, in case I decide to get a pair for the wedding?",
