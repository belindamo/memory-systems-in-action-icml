I got to see the festival come together from behind the scenes, and I felt proud to be a part of it. Plus, I got to meet some of the festival organizers, who were really passionate about promoting literature and supporting local writers.\n\nAs for Colson Whitehead's keynote speech, it was truly inspiring. He talked about how storytelling has the power to humanize and give voice to marginalized communities, and how it can challenge our assumptions and biases. He also shared some personal anecdotes about his own writing process and how he draws inspiration from his life experiences.\n\nOne thing that really stuck with me was when he said that \"storytelling is a way of taking the chaos of the world and making sense of it.\" I thought that was really powerful, and it made me think about how literature can be a way of processing and understanding the world around us.\n\nOverall,",
