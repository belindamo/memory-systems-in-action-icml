As an AI language model, I'm limited in terms of the specific information I can access about the camera techniques used in \"Blast.\" However, it's important to note that the techniques used in any given film are the result of a complex and multifaceted creative process, involving not just the camera work but other elements such as lighting, sound, editing, and direction.\n\nThat being said, some specific camera techniques reportedly used in \"Blast\" to create tension and suspense during the bomb disposal scenes include:\n\n- Low-angle shots of the bomb and the bomb squad technicians, creating a sense of danger and emphasizing the importance and difficulty of the task at hand.\n- Close-up shots of the bomb detonation timers and wires, highlighting the technical and time-sensitive nature of the work and building up suspense as the timers tick down.\n- Handheld camera work to create a sense of instability and urgency in the action, moving quickly between different angles to simulate the feeling of a high-pressure situation.\n- Wide-angle shots of the surrounding area to emphasize the isolation and danger of the bomb disposal sites.\n\nOverall, the specific camera techniques used in \"Blast\" are likely part of a broader creative vision for the film's overall style and tone.",
