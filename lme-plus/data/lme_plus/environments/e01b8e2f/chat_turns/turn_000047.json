Here are some general tips to help you prepare for a triathlon, with a focus on transitions:\n\n**Overall Training Tips:**\n\n1. **Create a structured training plan**: Develop a 12-16 week training plan that includes swimming, biking, running, and brick workouts (back-to-back workouts in different disciplines). Aim to increase your training volume and intensity gradually.\n2. **Incorporate strength training**: Include exercises that target your core, legs, and upper body to improve your overall endurance and efficiency in each discipline.\n3. **Incorporate open-water swimming**: If possible, practice swimming in open water to get accustomed to swimming in a wetsuit, sighting, and navigating through water.\n4. **Practice bike handling skills**: Focus on cornering, braking, and gearing to feel comfortable on your bike.\n5. **Incorporate brick workouts**: These workouts will help you adapt to the transition from swimming to biking and biking to running.\n\n**Transition Tips:**\n\n1. **Practice transitions**: Set up a mock transition area and practice moving from swimming to biking and biking to running.
