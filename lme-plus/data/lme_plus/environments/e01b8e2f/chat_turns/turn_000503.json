Speaking of which, I recently volunteered at a literary festival in my city, where I helped set up the author panels and assisted with crowd control. It was a fantastic experience, and I got to attend some amazing sessions, including a keynote speech by Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Colson Whitehead. His insights on the power of storytelling and its impact on society were truly inspiring.",
