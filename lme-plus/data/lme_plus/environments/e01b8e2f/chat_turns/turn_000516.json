  "content": "Ankle strap heels can be a fantastic choice for a spring wedding! They're a popular style that can add a touch of elegance to your outfit. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Elegance:** Ankle strap heels can elevate your overall look and make you feel more dressed up for the occasion.\n2. **Versatility:** They can be paired with a variety of dresses, skirts, or pants, making them a versatile choice.\n3. **Spring-appropriate:** Ankle strap heels are a great choice for spring, as they show off your ankles and are lighter than boots or closed-toe shoes.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Weather:** If the wedding is outdoors, you'll need to consider the weather. If it's going to be chilly or rainy, ankle strap heels might not be the most practical choice.\n2. **Comfort:** Heels can be uncomfortable, especially if you're not used to wearing them. Make sure you've broken them in before the wedding to avoid discomfort.\n3. **Dress code:** If the wedding is more casual, ankle strap heels might be too dressy. Make sure they fit with the dress code and overall vibe of the wedding.\n\n**Tips for making ankle strap heels work for a spring wedding:**\n\n1. **Choose a neutral color:** A neutral color like beige, navy, or black will be easy to pair with your outfit and won't distract from the wedding party.\n2. **Consider the height:** If you're not comfortable in very high heels, look for a pair with a lower heel (around 2-3 inches) for a more comfortable option.\n3. **Pair with a dress or skirt:** Ankle strap heels look great with dresses or skirts, which are perfect for a spring wedding.\n4. **Add a pop of color:** If you want to add some color to your outfit, try pairing the ankle strap heels with a brightly colored dress or accessories.\n\n**Is $90 a good price?**\n\n$90 is a reasonable price for a good-quality pair of ankle strap heels. Nordstrom is a reputable retailer, and you can expect a certain level of quality from their products. If you feel the heels are comfortable, fit well, and meet your style requirements, $90 might be a good investment.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether the ankle strap heels are worth the investment. If you feel confident and comfortable in them, they could be a great choice for the wedding!",
