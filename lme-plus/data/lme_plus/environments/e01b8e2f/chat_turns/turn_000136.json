Given your increasing mileage and frequency, I'll provide some recommendations that cater to your needs.\n\n**Key considerations for your new running shoes:**\n\n1. **Distance and frequency**: Since you're running 3 times a week with increasing distances, you'll want shoes that can handle the mileage and provide adequate support and cushioning.\n2. **Foot type and pronation**: If you have flat feet, high arches, or overpronate/supinate, you may need shoes with specific features to address these issues.\n3. **Running style**: Your running style, including your foot strike pattern and stride, can influence the type of shoe you need.\n4. **Comfort and fit**: A comfortable, secure fit is essential for enjoyable runs.\n\n**Recommended running shoe categories:**\n\nBased on your running frequency and distance, I suggest considering the following categories:\n\n1. **Neutral shoes**: Suitable for runners with neutral foot pronation (not too much or too little). These shoes offer a balance of cushioning and support.\n2. **Support shoes**: If you have flat feet or overpronate, support shoes can help correct your foot alignment and reduce the risk of injuries.\n3. **Trail shoes**: If you plan to mix up your runs with trail running, trail shoes provide more aggressive tread and protection from rough terrain.\n\n**Specific shoe models to consider:**\n\nHere are a few popular models across different categories:\n\n1. **Neutral shoes**:\n\t* Brooks Ghost: A popular choice for runners with neutral foot pronation, offering a smooth ride and comfortable fit.\n\t* Asics Gel-Kayano: A great option for runners who need a balance of cushioning and support.\n2. **Support shoes**:\n\t* Brooks Adrenaline GTS: Designed for runners with flat feet or overpronation, these shoes provide supportive features and a comfortable fit.\n\t* New Balance Fresh Foam: Offers a supportive ride with a comfortable, cushioned feel.\n3. **Trail shoes**:\n\t* Salomon Speedcross: A popular choice for trail runners, with aggressive tread and a comfortable fit.\n\t* Hoka One One Challenger: Provides a cushioned ride and a comfortable fit for trail running.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Visit a specialty running store**: Go to a store with knowledgeable staff who can analyze your foot pronation, gait, and running style to recommend the best shoes for you.\n2. **Try before you buy**: Try on several shoes to ensure a comfortable fit and feel.\n3. **Replace your shoes regularly**: Aim to replace your shoes every 300-500 miles or every 3-6 months to prevent wear and tear.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect pair of running shoes!",
