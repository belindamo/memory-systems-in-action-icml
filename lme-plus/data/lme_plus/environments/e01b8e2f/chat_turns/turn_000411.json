Hurricane season in the Caribbean runs from June 1st to November 30th and during this period, the risk of tropical cyclones, including hurricanes or tropical storms, is higher. However, it's important to remember that the Caribbean is a vast area, and not all islands or countries are equally at risk. Some areas may be more prone to hurricanes than others.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check the weather forecast and monitor official sources of information, such as the National Hurricane Center or local weather agencies, if you plan to travel to the Caribbean during hurricane season. It's also recommended to have a plan in case of an emergency and follow any evacuation orders from local authorities.",
