  "content": "Tropical and non-tropical cyclones are two types of storms that form in different ways and have distinct characteristics.\n\nTropical cyclones, also known as hurricanes or typhoons, are powerful rotating storms that form over warm ocean waters near the Equator. They derive their power from warm, moist air rising from the ocean surface, which fuels the storm's growth and intensification. Tropical cyclones are classified as Category 1 to Category 5, depending on their sustained wind speed. These storms can cause widespread damage and fatalities due to high winds, storm surge, heavy rains, and flooding.\n\nNon-tropical cyclones, also known as extratropical cyclones or mid-latitude cyclones, are low-pressure systems that form outside the tropics, typically between 30 and 60 degrees latitude. These storms are driven by temperature and weather fronts, rather than warm ocean waters. Non-tropical cyclones are typically less intense than tropical cyclones but can still cause strong winds, heavy rainfall, and snowfall, depending on the season and location.\n\nOverall, the main difference between tropical and non-tropical cyclones is in their origin and the factors that drive their formation. Tropical cyclones form over warm ocean waters, while non-tropical cyclones form due to temperature differences in the atmosphere.",
