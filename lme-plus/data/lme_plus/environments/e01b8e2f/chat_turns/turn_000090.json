Short sellers aim to profit from a decline in a company's stock price, but they do not necessarily have any direct impact on the company's operations or employees.\n\nShort selling can be controversial because it is associated with a negative perception of profiting from someone else's loss. Some people argue that short selling is unethical because it involves profiting from a company's hardships, and it can contribute to market instability or volatility. Others argue that short selling plays a useful role in providing liquidity and price discovery, highlighting weaknesses in companies' financial performance or business practices, and preventing market bubbles or overvaluation.\n\nUltimately, whether short selling is ethical or not is a matter of personal opinion, and different people may hold different views on the practice. It is important to note that short selling is a legal investment strategy, and investors who engage in short selling should operate within the laws and regulations that govern financial markets.",
