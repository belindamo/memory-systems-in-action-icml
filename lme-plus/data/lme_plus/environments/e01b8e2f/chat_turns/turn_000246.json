Here are some tips to help you:\n\n**Homemade Teriyaki Sauce**\n\nMaking teriyaki sauce from scratch is surprisingly easy and only requires a few ingredients. Here's a simple recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1/2 cup soy sauce\n* 1/4 cup sake (or dry sherry or mirin)\n* 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 2 tablespoons grated ginger\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, sake, sugar, and rice vinegar. Whisk until the sugar is dissolved.\n2. Add grated ginger and garlic to the saucepan. Whisk until smooth.\n3. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.\n4. Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil (if using). Let the sauce cool to room temperature.\n5. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the ginger and garlic particles.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a good-quality soy sauce as the base of your teriyaki sauce.\n* Adjust the amount of sugar to your taste, depending on how sweet you like your teriyaki sauce.\n* You can store homemade teriyaki sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\n\n**Yakitori Skewers**\n\nFor authentic Yakitori, you'll want to use traditional Japanese skewers made from bamboo or steel. Here are some options:\n\n* **Bamboo Skewers**: Soak bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before grilling to prevent them from burning. You can find bamboo skewers at most Asian markets or online.\n* **Steel Skewers**: Steel skewers are a great alternative to bamboo skewers. Look for skewers with a flat, wide blade to prevent the chicken from spinning while grilling.\n* **Yakitori Skewer Tips**: If you can't find traditional Yakitori skewers, you can use metal or bamboo skewers with a small metal or wooden tip. This will help prevent the chicken from falling off while grilling.\n\n**Grilling Tips**\n\n* Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F).\n* Brush the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking.\n* Grill the chicken Yakitori for 5-7 minutes per side, or until cooked through.\n* Brush the chicken with teriyaki sauce during the last minute of grilling to add a caramelized glaze.\n\nI hope these tips help you create delicious Salmon Teriyaki and Chicken Yakitori dishes for your dinner party! Good luck and have fun cooking!",
