  "content": "The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) applies to loans made to consumers. The correct answer is B: Consumers.\n\nTILA is a federal law that was enacted to protect consumers from deceptive lending practices by requiring lenders to disclose certain information about the terms and conditions of their loans. The law applies to a wide range of consumer credit transactions, including mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other types of consumer loans.\n\nTILA requires lenders to provide borrowers with clear and concise information about the terms and conditions of their loans, including the annual percentage rate (APR), the total finance charge, and the total amount financed. This information must be disclosed in writing and must be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner so that borrowers can make informed decisions about whether to take out a loan.\n\nTILA applies to loans made to individuals, but it does not apply to loans made to businesses, nonprofit organizations, or government agencies. These types of loans are typically governed by different laws and regulations.",
