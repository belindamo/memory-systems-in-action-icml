  "content": "My old water bottle was around 27 oz, made of stainless steel, and had a carrying handle. It was BPA-free and dishwasher safe. I think I paid around $20 for it. By the way, I just got back from the mountains, and I drove another 200 miles to return from the mountains on the last day of my road trip.
