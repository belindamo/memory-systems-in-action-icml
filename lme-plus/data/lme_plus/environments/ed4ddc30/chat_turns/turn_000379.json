  "content": "The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) requires lenders to disclose all of the following: finance charges, payment schedule, and the total of payments. The correct answer is C: Total maximum late fees that can be assessed.\n\nTILA is a federal law that was enacted to protect consumers from deceptive lending practices by requiring lenders to disclose certain information about the terms and conditions of their loans. TILA applies to a wide range of consumer credit transactions, including mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other types of consumer loans.\n\nTILA requires lenders to disclose information about the finance charges associated with a loan, including the annual percentage rate (APR) and any fees that may be charged. TILA also requires lenders to disclose the payment schedule, including the amount of each payment, the number of payments, and the due dates of the payments. In addition, TILA requires lenders to disclose the total of payments, which is the total amount that the borrower will pay over the life of the loan.\n\nHowever, TILA does not require lenders to disclose the total maximum late fees that can be assessed. This information may be disclosed in the loan agreement or other documents provided to the borrower.",
