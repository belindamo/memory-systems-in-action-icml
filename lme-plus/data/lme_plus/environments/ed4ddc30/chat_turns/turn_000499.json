  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on vocal warm-ups to help me prepare for my singing lessons. I've been taking lessons with Rachel and I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to improve my technique. By the way, I have a theater workshop on improvisation skills at the local arts center today, so I'm excited to apply some of the skills I've learned from Rachel to my acting as well.",
