  "content": "If your institution solicits customers to open credit card accounts, it must explain all terms of the card. This means that the correct answer is C: Explain all terms of the card.\n\nUnder the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), credit card issuers are required to clearly and conspicuously disclose the terms and conditions of their credit card accounts to consumers. This includes information such as the annual percentage rate (APR), fees, and any other terms and conditions that may apply to the account.\n\nTILA requires credit card issuers to provide this information in writing and to present it in a clear and conspicuous manner so that consumers can make informed decisions about whether to open a credit card account.\n\nTILA does not require credit card issuers to answer all questions in writing within 30 days, determine the customer's credit rating, or require the customer to authorize the solicitation. These requirements may be imposed by other laws or regulations.",
