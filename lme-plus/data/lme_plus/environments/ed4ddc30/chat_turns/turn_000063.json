  "content": "Garlic Butter Shrimp is a classic! I'm happy to help you find a new seafood dish to add to your repertoire. Since you've been enjoying the rich and savory flavors of garlic butter, I'll suggest some seafood options that complement those flavors or offer a nice contrast. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Lemon Herb Scallops**: Scallops are a natural pairing with garlic butter, and adding a bright, citrusy flavor like lemon will cut through the richness. Try searing scallops with a mixture of lemon zest, parsley, and garlic, then serving with a side of quinoa or roasted vegetables.\n2. **Crab Cakes with Remoulade Sauce**: Crab cakes are a great contrast to the tender, buttery shrimp. Mix lump crab meat with panko breadcrumbs, egg, and spices, then pan-fry until crispy. Serve with a tangy remoulade sauce (a creamy, herby condiment) for a delightful flavor combination.\n3. **Grilled Swordfish with Chimichurri**: Swordfish is a meaty fish that can hold its own against the bold flavors of garlic butter. Marinate it in a zesty chimichurri sauce (made with parsley, oregano, garlic, red pepper flakes, red wine vinegar, and olive oil) before grilling, then serve with a side of roasted vegetables or quinoa.\n4. **Cioppino-Style Fish Stew**: If you want to create a heartier dish, consider a San Francisco-style cioppino. This fish stew typically features a variety of seafood (such as fish, shrimp, mussels, and clams) in a rich, flavorful broth. You can add garlic butter to the pot for added depth of flavor.\n5. **Pan-Seared Cod with Browned Butter and Capers**: For a lighter, flakier fish, try pan-searing cod with a browned butter and caper sauce. The nutty, caramel flavors of the browned butter will complement the garlic butter shrimp nicely, while the capers add a salty, tangy element.\n6. **Seafood Paella**: If you're feeling adventurous, why not try a seafood paella? This classic Spanish dish features a variety of seafood (shrimp, mussels, clams, chorizo, and chicken) cooked with saffron-infused rice. You can add garlic butter to the paella for extra flavor.\n\nThese ideas should give you a good starting point. Feel free to experiment and adjust the recipes to your taste. Who knows, you might just find a new favorite seafood dish to pair with your beloved Garlic Butter Shrimp!",
