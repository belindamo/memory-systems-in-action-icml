  "content": "A closed-end loan is a type of loan that involves a single lump-sum borrowing, with a fixed repayment schedule and a fixed interest rate. Examples of closed-end loans include mortgages, car loans, and personal loans.\n\nThe correct answer is A: Adjustable-rate mortgage. An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of closed-end loan that allows the lender to adjust the interest rate on the loan periodically based on market conditions. The borrower is required to repay the loan in fixed installments over the life of the loan.\n\nOther examples of closed-end loans include fixed-rate mortgages, car loans, and personal loans. These types of loans typically involve a single borrowing and have a fixed repayment schedule and interest rate.\n\nOn the other hand, open-end loans are loans that allow the borrower to borrow and repay funds repeatedly up to a certain credit limit. Examples of open-end loans include credit card accounts and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Credit cards and HELOCs are not closed-end loans, as the borrower is able to borrow and repay funds repeatedly within a certain credit limit. Debit cards are not loans and are not covered by TILA.",
