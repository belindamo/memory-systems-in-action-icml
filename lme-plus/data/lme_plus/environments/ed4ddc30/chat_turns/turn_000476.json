Here's a classic quiche recipe that's easy to make and adaptable to your taste:\n\n**Basic Quiche Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pie crust (homemade or store-bought)\n* 3 large eggs\n* 1 1/2 cups heavy cream or half-and-half\n* 1/2 cup shredded cheese (Cheddar, Swiss, or a mix)\n* 1/2 cup diced ham, bacon, or vegetables (optional)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Fresh herbs (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. Roll out the pie crust and place it in a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.\n3. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, and a pinch of salt and pepper.\n4. Add the shredded cheese and diced ham, bacon, or vegetables (if using) to the egg mixture. Mix well.\n5. Pour the egg mixture into the pie crust.\n6. Bake the quiche for 35-40 minutes or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set.\n7. Remove the quiche from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.\n8. Garnish with fresh herbs (if using) and serve warm or at room temperature.\n\n**Variations:**\n\n* Spinach and Feta Quiche: Add 1 cup fresh spinach leaves and 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese to the egg mixture.\n* Mushroom and Swiss Quiche: Add 1 cup saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and 1/2 cup grated Swiss cheese to the egg mixture.\n* Broccoli and Cheddar Quiche: Add 1 cup steamed broccoli florets and 1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese to the egg mixture.\n\nTips:\n\n* Blind baking the pie crust (baking it without the filling) for 5-7 minutes before adding the egg mixture can help prevent the crust from becoming soggy.\n* Use a pie shield or foil to prevent the crust from overbrowning.\n* Quiche is a great make-ahead dish; you can prepare the filling and crust separately, then assemble and bake when you're ready.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade quiche!",
