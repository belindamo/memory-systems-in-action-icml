It's great to hear that you're feeling professional and prepared.\n\nNow, let's get down to business and help you calculate your inventory for the upcoming Harvest Market on September 18th. To do this, we'll need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Previous sales data**: How many candles and soaps did you sell at the last market, and what were the most popular items?\n2. **Average sales per market**: What's your average sales amount per market?\n3. **Inventory levels**: How many candles and soaps do you currently have in stock?\n4. **Lead time**: How long does it take to restock or produce new inventory?\n5. **Desired stock levels**: How many candles and soaps do you want to have on hand for the upcoming market?\n\nLet's work through these factors together. Can you provide some numbers or estimates for each of these points? This will help me give you a more accurate calculation for your inventory needs.",
