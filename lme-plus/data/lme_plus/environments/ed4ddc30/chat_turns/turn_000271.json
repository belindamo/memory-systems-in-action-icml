  "content": "I'm happy to help you with that! However, I need a bit more information from you. Unfortunately, I don't have access to your Booking.com booking details, so I won't know the exact location of your hotel.\n\nCould you please tell me the name of your hotel or the neighborhood it's located in? That way, I can give you a better idea of which restaurants might be within walking distance.\n\nAlternatively, you can also try the following:\n\n1. Check your hotel's website or contact them directly to ask about nearby restaurants or attractions.\n2. Use a mapping service like Google Maps to enter your hotel's address and the addresses of the restaurants I mentioned earlier. This will give you an estimate of the walking distance and time between each location.\n3. Look up online reviews or travel forums for your hotel to see if other guests have mentioned nearby restaurants or dining options.\n\nOnce I know more about your hotel's location, I'd be happy to provide more tailored recommendations for restaurants within walking distance.",
