Adjusting your morning routine can be really beneficial for getting a head start on the day.\n\nStarting your workout at 8:00 am can give you a sense of accomplishment and energy to tackle the rest of your day. Plus, having some extra time to grab coffee and get ready will definitely help you feel more relaxed and prepared for your meetings.\n\nRemember to also listen to your body and make sure you're getting enough sleep to support your new morning routine. It might take some time to adjust, but it sounds like you're motivated to make a positive change!\n\nWhat type of workout do you usually do in the morning? Are you a fan of cardio, strength training, or maybe some yoga or Pilates?",
