  "content": "With that information, let's make some assumptions and calculations to estimate your inventory needs for the upcoming Harvest Market.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* You want to have a similar sales performance at the upcoming market, considering it's a similar event and season.\n* You want to have some extra stock on hand to account for unexpected demand or to avoid selling out too quickly.\n* You have a steady supply chain and can restock or produce new inventory within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Candles:**\n\t* You sold 30 candles at the last market. To be safe, let's increase that by 10-20% to account for potential growth and popularity of the pumpkin spice candle. This brings us to 33-36 candles.\n\t* Considering you want to have some extra stock, let's add 10-15 candles to that number. This means you should aim to have 43-51 candles in stock for the upcoming market.\n2. **Soaps:**\n\t* You sold 15 soaps at the last market. Again, let's increase that by 10-20% to account for potential growth. This brings us to 16.5-18 soaps.\n\t* Adding 5-10 soaps to that number for extra stock, you should aim to have 21.5-28 soaps in stock for the upcoming market.\n\n**Actionable steps:**\n\n* Check your current inventory levels for candles and soaps. If you're below the desired stock levels, consider restocking or producing more to meet the demand.\n* Focus on producing more pumpkin spice candles, as they seem to be popular. You may also want to consider offering a limited-time promotion or discount to drive sales.\n* Review your pricing strategy to ensure you're competitive and profitable.\n* Make sure you have enough packaging materials, such as bags, twine, and business cards, to accommodate the expected sales.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be well-prepared for the Harvest Market on September 18th. Good luck, and I hope you have a successful event!",
