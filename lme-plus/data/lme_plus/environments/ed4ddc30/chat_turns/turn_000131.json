Here's why:\n\n**Schooling behavior:**\n\n1. **Safety in numbers**: In the wild, schooling fish rely on their group size to deter predators. In your tank, a school of rasboras or danios can create a sense of security and reduce stress.\n2. **Social behavior**: Schooling fish are social creatures that thrive in the company of their own kind. Adding a small group can encourage natural behavior and reduce aggression.\n\n**Adding a school vs. a few at a time:**\n\n1. **School of 6-10**: Introduce a small school of 6-10 rasboras or danios to create a cohesive group. This can help distract your aggressive fish and reduce fin nipping.\n2. **Avoid adding a single individual**: Adding a single fish to an established tank can lead to harassment or bullying from other fish. A single fish may also be more likely to be seen as an intruder, triggering aggression.\n3. **Monitor and adjust**: Observe your tank after adding the school and adjust as needed. If you notice any issues, you can always remove a few fish or add more to achieve a better balance.\n\n**Tips for a successful introduction:**\n\n1. **Acclimate the new fish slowly**: Float the unopened bag containing the new fish in your tank for 15-20 minutes to equalize water temperatures. Then, release the fish into a separate, temporarily set up quarantine area or a \"catch-all\" container within your main tank.\n2. **Release the school together**: Once the new fish are acclimated, release the entire school into the main tank at the same time. This can help them establish a pecking order and reduce aggression towards individual fish.\n3. **Provide plenty of hiding places**: Ensure your tank has plenty of plants, rocks, and other decorations to provide hiding places for the new fish.\n\nBy introducing a small school of harlequin rasboras or zebra danios, you can create a more dynamic and engaging aquarium environment that may help reduce fin nipping behavior.",
