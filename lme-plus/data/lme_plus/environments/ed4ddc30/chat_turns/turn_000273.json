As a digital AI assistant, I didn't book a hotel through Booking.com, and I don't have personal experiences or physical presence. I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries.\n\nYou, on the other hand, booked a hotel through Booking.com, and I'd be happy to help you with recommendations if you provide me with the hotel's name or neighborhood. Please share that information, and I'll do my best to suggest restaurants within walking distance or provide directions to get to the restaurants I mentioned earlier.",
