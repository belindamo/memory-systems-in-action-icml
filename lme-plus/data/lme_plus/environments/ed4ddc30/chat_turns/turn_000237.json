  "content": "Experimenting with coffee-to-water ratios is a great way to find your perfect cup!\n\nFor a medium-roasted Kochere, a good starting point for a pour-over ratio is between 1:15 and 1:17. This means for every 1 gram of coffee, you'll use 15-17 grams of water.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n* **1:15 ratio:** This is a good starting point if you prefer a slightly stronger, more intense cup. This ratio will bring out the coffee's brighter, fruitier notes and a hint of acidity.\n* **1:16 ratio:** This is a balanced ratio that will showcase the coffee's smooth, chocolatey notes and a hint of fruitiness. This is a great starting point if you're looking for a well-rounded cup.\n* **1:17 ratio:** This is a good option if you prefer a lighter, more nuanced cup with a focus on the coffee's floral and tea-like notes.\n\nRemember, the key to finding your perfect ratio is to experiment and adjust to your taste preferences. You can always adjust the ratio up or down to find the perfect balance for your taste buds.\n\n**Tips for adjusting your coffee-to-water ratio:**\n\n* **Start with a smaller ratio:** If you're new to experimenting with ratios, start with a smaller ratio (1:15) and adjust up to find your perfect balance.\n* **Adjust in small increments:** When adjusting your ratio, try changing it by 0.5-1 gram of coffee at a time to see how it affects the flavor.\n* **Pay attention to flavor notes:** Take note of the flavor notes you're experiencing and adjust the ratio based on what you want to bring out in the coffee.\n* **Experiment with different roasts:** Different roasts will respond differently to changes in the coffee-to-water ratio. Experiment with different roasts to find the perfect ratio for each one.\n\nHappy experimenting, and I hope you find your perfect cup!",
