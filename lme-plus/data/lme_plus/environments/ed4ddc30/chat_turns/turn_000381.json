  "content": "The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) ensures that loan terms are disclosed in a meaningful way. This means that the correct answer is D: Loan terms are disclosed in a meaningful way.\n\nTILA is a federal law that was enacted to protect consumers from deceptive lending practices by requiring lenders to disclose certain information about the terms and conditions of their loans. TILA applies to a wide range of consumer credit transactions, including mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other types of consumer loans.\n\nTILA requires lenders to provide borrowers with clear and concise information about the terms and conditions of their loans, including the annual percentage rate (APR), the total finance charge, and the total amount financed. This information must be disclosed in writing and must be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner so that borrowers can make informed decisions about whether to take out a loan.\n\nTILA does not ensure that all loans are processed fairly, that financial institutions comply with Regulation Z, or that the APR is higher than the interest rate. These requirements may be imposed by other laws or regulations.",
