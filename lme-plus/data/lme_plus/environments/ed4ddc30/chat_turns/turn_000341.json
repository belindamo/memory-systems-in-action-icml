Can we work together to find a solution that works for both of us?\"\n\n3. \"I don't feel comfortable with the way you are speaking to me. Can we please communicate respectfully?\"\n\n4. \"I would prefer if we could focus on finding a solution rather than placing blame on each other.\"\n\n5. \"I would like to express my thoughts and feelings without interruption. Can you please let me finish before responding?\"\n\n6. \"I understand that you have a position of authority, but it's important for me to feel valued and respected in this conversation.\"\n\nRemember, the key is to express your needs politely but firmly and to acknowledge the other person's perspective without compromising your own boundaries.",
