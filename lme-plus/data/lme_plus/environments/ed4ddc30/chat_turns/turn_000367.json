  "content": "A conductor typically has a clear plan for when to bring in specific instruments or sections of the orchestra during a performance, but they are also making decisions in the moment based on what they are hearing and observing. \n\nWhile the conductor will have studied and practiced the score in advance, they still need to make real-time adjustments during the performance. This is because the conductor is carefully listening to the performance to keep track of how things are sounding and to anticipate when different instruments or sections need to be introduced or emphasized.\n\nTo do this, the conductor is paying very close attention to what each musician is playing, as well as the overall mood and feel of the music. They interpret the composer's instructions and markings, such as tempo changes, dynamic shifts, and articulations, as clues to help them determine when and how various instruments should be introduced. \n\nAt the same time, conductors need to be continually aware of everything that is happening on stage, including the body language and cues of the musicians. This includes watching for signals from the concertmaster or other section leaders about when their sections should play, as well as ensuring that everyone is coordinating their playing and remaining synchronized with each other. \n\nOverall, being a conductor requires an exceptional level of focus and attention to detail, as well as the ability to make decisions in real-time based on the specific nuances of the performance.",
