  "content": "That's a great idea! Sharing your experience with the sales associate can help them understand your preferences and budget constraints. By mentioning that you recently spent $200 on a perfume that's out of your budget, you're giving them context and showing that you're willing to splurge, but also looking for more affordable options.\n\nWhen you share this information, you might say something like:\n\n\"Hi, I recently treated myself to a perfume that was a bit of a splurge \u2013 it was around $200. While I love it, I know it's not something I can afford regularly. I'm looking for something similar, but at a more affordable price point. Do you have any perfumes that might fit the bill?\"\n\nBy being honest about your budget and preferences, you're giving the sales associate a better understanding of what you're looking for. They might have some suggestions or recommendations that can help you find a similar perfume at a lower price point.\n\nAdditionally, sharing your experience might also help the sales associate understand that you're not just looking for a cheap perfume, but rather a quality fragrance that fits your budget. They might be more likely to recommend something that meets your standards, rather than just pushing a cheaper option.\n\nRemember to be open-minded and receptive to their suggestions. You might be surprised at the options they present, and you could find a new perfume that you love just as much as the expensive one!",
