Cats love to observe the outdoors, and being able to look outside while scratching can provide mental stimulation and entertainment.\n\nHere are a few benefits of placing scratching surfaces near windows:\n\n1. **Viewing pleasure**: As you mentioned, Luna can observe the outdoors, watching birds, trees, and other small creatures, which can be very engaging.\n2. **Natural light**: Windows allow natural light to enter, which can help maintain Luna's circadian rhythms and overall mood.\n3. **Ventilation**: If the window is openable, you can provide a gentle breeze, which can be refreshing for Luna.\n4. **Multi-functional**: By placing a scratching surface near a window, you're providing Luna with a multi-functional area where she can scratch, stretch, and observe the outdoors simultaneously.\n\nHowever, keep the following in mind:\n\n1. **Sunlight**: Be cautious of direct sunlight, especially during peak hours, as it can cause overheating or discomfort for Luna. You might consider using window filters or curtains to reduce the intensity of the sun's rays.\n2. **Drafts**: If the window is open, ensure that the draft isn't too strong, as it might make Luna uncomfortable or even create a chill.\n3. **Bird-watching**: If Luna becomes too focused on watching birds outside, it might lead to frustration or stress if she can't catch them. You can try placing a bird-watching station or a bird feeder at a safe distance to distract her.\n4. **Window safety**: Make sure the window is securely closed and that Luna can't escape or get injured by trying to jump out.\n\nWhen placing the scratching surfaces, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Stability**: Ensure the scratching post or tree is stable and won't topple over if Luna jumps on it or scratches vigorously.\n2. **Comfort**: Choose a scratching surface with a comfortable texture and angle that allows Luna to scratch and stretch comfortably.\n3. **Accessibility**: Place the scratching surface in an area that's easily accessible for Luna, so she can use it whenever she wants.\n\nBy providing Luna with a scratching surface near a window, you're creating an inviting and engaging space that combines physical activity with mental stimulation. Enjoy watching her enjoy her new setup!",
