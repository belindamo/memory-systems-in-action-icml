  "content": "Yes, Djibouti has been able to maintain its unique identity despite the French influence. The country has been able to preserve its traditional language, religion, and culture. Although French is one of the official languages, the Somali and Afar languages, which are spoken by the majority of the population, are still the most common.\n\nDjiboutian culture is a blend of various ethnic groups, including the Somali, Afar, and Arab communities. The traditional Djiboutian music, dance, and clothing have not been influenced much by the French. Djibouti has also established its own cultural institutions, such as the Djibouti National Museum, to promote and protect its cultural heritage.\n\nAdditionally, Djibouti has maintained its own political and economic policies after gaining independence from France. It has taken steps to diversify its economy and strengthen its political relationships with other African countries.\n\nOverall, while French influence has had an impact on Djibouti's culture and society, Djibouti has been able to retain its unique identity and establish itself as an independent nation.",
