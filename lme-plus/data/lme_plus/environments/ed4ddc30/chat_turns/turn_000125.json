  "content": "That's a great plan! I'm confident that you'll find a perfume that you'll love at Target's Market Pantry. Don't hesitate to ask the sales associate for help or recommendations. They're there to assist you and might have some valuable insights or knowledge about the perfumes.\n\nWhen you ask the sales associate about recommendations, be sure to provide them with some details about the $20 perfume you saw last weekend. This will help them narrow down some options that might be similar. You can say something like:\n\n\"Hi, I saw a perfume last weekend that I really liked, but I'm not sure if it's still available. It was around $20 and had a [insert fragrance family or notes, e.g., floral, fruity, oriental] scent. Do you have any perfumes that might be similar or that you would recommend?\"\n\nBy providing this information, you'll give the sales associate a better understanding of what you're looking for, and they can try to find a similar perfume or suggest something that might appeal to your taste.\n\nRemember to take your time, have fun, and don't be afraid to ask questions. You might even discover a new fragrance that you love even more than the original one!\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a perfume that makes you feel confident and happy!",
