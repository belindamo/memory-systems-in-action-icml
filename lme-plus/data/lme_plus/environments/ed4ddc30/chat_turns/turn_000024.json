  "content": "I've been really into Italian food lately, and I've been experimenting with different pasta dishes. Speaking of which, I recently learned to make a delicious Italian pasta dish with a creamy sauce in a cooking class on a Saturday morning. I was impressed by how easy it was to whip up the sauce using just a few ingredients like butter, cream, and parmesan cheese. Do you have any other pasta recipes that I might enjoy?",
