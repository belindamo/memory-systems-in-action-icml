  "content": "I'm actually attending a theater workshop on improvisation skills at the local arts center today, and I think In the Heights could be a great inspiration for some of the exercises we'll be doing. The show's blend of hip-hop, Latin music, and musical theater could be really interesting to explore in an improvisational context. Do you think there are any specific scenes or songs from the show that could be used as a starting point for improvisation exercises?",
