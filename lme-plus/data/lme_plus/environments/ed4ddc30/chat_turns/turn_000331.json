Begin by introducing yourself, discussing your child's strengths, and explaining your concerns related to their ADHD. 2. Be specific about your child's ADHD and the challenges it presents. Explain how it affects their learning and behavior, and provide examples if possible. 3. Share information about any accommodations or therapies that have worked for your child in the past. Discuss any support that you believe may be helpful for your child in the school setting, such as extra time on tests, a designated quiet space to work, or a reward system for good behavior. 4. Work together with the teacher to establish a plan for managing your child's ADHD in the classroom. Consider developing a behavior plan that outlines specific goals and rewards for your child. 5. Keep an open line of communication with the teacher throughout the school year. Check in regularly to see how your child is doing and to discuss any adjustments that may be necessary.
