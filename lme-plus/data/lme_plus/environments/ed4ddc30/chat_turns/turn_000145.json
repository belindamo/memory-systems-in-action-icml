It has a capacity of 5,000mAh, which can charge your iPhone 13 Pro about 1.5 times and your Samsung smartwatch multiple times. The wireless charging pad is perfect for your smartwatch, and the USB-A ports can charge your iPhone 13 Pro and other devices.\n2. **Mophie Powerstation Wireless XL**: This power bank has a capacity of 10,000mAh and features two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a wireless charging pad. It's a bit larger than the Anker option, but it can charge your iPhone 13 Pro about 2.5 times and your Samsung smartwatch multiple times. The wireless charging pad is convenient for your smartwatch, and the USB-A ports can charge your iPhone 13 Pro and other devices.\n3. **Belkin Boost Up Charge Power Bank**: This power bank has a capacity of 10,000mAh and features two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a wireless charging pad. It's a sleek and compact option that can charge your iPhone 13 Pro about 2.5 times and your Samsung smartwatch multiple times. The wireless charging pad is perfect for your smartwatch, and the USB-A ports can charge your iPhone 13 Pro and other devices.\n\nWhen choosing a portable power bank, consider the following factors:\n\n* Capacity: A higher capacity (measured in mAh) means more charges for your devices. For example, a 5,000mAh power bank can charge a smartphone about 1-2 times, while a 10,000mAh power bank can charge it 2-3 times.\n* Ports: Look for a power bank with multiple USB-A ports and a USB-C port for faster charging. A wireless charging pad is a bonus for charging your smartwatch or other Qi-enabled devices.\n* Size and weight: Compact and lightweight power banks are easier to carry, but may have smaller capacities. Larger power banks may be heavier but offer more capacity.\n* Brand reputation: Choose a reputable brand like Anker, Mophie, or Belkin, which offer high-quality products with reliable performance and safety features.\n\nRemember to always check the product description and reviews to ensure the power bank is compatible with your iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung smartwatch.",
