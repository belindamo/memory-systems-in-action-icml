  "content": "I'm excited to explore In the Heights as inspiration for our improvisation exercises today at the theater workshop. I think focusing on the emotional core of the scenes and songs will help us create more authentic and engaging performances. I'll definitely keep in mind the importance of ensemble building and cultural sensitivity, as well as the show's unique blend of hip-hop, Latin music, and musical theater. Thanks for the suggestions and tips!",
