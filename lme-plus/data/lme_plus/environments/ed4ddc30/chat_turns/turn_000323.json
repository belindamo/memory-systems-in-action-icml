Reviewing your budget and expenses regularly will help you stay on top of your finances and make adjustments as needed. It's essential to regularly assess your spending habits and make sure you're aligning with your financial goals.\n\nThe \"want\" list is a fantastic idea! It's a great way to separate needs from wants and prioritize your desires. By writing down things you want to buy, you'll be able to:\n\n1. **Identify patterns**: You might notice that you're consistently wanting similar items or falling into certain spending habits.\n2. **Prioritize**: You can prioritize your wants based on importance and urgency, ensuring you're focusing on the things that matter most to you.\n3. **Delay gratification**: By waiting a certain period before reconsidering a purchase, you'll be able to determine if the item is something you truly need or if the desire was just an impulsive want.\n4. **Make intentional decisions**: When you do decide to make a purchase, you'll be able to do so with confidence, knowing that it aligns with your financial goals and values.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be patient and kind to yourself throughout this process. Developing new habits and changing your spending habits takes time, and it's okay to make mistakes along the way.\n\nHere's a suggestion to take it a step further:\n\n* **Create a \"done\" list**: In addition to your \"want\" list, consider creating a \"done\" list to track your accomplishments and progress. This will help you see how far you've come and celebrate your successes.\n* **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your \"want\" list and \"done\" list to ensure they're still aligned with your financial goals and values. Make adjustments as needed to stay on track.\n\nYou're doing an amazing job of taking control of your finances and making intentional decisions. Keep up the great work!\n\nHow do you plan to organize your \"want\" list and \"done\" list? Will you use a note-taking app, spreadsheet, or physical journal?",
