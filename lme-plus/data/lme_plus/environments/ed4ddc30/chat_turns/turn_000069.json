Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Refrigeration:**\n\n* Refrigerate leftover crab cakes within 2 hours of cooking.\n* Place the crab cakes in a covered, airtight container or wrap them individually in plastic wrap or aluminum foil.\n* Store them in the refrigerator at 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below.\n* Cooked crab cakes can be refrigerated for up to 3 to 5 days.\n\n**Freezing:**\n\n* Freezing is a great way to preserve crab cakes for a longer period. However, it's essential to freeze them properly to maintain their texture and flavor.\n* Cool the cooked crab cakes to room temperature to prevent the formation of ice crystals, which can affect texture.\n* Place the cooled crab cakes in airtight, freezer-safe containers or freezer bags, making sure to remove as much air as possible before sealing.\n* Label the containers or bags with the date and contents.\n* Store the crab cakes in the freezer at 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C) or below.\n* Frozen crab cakes can be stored for up to 3-4 months.\n\n**Thawing and Reheating:**\n\n* When you're ready to reheat the frozen crab cakes, remove them from the freezer and place them in the refrigerator overnight to thaw.\n* Once thawed, you can reheat the crab cakes in the oven, pan-fry them, or microwave them until heated through.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Before reheating, inspect the crab cakes for any signs of spoilage, such as an off smell or slimy texture. If you notice any, it's best to err on the side of caution and discard them.\n* When reheating, make sure the crab cakes reach an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n* Reheated crab cakes might not be as crispy as freshly cooked ones, but they should still be delicious and safe to eat.\n\nBy following these storage and reheating guidelines, you can enjoy your leftover crab cakes while maintaining their quality and safety.",
