  "content": "Djiboutian cuisine is a blend of Somali, Afar, and other African, Middle Eastern, and French influences. The cuisine features a lot of meat dishes, particularly goat and camel, and staple grains like rice, pasta, and bread. Some popular Djiboutian dishes include Sabayad, a Somali flatbread made from flour, sugar, and water, and sweetened with honey; Lahoh, a Somali pancake-like bread made from grain flours; Fah-fah or Soupe Djiboutienne, a spicy stew made with meat, vegetables, and various spices; and Maraq, a Somali soup made with vegetables, meat, and various spices.\n\nDjibouti also celebrates several holidays and festivals. For example, Independence Day is celebrated on June 27th, which marks the country's independence from France in 1977. Other significant holidays include Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, and also the Eid al-Adha or Festival of Sacrifice, which honors the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son. Christmas, New Year, and Labor Day are also celebrated in Djibouti, though not as widely as religious holidays.\n\nAdditionally, Djiboutians celebrate various cultural events such as the Djibouti International Cultural Festival, which is organized every year showcasing the cultural diversity of the country. Lastly, the camel trade fair or Moussem is an annual event, celebrated across Djibouti's major nomadic towns where herders gather to trade and sell their livestock.",
