  "content": "What a fascinating topic! I'd be happy to help you with finding relevant articles on deep learning applications in cancer diagnosis. Here are some top sources and databases you can explore:\n\n1. **PubMed**: A comprehensive database of biomedical literature, including articles on AI and cancer diagnosis. You can filter your search using keywords like \"deep learning,\" \"cancer diagnosis,\" \"computer-aided detection,\" and specific types of cancer (e.g., breast, lung, etc.).\n2. **arXiv**: A preprint server that hosts a vast collection of papers on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision, including applications in cancer diagnosis.\n3. **ResearchGate**: A social networking site for scientists and researchers, where you can search for articles, papers, and projects related to AI in cancer diagnosis.\n4. **ScienceDirect**: An online platform that hosts a large collection of scientific and technical journals and books, including those focused on AI and healthcare.\n5. **Nature Medicine**: A leading international journal that frequently publishes articles on AI and machine learning in healthcare, including cancer diagnosis.\n6. **NeurIPS Proceedings**: The conference proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, which often features papers on deep learning applications in healthcare.\n7. **IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging**: A journal that publishes articles on medical imaging and image analysis, including the application of deep learning techniques in cancer diagnosis.\n8. **Cancer Research**: A journal that publishes original research on all aspects of cancer, including the use of AI and machine learning in cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n9. **Bioinformatics**: A journal that focuses on the development and application of computational methods in biology and medicine, including AI and machine learning in cancer research.\n10. **Google Scholar**: A search engine that indexes scholarly literature across many disciplines, including AI and healthcare. You can set up alerts for new papers and articles on specific topics.\n\nIn addition to these sources, you may also want to explore online repositories of AI-related datasets and projects, such as:\n\n1. **Kaggle**: A platform that hosts datasets, competitions, and projects related to AI and machine learning, including those focused on cancer diagnosis.\n2. **Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)**: A National Cancer Institute (NCI) dataset repository that provides access to cancer imaging data for research purposes.\n3. **Medical Imaging Data Repository (MIDR)**: A repository of medical imaging data, including cancer-related datasets.\n\nRegarding your survey, congratulations on sending out the requests! Analyzing the responses from medical professionals will provide valuable insights into the current state of AI in healthcare. You may want to consider using tools like Excel, R, or Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to analyze and visualize the data.\n\nGood luck with your thesis, and I hope this helps you get started on your literature review!",
