  "content": "Sure, here are some things to consider during the school tour:\n\n1. Location of classrooms: Make sure that your child knows the location of their classrooms and how to get to them. You can also check if the school can provide a map of the school layout.\n\n2. Locker location: Do lockers have shelves and space for your child's school supplies? Can your child reach their locker easily?\n\n3. Lunchroom: Check where the lunchroom is located and how to get there. Discuss the lunchtime routine with your child and any rules related to lunchtime.\n\n4. Schedules: Go over your child's class schedule for the day and help them learn how to read and understand it. Discuss if there are any changes to the schedule on certain days (e.g., early release).\n\n5. School rules: Review the school rules with your child, including what is expected of them in terms of behavior, dress code, and attendance.\n\n6. Extracurricular activities: Check the location of after-school clubs or activities that your child may be interested in, and see what opportunities the school has for your child to get involved.\n\n7. Meet school staff: Take the opportunity to meet school staff such as the school principal, counselor, or other administrative assistants. Introduce yourself and ask any questions you may have.\n\nBy touring the school in advance, you can help ease your child's anxiety and give them a clear idea of what to expect when they start school. Remember to make the experience fun, interactive and engaging, and discuss how the school supports students with ADHD.",
