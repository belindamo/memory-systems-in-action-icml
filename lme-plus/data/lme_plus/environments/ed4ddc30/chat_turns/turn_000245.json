Here are some suggestions to incorporate fridge and oven cleaning into your daily routine:\n\n**Fridge Cleaning:**\n\n* **Weekly Task:** Set aside 10-15 minutes on Friday or Saturday to quickly tidy up the fridge. Remove any expired or spoiled food, wipe down shelves and drawers with a damp cloth, and straighten up the contents.\n* **Deep Clean:** Schedule a deeper fridge clean every 4-6 weeks. Allocate 30-60 minutes to remove all contents, wipe down walls and shelves, and clean the fridge seals and exterior.\n\n**Oven Cleaning:**\n\n* **Daily Task:** After each use, wipe down the oven racks and stove top with a damp cloth to prevent food buildup.\n* **Weekly Task:** Set aside 10-15 minutes on Sunday or Monday to quickly clean the oven window and exterior with a gentle cleanser.\n* **Deep Clean:** Schedule a deeper oven clean every 2-3 months. Allocate 1-2 hours to remove racks, clean the oven walls and floor, and tackle any tough stains.\n\n**Incorporating into Your Daily Routine:**\n\n* Consider adding these tasks to your daily cleaning routine, perhaps as a \"Friday Fridge Frenzy\" or \"Sunday Oven Sprint.\"\n* Use a habit-tracking app or planner to remind you of these tasks and stay on track.\n* Break down larger tasks into smaller chunks, making them more manageable and less overwhelming.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Clean as you go: Wipe down surfaces and clean up spills immediately to prevent crumbs and stains from building up.\n* Make it a habit: Incorporate these tasks into your daily routine, so they become second nature.\n* Don't forget the little things: Regularly cleaning the fridge and oven seals, as well as the stove top and oven window, can make a big difference in their overall cleanliness.\n\nBy incorporating these tasks into your daily routine, you'll be able to maintain a cleaner fridge and oven, and reduce the likelihood of needing to do a massive deep clean.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Do you have any other areas in your home that you'd like to tackle?",
