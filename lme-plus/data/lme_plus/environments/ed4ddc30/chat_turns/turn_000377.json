  "content": "For loans secured by a dwelling, if the annual percentage rate (APR) may increase during the life of the loan, your institution must disclose the maximum rate that may be imposed during the loan term. This means that the correct answer is B: Disclose the maximum rate that may be imposed during the loan term.\n\nUnder the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), lenders are required to clearly and conspicuously disclose the terms and conditions of loans secured by a dwelling, including information about the APR. If the APR may increase during the life of the loan, the lender must disclose the maximum rate that may be imposed and any conditions under which the rate may increase.\n\nTILA does not require lenders to allow the applicant to convert to a fixed rate at any time, notify the applicant every time the APR changes, or terminate the plan and demand repayment of the outstanding balance. These requirements may be imposed by other laws or regulations.",
