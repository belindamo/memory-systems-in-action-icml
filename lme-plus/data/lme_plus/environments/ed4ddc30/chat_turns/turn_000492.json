  "content": "Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole are both incredible artists, but their styles might not be the best fit for a high-energy hip hop class. While they're both known for their lyrical complexity and storytelling, their tracks often have a more laid-back, introspective vibe that might not provide the same level of energy and motivation as the tracks I suggested earlier.\n\nThat being said, it ultimately depends on the specific songs you're considering and the tone you want to set for your class. If you want to incorporate some of their tracks, you could try using songs that are more upbeat and energetic, such as:\n\n* Kendrick Lamar: \"Humble.\", \"DNA.\", \"King Kunta\"\n* J. Cole: \"Middle Child\", \"ATM\", \"G.O.M.D.\"\n\nThese tracks have a more driving beat and a higher energy level that might work well for a hip hop class. However, if you're looking for more upbeat tracks to keep the energy high throughout the class, you might want to stick with artists like Cardi B, Travis Scott, or Nicki Minaj, who are known for their high-energy tracks.\n\nYou could also consider mixing it up by including a few slower tracks from Kendrick or J. Cole for warm-ups or cool-downs, and then transitioning to more upbeat tracks for the higher-intensity sections of the class. This can help create a dynamic and engaging playlist that caters to different moods and energy levels.\n\nRemember, the key is to create a playlist that motivates and inspires you to move and have fun. Experiment with different tracks and see what works best for you and your class!",
