  "content": "That's a great point! Your daily market stall sales can definitely impact your inventory levels, especially since it's a regular occurrence. Let's factor that in to get a more accurate calculation.\n\n**Daily Market Stall Sales:**\n\n* Average sales per day: $100\n* You sell at the daily market stall 2 days a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays)\n* Assuming an average sale value of $10-15 per item (candles and soaps), you're selling around 6-10 items per day\n\n**Inventory Impact:**\n\n* Between now and the Harvest Market on September 18th, you'll have around 4-5 daily market stall days (2 days/week x 2-2.5 weeks)\n* Based on your average daily sales, you can expect to sell around 24-40 items (6-10 items/day x 4-5 days) at the daily market stall before the Harvest Market\n* This means you should subtract 24-40 items from your total inventory to account for the daily market stall sales\n\n**Revised Inventory Calculation:**\n\n* Candles: 43-51 (initial calculation) - 12-20 (daily market stall sales) = 23-31 candles\n* Soaps: 21.5-28 (initial calculation) - 8-16 (daily market stall sales) = 13.5-20 soaps\n\n**Actionable Steps:**\n\n* Review your current inventory levels and adjust your production or restocking accordingly to ensure you have enough stock for the daily market stall and the Harvest Market.\n* Consider increasing your production or restocking more frequently to maintain a healthy inventory level, especially for popular items like the pumpkin spice candle.\n* Monitor your sales and inventory levels closely to identify any trends or patterns that may impact your inventory needs.\n\nBy taking your daily market stall sales into account, you can get a more accurate calculation of your inventory needs and avoid overstocking or understocking. This will help you make informed decisions about production, restocking, and pricing to ensure a successful Harvest Market.",
