It explores themes of identity, community, and the American Dream, with a vibrant blend of hip-hop, salsa, and Latin music.\n3. **Dear Evan Hansen** (2015) - This musical by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul tells the story of a high school student struggling with social anxiety and loneliness. It features a contemporary pop-rock score and explores themes of social media, mental health, and human connection.\n4. **The Band's Visit** (2017) - This musical by David Yazbek is based on an Israeli film of the same name.
