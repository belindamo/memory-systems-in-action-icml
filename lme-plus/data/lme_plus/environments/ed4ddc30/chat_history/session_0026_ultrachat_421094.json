Talk about what middle school is like, what the expectations are, and what kind of support will be available.\n\n2. Tour the school: Take your child on a tour of the school before the first day. This will give them an opportunity to get familiar with the building, location of classrooms, lunchroom, and other important areas.\n\n3. Meet the teachers and school administrators: Arrange a meeting with your child's teachers and the school administrator to discuss your child's ADHD and how they can be supported in the transition process.\n\n4.

Set up regular check-ins to assess your child's progress and to ensure that they are getting the help they need.\n\n5. Discuss coping strategies: Talk with your child about coping strategies for managing ADHD symptoms in a new environment. Help your child to develop an action plan of what to do when they feel overwhelmed or anxious.\n\n6. Create a routine: Establish a routine for your child at home that includes regular study periods, exercise and physical activity, and sufficient sleep. Encourage your child to manage their time wisely to avoid becoming overwhelmed.\n\n7. Foster independence: Encourage your child to take ownership of their academic and organizational needs. Help them develop strategies for managing their time, including using a planner and setting goals.\n\nRemember, transitioning to middle school can be a challenging time for any child, even more so for those with ADHD. By working together with your child and their school, you can help ensure a successful transition."
