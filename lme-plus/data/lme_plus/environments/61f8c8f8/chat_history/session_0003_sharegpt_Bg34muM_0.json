This can be a convenient option if you are struggling to sell your home and want to move quickly.\n4. Offer incentives to potential buyers - Offering incentives to potential buyers, such as paying for their legal fees or offering a cashback bonus, can help to make your property more attractive and encourage offers.\n5.
