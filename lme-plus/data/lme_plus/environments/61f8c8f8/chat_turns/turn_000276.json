  "content": "The philosophical view that the only person you can truly trust is yourself is known as skepticism. Skepticism is the idea that knowledge is uncertain and that we cannot trust our senses or our beliefs about the world. This view holds that we should be skeptical of everything, including our own beliefs and experiences, and that the only thing we can truly trust is our own consciousness. This approach to knowledge is often associated with the work of the ancient Greek philosopher Pyrrho, who argued that the only way to achieve peace of mind is to suspend judgment about the nature of reality.",
