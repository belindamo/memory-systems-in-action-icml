  "content": "I think there might be some confusion here! The 5-acre plot in Oakdale is not directly related to the condo sale, is it? If it's a separate property, it's best to keep the focus on the condo itself and its surrounding amenities.\n\nMentioning the 5-acre plot in Oakdale might confuse potential buyers or make them think it's included in the sale of the condo, which could lead to disappointment or miscommunication. Additionally, it's not relevant to the condo's value or desirability, so it's best to leave it out of the listing.\n\nInstead, focus on highlighting the condo's best features, amenities, and location. If you're looking to sell the 5-acre plot in Oakdale, you can consider listing it separately or discussing it with potential buyers who might be interested in purchasing both properties.\n\nRemember to keep the listing concise, clear, and focused on the condo itself. You want to attract buyers who are interested in the condo and its unique features, not those who might be confused or distracted by unrelated information.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns about the listing, feel free to ask!",
