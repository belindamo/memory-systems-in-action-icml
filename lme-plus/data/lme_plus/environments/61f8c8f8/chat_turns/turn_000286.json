And don't forget to grab that coffee at The Daily Grind soon to get those last two stamps!\n\nRemember to make the reminders specific and actionable, such as \"Use FreshMart loyalty app when shopping for groceries\" or \"Grab a coffee at The Daily Grind to get closer to a free drink.\" This will help you stay on track and make it a consistent habit.\n\nAlso, try to associate using your loyalty apps or cards with a specific activity or routine, such as when you're getting your morning coffee or when you're grocery shopping. This will help make it a habitual behavior, and you'll be more likely to remember to use them.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you get those last two stamps at The Daily Grind soon!",
