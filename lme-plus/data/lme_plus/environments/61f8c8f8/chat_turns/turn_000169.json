Here are some tips to help you create a workout plan that incorporates running, strength training, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT):\n\n1. **Start with a baseline**: Continue tracking your runs with your Garmin Forerunner 245 Music and monitor your blood pressure regularly. This will give you a baseline to work from and help you track progress.\n2. **Set realistic goals**: Determine how many days per week you can commit to exercising and set specific goals for each workout. For example, you might aim to do 3 runs, 2 strength training sessions, and 1 HIIT workout per week.\n3. **Create a schedule**: Plan out your workouts for the week, including rest days. Aim to space out your runs and strength training sessions to allow for recovery time. For example:\n\nMonday: Run (30 minutes, easy pace)\nTuesday: Strength training (lower body focus)\nWednesday: Rest day\nThursday: HIIT workout (20-30 minutes)\nFriday: Run (30 minutes, moderate pace)\nSaturday: Strength training (upper body focus)\nSunday: Rest day or active recovery (e.g., yoga or a leisurely walk)\n\n4. **Incorporate strength training exercises**: Focus on exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, lunges, deadlifts, and rows. Aim for 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps for each exercise.\n5. **Add HIIT workouts**: Incorporate HIIT workouts 1-2 times per week, focusing on exercises like burpees, jump squats, or box jumps. Aim for 20-30 minutes of HIIT, with 30-60 seconds of all-out effort followed by 30-60 seconds of rest.\n6. **Incorporate rest and active recovery**: Make sure to include rest days or active recovery days (e.g., yoga, stretching, or a leisurely walk) to allow your body to recover.\n7. **Progress gradually**: Gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time. For example, you might start with shorter HIIT workouts and gradually increase the duration as you build endurance.\n8. **Monitor and adjust**: Continuously monitor your blood pressure and adjust your workout plan as needed. If you notice your blood pressure increasing, you may need to adjust the intensity or frequency of your workouts.\n9. **Stay hydrated and fueled**: Make sure to drink plenty of water and fuel your body with a balanced diet to support your workouts.\n10. **Consult a professional**: If you're new to strength training or HIIT, consider consulting with a personal trainer or fitness coach to help you create a customized workout plan.\n\nHere's an example workout plan to get you started:\n\n**Monday (Run)**\n\n* Warm-up: 5-minute easy jog\n* Run: 30 minutes at an easy pace\n* Cool-down: 5-minute stretching\n\n**Tuesday (Strength Training - Lower Body)**\n\n* Warm-up: 5-minute cardio (jogging, jumping jacks, etc.)\n* Squats: 3 sets of 10 reps\n* Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps (per leg)\n* Calf raises: 3 sets of 15 reps\n* Cool-down: 5-minute stretching\n\n**Thursday (HIIT)**\n\n* Warm-up: 5-minute cardio\n* HIIT workout: 20 minutes (e.g., burpees, jump squats, box jumps)\n* Cool-down: 5-minute stretching\n\n**Friday (Run)**\n\n* Warm-up: 5-minute easy jog\n* Run: 30 minutes at a moderate pace\n* Cool-down: 5-minute stretching\n\n**Saturday (Strength Training - Upper Body)**\n\n* Warm-up: 5-minute cardio\n* Push",
