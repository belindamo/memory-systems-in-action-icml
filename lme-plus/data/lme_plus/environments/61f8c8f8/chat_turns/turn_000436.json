Displaying your delicate antique vase alongside your 19th-century music box can be a beautiful combination, but it's essential to take extra precautions to ensure the vase's safety. Using padding or support is an excellent idea to keep your vase stable and secure in the display case. Here are some tips to help you achieve a safe and stunning display:\n\n1. **Custom-cut foam inserts**: Consider using custom-cut foam inserts specifically designed for your vase. These inserts can be made to fit the exact shape and size of your vase, providing snug support and protection.\n2. **Velvet or felt padding**: Place a layer of velvet or felt padding at the bottom of the display case to provide a soft, cushioned surface for your vase. This can help absorb any shocks or vibrations that might occur.\n3. **Support rings or collars**: Use support rings or collars specifically designed for delicate ceramics. These can be placed around the vase to prevent it from shifting or toppling over.\n4. **Display case with a soft-close door**: Opt for a display case with a soft-close door mechanism to prevent the door from slamming shut and potentially damaging your vase.\n5. **Museum-quality mounting materials**: Use museum-quality mounting materials, such as archival-quality adhesives, tapes, or mounts, to secure your vase in place. These materials are designed to be gentle on your artifacts while providing a secure hold.\n6. **Adjustable shelves or risers**: Consider using adjustable shelves or risers within the display case to customize the positioning of your vase. This can help ensure it's placed at a stable and secure angle.\n7. **Earthquake-putty or museum wax**: Apply a small amount of earthquake-putty or museum wax to the base of your vase to prevent it from shifting or sliding within the display case.\n\nWhen selecting padding or support materials, make sure to choose options that are:\n\n* Acid-free and lignin-free to prevent damage to your vase\n* Gentle on the ceramic material to avoid scratching or marking\n* Breathable to prevent moisture buildup, which can damage your vase\n* Adjustable or customizable to fit your vase's unique shape and size\n\nSome popular suppliers for display case padding and support materials include:\n\n* Museum Quality Display Cases\n* Conservation Resources\n* Hollinger Metal Edge\n* University Products\n* Gaylord Archival\n\nRemember to handle your antique vase with care when placing it in the display case, and consider consulting with a professional conservator or restorer if you're unsure about the best way to display or care for your piece.",
