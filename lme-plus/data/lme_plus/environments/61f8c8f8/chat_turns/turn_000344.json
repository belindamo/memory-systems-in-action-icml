  "content": "In this conversation, Gary Marcus is discussing the limitations of deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is particularly good at pattern recognition. Marcus argues that while deep learning has proven to be very useful, it is only one part of what is required to build intelligent systems. He points out that the human mind is capable of many other things, such as language use, analogy making, and planning, which are not yet well-understood by AI researchers. Marcus also discusses the longstanding tension between researchers who work on neural networks (like deep learning) and those who work on symbolic AI, which involves the manipulation of symbols to represent and reason about the world. Finally, Marcus comments on the way that funding and cultural dynamics within the field of AI are currently shaping the direction of research.",
