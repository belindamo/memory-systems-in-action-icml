It's great that you have Mochi to keep you company, but it's essential to connect with humans too!\n\nBoth language exchange events and one-on-one language exchange partners have their advantages. Here's a brief pros and cons of each to help you decide:\n\n**Language Exchange Events:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Meet multiple people at once, increasing your chances of finding a compatible language exchange partner\n* Opportunity to practice speaking with different people and get feedback from various native speakers\n* Often held in public places, which can be safer and more comfortable for first-time meetings\n* Can be a fun and social way to practice your language skills\n\nCons:\n\n* May not get to practice speaking as much as you'd like, as you'll be sharing time with others\n* Conversations might be more superficial due to the group setting\n* Scheduling can be limited, and events might not be held frequently\n\n**One-on-One Language Exchange Partners:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Can have more in-depth conversations and focus on specific topics or areas of improvement\n* Can schedule meetings at a time and place that suits you both\n* Can build a stronger connection and friendship with your language exchange partner\n* Can receive more personalized feedback and correction on your language skills\n\nCons:\n\n* May feel more intimidating or pressure to hold conversations, especially if you're shy or nervous\n* Need to be more proactive in finding and scheduling meetings\n* Safety concerns, as you'll be meeting a stranger one-on-one\n\nConsider your personality, goals, and preferences when deciding between language exchange events and one-on-one partners. If you're extroverted and enjoy meeting new people, language exchange events might be a great way to start. If you prefer more in-depth conversations and personalized feedback, one-on-one language exchange partners could be the better choice.\n\nYou might also consider a combination of both approaches. Attend language exchange events to meet new people and then arrange one-on-one meetings with those you click with.\n\nRemember to prioritize your safety and comfort when meeting strangers, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more advice or guidance.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a great language exchange partner or event that helps you improve your Japanese skills and makes you feel more connected in Tokyo!",
