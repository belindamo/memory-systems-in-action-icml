It allows you to store contacts, track interactions, and set reminders for follow-ups.\n2. **Contactually**: A CRM tool specifically designed for networking and relationship-building. It helps you organize your contacts, set reminders, and track interactions.\n3. **Pipedrive**: A CRM tool focused on sales pipeline management, but also suitable for tracking business contacts and follow-ups.\n4. **Airtable**: A cloud-based database that can be customized to create a CRM system. It's flexible and scalable, but requires some setup.\n5. **Copper**: A Google-recommended CRM tool that integrates seamlessly with G Suite. It's easy to use and offers automated features for follow-ups.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n1. **Google Contacts**: If you're already using Google services, Google Contacts is a simple and free way to store and organize your business contacts. You can also use Google Sheets to create a custom CRM system.\n2. **Microsoft Outlook**: If you're using Outlook for email, you can use its built-in CRM features to store contacts and track interactions.\n3. **Spreadsheet-based CRM**: You can create a custom CRM system using a spreadsheet tool like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. This approach requires more setup, but can be tailored to your specific needs.\n\nWhen choosing a CRM tool, consider the following factors:\n\n* Ease of use: How intuitive is the interface, and how easily can you add and manage contacts?\n* Integration: Does the tool integrate with your existing workflow, such as email or calendar apps?\n* Customization: Can you tailor the tool to fit your specific needs, such as adding custom fields or workflows?\n* Scalability: Will the tool grow with your network, or become too cumbersome as your contacts list expands?\n\nBefore committing to a CRM tool, you might want to try out a few options to see which one feels most comfortable for you.\n\nAs for organizing your notes from the business networking workshop, you can create a separate notebook or section in your chosen note-taking app (Evernote or Bear) to store your notes, insights, and follow-up actions. You can also create a Trello board to track your progress and follow-ups with the contacts you met during the workshop.",
