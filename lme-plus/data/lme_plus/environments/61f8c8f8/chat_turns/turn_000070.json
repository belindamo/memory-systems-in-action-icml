I recently got a new coffee grinder and a milk frother, so I've been having fun trying out different coffee drinks and flavor combinations. I've also been thinking of starting a small coffee and baking blog, where I can share my recipes and experiments with others. Do you have any tips on how to get started with blogging, or any favorite coffee and baking blogs that I should check out?",
