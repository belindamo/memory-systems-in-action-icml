That's a great starting point.\n\nFor a base building phase, the goal is to establish a consistent running habit, build your endurance, and increase your weekly mileage. To pace yourself, let's determine your current running pace and use that as a guideline.\n\n**Calculating Your Current Running Pace:**\n\nBased on your previous 5K time of 45 minutes, we can estimate your average pace per mile. There are a few ways to do this, but a simple method is to divide your finish time by the distance:\n\n45 minutes \u00f7 3.1 miles = approximately 14:30 minutes per mile\n\nThis means your current average pace is around 14:30 minutes per mile. For a base building phase, you'll want to aim for a pace that's slightly slower than your current pace. This will allow you to build endurance and make progress without pushing yourself too hard.\n\n**Base Building Pace Guidelines:**\n\nFor a base building phase, aim to run at a conversational pace, where you can still hold a conversation with someone. This is often referred to as a \"zone 1\" or \"easy\" pace. A good rule of thumb is to add 1-2 minutes to your current pace to determine your base building pace.\n\nBased on your current pace of 14:30 minutes per mile, your base building pace could be:\n\n* 15:30-16:30 minutes per mile (add 1 minute to your current pace)\n* 16:30-17:30 minutes per mile (add 2 minutes to your current pace)\n\n**How to Pace Yourself During Runs:**\n\n1. **Start slow**: Begin your runs at a slow pace, even slower than your base building pace. This will help you warm up and get into a rhythm.\n2. **Focus on effort**: Instead of focusing on your pace, pay attention to your perceived exertion. You should feel like you're working, but not pushing yourself too hard.\n3. **Use a timer**: Set a timer or use a running app to track your pace. Try to maintain a consistent pace throughout your run.\n4. **Walk breaks**: If you need to, take walk breaks to recover. This is especially important if you're new to running or coming back from a break.\n5. **Listen to your body**: If you're feeling tired or struggling to maintain your pace, slow down or take a walk break.\n\nRemember, the goal of a base building phase is to establish a consistent running habit and build endurance. Don't worry too much about your pace; focus on showing up and putting in the miles.\n\nHow does this sound? Are you ready to start your base building phase with a target pace in mind?",
