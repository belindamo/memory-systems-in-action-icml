The costume designer, Terry Dresbach, is a master of her craft, and her team has done an incredible job of recreating the clothing and textiles of 18th century Scotland.\n\n**Accuracy and Research**:\n\nThe costume team conducted extensive research to ensure that the clothing, fabrics, and accessories were accurate to the time period. They pored over historical documents, paintings, and artifacts to get a sense of the styles, fabrics, and techniques used during the 1740s. They also consulted with historians and experts in Scottish history and textiles to ensure that the costumes were authentic.\n\n**Fabric and Textiles**:\n\nThe costume team used a range of fabrics and textiles to create the clothing, including wool, linen, cotton, and silk. They sourced fabrics from all over the world to find materials that were as close as possible to those used during the 18th century. They also created their own fabrics, using traditional techniques like weaving and dyeing, to achieve the desired look and texture.\n\n**Attention to Detail**:\n\nThe attention to detail in the costumes is stunning. From the intricate embroidery on Claire's dresses to the tartan patterns on the Highlanders' kilts, every element is carefully considered to create an authentic look. The costume team even went so far as to create their own tartan patterns, using traditional Scottish weaving techniques to create unique and accurate designs.\n\n**Claire's Costumes**:\n\nClaire's costumes are particularly noteworthy, as they reflect her transition from a 1940s nurse to a 18th century woman. The costume team created a range of outfits for Claire, from her practical nurse's uniform to her elegant gowns and riding habits. Each costume is designed to reflect Claire's growing comfort in her new surroundings and her evolving sense of identity.\n\n**The Highlanders' Costumes**:\n\nThe Highlanders' costumes are also incredibly detailed, with intricate tartan patterns and traditional Scottish accessories like sgian dubhs and dirks. The costume team worked closely with Scottish historians and experts to ensure that the Highlanders' clothing was accurate to the time period and region.\n\n**Awards and Accolades**:\n\nThe costume team's hard work has been recognized with numerous awards and nominations, including several Emmy nominations for Outstanding Costume Design.\n\nOverall, the costumes in \"Outlander\" are a true highlight of the show, and a testament to the attention to detail and commitment to accuracy of the costume team.",
