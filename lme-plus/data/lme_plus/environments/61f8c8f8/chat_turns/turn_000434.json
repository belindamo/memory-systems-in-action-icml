When it comes to choosing a display case, you're right to prioritize protection and security for these delicate and valuable pieces. Here are some recommendations for display cases that would be suitable for both your vase and music box:\n\n1. **Glass-fronted display case with UV-filtering glass**: A glass-fronted case with UV-filtering glass can help protect your vase and music box from harmful light exposure, which can cause fading, discoloration, or damage. Look for glass with a UV-filtering rating of at least 99%.\n2. **Acrylic or polycarbonate display case**: Acrylic or polycarbonate cases are shatter-resistant and can provide a high level of protection for your delicate pieces. They're also lightweight and easy to clean.\n3. **Shadow box with a deep frame**: A shadow box with a deep frame can create a sense of depth and add visual interest to your display. Look for a shadow box with a frame that's at least 2-3 inches deep to provide ample space for your vase and music box.\n4. **Display case with a lock and key**: A display case with a lock and key can provide an added layer of security for your valuable pieces. This is especially important if you plan to display your pieces in a public area or in a location with high foot traffic.\n5. **Climate-controlled display case**: If you live in an area with extreme temperature or humidity fluctuations, consider a display case with climate-control features. This can help maintain a stable environment for your vase and music box, which can be sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity.\n6. **Custom-made display case**: If you have a specific design or size requirement in mind, consider commissioning a custom-made display case. This can ensure that your case is tailored to your exact needs and provides the perfect fit for your vase and music box.\n\nWhen selecting a display case, make sure to consider the following factors:\n\n* Size: Choose a case that's large enough to accommodate both your vase and music box, with some space to spare.\n* Material: Opt for a case made from high-quality materials that are durable and resistant to scratches or damage.\n* Construction: Ensure the case is well-constructed and sturdy, with secure hinges and a robust locking mechanism (if applicable).\n* Lighting: Consider a case with built-in lighting or one that allows for easy installation of lighting fixtures. This can help highlight your pieces and create a visually appealing display.\n\nSome popular brands and online retailers that offer high-quality display cases for antiques and collectibles include:\n\n* Waddell Display Cases\n* Hans Display Cases\n* Museum Quality Display Cases\n* Display Cases Unlimited\n* Etsy (for custom-made or vintage display cases)\n\nRemember to always handle your antique vase and music box with care when placing them in the display case, and consider consulting with a professional conservator or restorer if you're unsure about the best way to display or care for your pieces.",
