Eternal Life:\n* John 3:16 (For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.)\n* John 5:24 (Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.)\n* John 6:54 (Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.)\n10. Manna:\n* Exodus 16:15 (And when the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, \u201cIt is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat.\")\n* Revelation 2:17 (He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give some of the hidden manna. And I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it.)\n* John 6:31-32 (Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, \u2018He gave them bread from heaven to eat.\u2019 Jesus then said to them, \u201cTruly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.\")\n\nNote that these are just examples and there are many more verses that can be used to illustrate these concepts in the Bible.",
