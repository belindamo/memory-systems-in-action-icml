  "content": "Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus, is often considered a counterfeit because of his betrayal of Jesus. He was one of the closest followers of Jesus, but ultimately he chose to betray Jesus for money.\n\nIn the New Testament, there are several references to Judas as a traitor and a counterfeit. For example:\n\n1. Matthew 26:14-16 (Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.)\n2. Matthew 27:3-5 (Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.)\n3. Mark 14:10-11 (And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them. And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.)\n\nIn the Old Testament, there are no direct references to Judas as a counterfeit but there are some parallels that can be drawn with the figures of Ahithophel (2 Samuel 15:12-31) and Shebna (Isaiah 22:15-25) who were trusted advisors to the king but ultimately betrayed and plotted against him.\n\nJudas is also an example of a person who was given great opportunity and privilege, but chose to betray and ultimately be a counterfeit.",
