But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\u201d)\n2. John 6:31-33 (Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, \u2018He gave them bread from heaven to eat.\u2019 Jesus said to them, \u201cVery truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d)\n3. Hebrews 9:4 (which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron\u2019s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.)\n\nThese references show that Jesus is being compared to the manna that the Israelites ate in the wilderness, as the bread of life. He is the true bread from heaven that gives life to the world. The manna was a temporary provision for the Israelites while they were in the wilderness, but Jesus is the eternal bread of life that gives eternal life to those who believe in Him.",
