  "content": "If you love your morning coffee but find that it's making you feel jittery, here are a few tips to help you avoid this:\n\n1. Choose a lower-caffeine coffee: Look for coffee that has less caffeine, like decaf or a blend with a lower percentage of caffeine.\n\n2. Don't drink coffee on an empty stomach: Drinking coffee on an empty stomach can cause your blood sugar levels to drop, which can make you feel jittery. Try drinking your coffee with breakfast or after eating something.\n\n3. Drink water with your coffee: Stay hydrated by drinking water before or after your coffee. Drinking water will help flush out the caffeine quicker, which can help you avoid jitteriness.\n\n4. Don't drink too much coffee: Stick to one or two cups of coffee per day. Anything more than that could result in increased caffeine consumption, which can cause jitteriness.\n\n5. Switch to tea: Tea contains less caffeine than coffee, making it a good alternative if you want to avoid jitteriness. Try green tea, which has less caffeine and offers other health benefits.",
