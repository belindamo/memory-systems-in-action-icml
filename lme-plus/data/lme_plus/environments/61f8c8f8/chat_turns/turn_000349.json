  "content": "The \"Counterfeit-level\" dimension refers to the ways in which Satan can counterfeit or mislead God's people through scripture. Here are some examples of scripture references that relate to this dimension:\n\n1. 2 Corinthians 11:13-15 (For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.)\n2. Matthew 7:15 (Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.)\n3. 1 John 4:1 (Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.)\n4. 2 Peter 2:1-3 (But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them\u2014bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories.)\n5. Galatians 1:6-9 (I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel\u2014which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God\u2019s curse!)\n\nThese references point out that Satan uses false prophets and false teachers to lead people astray and deceive them. The Bible encourages us to be vigilant and test the spirits, to make sure that we are not being led astray by counterfeit teachings.",
