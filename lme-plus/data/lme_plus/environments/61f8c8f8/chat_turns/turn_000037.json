However, I'll provide you with some general guidance and recommendations for a dresser with smooth-gliding drawers, regardless of the brand.\n\n**What to look for:**\n\n1. **Soft-close or soft-open drawers**: These features ensure that the drawers close or open slowly and smoothly, reducing the likelihood of sticking or jamming.\n2. **Ball-bearing glides**: These are high-quality drawer slides that use ball bearings to reduce friction, allowing for smooth and quiet operation.\n3. **Dovetail construction**: This type of joint construction ensures that the drawers are built to last and can withstand frequent use.\n4. **Adjustable drawer glides**: These allow you to adjust the drawer alignment and tension, which can help prevent sticking.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nHere are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Room & Board's Hudson Dresser**: As you've already been looking at Room & Board, their Hudson Dresser features soft-close drawers and ball-bearing glides. It's a modern, sleek option with a sturdy construction.\n2. **Crate & Barrel's Parsons Dresser**: This dresser has soft-close drawers and adjustable glides, ensuring smooth operation. It's a classic, modern design that fits well in most bedrooms.\n3. **West Elm's Mid-Century Dresser**: This dresser features ball-bearing glides and a sturdy construction. While it doesn't have soft-close drawers, the glides are designed for smooth operation.\n4. **IKEA's MALM Dresser**: This affordable option features soft-close drawers and adjustable glides. It's a great budget-friendly choice, but keep in mind that the quality might not be as high as the other brands mentioned.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Read reviews**: Check reviews from other customers to see how the dresser performs in real-life use.\n2. **Check the warranty**: Look for a dresser with a comprehensive warranty that covers the drawers and glides.\n3. **Test it out**: If possible, visit a physical store to test the dresser's drawers before making a purchase.\n\nI hope this helps you in your search for the perfect dresser with smooth-gliding drawers!",
