Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Step 1: Organize Your Contacts**\n\n* Use a CRM tool like HubSpot CRM (which you're already using) or another tool like Contactually or Copper to store the contact information of the entrepreneurs you met.\n* Create a tag or label to categorize them as \"Business Networking Workshop\" or \"Potential Collaborators\" to easily filter and find them later.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up a Follow-up System**\n\n* Create a task management system using Trello, Asana, or ClickUp to schedule follow-up tasks and reminders for each entrepreneur.\n* Set up a recurring task (e.g., every 2-3 months) to check in with each entrepreneur and see how they're doing.\n* Use a template or a script to make the follow-up process more efficient and personalized.\n\n**Step 3: Track Interactions and Conversations**\n\n* Use your CRM tool to track interactions and conversations with each entrepreneur, including emails, meetings, and phone calls.\n* Take notes on the discussions you had, including potential collaboration ideas, challenges they're facing, and any next steps agreed upon.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Collaboration Opportunities**\n\n* Regularly review your CRM and task management system to identify potential collaboration opportunities.\n* Look for entrepreneurs who have complementary skills, expertise, or resources that align with your goals and projects.\n* Reach out to them to discuss potential collaboration ideas and explore ways to work together.\n\n**Step 5: Nurture Relationships**\n\n* Make an effort to add value to the entrepreneurs in your network by sharing relevant resources, introducing them to others, or offering advice.\n* Attend industry events, conferences, and meetups to stay connected with your network and potentially meet new entrepreneurs.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a system that helps you stay in touch with the entrepreneurs you met during the business networking workshop, identify potential collaboration opportunities, and nurture relationships that can lead to future projects and growth.\n\nRemember to be authentic, personalized, and consistent in your follow-ups, and always focus on providing value to others. Good luck!",
