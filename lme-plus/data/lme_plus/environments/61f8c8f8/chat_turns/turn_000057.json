  "content": "Khomeini's views on Judaism and Israel were particularly negative, and he called for the destruction of Israel and branded Judaism as a form of imperialism. These views had a significant impact on Iran's relationships with Israel and the Jewish community as a whole. \n\nIran cut off its diplomatic relations with Israel soon after the Islamic Revolution, and it has continued to be one of the most ardent critics of the Israeli government in international forums. Iran has also allied itself with anti-Israeli groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah and has provided them with financial, military, and political support.\n\nKhomeini's hostility towards Judaism has also resulted in a substantial shrinking of the country's Jewish community, who are now estimated to number fewer than 10,000. Many Jews have emigrated from Iran over the years because of fears of persecution and discrimination.\n\nIn summary, Khomeini's views on Judaism and Israel have helped to shape Iran's relationships with those nations, resulting in a significant deterioration in those relationships.",
