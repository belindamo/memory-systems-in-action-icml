Homestar Runner walks in and approaches Strong Bad's desk.]\n\nHomestar Runner: [excitedly] Hey Strong Bad! What are you up to today?\n\nStrong Bad: [sighs] Just checking my email, trying to find something interesting. [pauses and looks at the screen] Oh wait, what's this? A fan email.\n\nHomestar Runner: [interested] Ooh, a fuh-mail! What's it about?\n\nStrong Bad: [skeptically] It's about a video game called \"Fuse\". [rolls his eyes] Yawn.\n\n[Strong Bad reads the email, which asks him for his thoughts on the game \"Fuse\".]\n\nStrong Bad: [to Homestar] Hey Homestar, one of my fans wants to know what I think of \"Fuse\".\n\nHomestar Runner: [excitedly] What do you think of it, Strong Bad?\n\nStrong Bad: [skeptically] Well, it's a decent game, I guess. But it could use some improvements. [pauses and starts typing a reply to the email]\n\nStrong Bad: [typing on the keyboard] \"Thanks for reaching out and being one of my many fans. I think 'Fuse' is a decent game, but there are certainly ways it could be improved.\nFirst, all the agents need to have a massive tattoo of their emblem on their forehead. Nothing says 'badass' like a giant tattoo.\nSecond, the weapons need to be more destructive. Fuse-powered weapons are a good start, but why not add some nukes and flamethrowers to the mix?\n\n[Strong Bad stops typing and looks up at Homestar with a smirk.]\n\nHomestar Runner: [excitedly] I've got a great idea too, Strong Bad!\n\nStrong Bad: [skeptically] Oh yeah? Let's hear it.\n\nHomestar Runner: [enthusiastically] How about we make all the agents have their own personal dance moves that they can do in the middle of battle? That way, they can show off their sweet moves and distract their enemies.\n\nStrong Bad: [disgusted] What?! [stands up from his chair and turns to face Homestar] Personal dance moves? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! This is supposed to be a serious, hardcore shooter game, not some ridiculous dance party! [sits back down and starts typing on the keyboard] \"Let's not make it a dance party, let's make it a battle!\" [stops typing and looks up at Homestar with a scowl]\n\nHomestar Runner: [sadly] Oh, okay. Sorry Strong Bad. I thought it was a good idea.\n\nStrong Bad: [skeptically] Yeah, well maybe for a kiddie party game, not for \"Fuse\". [starts typing again and continues with his previous thoughts on how to improve the game.]\n\n[Scene closes with Strong Bad typing away at the keyboard and Homestar standing beside him, dejected.]"

He reads the email out loud as he types his response.]\n\nStrong Bad: \"An email from one of my many fans? Let's see what's up.\"\n\n[Reading the email]\n\"Hey Strong Bad, I heard you're a big gamer. What do you think about the video game 'Fuse'? Love it or hate it?\"\n\nStrong Bad: [typing] \"Love it? Hate it? I've got some ideas to make it better. First up, we ditch those boring, straight-laced agents and replace them with a team of four masked wrestlers. And instead of stopping some boring old corporation, we're taking down the evil Intergalactic Wrestling Federation! And Fuse? More like Fuse-tastic! Am I right?\"\n\n[Homestar Runner enters the room]\n\nHomestar Runner: \"Fuh-mail, Strong Bad! What's the de-mail?\"\n\nStrong Bad: \"Nothing, Homestar. Just improving upon the video game 'Fuse'. What do you got to add?\"\n\nHomestar Runner: \"Well, I was thinking maybe we could make it a musical! The agents could sing and dance their way through missions, using their Fuse-powered weapons as instruments!\"\n\nStrong Bad: [typing] \"Homestar, that's the worst idea I've ever heard. How about we stick with the masked wrestler concept and leave the singing and dancing to the professionals. Got it?\"\n\nHomestar Runner: \"Aw, Strong Bad. You always ruin my fun.\"\n\nStrong Bad: [typing] \"And that's a wrap. [presses the send button] Preeeeow!\"\n\n[The paper falls down from the top of the screen with the sound effect \"Preeeeow\".
