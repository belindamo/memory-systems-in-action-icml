To use more than 5 images in a prompt use image prompts with /imagine\n/blend does not work with text prompts. To use text and image prompts together, use image prompts and text with /imagine\n\n/blend Options\nAfter typing the /blend command, you will be prompted to upload two photos. Drag and drop images from your hard drive or add images from your photo library when using a mobile device. To add more images, select the optional/options field and select image3, image4, or image5. The /blend command may take longer to start than other commands because your images must be uploaded before the Midjourney Bot can process your request.\n\nBlended images have a default 1:1 aspect ratio, but you can use the optional dimensions field to select between a square aspect ratio (1:1), portrait aspect ration (2:3), or landscape aspect ratio (3:2).\n\nCustom suffixes are added to the end of /blend prompts, like any other /imagine prompt. Aspect ratios specified as part of the /blend command override aspect ratios within a custom suffix.\n\nImage showing the discord app interface for the Midjourney /blend command\nBlending Tip\nFor the best results, upload images that are the same aspect ratio as your desired result.\n\nHow to Use /blend\nanimated gif showing how to use the Midjourney blend command"
