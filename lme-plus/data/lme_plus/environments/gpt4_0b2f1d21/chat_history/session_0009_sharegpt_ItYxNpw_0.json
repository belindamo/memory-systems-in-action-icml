    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The name of the polymer created by mixing baking soda and superglue is not known as \"glutine\". Mixing baking soda and super glue will not create a polymer. Super glue, also known as cyanoacrylate, is a type of adhesive that forms a strong bond when it comes into contact with moisture. Baking soda, on the other hand, is a type of alkali that is often used as a rising agent in baking. Mixing the two substances together will not create a polymer, it will only create a paste that will not have any particular use."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Mixing baking soda and super glue will not create a hard and useful type of plastic. As mentioned earlier, super glue, also known as cyanoacrylate, is a type of adhesive that forms a strong bond when it comes into contact with moisture. Baking soda, on the other hand, is a type of alkali that is often used as a rising agent in baking. Mixing these two substances together will not create a hard and useful type of plastic. There is no chemical reaction between the two substances that would cause them to form a polymer or plastic. It is not a recommended method or a known way to create a plastic or any useful material."

      "content": "you are wrong many people use this to repair stuff or even to mold object"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I apologize for any confusion. Mixing baking soda and super glue is not a known method for creating a hard and useful type of plastic. However, it is possible that some people might use the mixture as an adhesive, sealant or filler for certain applications, but it's not a recommended method and it's not intended for that use. The mixture will not be as strong as the original super glue and it might not be as durable as other adhesives. Therefore, the result of mixing baking soda and super glue is not reliable and it will not be suitable for many applications."
