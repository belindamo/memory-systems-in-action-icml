Deciding what to keep and what to let go of can be challenging, but here are some tips to help you make those decisions:\n\n**The Hanger Trick:**\n\n1. **Hang clothes with the hangers facing the opposite direction**: When you wear an item, hang it back up with the hanger facing the normal direction. After a few months, consider donating or discarding items that are still facing the opposite direction.\n\n**The 80/20 Rule:**\n\n1. **80% of the time, you likely wear 20% of your clothes**: Identify your favorite, most-worn items and consider letting go of the rest.\n\n**Ask Yourself Questions:**\n\n1. **When was the last time I wore this item?**: If it's been over a year, it's likely safe to let it go.\n2. **Does it fit me well?**: If it's too small, too large, or unflattering, consider donating or discarding it.\n3. **Is it in good condition?**: If it's stained, torn, or worn out, it's probably time to let it go.\n4. **Is it relevant to my current lifestyle?**: If you've changed jobs, moved to a new climate, or shifted your personal style, some items might no longer be suitable.\n5. **Do I feel confident and comfortable in this item?**: If not, it's likely time to let it go.\n\n**Categorize and Purge:**\n\n1. **Sort items into three piles**: Keep, Donate/Sell, and Discard. Be honest with yourself about which category each item belongs in.\n2. **Consider the 1-touch rule**: When sorting, try to make a decision about each item as you touch it. This can help you avoid handling the same item multiple times and make the process more efficient.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Keep a 'maybe' box**: For items that are difficult to decide on, place them in a 'maybe' box and set a deadline, like six months, to revisit the item. If you haven't worn it by then, consider letting it go.\n2. **Store out-of-season clothes**: Consider storing out-of-season clothes in bins or containers to free up space in your closet and reduce clutter.\n3. **Keep a donation bin**: Designate a bin or bag for donations and place it in your closet or near your dresser. This will encourage you to regularly purge items that no longer serve you.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to declutter your closet, identify what's truly important to you, and make room for new pieces that bring you joy!",
