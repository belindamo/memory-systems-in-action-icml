  "content": "With this additional information, I can give you a more accurate assessment of how much condo you can afford.\n\n**Debt and credit:**\n\n* Student loans: $300/month\n* Credit score: 750 (excellent credit score, which can help you qualify for better interest rates)\n\n**Savings:**\n\n* Down payment: $20,000 (aiming for 5% to 10% of the purchase price)\n* Additional savings for closing costs and other expenses: let's assume you're willing to use up to $10,000 from your other savings\n\n**Mortgage terms:**\n\n* 30-year fixed-rate mortgage\n* Interest rate: assuming a good interest rate around 3.75% to 4% (based on your excellent credit score)\n\n**Target condo price range:**\n\n* $400,000 to $450,000\n\nNow, let's calculate your affordability:\n\n**Monthly gross income:** $5,417\n**Monthly debt payments:**\n\n* Student loans: $300\n* Future mortgage payment: unknown (we'll calculate this soon)\n* Other debt: none mentioned\n\n**Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio:**\nWe'll aim to keep your DTI ratio below 36%. Let's calculate your maximum monthly housing costs:\n\n* Maximum DTI ratio: 36% of $5,417 = $1,951\n* Student loan payment: $300\n* Maximum monthly housing costs: $1,951 - $300 = $1,651\n\n**Mortgage calculation:**\n\n* Mortgage amount: $380,000 to $427,500 (based on your target price range and 10% to 5% down payment)\n* Monthly mortgage payment: approximately $1,800 to $2,100 (depending on the interest rate and mortgage amount)\n\n**Other costs:**\n\n* Property taxes: assume 1.25% of the purchase price (this might vary depending on the location and tax rates in Oakland)\n* Insurance: assume $100 to $200 per month (depending on the location, condo type, and other factors)\n* HOA fees: assume $200 to $500 per month (depending on the condo complex and amenities)\n\nAdding these costs to your mortgage payment, your total monthly housing costs would be:\n\n* $1,800 (mortgage) + $500 (property taxes) + $150 (insurance) + $300 (HOA fees) = $2,750 (at the high end of the estimate)\n\nThis is slightly above your maximum monthly housing costs of $1,651. To stay within your budget, you might need to consider:\n\n* Reducing your target condo price range to $380,000 or lower\n* Increasing your down payment to reduce your mortgage payment\n* Looking for condos with lower HOA fees or fewer amenities\n* Considering a longer commute to find a more affordable area\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an estimate, and you should also factor in other expenses like maintenance, repairs, and potential assessments.\n\nHow do these calculations look to you? Are you comfortable with the estimated costs, or would you like to explore other options?",
