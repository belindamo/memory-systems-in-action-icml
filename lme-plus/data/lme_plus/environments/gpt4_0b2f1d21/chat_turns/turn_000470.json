This will help you develop a regular routine and make it easier to focus. 2. Use a timer: Set a timer for your meditation session, so you don't have to worry about checking the time. 3. Find a comfortable position: Find a comfortable position that you can maintain for the duration of the meditation session. 4. Focus on your breath: Focus on your breath and try to feel the sensations of the breath as it goes in and out. 5. Label your thoughts: If your mind starts to wander, label your thoughts as 'thinking' and return your focus to your breath. 6. Avoid judging yourself: Don't judge yourself if you find it hard to focus. Instead, acknowledge the challenge and try again the next time. 7. Practice mindfulness throughout the day: Incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine by paying attention to your breath or senses during everyday activities. Remember, meditation is a practice, and it takes time to develop focus and concentration. Don't be discouraged if you find it challenging at first.
