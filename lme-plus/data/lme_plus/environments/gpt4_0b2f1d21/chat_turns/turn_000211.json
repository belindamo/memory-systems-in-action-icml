I'm looking forward to viewing both properties and working with a local real estate agent to navigate the buying process.\n\nMy availability is pretty flexible, but I'd prefer to schedule the viewing for a weekday morning or early afternoon. Would that work for you?\n\nAlso, please go ahead and provide me with more information on the California real estate process and the necessary forms and disclosures. I'd like to be as prepared as possible for the viewing and the subsequent steps.\n\nThanks again for your help and guidance throughout this process!",
