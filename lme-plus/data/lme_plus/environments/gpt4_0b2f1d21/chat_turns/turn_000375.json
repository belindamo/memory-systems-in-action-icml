  "content": "[Scene opens with Strong Bad sitting in front of his computer, typing an email reply. He reads the email out loud as he types his response.]\n\nStrong Bad: \"An email from one of my many fans? Let's see what's up.\"\n\n[Reading the email]\n\"Hey Strong Bad, I heard you're a big gamer. What do you think about the video game 'Fuse'? Love it or hate it?\"\n\nStrong Bad: [typing] \"Love it? Hate it? I've got some ideas to make it better. First up, we ditch those boring, straight-laced agents and replace them with a team of four masked wrestlers. And instead of stopping some boring old corporation, we're taking down the evil Intergalactic Wrestling Federation! And Fuse? More like Fuse-tastic! Am I right?\"\n\n[Homestar Runner enters the room]\n\nHomestar Runner: \"Fuh-mail, Strong Bad! What's the de-mail?\"\n\nStrong Bad: \"Nothing, Homestar. Just improving upon the video game 'Fuse'. What do you got to add?\"\n\nHomestar Runner: \"Well, I was thinking maybe we could make it a musical! The agents could sing and dance their way through missions, using their Fuse-powered weapons as instruments!\"\n\nStrong Bad: [typing] \"Homestar, that's the worst idea I've ever heard. How about we stick with the masked wrestler concept and leave the singing and dancing to the professionals. Got it?\"\n\nHomestar Runner: \"Aw, Strong Bad. You always ruin my fun.\"\n\nStrong Bad: [typing] \"And that's a wrap. [presses the send button] Preeeeow!\"\n\n[The paper falls down from the top of the screen with the sound effect \"Preeeeow\". The scene ends.]",
