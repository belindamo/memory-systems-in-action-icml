  "content": "COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in Wuhan, China in 2019 and has since become a global pandemic. The virus spreads easily from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person speaks, coughs, or sneezes. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can lead to severe illness or death, particularly in older people or those with underlying health conditions. Measures such as wearing masks, washing hands frequently, and practicing physical distancing can help prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccines are also being developed and distributed globally to help control the pandemic.",
