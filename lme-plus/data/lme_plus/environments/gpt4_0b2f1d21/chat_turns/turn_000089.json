  "content": "Technically, it is possible to mix and match different types of frets on a bass guitar, such as jumbo frets on the lower frets and medium frets on the higher ones. However, it is generally not recommended because it can impact intonation and playability.\n\nWhen different types of frets are used, they may need to be leveled differently, and this can impact playability. Additionally, mixing and matching different types of frets can result in inconsistencies in the fretting system, which can result in poor intonation.\n\nIt's best to maintain a consistent fret size across the entire fretboard unless you're prepared to have a professional guitar technician adjust the entire fretting system in order to preserve good playability.\n\nIn summary, while it's possible to mix and match different types of frets on a bass guitar, it's generally not recommended, and it's best to stick to a consistent fret size.",
