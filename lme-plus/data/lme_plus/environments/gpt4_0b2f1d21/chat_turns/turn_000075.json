  "content": "The name of the polymer created by mixing baking soda and superglue is not known as \"glutine\". Mixing baking soda and super glue will not create a polymer. Super glue, also known as cyanoacrylate, is a type of adhesive that forms a strong bond when it comes into contact with moisture. Baking soda, on the other hand, is a type of alkali that is often used as a rising agent in baking. Mixing the two substances together will not create a polymer, it will only create a paste that will not have any particular use.",
