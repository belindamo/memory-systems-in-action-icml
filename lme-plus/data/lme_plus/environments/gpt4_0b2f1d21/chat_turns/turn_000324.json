  "content": "Crime Prevention Strategies in Waterloo, Canada\n\nCanada has largely focused on social responsibility methods of crime prevention as compared to the United States. One of the most observable methods of crime prevention is protection/avoidance strategies achieved through environmental design, also known as CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design). In this assignment, two types of protection/avoidance strategies in Waterloo, Canada, will be observed and recorded - one example of \"surveillance\" and one example of \"access control.\"\n\nExample 1: Surveillance (CPTED)\nLocation: 308 King St N, Waterloo, ON N2J 2Z2\nDate: March 23, 2023\nTime of Day: 1:30 PM\n\nThe location is a luxury apartment building situated adjacent to King Street, Regina Street, and Hickory Street. The direction adjacent to Regina Street is a place for various building materials and construction vehicles to enter and exit, making it a high-risk area for crime. This area is covered with cameras from different directions, mostly facing the entrance and exits and the surrounding streets. The three streets surrounding it are mostly residential areas, with individual villas, large apartment buildings, and some shops, mostly restaurants. There is heavy traffic, making the surrounding area very lively.\n\nThe surveillance strategy in this location is both natural and mechanical. The building has installed cameras that cover the entrances and exits, which are mechanical surveillance methods. Additionally, the surrounding area's natural surveillance strategy is achieved through the high traffic of people and vehicles, making it challenging for criminals to commit crimes without being noticed. The surveillance strategy in this location is preventing crime by providing evidence of any criminal activity, which can be used for investigation and prosecution.\n\nExample 2: Access Control (CPTED)\nLocation: Holbeach Crescent, Waterloo, ON\nDate: March 23, 2023\nTime of Day: 3:45 PM\n\nHolbeach Crescent is one of Waterloo's most famous villa areas, with many large villas, surrounded by walls that are over 2 meters high. Most of the walls have been renovated, replacing the wooden fences with metal ones. Many homeowners have installed cameras outside their villas to monitor the surrounding activities. Most of the villa's entrances use mechanical key locks, while some use electronic password locks, especially those that are rented out.\n\nAccess control is achieved through these measures, making it harder for criminals to enter and commit crimes. The villa's walls and high fences are natural barriers that limit access, while the mechanical and electronic locks are mechanical access control strategies. The access control strategy in this location is preventing crime by making it harder for criminals to enter and commit crimes.\n\nIn conclusion, protection/avoidance strategies achieved through environmental design are essential in preventing crime. The two examples provided, one of surveillance and one of access control, demonstrate how these strategies are being used in Waterloo, Canada. The natural and mechanical measures installed in these locations provide a safer environment for residents, workers, and visitors.",
