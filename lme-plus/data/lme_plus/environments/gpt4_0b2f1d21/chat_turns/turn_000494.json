They'll be able to inspect your brakes as part of the Deluxe Tune-Up package and diagnose any problems.\n\nBe prepared to provide more details about the issue, such as:\n\n* When did you first notice the problem?\n* How would you describe the feeling when you brake (e.g., soft, spongy, uneven, etc.)?\n* Have you noticed any other symptoms, like a hissing sound or a feeling of uneven braking?\n\nThis information will help the mechanics to better understand the issue and perform the necessary checks and repairs.\n\nAs part of the brake inspection, they may check the following:\n\n* Brake pad wear and condition\n* Brake cable tension and adjustment\n* Brake caliper alignment and pad alignment\n* Brake fluid level and condition (if your bike has hydraulic brakes)\n\nIf they find any issues, they'll be able to provide you with a quote for the necessary repairs and get your approval before proceeding.\n\nRemember to ask them to explain any repairs or adjustments they recommend, so you understand what's being done and why. A good bike shop will always take the time to educate you on the work they're doing and help you understand how to maintain your bike properly.\n\nBy addressing the brake issue now, you'll be able to get back to riding safely and confidently.\n\nHave a great day, and I hope your bike gets the TLC it needs!",
