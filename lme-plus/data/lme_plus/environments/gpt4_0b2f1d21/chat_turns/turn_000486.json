  "content": "I'd be happy to help you find a good bike shop near your apartment!\n\nTo do so, I'll need to know a bit more information from you. Could you please provide me with the following:\n\n1. Your city or zip code (or approximate location)?\n2. What type of service is your road bike in need of (e.g. routine maintenance, repairs, tune-up, etc.)?\n\nRegarding your helmet, don't worry about it for now. Focus on getting your bike serviced, and you can worry about getting your helmet back from Mike later.\n\nOnce I have the necessary information, I can provide you with a list of recommended bike shops in your area, along with their reviews and ratings to help you make an informed decision.",
