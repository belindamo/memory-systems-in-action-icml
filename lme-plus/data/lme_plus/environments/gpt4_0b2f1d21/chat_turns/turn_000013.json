  "content": "Mysterium is an excellent choice for a social deduction game that offers a unique and thrilling experience. Here's an overview of how the game is played and whether it's suitable for a group of 3 players:\n\n**Number of players:** 2-7 players\n\n**Objective:**\n\nIn Mysterium, one player takes on the role of the **Ghost**, while the other players play as **Psychic Mediums**. The Ghost's goal is to communicate with the Psychic Mediums to help them solve a murder mystery by providing them with visions (clues) to identify the correct suspect, location, and murder weapon.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\n1. **Setup:** The Ghost player receives a set of cards with abstract, surreal images (visions) and a solution card with the correct answer (suspect, location, and murder weapon).\n2. **Rounds:** The game consists of 7 rounds, each representing a night in a haunted mansion. During each round, the Ghost player draws a hand of 7 vision cards and attempts to communicate with the Psychic Mediums by playing one or more cards from their hand.\n3. **VISIONS:** The Ghost plays vision cards face down, and the Psychic Mediums try to interpret the meaning behind the cards. The visions can be abstract, and the Ghost can only communicate through these cards.\n4. **INTERPRETATION:** The Psychic Mediums discuss and vote on which suspect, location, and murder weapon they think the vision cards are pointing to.\n5. **RESULTS:** The Ghost reveals which Psychic Mediums correctly guessed the solution, and those players get to move their token closer to solving the mystery.\n6. **SOLVING THE MYSTERY:** If all Psychic Mediums correctly identify the solution in a round, they win the game. If not, the game continues until all 7 rounds are played, and the Psychic Mediums must make one final guess.\n\n**3-Player Suitability:**\n\nMysterium is typically recommended for 2-7 players, but it's definitely playable with 3 players. However, keep in mind that the game might be slightly less dynamic with fewer players. Here's how the game changes with 3 players:\n\n* The Ghost player will have more control over the game, as they'll be able to play more vision cards and have a bigger influence on the Psychic Mediums' interpretations.\n* The Psychic Mediums will have to work together more closely, as there will be fewer players to share the responsibility of solving the mystery.\n* The game might be slightly shorter, as there will be fewer players to make mistakes or misinterpret the visions.\n\n**Tips for 3-player games:**\n\n* The Ghost player should try to be more concise and strategic with their vision cards, as they'll have more influence on the game.\n* The Psychic Mediums should communicate clearly and work together to ensure they're on the same page when making their guesses.\n\nOverall, Mysterium is an excellent choice for a group of 3 players who enjoy social deduction and party games. It's a unique and engaging experience that will challenge your communication and deduction skills.",
