Offering incentives can be an excellent way to encourage viewers to participate and engage with your content.

Emphasize the value of the content and the discussion.\n2. **Choose relevant incentives**: Offer prizes or discounts that are relevant to your audience and align with your brand. This will help attract the right audience and increase engagement.\n3. **Set clear rules**: Establish clear rules and guidelines for the incentives, such as \"Ask a question and get a chance to win a free product\" or \"Participate in the Q&A session and receive a 10% discount code.\"\n4. **Don't overdo it**: Limit the number of incentives or the frequency of giveaways to avoid creating an expectation of constant rewards.\n5. **Focus on the experience**: Remember that the Q&A session is about providing value to your audience. Focus on creating an engaging and informative experience, and the incentives should complement that.\n\nIn your case, offering a free product or discount code can be a great way to incentivize viewers to participate in the Q&A session. Just make sure to set clear rules, keep the focus on the content, and don't overemphasize the prizes. Good luck with your stream!",
