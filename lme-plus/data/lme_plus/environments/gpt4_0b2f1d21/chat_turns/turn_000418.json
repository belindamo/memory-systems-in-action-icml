Here are some tips to help you deep-fry like a pro:\n\n**Tips for Deep-Frying Jalebi and Gulab Jamun:**\n\n1. **Choose the right oil:** Use a neutral-tasting oil with a high smoke point, such as peanut oil, canola oil, or avocado oil. These oils can handle high temperatures without breaking down or smoking.\n2. **Temperature control:** Heat the oil to the right temperature, which is usually between 350\u00b0F to 375\u00b0F (175\u00b0C to 190\u00b0C) for jalebi and 325\u00b0F to 350\u00b0F (165\u00b0C to 175\u00b0C) for gulab jamun. Use a thermometer to ensure the temperature is accurate.\n3. **Don't overcrowd:** Fry in batches to prevent the batter or dumplings from sticking together. This will also help you maintain the oil temperature.\n4. **Use the right amount of batter:** For jalebi, use a piping bag or a plastic bottle with a small nozzle to control the amount of batter. For gulab jamun, make sure the dumplings are evenly sized and not too large.\n5. **Fry until golden:** Fry the jalebi until they're golden brown and crispy, which should take around 2-3 minutes. Fry the gulab jamun until they're golden brown and puffed up, which should take around 3-4 minutes.\n6. **Drain excess oil:** Remove the fried sweets from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n7. **Don't over-fry:** Fry the sweets until they're cooked through, but not too long. Over-frying can make them greasy and bitter.\n\n**Tips to Prevent Greasiness:**\n\n1. **Use a thermometer:** Ensure the oil is at the right temperature to prevent the sweets from absorbing excess oil.\n2. **Don't overcrowd:** Frying in batches helps to prevent the sweets from sticking together and absorbing excess oil.\n3. **Drain excess oil:** Remove excess oil from the sweets immediately after frying to prevent them from becoming greasy.\n4. **Use a paper towel-lined plate:** Place the fried sweets on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil.\n\n**Tips to Achieve Crispiness:**\n\n1. **Use the right batter:** Ensure the batter is smooth, thick, and free of lumps. This will help the jalebi or gulab jamun cook evenly and become crispy.\n2. **Fry at the right temperature:** Fry at the right temperature to achieve crispiness. If the oil is too hot, the sweets will burn on the outside before cooking through.\n3. **Don't over-fry:** Fry the sweets until they're cooked through, but not too long. Over-frying can make them soft and greasy.\n4. **Drain excess moisture:** Remove excess moisture from the sweets before frying to help them become crispy.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve perfect, crispy jalebi and gulab jamun with minimal greasiness! Remember to practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries to get it right.",
