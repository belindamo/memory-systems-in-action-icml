  "content": "In \"Elements of Folk Psychology,\" Wilhelm Wundt explored the role of language in the formation of thought and argued that language and thought are deeply interconnected. He proposed that the meanings of words are not inherent in the words themselves, but are instead learned through socialization and cultural practices. According to Wundt, words acquire meaning through their use in social contexts, and the meanings of words can change over time as social practices change. In this way, Wundt's work on folk psychology provided a foundation for the study of word meanings as a social and cultural phenomenon.",
