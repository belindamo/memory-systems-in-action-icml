  "content": "I apologize for any confusion. Mixing baking soda and super glue is not a known method for creating a hard and useful type of plastic. However, it is possible that some people might use the mixture as an adhesive, sealant or filler for certain applications, but it's not a recommended method and it's not intended for that use. The mixture will not be as strong as the original super glue and it might not be as durable as other adhesives. Therefore, the result of mixing baking soda and super glue is not reliable and it will not be suitable for many applications.",
