They both had a sense that their arch-nemesis Mustafa was still out there, lurking in the shadows.\n\nSure enough, just as they were about to leave the ring, Mustafa appeared out of nowhere. He was armed and dangerous, and he had a look of pure hatred in his eyes.\n\nBefore Emaad and Shavez could react, Mustafa pulled out his gun and aimed it at Shavez. Emaad tried to intervene, but it was too late. Mustafa pulled the trigger, and Shavez fell to the ground, lifeless.\n\nEmaad was devastated by the loss of his brother, and he couldn't believe that Mustafa had taken things to such a violent and tragic level.
