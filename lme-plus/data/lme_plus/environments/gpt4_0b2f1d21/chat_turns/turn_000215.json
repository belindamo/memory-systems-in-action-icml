  "content": "**Mix of educational and entertaining content**: Absolutely! Having a mix of educational and entertaining content can help keep your audience engaged and interested in your live streams. Educational content can provide value to your viewers, establish your authority in your niche, and attract new viewers who are searching for information on a specific topic. Entertaining content, on the other hand, can help build a community, increase engagement, and make your live streams more enjoyable and shareable.\n\nA good ratio to aim for is:\n\n* 60-70% educational content (tutorials, tips, industry news, etc.)\n* 30-40% entertaining content (Q&A, challenges, behind-the-scenes, etc.)\n\nHowever, this ratio can vary depending on your audience, niche, and goals. Experiment with different types of content to see what resonates with your audience.\n\n**Congratulations on your increasing viewership!** It's great to hear that your hard work is paying off! Thursday seems to be a good day for you, so it might be worth considering making it a regular \"feature day\" or highlighting a specific type of content on Thursdays.\n\nTo build on this momentum, you might want to:\n\n1. **Analyze your analytics**: Take a closer look at your streaming platform's analytics to see what's working and what's not. Identify the types of content, titles, and tags that are performing well.\n2. **Ask your audience**: Engage with your viewers and ask them what they like about your content, what they'd like to see more of, and what keeps them coming back.\n3. **Create a \"Thursday theme\"**: Consider creating a recurring theme or series for Thursdays, like \"Throwback Thursday\" or \"Thursday Tips and Tricks.\" This can help create anticipation and make your content more discoverable.\n4. **Promote your Thursday streams**: Make sure to promote your Thursday streams more heavily on social media, email newsletters, and other channels to attract new viewers and remind existing ones about your regular schedule.\n\nKeep up the good work, and I'm excited to see your channel continue to grow!",
