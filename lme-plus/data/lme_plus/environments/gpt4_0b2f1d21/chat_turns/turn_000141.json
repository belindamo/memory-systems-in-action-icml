  "content": "Agenda 21 is a non-binding action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development. It is a product of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. It is an action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development. Its goal is to encourage countries to cooperate in developing and implementing policies for sustainable development. The plan is non-binding, which means that countries are not legally required to implement it. However, many countries have chosen to adopt some of the recommendations in the plan in their own national policies. Agenda 21 has been widely debated and has been the subject of criticism from various groups, including those who argue that it infringes on national sovereignty and those who believe that it is not effective in addressing the issues it aims to address.",
