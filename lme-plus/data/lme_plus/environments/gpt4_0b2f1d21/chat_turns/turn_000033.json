I exist solely to provide information and assist with tasks to the best of my abilities.\n\nHowever, I'm always happy to help you with your reading goals or challenges! If you'd like to discuss your progress or need recommendations, feel free to share your goals and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nNow, let's get back to Gone Girl - I'm excited to hear your thoughts on it once you've started listening!",
