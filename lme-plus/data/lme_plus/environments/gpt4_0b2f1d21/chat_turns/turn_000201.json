  "content": "I'd be happy to help you determine how much condo you can afford in Oakland.\n\nTo give you a more accurate estimate, I'll need to consider a few factors beyond your income. Please bear with me while I ask a few more questions:\n\n1. **Debt and credit**: Do you have any outstanding debts, such as student loans, car loans, credit card debt, or personal loans? If so, what are the monthly payments?\n2. **Savings**: How much have you saved for a down payment, and do you have any other savings or assets that you're willing to use for the purchase?\n3. **Credit score**: Do you have a good idea of your credit score? A higher credit score can help you qualify for better interest rates.\n4. **Desired mortgage terms**: Are you looking for a 30-year or 15-year mortgage? Do you have a preference for a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage?\n5. **Other expenses**: Do you have any other regular expenses, such as alimony, child support, or high utility bills, that might impact your ability to afford a mortgage payment?\n6. **Target condo price range**: Are you looking to spend a specific amount on a condo, or do you have a general idea of what you're comfortable paying per month?\n\nAssuming you don't have any significant debt and a decent credit score, here's a rough estimate of how much condo you might be able to afford based on your income:\n\n* **Gross income**: $65,000 per year\n* **Monthly gross income**: $5,417\n* **Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio**: Many lenders use a DTI ratio of 36% or less. Based on this, your monthly housing costs (mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance, and HOA fees) should not exceed $1,950.\n\nUsing a mortgage calculator, here's an estimate of how much condo you might be able to afford:\n\n* **Mortgage amount**: $350,000 to $400,000\n* **Down payment**: 20% ($70,000 to $80,000) to avoid PMI (private mortgage insurance)\n* **Monthly mortgage payment**: $1,700 to $2,000 (depending on interest rates and mortgage terms)\n\nKeep in mind that this is a rough estimate and doesn't take into account other expenses associated with homeownership, such as maintenance, repairs, and potential HOA fees.\n\nPlease feel free to provide more information about your financial situation, and I can give you a more accurate assessment of how much condo you can afford in Oakland.",
