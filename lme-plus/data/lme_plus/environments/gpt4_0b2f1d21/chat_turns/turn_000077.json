  "content": "Mixing baking soda and super glue will not create a hard and useful type of plastic. As mentioned earlier, super glue, also known as cyanoacrylate, is a type of adhesive that forms a strong bond when it comes into contact with moisture. Baking soda, on the other hand, is a type of alkali that is often used as a rising agent in baking. Mixing these two substances together will not create a hard and useful type of plastic. There is no chemical reaction between the two substances that would cause them to form a polymer or plastic. It is not a recommended method or a known way to create a plastic or any useful material.",
