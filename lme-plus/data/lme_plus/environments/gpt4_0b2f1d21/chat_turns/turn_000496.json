You can worry about getting your helmet back from Mike later.\n\nRemember to ask the mechanics at Springfield Cycleworks to provide you with a detailed report of their findings and any recommendations for repairs or maintenance. This will help you stay on top of your bike's condition and plan for any future work that might be needed.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns while you're at the shop, don't hesitate to ask. A good bike shop will always take the time to explain things to you and make sure you're comfortable with the work being done.\n\nGet your bike serviced, and then you can start planning your next ride!",
