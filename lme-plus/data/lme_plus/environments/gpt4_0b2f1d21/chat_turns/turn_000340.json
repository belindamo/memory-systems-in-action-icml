  "content": "When donating multiple items to the same organization, you can usually combine the values of all the items on a single receipt. However, it's essential to ensure that the receipt accurately reflects the donations.\n\n**Here's what you can do:**\n\n1. **Ask Goodwill for a combined receipt**: When you drop off the shoes, let the Goodwill staff know that you're also donating items from your garage and ask if they can provide a single receipt that includes all the items. They might have a process for combining donations, so it's best to ask.\n2. **Get a separate receipt for the shoes**: If Goodwill can't provide a combined receipt, you can ask for a separate receipt for the shoes. This will give you a dedicated receipt for the shoes, and you can keep it with your other donation receipts.\n3. **Itemize the donations on the receipt**: If you do get a combined receipt, make sure the receipt itemizes the donations, including the shoes. This will help you keep track of the individual values and descriptions of each item.\n\n**Valuing the shoes:**\n\nWhen estimating the value of the shoes, you can use online resources like Goodwill's donation value guide or other charity websites to determine their fair market value. You can also use the original purchase price or the price of similar shoes in good condition.\n\n**Adding the values:**\n\nOnce you have the receipt(s) and the estimated values of the shoes, you can add them to the total value of the items you're donating from your garage. Keep a record of the combined total, as you'll need this information when claiming the deduction on your taxes.\n\nRemember to keep all receipts, itemized lists, and supporting documentation with your tax records, as these will be essential for claiming your charitable deduction.",
