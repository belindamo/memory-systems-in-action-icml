  "content": "The playtime of Mysterium can vary depending on the group's familiarity with the game, the Ghost's ability to communicate effectively, and the Psychic Mediums' deductive skills. However, here are some general guidelines on what you can expect:\n\n**First playthrough:** 60-90 minutes\n\n* The first time you play Mysterium, it's common for the game to take longer as everyone gets accustomed to the unique mechanics and learns how to communicate effectively. The Ghost player will need time to understand how to convey their visions, and the Psychic Mediums will need to develop their interpretation skills.\n\n**Average playtime:** 45-60 minutes\n\n* Once your group has a few games under their belt, the playtime will likely decrease as everyone becomes more comfortable with the game. The Ghost player will become more efficient in conveying their visions, and the Psychic Mediums will improve their deduction skills.\n\n**Experienced players:** 30-45 minutes\n\n* With experienced players, the game can be resolved relatively quickly. The Ghost player will know exactly how to convey their visions, and the Psychic Mediums will be able to make accurate interpretations quickly.\n\n**Factors that can affect playtime:**\n\n* The Ghost's ability to communicate effectively: If the Ghost is struggling to convey their visions, the game can drag on.\n* The Psychic Mediums' deduction skills: If the Psychic Mediums are having trouble interpreting the visions, the game can take longer.\n* The number of rounds needed to solve the mystery: If the Psychic Mediums are consistently incorrect, the game may take longer as they try to solve the mystery.\n\nKeep in mind that Mysterium is a game that encourages discussion, debate, and creative thinking. While the playtime can vary, the game's unique mechanics and social interaction make it an engaging and entertaining experience.",
