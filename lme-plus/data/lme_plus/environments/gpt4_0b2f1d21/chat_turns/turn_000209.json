I'll connect you with a real estate agent who can schedule a viewing at your convenience.\n\n**Viewing Arrangements:**\n\nI'll introduce you to a local real estate agent who's familiar with the Oakland market and can show you both properties. They'll work with you to schedule a viewing at a time that suits you best.\n\n**Making an Offer on a Condo in California:**\n\nIn California, the process of making an offer on a condo typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Pre-approval:** Get pre-approved for a mortgage to understand your budget and negotiating power. Your lender will provide a pre-approval letter stating the loan amount and terms.\n2. **Viewing and selection:** View the properties, and once you've found the one you like, let your agent know you're interested in making an offer.\n3. **Offer preparation:** Your agent will help you prepare an offer, which typically includes:\n\t* Purchase price\n\t* Contingencies (e.g., financing, inspection, appraisal)\n\t* Closing date\n\t* Any other terms or requests (e.g., repairs, credits)\n4. **Submit the offer:** Your agent will present the offer to the seller or their agent.\n5. **Negotiation:** The seller may accept your offer, reject it, or make a counteroffer. Your agent will help you negotiate the terms until you reach an agreement.\n6. **Inspections and due diligence:** Once your offer is accepted, you'll hire inspectors to examine the property for any potential issues. You'll also review the condo's documents, including the CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions), budget, and any outstanding fees.\n7. **Loan processing:** Your lender will process your loan application, and you'll complete any remaining paperwork.\n8. **Closing:** Sign the final documents, transfer the ownership, and receive the keys to your new condo!\n\n**California Real Estate Forms:**\n\nIn California, there are specific forms and disclosures required for real estate transactions. Your agent will guide you through these documents, which may include:\n\n* California Residential Purchase Agreement (RPA-CA)\n* California Disclosure Statement (TDS)\n* Natural Hazard Disclosure Report (NHD)\n* Condo documents (CC&Rs, budget, meeting minutes, etc.)\n\nDon't worry if this seems overwhelming \u2013 your agent will be with you every step of the way to ensure a smooth transaction.\n\nNow, let's schedule those viewings!
