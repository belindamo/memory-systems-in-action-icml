  "content": "I'm not sure about specific traditions, but I think the gender ratio might have influenced the way we interact with each other. For instance, during our last family reunion, I noticed that the females in my family tend to dominate the conversations and decision-making processes. The males, on the other hand, seem to be more laid-back and less assertive in group settings. \n\nI'm not sure if this is a result of the gender ratio or just the personalities of my family members, but it's something I've observed. What do you think? Could the gender ratio be playing a role in this dynamic?",
