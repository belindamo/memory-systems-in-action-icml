  "content": "I think I'll start with a competitive price for each item and be open to negotiations. For the vintage record player, I'll start with a price around $200, since it's in good condition and still works well. For the antique vase, I'll start with a price around $800, considering its rarity and condition. And for the collection of old cameras, I'll price each one individually, starting with a price around $75-$150, depending on the condition and functionality. Do you think I should also consider offering a bundle discount for the cameras, in case someone wants to buy multiple ones?",
