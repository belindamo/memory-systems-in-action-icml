You are correct, the use of \"that said\" in the sentence \"I just saw a tweet that said the TV show was interesting\" has a different meaning than the usage I previously described. In this sentence, \"that said\" is used to refer to the content of the tweet. It is similar to saying \"according to the tweet\" or \"as stated in the tweet.\" Here's another example to clarify the usage:\n\n* I heard that the concert was amazing, but that said, I haven't seen any reviews yet.\n\nIn this sentence, \"that said\" is used to refer to the information the speaker heard, and it signals a cautionary or qualifying tone.",
