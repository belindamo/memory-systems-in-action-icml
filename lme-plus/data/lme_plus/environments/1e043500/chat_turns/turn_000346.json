  "content": "Yes, the odds of winning on the Win'it platform can be dynamic and can change based on various factors such as the face value of the win, cost of the win, and the number of bonus retries used.\n\nThe odds of winning with bonus retries are calculated dynamically based on the value of the bonus retries, which is determined by the cost of the win and the odds of winning. The value of bonus retries can change based on changes in the cost of the win, the desired odds of winning, or other factors that affect the probability of winning.\n\nAdditionally, the odds can change based on the number of bonus retries used by the player. The more bonus retries that are used, the higher the probability of winning, which means that the odds can change dynamically during gameplay.\n\nFinally, the odds can be adjusted based on other factors such as the gross profit margin or the historical transaction value of the merchant. These factors can affect the cost of the win and, therefore, the value of bonus retries and the odds of winning.\n\nOverall, the Win'it platform is designed to be flexible and dynamic, allowing merchants to adjust the odds of winning and offer different incentives to players based on various factors.",
