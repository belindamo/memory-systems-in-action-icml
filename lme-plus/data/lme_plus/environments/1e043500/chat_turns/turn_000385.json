  "content": "The observatory roof is an enclosed attic with a large telescope dominating the center of the room. The telescope is mostly intact, but there are some cracks in the glass and it looks as if it hasn't been used in years. The roof is made of copper and has caved in a bit in places due to years of neglect.\n\nAround the edges of the room are various pieces of abandoned astronomical equipment, including charts, books, and tools. The walls are covered in murals depicting the stars and planets, but they have been faded by time and weather.\n\nIn the center of the room is a raised platform where the hags have set up their summoning circle. The circle is etched into the floor and has a few candles and other ritual items around it. The hags themselves are standing on the platform, ready to do battle.\n\nAs the players enter the room, a bolt of lightning strikes the telescope, causing it to wobble precariously. The players can attempt to knock the telescope over onto the hags by using their strength, dexterity, or other appropriate skills. However, doing so may cause the telescope to fall on them instead, dealing damage and possibly trapping them underneath.\n\nAdditionally, the rain is pouring down heavily, creating slick surfaces and obstacles that can be used to gain an advantage or hamper movement. The thunderstorm has also caused several leaks in the roof, which are creating large puddles of water on the floor that can be used to electrocute enemies with lightning spells or conductive weapons.\n\nFinally, there are various pieces of broken equipment and loose debris scattered around the room that can be used as improvised weapons or obstacles. The hags may attempt to use these against the players as well, making the battlefield a constantly shifting and dangerous environment.\n\nWould you please expound on this dnd 5e battlefield description?",
