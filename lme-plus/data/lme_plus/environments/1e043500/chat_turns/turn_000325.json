  "content": "I'm happy to clarify!\n\nWhen you mark an episode as \"Skipped\" in TV Time, it **does not** assume you've watched the episode. Instead, it treats the episode as if it doesn't exist in your watchlist. Here's what happens:\n\n1. The skipped episode is removed from your \"Next Episode\" queue.\n2. TV Time won't prompt you to watch the skipped episode again.\n3. The app will **not** automatically move on to the next episode in the series. You'll need to manually mark the next episode as \"Watched\" or \"Next\" to continue tracking the show.\n\nBy skipping an episode, you're essentially telling TV Time that you don't want to track that particular episode. This can be useful if you:\n\n* Want to avoid spoilers for a specific episode.\n* Don't care about a particular storyline or character arc.\n* Missed an episode and don't plan to catch up.\n\nTo reiterate, skipping an episode doesn't mean you've watched it; it means you're choosing to ignore it in your tracking.\n\nIf you want TV Time to automatically move on to the next episode, you should mark the current episode as \"Watched\" instead of \"Skipped.\" This will update your progress and prompt the app to suggest the next episode in the series.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion! Let me know if you have more questions or need further assistance.",
