Choosing the right pieces can be a bit overwhelming, but with a few tips, you can find artwork that complements your existing decor.\n\nSince you mentioned you already have a painting that adds a pop of color, let's build on that. Here are some tips to help you choose artwork that fits with the rest of your decor:\n\n1. **Start with the color palette**: Take note of the dominant colors in your living room, including the walls, furniture, and accent pieces. Look for artwork that features similar hues or complements them. You can also use online color picker tools or apps to help you identify the colors in your painting and find matching shades.\n2. **Consider the style and theme**: Think about the overall style of your living room. Is it modern, traditional, coastal, or bohemian? Choose artwork that fits within that aesthetic. If you have a lot of abstract pieces, you might want to balance them with more realistic or figurative art.\n3. **Think about the frame**: The frame can greatly impact the overall look of the artwork. Choose frames that complement the style of your furniture and decor. For example, a modern piece might look great with a sleek, minimalist frame, while a vintage piece might benefit from a ornate, distressed frame.\n4. **Scale is important**: Make sure the artwork is proportional to the wall and the furniture. A large piece can overwhelm a small wall, while a tiny piece might get lost on a large wall.\n5. **Mix and match**: Don't be afraid to combine different styles, mediums, and sizes. A mix of frame styles, shapes, and sizes can add visual interest to your walls.\n6. **Personal connection**: Ultimately, choose artwork that speaks to you. If you love a piece, it will show, and it will make your living room feel more like your own.\n\nSome popular online resources for finding artwork include:\n\n1. **Society6**: A platform that features a wide range of artwork from various artists, with options for custom framing and sizing.\n2. **Minted**: A site that showcases independent artists and offers a variety of styles, from abstract to realistic.\n3. **Etsy**: A marketplace for independent artists and makers, where you can find unique, one-of-a-kind pieces.\n4. **Local art fairs and galleries**: Attend local art fairs and galleries to discover new artists and find pieces that resonate with you.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of finding artwork that makes you happy!",
