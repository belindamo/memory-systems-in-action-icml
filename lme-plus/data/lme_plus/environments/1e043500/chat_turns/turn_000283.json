  "content": "A scrum review, also known as a sprint review, is a key event in the Scrum methodology of Agile. The Scrum review is typically held at the end of each sprint cycle and provides a forum for the development team to present their work to the product owner, stakeholders and anyone else interested in the project. The purpose of the Scrum review is to demonstrate progress made during the sprint, such as completed features, and to obtain feedback that can be used to improve future sprints. During the review, the team will showcase completed work and have the opportunity to discuss what they learned, any challenges they faced and how they overcame them. The review is also a chance for stakeholders to provide feedback, ask questions and offer suggestions for improvement. By holding regular Scrum reviews, teams can ensure alignment, stay on track, and continuously improve their product.",
