  "content": "Banking credit before playing a game should not directly affect the odds of winning on the Win'it platform. This is because the odds of winning are based on the number of games played, the cost of the win, and the number of bonus retries used, and not on the amount of credit that is banked before playing a game.\n\nThe option to bank credit before playing a game is designed to give players more flexibility and control over their purchases, and to provide them with a discount on their purchase. This discount is based on the cost of the win and the gross profit margin of the merchant, and it does not affect the probability of winning.\n\nHowever, the option to bank credit can indirectly affect the odds of winning by reducing the number of games played on the platform. This is because players who bank their credit are not using it to play games, which means that fewer games are played and the probability of winning for other players may be slightly affected.\n\nOverall, the option to bank credit is designed to provide players with more flexibility and control over their purchases, and it should not directly affect the odds of winning on the Win'it platform.",
