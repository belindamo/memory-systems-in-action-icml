  "content": "Yes, since the fire, the French government has committed to restoring Notre Dame Cathedral to its former glory. Restoration work began in earnest in 2020, after a long period of planning and safety assessments. \n\nSo far, the focus has been on ensuring the safety and stability of the building, which involved removing debris and reinforcing the structure. This phase of the project was completed in late 2020. \n\nThe current phase of the restoration process is focused on repairing the stonework of the cathedral's outer walls and the intricate wooden structure that supports the roof. Skilled craftsmen are using traditional techniques to restore the stonework, while the wooden structure is being replaced with oak beams sourced from sustainable forests.\n\nAlthough the restoration work has been impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, there is still optimism that the first phase of the reconstruction will be completed in time for the 2024 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Paris.",
