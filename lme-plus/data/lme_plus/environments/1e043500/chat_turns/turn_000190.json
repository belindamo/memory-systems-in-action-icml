  "content": "That's great to hear! Congratulations on finding a new cobbler shop downtown that did a fantastic job cleaning your sneakers. $10 is an excellent price, especially considering the state of your shoes.\n\nI'm glad I could provide you with some suggestions, but it's even better that you've already found a reliable and affordable option. Word of mouth is the best advertising, so I'm sure the shop will appreciate your positive feedback.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what's the name of the shop? I'd be happy to keep it in mind for future recommendations. Additionally, what made you choose that particular shop, and what was your overall experience like?\n\nThanks for sharing your experience, and I'm happy to hear that your sneakers are looking fresh and clean again!",
