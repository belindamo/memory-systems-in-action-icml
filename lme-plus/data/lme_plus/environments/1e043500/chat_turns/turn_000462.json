I'm scheduled to see a specialist soon, so I'll ask them about my specific situation. In the meantime, I've been trying to change my diet to avoid fatty or greasy foods, which can exacerbate the symptoms. Do you have any suggestions on how to incorporate more fiber into my diet, as I've heard it can help with digestion and reduce symptoms?",
