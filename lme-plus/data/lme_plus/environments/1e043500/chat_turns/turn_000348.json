  "content": "Players on the Win'it platform have the option to \"bank\" their credit before playing a game. This means that they can choose to take the credit that was going to fund the chance to win, instead of using it to play the game. The credit would be for the cost of the win plus a margin discount.\n\nWhen a player banks their credit, they forfeit their chance to win the prize, but they receive a discount on their purchase. This discount is based on the cost of the win and the gross profit margin of the merchant, which determines the cost of the win.\n\nThe option to bank credit before playing a game is designed to give players more flexibility and control over their purchases. Players can choose to take the credit and use it to purchase other items on the platform or save it for later, instead of playing a game and risking the chance of losing.\n\nThe ability to bank credit before playing a game does not directly affect the odds of winning, but it does affect the number of games played on the platform and the amount of credit issued by the merchant. This is because players who bank their credit are not using it to play games, which means that fewer games are played and fewer credits are issued.",
