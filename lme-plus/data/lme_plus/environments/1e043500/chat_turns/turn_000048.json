  "content": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences, so I didn't update my alma mater with a new ID or divorce decree. I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries!\n\nHowever, I can provide general guidance on what you might need to update your alma mater. Typically, institutions require a certified copy of your name change decree or court order to update their records. This document serves as proof of your legal name change.\n\nIn your case, you may need to provide a certified copy of your divorce decree that shows your name change from John Wilson to Emily Rose Thompson. Be sure to check with your alma mater's specific requirements, as they might vary.\n\nRemember to also update your other important documents, such as your passport, driver's license, and social security card, to reflect your new name.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
