February 12th was a great day for you, it seems!\n\nI'm glad to hear that they're feeling comfortable so far. Adidas is known for their comfortable and supportive shoes, so I'm not surprised. How's the break-in period been? Have you had a chance to take them on any long runs or workouts yet?\n\nAlso, which specific model did you end up getting? I'm curious!",
