That's a fantastic piece of glass, and I'm sure it performed beautifully in Yosemite.\n\nRegarding your current Lowepro ProTactic 450 AW, it's a great backpack, but I understand the need for a reliable upgrade. The F-Stop Loka UL 40L is an excellent choice, known for its durability, comfort, and weather resistance.\n\nHere are some points to consider when evaluating the F-Stop Loka UL 40L:\n\n1. **Capacity**: The 40L capacity should be sufficient for carrying your gear, but consider the size and shape of your lenses and accessories. If you have larger lenses or multiple bodies, you might want to check the internal dimensions.\n2. **Weight distribution**: F-Stop backpacks are known for their comfortable and ergonomic design, which helps distribute the weight evenly. This is especially important for long hikes or extended shoots.\n3. **Weather resistance**: The Loka UL 40L features a water-resistant and durable nylon construction, which should keep your gear dry in wet conditions. However, it's still essential to use rain covers or additional protection in extreme weather.\n4. **Modularity**: F-Stop's ICU (Internal Camera Unit) system allows you to customize the interior to fit your specific gear. This is a great feature if you have unique or oversized equipment.\n5. **Access and organization**: The Loka UL 40L has multiple compartments and pockets to keep your gear organized and easily accessible. This can help you stay efficient during shoots and reduce the risk of damaging your equipment.\n6. **Comfort and fit**: As you'll be carrying the backpack for extended periods, ensure the straps and hip belt fit comfortably, and the pack doesn't feel too bulky or restrictive.\n\nBefore making a final decision, you might want to consider the following:\n\n* Check the weight and size of the Loka UL 40L compared to your current backpack. If you're used to carrying a larger pack, you might appreciate the smaller footprint and lighter weight of the F-Stop.\n* Read reviews and watch videos to get a better understanding of the backpack's features and any potential drawbacks.\n* If you have specific gear or accessories that require additional protection or storage, make sure the Loka UL 40L can accommodate them.\n\nOverall, the F-Stop Loka UL 40L is a great choice for a reliable and comfortable camera backpack. If you're willing to invest in a high-quality pack, it should serve you well for many adventures to come!",
