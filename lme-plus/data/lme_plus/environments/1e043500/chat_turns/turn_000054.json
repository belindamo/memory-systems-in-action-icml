  "content": "\"That said\" is often used to introduce a statement that contrasts or qualifies what was said previously. When used in the middle of a sentence, \"that said\" can indicate a shift in the speaker's perspective, tone, or emphasis. Here are some examples:\n\n* I love going to the park, but that said, I don't like when it's crowded.\n* I know we agreed to meet at 5 PM, but that said, I think we should push it back an hour.\n* The new movie was terrible, that said, the special effects were really impressive.\n\nIn each of these examples, \"that said\" signals a change in the speaker's thoughts or feelings about the topic being discussed. It can be seen as a way to soften the impact of a criticism or to qualify a statement.",
