  "content": "Herby Chicken Shawarma is a fantastic choice! For sides, you'll want something that complements the bright, herby flavors of the chicken. Here are some suggestions that would pair perfectly:\n\n1. **Tomato and Onion Salad**: A simple salad of diced tomatoes, onions, parsley, and a squeeze of lemon juice will provide a refreshing contrast to the richness of the shawarma.\n2. **Cucumber-Tahini Sauce**: A creamy tahini sauce with diced cucumber, garlic, and lemon juice will help cool down the palate. Serve it on the side or use it as a topping for the shawarma.\n3. **Pickled Turnips**: Thinly slice some turnips and soak them in a brine made with vinegar, sugar, and salt. The tangy, crunchy turnips will cut through the richness of the chicken.\n4. **Roasted Sumac Carrots**: Toss carrot sticks with olive oil, sumac, salt, and pepper, and roast them in the oven until caramelized. The sweet, earthy carrots will complement the herby flavors of the chicken.\n5. **Greek-Style Fries**: Thinly slice some potatoes and fry them until crispy. Season with salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of oregano. The crispy, salty fries will provide a satisfying contrast to the juicy chicken.\n6. **Tabbouleh**: A classic Middle Eastern salad made with bulgur, parsley, tomatoes, mint, and lemon juice will provide a fresh, herby flavor profile that pairs perfectly with the shawarma.\n7. **Grilled Pita Bread**: Grill some pita bread and serve it on the side to mop up the juices from the shawarma. You can also use it to make a wrap with the chicken, veggies, and tahini sauce.\n\nChoose one or two of these options to serve alongside your Herby Chicken Shawarma, and you'll have a well-rounded, delicious meal that showcases the flavors of the Middle East!",
