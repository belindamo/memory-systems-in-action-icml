  "content": "I've been using coconut oil as a hair mask, but I'm interested in trying it as a leave-in conditioner or hair serum. Since I've already switched to a sulfate-free, organic shampoo about six weeks ago, I'm wondering if using coconut oil as a leave-in conditioner will complement my current hair care routine.
