  "content": "Thank you for providing more information! With 25-30 people, rectangular tables, and a large room, we can create a comfortable and accessible seating arrangement. Considering the age range, I'll suggest a layout that prioritizes ease of movement and accessibility for your elderly family members.\n\nHere's a possible seating arrangement:\n\n**Main Table:**\n\n* Use 2-3 rectangular tables (8-10 feet long) and place them in a U-shape or a gentle curve. This will create a central gathering area and encourage conversation.\n* Seat the elderly family members at the ends of the tables, closest to the walls or corners, to provide easier access and minimize navigation around the tables.\n* Place the most mobility-impaired individuals at the ends of the tables, with their backs to the walls, to provide additional support and stability.\n\n**Additional Tables:**\n\n* Set up 2-3 smaller rectangular tables (4-6 feet long) around the perimeter of the room, leaving enough space between them for comfortable movement. These tables can accommodate smaller family groups, such as young children or couples.\n* Consider placing these smaller tables near the walls or in corners to create cozy nooks and reduce congestion in the main area.\n\n**Accessibility Considerations:**\n\n* Leave about 3-4 feet of clearance between the tables and the walls to allow for easy movement and wheelchair accessibility (if needed).\n* Make sure the pathways between tables are wide enough for people to pass comfortably, ideally 4-5 feet wide.\n* Consider reserving a few chairs near the entrance or in a quiet area for anyone who might need to take a break or have a conversation away from the main gathering.\n\n**Children's Area:**\n\n* If you have a lot of young children, you might want to set up a separate area with smaller tables and chairs, toys, and activities to keep them occupied. This can be a designated kids' zone or a play area.\n\n**Flexibility:**\n\n* Be prepared to make adjustments on the day of the gathering. You might need to reconfigure the tables or chairs based on the actual attendance or specific needs of your family members.\n* Consider having a few extra chairs or tables on hand in case you need to make last-minute adjustments.\n\nThis layout should provide a comfortable and accessible seating arrangement for your family gathering. Remember to keep the tables and chairs at a comfortable height, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need additional assistance.",
