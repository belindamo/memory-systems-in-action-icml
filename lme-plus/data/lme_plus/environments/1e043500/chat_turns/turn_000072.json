Here are some suggestions for searching for studies that have examined these relationships:\n\n**Keywords:**\n\n1. Mediators: self-esteem, social support, self-concept, social connections, social capital\n2. Relationships: mediating, moderating, intervening, indirect effects\n3. Social media usage: social media use, social networking, online social behavior\n4. Mental health outcomes: depression, anxiety, mental wellbeing, psychological distress\n\n**Search strategies:**\n\n1. (\"social media\" AND \"self-esteem\" AND \"depression\") OR (\"social media\" AND \"social support\" AND \"anxiety\")\n2. (\"online social behavior\" AND \"mediating role\" AND \"mental health outcomes\") OR (\"social networking\" AND \"moderating effect\" AND \"self-esteem\")\n3. (\"social media usage\" AND \"indirect effect\" AND \"anxiety\" AND \"social support\") OR (\"social media\" AND \"intervening variable\" AND \"depression\" AND \"self-esteem\")\n4. (\"social media\" AND \"self-concept\" AND \"mental wellbeing\") OR (\"online social connections\" AND \"social capital\" AND \"psychological distress\")\n\n**Databases:**\n\n1. PsycINFO (American Psychological Association) - a premier database for psychology and mental health research\n2. Scopus (Elsevier) - a large, interdisciplinary database covering science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, as well as social sciences and humanities\n3. Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) - a multidisciplinary database covering science, social sciences, and humanities\n4. Google Scholar (Google) - a search engine for scholarly literature across many disciplines and sources\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. Use specific keywords related to mediation analysis, such as \"mediating role\", \"moderating effect\", \"indirect effect\", or \"intervening variable\", to find studies that have explicitly examined these relationships.\n2. Combine keywords related to social media usage, self-esteem, social support, and mental health outcomes to find studies that have investigated these relationships.\n3. Use quotes to search for exact phrases, like \"mediating role of self-esteem\", to find studies that have specifically examined this relationship.\n4. Filter your search results by date to focus on recent studies (e.g., 2015-2022) that may have used more advanced statistical methods or larger datasets.\n5. Look for reviews, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews that have synthesized the findings on these relationships, as they can provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature.\n\nSome influential studies and reviews to get you started:\n\n1.
