  "content": "Yes, of course. \"That said\" is a set phrase commonly used to introduce a contrasting or qualifying statement, while \"said that\" simply indicates that someone made a statement. \"That said\" is used to emphasize the contrast or qualification, whereas \"said that\" is more straightforward and neutral in tone.\n\nIn the sentence \"I just saw a tweet that said the TV show was interesting,\" \"that said\" is used to emphasize the source of the information being referred to, which is the tweet. It signals to the reader or listener that the information comes from an external source and not the speaker's own observation. Using \"said that\" in this sentence would not convey the same emphasis on the source of the information.",
