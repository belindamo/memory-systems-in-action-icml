Look for eco-labels: Organizations like the Marine Stewardship Council and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council certify seafood products that meet sustainable fishing and aquaculture standards. Look for these labels when shopping for seafood.\n\n2. Consult seafood guides: Several organizations publish seafood guides that provide information on which seafood species are sustainably harvested and which to avoid. Examples include Seafood Watch and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\n3. Choose fish that is in season: Choosing fish that is in season can help to reduce pressure on fish populations and support sustainable fishing practices.\n\n4. Be wary of certain fishing practices: Some fishing methods, like trawling and dredging, can be harmful to marine ecosystems and fish populations. Look for seafood that is caught using more sustainable methods like pole-and-line fishing.\n\n5. Support local fisheries: Choose seafood that is sourced locally to reduce the environmental impact of transportation and support small-scale, sustainable fishing practices.\n\nBy making these simple changes in your seafood choices, you can help to support sustainable fishing practices and protect marine environments, including kelp populations.",
