  "content": "For Herby Chicken Shawarma, you want to achieve a tender, juicy, and slightly charred chicken that's infused with the flavors of the herbs. Both grilling and pan-frying can work well, but I'd recommend grilling for that authentic shawarma flavor and texture. Here's why:\n\n**Grilling:**\n\n1. **Char and Crispiness**: Grilling over medium-high heat will give you a nice char on the outside, which adds texture and flavor to the chicken. The high heat will also help to crisp up the skin, making it more appealing.\n2. **Smoky Flavor**: Grilling imparts a smoky flavor to the chicken, which complements the herby flavors beautifully. This smokiness is a characteristic of traditional shawarma.\n3. **Even Cooking**: Grilling allows for even cooking, ensuring that the chicken is cooked through and juicy.\n\nTo grill the chicken, preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C). Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Grill the chicken for 5-7 minutes per side, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n\n**Pan-Frying:**\n\n1. **Easy and Quick**: Pan-frying is a great option if you don't have a grill or prefer a quicker cooking method.\n2. **Crispy Crust**: Pan-frying can help create a crispy crust on the chicken, especially if you use a hot skillet.\n\nHowever, pan-frying might not provide the same level of char and smokiness as grilling. To pan-fry the chicken, heat a skillet over medium-high heat with a small amount of oil. Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Cook the chicken for 5-7 minutes per side, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to pat the chicken dry with paper towels before cooking to remove excess moisture. This helps the chicken cook more evenly and prevents steaming instead of browning.\n* Don't overcrowd the grill or skillet, as this can lower the temperature and prevent even cooking. Cook in batches if necessary.\n* Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken even juicier.\n\nIn summary, grilling is the preferred method for Herby Chicken Shawarma, as it provides a smoky flavor, char, and crispiness. However, pan-frying is a great alternative if you don't have a grill or prefer a quicker cooking method.",
