Two key figures in this movement were George Lakoff and Ronald Langacker. Lakoff's \"Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things\" (1987) proposed that categories in language are organized around prototypes, while Langacker's \"Foundations of Cognitive Grammar\" (1987) argued that meaning arises from the interaction of linguistic forms and cognitive structures.",
