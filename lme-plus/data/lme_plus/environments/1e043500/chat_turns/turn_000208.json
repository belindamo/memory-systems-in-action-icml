Grouping similar items together and varying the heights and textures are great ways to create a visually appealing arrangement. And don't forget to leave some space to create a sense of breathing room \u2013 it makes a big difference in the overall feel of the space.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and experiment with different arrangements until you find one that feels like you. Don't be afraid to try out new things and make mistakes \u2013 it's all part of the process!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy arranging your coffee table and shelves, and I'm sure they'll look amazing when you're done!",
