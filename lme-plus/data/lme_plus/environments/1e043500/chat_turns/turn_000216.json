Here are some tips to help you determine the best approach:\n\n**Option 1: Start with a higher price and be open to negotiations**\n\n* **Pros**:\n\t+ Gives you room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.\n\t+ May attract serious buyers who are willing to pay a premium for the item.\n* **Cons**:\n\t+ May deter some buyers who are put off by the high initial price.\n\t+ You may need to be prepared to haggle, which can be time-consuming.\n\n**Option 2: Price lower to attract more buyers**\n\n* **Pros**:\n\t+ Attracts more buyers and increases the chances of a sale.\n\t+ Can create a sense of urgency, encouraging buyers to make a decision quickly.\n* **Cons**:\n\t+ You may leave money on the table if you price too low.\n\t+ May attract low-ball offers or buyers who are looking for a steal.\n\n**Hybrid approach:**\n\n* **Start with a competitive price**: Research similar items and price your item competitively, taking into account its condition, rarity, and demand.\n* **Be open to negotiations**: Be prepared to consider reasonable offers and negotiate with interested buyers.\n* **Leave some wiggle room**: Price your item slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price, so you have room to negotiate.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* **Consider the platform**: eBay and Etsy have different pricing dynamics. eBay is more auction-oriented, while Etsy is more fixed-price focused.\n* **Watch for similar listings**: Monitor similar listings and adjust your price accordingly.\n* **Be prepared to adjust**: If your item isn't getting any bites, consider adjusting the price or relisting with new photos and descriptions.\n\nFor your items, you could consider the following prices:\n\n* **Vintage record player (1960s)**: Start with a competitive price around $150-$250, depending on condition and functionality.\n* **Antique vase (1930s)**: Price competitively around $500-$1,000, considering its condition, rarity, and demand.\n* **Collection of old cameras (1970s and 1980s)**: Price each camera individually, starting with a competitive price around $50-$200, depending on condition, functionality, and demand.\n\nRemember to stay flexible and be open to negotiations. Good luck with your sales!",
