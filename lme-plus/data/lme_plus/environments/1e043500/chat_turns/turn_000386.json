  "content": "As the party enters the room, they notice that the copper roof, with its aged patina, casts an eerie greenish hue over the entire space, adding an unsettling atmosphere to the battle that is about to unfold. The flickering candlelight from the hags' summoning circle casts long, twisted shadows that dance around the room, making it difficult to discern the true positions of objects and enemies.\n\nIn one corner of the observatory, a dusty, cobweb-covered orrery, its gears long seized up, stands as a testament to the room's former glory. The players may use this complex piece of machinery to their advantage, potentially dislodging gears or other components to create makeshift traps or distractions for the hags.\n\nThe summoning circle itself appears to be pulsating with dark energy, giving off an aura of malevolence that seeps into the room. This aura may have an effect on the players, causing them to feel uneasy or even experience momentary lapses in concentration, affecting their spellcasting or combat abilities.\n\nThe murals on the walls, although faded, seem to tell a story of ancient celestial events and cosmic prophecies. If the players manage to decipher these murals during the battle, they may gain insights that could aid them against the hags or uncover secrets about the world of Hiigarraa itself.\n\nAs the thunderstorm rages outside, occasional gusts of wind force their way into the observatory through the damaged roof and broken windows. These gusts can scatter loose papers, charts, and debris, obscuring vision and making movement more challenging. Players and hags alike may also have to contend with the noise of the storm, which could make it difficult to communicate or hear approaching enemies.\n\nThroughout the battle, the precarious state of the observatory can create unexpected hazards, as well. Shelves and bookcases laden with ancient tomes may suddenly topple, sending a cascade of books and debris onto the combatants below. Sections of the copper roof could detach and fall, creating temporary barriers or causing damage to those unfortunate enough to be caught beneath them.\n\nOverall, the observatory is a dynamic and treacherous battlefield that will require the players to adapt and strategize in real-time to overcome the hags and their sinister machinations.",
