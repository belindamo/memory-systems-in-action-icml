  "content": "Here is an example of how the merchant reporting for Win'it could be structured:\n\nMerchant Reporting Resource:\n```javascript\n{\n  \"fields\": {\n    \"name\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"required\": true},\n    \"start_date\": {\"type\": \"datetime\", \"required\": true},\n    \"end_date\": {\"type\": \"datetime\", \"required\": true},\n    \"sales_generated\": {\"type\": \"decimal\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"cost_of_goods_sold\": {\"type\": \"decimal\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"num_winners\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"num_games_won\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"num_games_played\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"avg_credit_value_won\": {\"type\": \"decimal\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"credit_banked\": {\"type\": \"decimal\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"credit_won\": {\"type\": \"decimal\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"total_credit_issued\": {\"type\": \"decimal\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"credits_redeemed\": {\"type\": \"decimal\", \"default\": 0}\n  }\n}\n```\nThis resource would track various metrics for each merchant campaign, such as the sales generated, cost of goods sold, number of winners, number of games won, number of games played, average credit value won, credit banked, credit won, total credit issued, and credits redeemed.\n\nMerchant Reporting Endpoints:\n\n1. Endpoint to create a new merchant reporting:\n```javascript\nPOST /merchant_reportings\n{\n  \"name\": \"Spring Sale\",\n  \"start_date\": \"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"end_date\": \"2023-03-31T23:59:59Z\"\n}\n```\n2. Endpoint to update a merchant reporting:\n```javascript\nPUT /merchant_reportings/:id\n{\n  \"name\": \"Spring Sale\",\n  \"start_date\": \"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"end_date\": \"2023-03-31T23:59:59Z\",\n  \"sales_generated\": 5000,\n  \"cost_of_goods_sold\": 2500,\n  \"num_winners\": 50,\n  \"num_games_won\": 100,\n  \"num_games_played\": 500,\n  \"avg_credit_value_won\": 10,\n  \"credit_banked\": 500,\n  \"credit_won\": 1000,\n  \"total_credit_issued\": 1500,\n  \"credits_redeemed\": 500\n}\n```\n3. Endpoint to get a list of merchant reportings:\n```javascript\nGET /merchant_reportings\n```\n4. Endpoint to get details of a specific merchant reporting:\n```javascript\nGET /merchant_reportings/:id\n```\nThese endpoints would allow merchants to create, update, and view their campaign reporting data, as well as track key metrics for their campaigns such as sales generated, number of winners, and credits issued. The data in the merchant reporting resource can be updated dynamically based on the activity on the platform, and can provide valuable insights into the success of each merchant campaign.",
