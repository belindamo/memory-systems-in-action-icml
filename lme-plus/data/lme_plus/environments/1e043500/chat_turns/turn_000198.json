However, I should let you know that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to see your living room or know about your specific purchases. But I'd be happy to provide you with some general tips on how to declutter and keep your living room tidy!\n\nHere are some suggestions to get you started:\n\n1. **Start with a clean slate**: Take everything out of your living room and sort items into categories (e.g., books, decorative items, remotes, etc.). This will give you a sense of what you have and help you decide what to keep, donate, or throw away.\n2. **Purge the unnecessary**: Be ruthless \u2013 if you haven't used something in the past year, it's probably safe to get rid of it. Consider donating gently used items or recycling materials that can't be donated.\n3. **Designate zones**: Divide your living room into zones, such as a reading area, a TV-watching area, and a conversation area. This will help you determine what items belong in each zone and keep them organized.\n4. **Use storage containers**: Invest in decorative storage bins, baskets, or shelves to keep items like throw blankets, books, and remotes organized and out of sight.\n5. **Keep surfaces clear**: Make it a habit to keep surfaces like your coffee table, side tables, and shelves clear of clutter. This will create a sense of calm and make it easier to clean.\n6. **Create a \"launching pad\"**: Designate a spot near the entrance of your living room as a \"launching pad\" where you can place keys, wallets, and other items that need to be dealt with later.\n7. **Establish routines**: Set aside time each day or week to tidy up and maintain your space. This could be as simple as putting away toys or books after use or wiping down surfaces.\n8. **Consider vertical space**: Make the most of your walls by using wall-mounted shelves, hooks, or storage units to keep items off the floor and out of the way.\n9. **Keep it up**: Decluttering and organizing is an ongoing process. Schedule regular decluttering sessions to maintain your space and keep it feeling tidy and organized.\n\nRemember, decluttering and organizing is a process, and it may take some time to get your living room exactly how you want it. But with these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a cozy and inviting space that you'll love spending time in!",
