  "content": "Yes, the overall formula is dynamic and can be adjusted based on various inputs, such as the face value of the win, gross profit margin, desired odds of winning, number of games played, and number of bonus retries earned by the player.\n\nThe odds of winning with bonus retries can be adjusted based on the value of the bonus retries, which is calculated using the cost of the win and the odds of winning. The odds with bonus retries are then used to calculate the number of games won by the player, which is based on the number of games played and the number of bonus retries used.\n\nHere is an overview of the data points used to adjust the odds:\n\n* Face value of the win: This is the value of the prize that the player can win when playing the game.\n* Gross profit margin: This is the profit margin that the merchant makes on each sale, and it is used to calculate the cost of the win.\n* Desired odds of winning: This is the desired probability of winning that the merchant wants to offer to players.\n* Number of games played: This is the number of games that have been played on the platform.\n* Number of bonus retries earned: This is the number of bonus retries that the player has earned through referrals or other means.\n* Cost of the win: This is the cost to the merchant to fund the prize based on the face value of the win and the gross profit margin.\n* Value of bonus retries: This is the value of each bonus retry, which is calculated based on the cost of the win and the odds of winning.\n* Odds with bonus retries: This is the probability of winning when using bonus retries, which is based on the face value of the win and the value of the bonus retries.\n* Number of games won: This is the number of games that the player wins based on the odds with bonus retries and the number of bonus retries used.\n\nBy adjusting these data points, the Win'it platform can dynamically change the odds of winning and offer players different incentives to make purchases or refer friends to the platform.",
