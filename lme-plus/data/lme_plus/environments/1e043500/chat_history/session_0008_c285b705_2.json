      "content": "Congratulations on the positive feedback from your advisor! That's a great motivator to keep you moving forward.\n\nI'd be happy to help you with finding relevant literature for your literature review. To get started, could you please share some details about your thesis topic? What's the general area of study, and what specific questions or themes are you exploring? The more information you provide, the more targeted my suggestions can be.\n\nThat being said, here are some general tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Brainstorm keywords**: Identify the main concepts, variables, and themes related to your research question. Write down as many keywords as you can think of, and then narrow them down to the most relevant ones.\n2. **Use academic databases**: Some popular databases for searching academic literature include:\n\t* Google Scholar (scholar.google.com)\n\t* Web of Science (wokinfo.com)\n\t* Scopus (scopus.com)\n\t* PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)\n\t* PsycINFO (www.apa.org/pubs/databases/psycinfo/index)\n\t* JSTOR (www.jstor.org)\n\t* ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com)\n3. **Use specific search operators**: Combine your keywords using Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and wildcards (*) to refine your search results. For example: (\"climate change\" AND mitigation) OR (\"renewable energy\" AND policy)\n4. **Explore citation tracking**: Use tools like Google Scholar's \"Cited by\" feature or Scopus's \"Citation Tracker\" to find more recent articles that have cited the papers you're already familiar with.\n5. **Check reference lists**: Look at the reference lists of relevant articles and book chapters to discover other sources that might be relevant to your research.\n\nOnce you provide more information about your thesis topic, I can offer more specific suggestions for keywords, databases, and search strategies."
