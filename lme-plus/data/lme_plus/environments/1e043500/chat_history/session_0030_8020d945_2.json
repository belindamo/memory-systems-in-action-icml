      "content": "In TV Time, \"Skipped\" and \"Paused\" serve distinct purposes, helping you manage your episode tracking effectively.\n\n**Skipped:**\n\nMark an episode as \"Skipped\" when:\n\n1. You've decided not to watch a particular episode.\n2. You're not interested in a specific episode or story arc.\n3. You've missed an episode and don't plan to catch up.\n\nWhen you mark an episode as \"Skipped,\" TV Time will:\n\n* Remove the episode from your \"Next Episode\" queue.\n* Not prompt you to watch it again.\n* Allow you to move on to the next episode in the series.\n\n**Paused:**\n\nMark an episode as \"Paused\" when:\n\n1. You've started watching an episode but haven't finished it.\n2. You need to take a break from a show for a while.\n3. You're waiting for a friend or family member to catch up before continuing.\n\nWhen you mark an episode as \"Paused,\" TV Time will:\n\n* Keep the episode in your \"Next Episode\" queue.\n* Display a \"Paused\" indicator, reminding you where you left off.\n* Allow you to easily resume watching from where you paused.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* \"Skipped\" means you're intentionally bypassing an episode.\n* \"Paused\" means you're temporarily halting your progress, intending to return to the episode later.\n\nBy using these features correctly, you'll be able to manage your episode tracking efficiently and maintain a clean, organized watchlist.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using TV Time or tracking your shows?"

      "content": "I'm still a bit unclear about the Skip feature. If I skip an episode, does TV Time assume I've watched it and move on to the next one?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'm happy to clarify!\n\nWhen you mark an episode as \"Skipped\" in TV Time, it **does not** assume you've watched the episode. Instead, it treats the episode as if it doesn't exist in your watchlist. Here's what happens:\n\n1. The skipped episode is removed from your \"Next Episode\" queue.\n2. TV Time won't prompt you to watch the skipped episode again.\n3. The app will **not** automatically move on to the next episode in the series. You'll need to manually mark the next episode as \"Watched\" or \"Next\" to continue tracking the show.\n\nBy skipping an episode, you're essentially telling TV Time that you don't want to track that particular episode. This can be useful if you:\n\n* Want to avoid spoilers for a specific episode.\n* Don't care about a particular storyline or character arc.\n* Missed an episode and don't plan to catch up.\n\nTo reiterate, skipping an episode doesn't mean you've watched it; it means you're choosing to ignore it in your tracking.\n\nIf you want TV Time to automatically move on to the next episode, you should mark the current episode as \"Watched\" instead of \"Skipped.\" This will update your progress and prompt the app to suggest the next episode in the series.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion! Let me know if you have more questions or need further assistance."
