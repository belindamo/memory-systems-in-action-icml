      "content": "Yes, you are correct. The bonus retries resource should include a reference to the game or games that the bonus retries were used in. This allows you to track which games were played using bonus retries and which were played using regular credits.\n\nHere is an updated snippet for the bonus retries resource that includes a reference to the game:\n```javascript\n{\n  \"fields\": {\n    \"player_id\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"required\": true},\n    \"num_retries\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"earned_by_referral\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"earned_by_purchase\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"default\": 0},\n    \"used_in_game\": {\"type\": \"boolean\", \"default\": false},\n    \"used_date\": {\"type\": \"datetime\"},\n    \"game_id\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"reference\": \"games.id\"}\n  }\n}\n```\nThis new field, `game_id`, is a reference to the game resource and allows you to associate the bonus retries with a specific game. When a player uses bonus retries to play a game, you can update the `used_in_game` field to `true` and set the `game_id` to the ID of the game that was played using the bonus retries. This way, you can keep track of which games were played using bonus retries and which were played using regular credits."

      "content": "Yes, the overall formula is dynamic and can be adjusted based on various inputs, such as the face value of the win, gross profit margin, desired odds of winning, number of games played, and number of bonus retries earned by the player.\n\nThe odds of winning with bonus retries can be adjusted based on the value of the bonus retries, which is calculated using the cost of the win and the odds of winning. The odds with bonus retries are then used to calculate the number of games won by the player, which is based on the number of games played and the number of bonus retries used.\n\nHere is an overview of the data points used to adjust the odds:\n\n* Face value of the win: This is the value of the prize that the player can win when playing the game.\n* Gross profit margin: This is the profit margin that the merchant makes on each sale, and it is used to calculate the cost of the win.\n* Desired odds of winning: This is the desired probability of winning that the merchant wants to offer to players.\n* Number of games played: This is the number of games that have been played on the platform.\n* Number of bonus retries earned: This is the number of bonus retries that the player has earned through referrals or other means.\n* Cost of the win: This is the cost to the merchant to fund the prize based on the face value of the win and the gross profit margin.\n* Value of bonus retries: This is the value of each bonus retry, which is calculated based on the cost of the win and the odds of winning.\n* Odds with bonus retries: This is the probability of winning when using bonus retries, which is based on the face value of the win and the value of the bonus retries.\n* Number of games won: This is the number of games that the player wins based on the odds with bonus retries and the number of bonus retries used.\n\nBy adjusting these data points, the Win'it platform can dynamically change the odds of winning and offer players different incentives to make purchases or refer friends to the platform."

      "content": "Yes, the odds of winning on the Win'it platform can be dynamic and can change based on various factors such as the face value of the win, cost of the win, and the number of bonus retries used.\n\nThe odds of winning with bonus retries are calculated dynamically based on the value of the bonus retries, which is determined by the cost of the win and the odds of winning. The value of bonus retries can change based on changes in the cost of the win, the desired odds of winning, or other factors that affect the probability of winning.\n\nAdditionally, the odds can change based on the number of bonus retries used by the player. The more bonus retries that are used, the higher the probability of winning, which means that the odds can change dynamically during gameplay.\n\nFinally, the odds can be adjusted based on other factors such as the gross profit margin or the historical transaction value of the merchant. These factors can affect the cost of the win and, therefore, the value of bonus retries and the odds of winning.\n\nOverall, the Win'it platform is designed to be flexible and dynamic, allowing merchants to adjust the odds of winning and offer different incentives to players based on various factors."

      "content": "Players on the Win'it platform have the option to \"bank\" their credit before playing a game. This means that they can choose to take the credit that was going to fund the chance to win, instead of using it to play the game. The credit would be for the cost of the win plus a margin discount.\n\nWhen a player banks their credit, they forfeit their chance to win the prize, but they receive a discount on their purchase. This discount is based on the cost of the win and the gross profit margin of the merchant, which determines the cost of the win.\n\nThe option to bank credit before playing a game is designed to give players more flexibility and control over their purchases. Players can choose to take the credit and use it to purchase other items on the platform or save it for later, instead of playing a game and risking the chance of losing.\n\nThe ability to bank credit before playing a game does not directly affect the odds of winning, but it does affect the number of games played on the platform and the amount of credit issued by the merchant. This is because players who bank their credit are not using it to play games, which means that fewer games are played and fewer credits are issued."

This is because players who bank their credit are not using it to play games, which means that fewer games are played and the probability of winning for other players may be slightly affected.\n\nOverall, the option to bank credit is designed to provide players with more flexibility and control over their purchases, and it should not directly affect the odds of winning on the Win'it platform."

Endpoint to create a new merchant reporting:\n```javascript\nPOST /merchant_reportings\n{\n  \"name\": \"Spring Sale\",\n  \"start_date\": \"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"end_date\": \"2023-03-31T23:59:59Z\"\n}\n```\n2. Endpoint to update a merchant reporting:\n```javascript\nPUT /merchant_reportings/:id\n{\n  \"name\": \"Spring Sale\",\n  \"start_date\": \"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"end_date\": \"2023-03-31T23:59:59Z\",\n  \"sales_generated\": 5000,\n  \"cost_of_goods_sold\": 2500,\n  \"num_winners\": 50,\n  \"num_games_won\": 100,\n  \"num_games_played\": 500,\n  \"avg_credit_value_won\": 10,\n  \"credit_banked\": 500,\n  \"credit_won\": 1000,\n  \"total_credit_issued\": 1500,\n  \"credits_redeemed\": 500\n}\n```\n3. Endpoint to get a list of merchant reportings:\n```javascript\nGET /merchant_reportings\n```\n4. Endpoint to get details of a specific merchant reporting:\n```javascript\nGET /merchant_reportings/:id\n```\nThese endpoints would allow merchants to create, update, and view their campaign reporting data, as well as track key metrics for their campaigns such as sales generated, number of winners, and credits issued. The data in the merchant reporting resource can be updated dynamically based on the activity on the platform, and can provide valuable insights into the success of each merchant campaign."
