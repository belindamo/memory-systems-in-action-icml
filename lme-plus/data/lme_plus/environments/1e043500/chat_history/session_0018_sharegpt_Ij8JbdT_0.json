I will provide some details about the app and it will be your job to write up a detialed statement on the app, including its features, goals, purpose, user persona, value propistion, target audience and furthermore come up with creative ways to improve its user experience. Determine why your app needs to exist and what problem it solves in the real world. Determine your competition, relevant to your platform. Do similar apps already meet the needs of your anticipated users? My first request is \"I want to create a Black Community Impact app that gamifies Black individuals' contribution to their community and ultimatley measures their performance. The app will operate similar to an advance fitness app that educates, provides workouts, provides diet plans, provides health tips, collects personal health info, provides feedback, provides inspirational content, allows journaling, and rewards good performance. The goal of my Black Community Impact app is to inspire and motivate Black individuals to get involved in thier community with taking positive action that contributes to the social advancement of the collective Black community. The app functions as a way to quantify everyday tasks and work that spport the Black community. In no way is this app to shame anyone for their contributions or lack thereof. The app is strictly to be positive, uplift, and promote a culture that advances the Black community. The app will collect self-reported activity from each user such as: study hours, community service hours, money spent with a Black business, money donated to a Black institution (HBCUs, Black churches, Black nonprofits, etc.), money invested in local Black businesses, trips to the doctors, daily steps walked, hours spent with family, local events attended, etc. Other app features include: user levels based on activity (i.e. Starting from Citizen, Neighbor, Advocate, Builder, Representative), savings account tracker, educational content on how to support the community, local black directory, reciept capturing, inspirational prompts, micro lending, networking events, community gatherings, step counter, interactive media, reward points for meeting community impact activity goals, dashboard, show nearby local users' path level, and digital wallet. The \"Representative\" user level is a paid level. For users who purchase a $99 monthly subscription will be a \"Representative\". Perks to being a Representative includes invitations to exclusive events, courses, monthly publication, produce food box, emergency micro loans, etc.\""
