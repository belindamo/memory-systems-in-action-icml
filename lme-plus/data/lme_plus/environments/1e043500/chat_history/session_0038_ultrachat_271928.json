Typically, matsuri (festivals) are held to honor a deity, express gratitude for a bountiful harvest, or pray for good luck or fortune.\n\nDuring the festival, there is a procession of omikoshi (portable shrines) carried through the streets by participants, along with traditional dance performances, music, and games. The festival also sometimes features a type of battle called Shinken Shiraha-Tori (\"Taking the White Blade\"), where participants try to seize the sacred white paper streamers that are attached to a pole.\n\nThis festival has been held for over 800 years and is an important cultural event in the local community, as it brings together families, friends, and neighbors to celebrate their shared traditions and customs."
