Spring (March-May) - This is a popular time to visit Paris because the weather is mild, and flowers bloom throughout the city. The city in Spring offers a festive atmosphere with events like the Paris Marathon and the French Open tennis tournament. 2. Summer (June-August) - This is peak tourist season in Paris. And deservedly so - the weather is warm and sunny, many outdoor festivals and events happen during this time, and there are extended daylight hours, so you can make the most out of your sightseeing. 3. Autumn (September-November) - Autumn brings cooler temperatures and colorful foliage to the city. It is a quieter season, and the museums have fewer crowds, but still some fun events like art exhibitions and wine tastings. 4. Winter (December-February) - Paris is magical during the winter holidays. You can enjoy a cozy atmosphere, lots of Christmas lights and decorations, ice skating rinks, and Christmas markets throughout the city in winter. Overall, Paris is a beautiful city all year round, but avoid August for crowds and business closures. Spring and autumn offer the best balance of comfortable weather and lower tourist crowds."
