Wind Tunnel Testing: Wind tunnel testing has been used for decades to study the aerodynamic performance of vehicles. In a wind tunnel, a series of sensors are used to measure different components of the car's aerodynamics. Aston Martin uses wind tunnel testing to measure aerodynamic coefficients such as drag, lift, and downforce to develop the most optimal car design. Data gathered from wind tunnel testing can inform changes to the car's deflector, airfoil, and/or spoiler.\n\n4. Data Visualization Tools: To analyze vast amounts of data such as sensor signals, engineers use data visualization tools, including histograms and scatter plots, to identify patterns and trends in the data they collected. By utilizing data visualization tools, engineers can optimize the design and performance of Aston Martin's cars."
