      "content": "Arbroath's fishing industry has been the backbone of the town's economy for centuries, providing not only a source of income for local families but also influencing the town's culinary heritage. The most famous fish product associated with Arbroath is Arbroath Smokies, a smoked haddock delicacy that has been produced in the town for over 200 years.\n\nTraditionally, fishermen would smoke leftover fish as a means of preserving it for later consumption. Arbroath Smokies are created by smoking haddock over hardwood logs in a special smokehouse using a time-honored method that has remained unchanged for generations. The smokehouse is an essential part of the town's cultural heritage and attracts visitors from all over Scotland and beyond.\n\nBeyond Arbroath Smokies, fish and seafood remain a vital part of Arbroath's culinary culture. Local restaurants and fishmongers offer a range of fresh fish, including haddock, cod, sole, and plaice, among others.\n\nIn summary, Arbroath's fishing industry has played a crucial role in shaping the town's culinary heritage. From the famous Arbroath Smokies to fresh fish and seafood, the bounty of the sea has influenced local cuisine for centuries."
