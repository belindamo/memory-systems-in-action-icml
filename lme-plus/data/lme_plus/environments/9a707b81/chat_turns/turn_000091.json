  "content": "You're welcome! Grilling the chicken breast for 10-11 minutes total should result in a nicely cooked and juicy breast. Remember to check the internal temperature to ensure it reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) for food safety.\n\nAnd don't forget to let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. This is a crucial step that allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken even more tender and flavorful.\n\nYou've got a solid plan in place, and I'm confident you'll end up with a delicious dinner. Enjoy your grilled chicken breast with roasted vegetables, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further assistance.\n\nNow, go ahead and get started on preparing your dinner. You've got this! And don't forget to wind down with your episode of \"The Office\" afterwards.",
