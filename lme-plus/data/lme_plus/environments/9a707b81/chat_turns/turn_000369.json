  "content": "Hate crimes are defined as criminal acts motivated by bias or prejudice against a particular individual or group based on their race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. \n\nProsecution of hate crimes can vary depending on the laws of the state or country in which the crime took place. In the United States, hate crimes are typically prosecuted at the state or federal level, depending on the severity and circumstances of the crime. \n\nTo prove a hate crime, prosecutors must provide evidence that the crime was motivated by bias or prejudice against the victim's race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. This can include evidence of hate speech, targeting of specific individuals or groups, or use of symbols associated with hate groups. \n\nPenalties for hate crimes can include fines, probation, imprisonment, and in some cases, the death penalty. The severity of the penalty depends on the severity of the crime, the motivation behind it, and the criminal history of the perpetrator.",
