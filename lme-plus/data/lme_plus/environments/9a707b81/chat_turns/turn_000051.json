  "content": "SQL Joins:\n\nSQL Joins are used to combine two or more tables in a database based on a common column between them. There are four types of SQL Joins: Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, and Full Join.\n\n1. Inner Join: An Inner Join returns only the matching rows from both tables.\n\nExample: Suppose we have two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders\". Both tables have a common column called \"CustomerID\". To get the details of the customers who have placed orders, we can use an Inner Join like this:\n```sql\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nINNER JOIN Orders\nON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n```\n1. Left Join: A Left Join returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there are no matching rows in the right table, then NULL values are returned.\n\nExample: Suppose we have two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders\". To get the details of all customers and their orders, we can use a Left Join like this:\n```sql\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nLEFT JOIN Orders\nON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n```\n1. Right Join: A Right Join returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there are no matching rows in the left table, then NULL values are returned.\n\nExample: Suppose we have two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders\". To get the details of all orders and their corresponding customers, we can use a Right Join like this:\n```sql\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nRIGHT JOIN Orders\nON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n```\n1. Full Join: A Full Join returns all the rows from both tables, with NULL values in the columns where there are no matches.\n\nExample: Suppose we have two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders\". To get the details of all customers and all orders, we can use a Full Join like this:\n```sql\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nFULL JOIN Orders\nON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n```\nSQL Views:\n\nSQL Views are virtual tables that do not store data themselves but represent the data stored in other tables. They are created by using a SELECT statement and can be used to simplify complex queries, hide sensitive data, and provide a simpler interface for end-users.\n\nExample: Suppose we have a table \"Employees\" with columns \"EmployeeID\", \"FirstName\", \"LastName\", \"Salary\", and \"DepartmentID\". To create a view that displays the names and salaries of employees in each department, we can use this code:\n```sql\nCREATE VIEW EmployeeSalaries AS\nSELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Employees.Salary, Departments.DepartmentName\nFROM Employees\nINNER JOIN Departments\nON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;\n```\nOnce the view is created, we can use it like a regular table to retrieve data:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM EmployeeSalaries;\n```\nSQL Common Table Expressions (CTEs):\n\nSQL Common Table Expressions are temporary result sets that are defined within a single execution of a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. They can be used to simplify complex queries, improve performance, and make code more readable.\n\nExample: Suppose we have a table \"Orders\" with columns \"OrderID\", \"CustomerID\", \"OrderDate\", and \"OrderTotal\". To create a CTE that returns the total sales for each customer, we can use this code:\n```vbnet\nWITH CustomerSales AS (\nSELECT CustomerID, SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSales\nFROM Orders\nGROUP BY CustomerID\n)\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, CustomerSales.TotalSales\nFROM Customers\n```",
