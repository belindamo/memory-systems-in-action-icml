I'm here to provide information and assist with tasks, but I don't have personal experiences or schedules.\n\nHowever, I can help you reflect on your own meeting with the potential client! How did your meeting go? Was it productive, and are there any follow-up tasks or next steps you need to take care of?\n\nRemember to take a few minutes to review the meeting and update your Todoist tasks accordingly. You can add new tasks, update existing ones, or mark them as completed. This will help you stay organized and ensure that you don't miss any important follow-ups.\n\nIf you need any help with task management or have questions about Todoist, feel free to ask!",
