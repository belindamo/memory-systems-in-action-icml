It's great that you're diligent about cleaning your bathroom, but unfortunately, a clean toilet doesn't necessarily mean it's functioning properly.\n\nA constantly running toilet can be frustrating and wasteful. Let's go through some possible causes and potential solutions to help you identify the problem:\n\n1. **Faulty Flapper**: The flapper is the rubber valve that covers the hole at the bottom of the tank. If it's not sealing properly, water will continue to flow into the bowl. Check the flapper for any signs of wear, misalignment, or mineral buildup. You can try cleaning or replacing it if necessary.\n2. **Improper Chain Adjustment**: The chain connecting the flapper to the flush handle can get caught under the flapper, preventing it from closing fully. Adjust the chain length to ensure it's not interfering with the flapper's closure.\n3. **Clogged Overflow Tube**: Debris or mineral buildup in the overflow tube can cause the toilet to continuously run. Check the tube for blockages and clean it out if necessary.\n4. **Float Issues**: The float is the plastic or metal arm that rises and falls with the water level in the tank. If it's stuck or not moving smoothly, the toilet may run constantly. Check the float for any blockages or corrosion and adjust or replace it if needed.\n5. **Faulty Fill Valve**: The fill valve is responsible for refilling the tank with water. If it's malfunctioning, the toilet may run continuously. You can try adjusting or replacing the fill valve if you suspect it's the culprit.\n6. **Water Level Issues**: If the water level in the tank is set too high, water will continuously flow into the overflow tube and then into the bowl. Adjust the water level by turning the adjustment screw or by bending the float arm.\n\nTo help you better diagnose the issue, can you tell me:\n\n* How long has the toilet been running constantly?\n* Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as a slow fill or strange noises?\n* Have you recently made any changes to your toilet or bathroom?\n\nLet's work together to identify the problem and get your toilet running efficiently again!",
