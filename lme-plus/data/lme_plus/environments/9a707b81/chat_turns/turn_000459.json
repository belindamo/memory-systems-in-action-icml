  "content": "I'm excited to try making croissants again, and I think I'll also make some banana bread for the dinner party. I recently made a batch with walnuts, and it turned out amazing. By the way, I just baked a chocolate cake for my friend's birthday party today that turned out amazing. It was a new recipe I found online that used espresso powder to intensify the chocolate flavor. Anyways, do you have any tips for making a moist and flavorful banana bread?",
