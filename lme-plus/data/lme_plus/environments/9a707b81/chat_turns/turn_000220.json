  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot advise you to do either way or the other, but, I understand that stretching can be uncomfortable, especially when starting out. However, skipping stretching exercises can limit your flexibility and overall range of motion, which are important parts of martial arts practice.\n\nInstead of skipping the stretches that feel uncomfortable, try slowing down and focusing on your breathing while gently leaning into the stretch until you feel a manageable level of discomfort. It's important not to push yourself too hard and risk injuring yourself, but at the same time, consistency will allow your muscles to gradually become more flexible over time.\n\nAlternatively, speak to your martial arts instructor about different stretching techniques or modifications to make the exercises less uncomfortable for you while still working towards your flexibility goals. There may be ways to modify the stretches to make them more manageable for you. Remember, it's important to listen to your body's limits and work gradually towards your goals in a safe and sustainable way.",
