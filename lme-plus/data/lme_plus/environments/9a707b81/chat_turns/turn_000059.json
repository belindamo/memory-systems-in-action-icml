I'm happy to share some more tips to help you optimize your meal prep and planning:\n\n1. **Plan your meals around staples:** Focus on ingredients that can be used in multiple dishes, like rice, quinoa, beans, and canned goods. This will help reduce food waste and save you money.\n2. **Shop your pantry first:** Before going grocery shopping, take stock of what you already have at home. This will prevent duplicate purchases and help you create meals around what you already have.\n3. **Cook in bulk:** Just like you did with your quinoa salad and roasted vegetables, cooking in bulk can save time and money. Consider making large batches of grains, proteins, or soups that can be used throughout the week.\n4. **Portion control:** Divide your cooked meals into individual portions and store them in containers. This will make it easy to grab-and-go and avoid overeating.\n5. **Label and date containers:** Use labels and dates to keep track of what you've prepared and how long it's been in the fridge. This will help you avoid foodborne illnesses and ensure you use the oldest items first.\n6. **Freeze it:** If you're not planning to eat something within a few days, consider freezing it for later. This works well for soups, casseroles, and individual portions of cooked meals.\n7. **Rotate your stock:** Make sure to use the \"first in, first out\" rule when it comes to your meal prep containers. This will prevent older items from getting lost in the back of the fridge.\n8. **Keep it simple:** Don't feel like you need to make complicated meals. Simple ingredients like chicken, rice, and veggies can be just as delicious and satisfying as more complex dishes.\n9. **Get creative with leftovers:** Think beyond just reheating leftovers. Use them to create new meals, like turning last night's dinner into tomorrow's lunch or using leftover veggies in a soup or stir-fry.\n10. **Make it a habit:** Try to set aside a specific day and time each week for meal prep. This will make it a habit and help you stay consistent.\n\nRemember, meal prep is all about finding a system that works for you and your lifestyle. Experiment with different recipes, ingredients, and containers until you find what works best for you.\n\nBy the way, $30 for containers and ingredients from Target is a great investment! You'll likely make that back in savings from not buying lunch out and reducing food waste.",
