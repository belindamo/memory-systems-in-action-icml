Exploring different types of flour can indeed lead to exciting results, and it's great that you're experimenting with various options.\n\nNow, about using oat flour or bread flour for your sourdough shortcake:\n\n**Oat Flour:**\n\nOat flour can add a delightful nutty flavor and a slightly denser texture to your shortcake. However, keep in mind that oat flour is a coarser, whole-grain flour that can affect the overall structure and rise of your shortcake. Oat flour also has a lower gluten content than all-purpose flour, which might impact the shortcake's texture and crumb.\n\nIf you decide to use oat flour, you may need to:\n\n* Increase the liquid content in the recipe to compensate for the coarser texture.\n* Adjust the proofing time, as oat flour can take longer to ferment.\n* Be prepared for a denser, more rustic shortcake with a nutty flavor.\n\n**Bread Flour:**\n\nBread flour, on the other hand, is a high-protein flour that can add strength and structure to your shortcake. It's a great choice if you want a more tender, chewy crumb. However, bread flour can also make the shortcake more dense and heavier than all-purpose flour.\n\nIf you decide to use bread flour, you may need to:\n\n* Reduce the liquid content in the recipe, as bread flour can absorb more liquid.\n* Monitor the proofing time, as bread flour can ferment more quickly.\n* Be prepared for a more dense, chewy shortcake with a slightly heavier texture.\n\n**Tips for using alternative flours:**\n\n1. Start with a small batch to test the recipe and adjust as needed.\n2. Be prepared to adjust the liquid content, proofing time, and temperature based on the flour's properties.\n3. Consider blending the alternative flour with all-purpose flour to create a hybrid flour that balances the characteristics of both.\n4. Keep an eye on the shortcake's texture and adjust the recipe accordingly. You may need to add more liquid, adjust the mixing time, or try a different proofing schedule.\n\nRemember, experimenting with different flours is all about trial and error. Don't be discouraged if the first batch doesn't turn out as expected. Take notes, adjust, and try again!\n\nWhich flour do you think you'll try first? Oat flour or bread flour?",
