  "content": "While you technically can avoid doing splits altogether, it's important to remember that flexibility is an important aspect of martial arts and avoiding it can hinder your progress. Splits can help improve your overall range of motion, improve balance and coordination, and also help prevent injuries.\n\nIt's also important to remember that discomfort is normal when stretching muscles which have been relatively inactive. However, if you are feeling pain that is beyond discomfort, stop the stretch and seek advice from a trainer or medical professional. Gradually increasing your flexibility through regular stretches over time can make discomfort more manageable.\n\nRemember, practice makes progress, not perfection. Keep a positive mindset and focus on your improvement over time.",
