  "content": "I'd be happy to help you organize your thoughts about your movie consumption habits. It's great that you just got back from a solo trip to the cinema and enjoyed \"Birds of Prey\" - Margot Robbie is definitely a talented actress!\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about what you're trying to recall about your movie consumption habits? For example, are you trying to remember:\n\n* How many movies you've watched in a certain time period?\n* What types of movies you tend to watch (genre, era, etc.)?\n* How often you go to the cinema versus watching movies at home?\n* What platforms or devices you use to watch movies?\n* Your favorite movies or franchises?\n* Something else entirely?\n\nFeel free to share as much or as little as you'd like, and I can help you brainstorm and organize your thoughts!",
