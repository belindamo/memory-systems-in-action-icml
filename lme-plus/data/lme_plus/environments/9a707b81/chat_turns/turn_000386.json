These tools allow you to create folders, albums, and collections, as well as assign keywords and tags.\n* Consider using a consistent naming convention for your files, such as \"Event Name_Artist Name_Artwork Title_Date.jpg\"\n\nRemember to back up your photos regularly to prevent data loss, and consider sharing your organized photos with the artists or event organizers, if applicable.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you get started on organizing your art event photos!",
