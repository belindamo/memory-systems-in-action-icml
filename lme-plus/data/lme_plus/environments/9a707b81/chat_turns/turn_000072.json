  "content": "I think I want to focus on the past 3 months, since I've been watching a lot of movies during that time. For method of watching, it's been a mix - some in the cinema like \"Birds of Prey\" on my solo trip, some on streaming services like Netflix, and some on my laptop during downtime when I'm traveling. As for genre, I've been watching a bit of everything, but I'd say I've been leaning towards action movies and dramas lately. I've also been re-watching some old favorites, like the \"Harry Potter\" series.",
