  "content": "Yes, there are several national monuments and sites that have been controversial for similar reasons. One example is the Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming, which is considered to be a sacred site by several Native American tribes, including the Sioux and the Arapaho. The creation of the monument, which is a popular rock climbing destination and attracts thousands of visitors each year, has been contentious for the tribes because of their longstanding spiritual and cultural connections to the land.\n\nAnother example is the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which was created by President Barack Obama in 2016 to protect important cultural and archaeological sites for several Native American tribes including the Navajo and Hopi. The monument has since become the subject of controversy after President Trump reduced its size by 85 percent in 2017, drawing criticism from environmentalists and Native American groups who argue that such action is a violation of treaty rights and undermines conservation efforts.\n\nThere are also many other examples of national monuments and sites that have been a source of controversy, including the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, among others.",
