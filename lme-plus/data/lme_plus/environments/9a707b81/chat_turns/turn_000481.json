However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't know about Max or his stuffed rabbit toy. But I'm here to provide you with general advice and suggestions!\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a new cat tower, there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Space and size**: Measure the area where you plan to place the tower to ensure it fits comfortably. Consider the height, width, and depth of the tower.\n2. **Material and durability**: Look for sturdy, high-quality materials that can withstand scratching and climbing. Carpeted surfaces or sisal rope can provide good scratching surfaces.\n3. **Multiple levels and perches**: Cats love to climb and observe from high places. A tower with multiple levels, perches, and hideaways can keep your cat engaged and active.\n4. **Stability and stability**: Ensure the tower is stable and won't topple over, especially if you have a larger or more rambunctious cat.\n5. **Aesthetics**: Choose a design that fits your home decor and style.\n\nSome popular cat tower brands and models include:\n\n1. **Armarkat**: Known for their affordable, sturdy, and functional cat towers with multiple levels and scratching surfaces.\n2. **Go Pet Club**: Offers a range of cat towers with unique designs, such as the \"Tree\" model with a hammock and observation deck.\n3. **FurHaven**: Provides high-quality, plush cat towers with multiple perches and hideaways.\n4. **SmartCat**: Designs innovative, space-saving cat towers with modern aesthetics.\n5. **Cat Tower USA**: Offers handcrafted, made-in-the-USA cat towers with natural wood and carpeted surfaces.\n\nWhen selecting a cat tower, consider your cat's preferences, age, and abilities. You may also want to read reviews and watch videos to get a better sense of the product's quality and performance.\n\nI hope this helps you find the purrfect cat tower for Luna!",
