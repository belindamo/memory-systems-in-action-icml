  "content": "In many countries, hate crimes carry heavier penalties than non-hate crimes of the same nature. This is because hate crimes not only harm the individual victim, but they also have a harmful impact on the targeted group as a whole. \n\nIn the United States, for example, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act provides for enhanced sentencing in federal hate crime cases. If someone commits a crime motivated by bias or prejudice based on the victim's race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, they can be charged with a hate crime, which carries steeper penalties than the underlying offense itself.\n\nIndividual states may also have their own laws providing for enhanced penalties for hate crimes. However, the specific penalties can vary depending on the state or country where the crime occurred.",
