Cat towers with ramps can be a great option for cats with mobility issues or who prefer a more gentle climb.\n\nRegarding Luna's cat tree, it's great that you cleaned it out and added new scratching pads! That's a wonderful way to keep her happy and engaged. Whether to get a new cat tree or stick with the one you have depends on a few factors:\n\n1. **Condition of the current cat tree**: If the cat tree is still sturdy, clean, and in good condition, there might not be a need to replace it. Adding new scratching pads and some TLC can give it a fresh new look and feel.\n2. **Luna's preferences**: Observe Luna's behavior and see if she's still enjoying the current cat tree. If she's using it regularly and seems happy with it, there's no need to change it.\n3. **Upgrades and features**: If you're considering a new cat tree, think about what features you'd like to add or upgrade. For example, do you want a taller tree, more scratching surfaces, or a different design?\n\nIf you decide to get a new cat tree, you could consider the following:\n\n1. **Rotate cat trees**: You could rotate the old cat tree with a new one every few years to keep things fresh and interesting for Luna.\n2. **Add a secondary cat tree**: If you have the space, you could add a secondary cat tree in a different location to provide Luna with more options and variety.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours! If you're happy with the current cat tree and Luna seems to be enjoying it, there's no need to change it. But if you're looking to upgrade or add some variety to her environment, a new cat tree could be a great option.",
