Since I started my morning cleaning routine 6 weeks ago, I've noticed a huge difference in the cleanliness and organization of my apartment. However, I did miss my morning cleaning routine today due to a busy Monday, which made me feel a bit behind. Do you have any suggestions on how to stay motivated and stick to my daily routines, even on busy days?",
