  "content": "Let me think... I've been to the cinema a few times, maybe around 3-4 times in the past 3 months. As for streaming services, I'd say I watch around 2-3 movies per week, mostly during my free time on the weekends. When I'm traveling, I usually watch 1-2 movies per trip, depending on the length of the trip. I've also re-watched a few other movies, like \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"The Dark Knight\", aside from the \"Harry Potter\" series.",
