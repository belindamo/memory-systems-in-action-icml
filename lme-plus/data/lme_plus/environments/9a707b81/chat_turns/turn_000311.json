Yes, the visual effects in Inception were indeed impressive and groundbreaking. The film used a blend of practical effects and CGI to create the dream world within the movie. The team behind the visual effects used a combination of techniques to create complex shots that involved changing gravity, rotating environments, and folding architecture. They used motion control, miniature models, and extensive green screen work to capture the complex visuals seen in the film.\n\nMoreover, Christopher Nolan, the director of Inception, is known for his preference for practical effects over CGI, and many of the visual effects used in Inception were actually real and practical. For instance, the scene where Arthur and Ariadne battle in a zero-gravity environment was achieved by building a rotating set and filming the actors suspended on cables.\n\nOverall, the visual effects of Inception were a perfect blend of practical and digital effects, which combined to create a visually stunning and immersive world within the film.",
