Here's one that yields a deliciously juicy and flavorful chicken breast:\n\n**Simple Grilled Chicken Breast Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1-2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (depending on size and your appetite)\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 1 tsp black pepper\n* 1 tsp garlic powder (optional)\n* 1 tsp paprika (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C).\n2. Rinse the chicken breasts and pat them dry with paper towels.\n3. In a small bowl, mix together olive oil, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika (if using).\n4. Rub the mixture evenly onto both sides of the chicken breasts, making sure to coat them thoroughly.\n5. Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook for 5-7 minutes per side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n6. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 2-3 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to oil your grill grates before cooking to prevent the chicken from sticking.\n* If you're using a gas grill, you can close the lid during cooking to help cook the chicken more evenly. If you're using a charcoal grill, keep the lid slightly ajar to maintain a consistent temperature.\n* Don't press down on the chicken with your spatula while it's cooking, as this can squeeze out juices and make the chicken dry.\n* Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute, making it even more tender and juicy.\n\nThat's it! You should end up with a deliciously grilled chicken breast, perfect for a quick and easy dinner. Enjoy with your favorite sides and don't forget to save some time for your \"Office\" episode later.",
