How many trips have you taken in the past 3 months? If it's around 4-6 trips, that's an additional 6-9 movies.\n\n**Re-watches**: You mentioned re-watching a few movies, including the \"Harry Potter\" series (8 movies), \"The Shawshank Redemption\", and \"The Dark Knight\". Let's count these as 10 re-watches in total.\n\nAdding these up, you've likely watched around 43-60 movies in the past 3 months.

Do you think they're accurate, or do you think you've watched more or fewer movies?",
