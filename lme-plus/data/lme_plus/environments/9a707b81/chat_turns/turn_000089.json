Here are some tips to ensure your chicken breast is cooked evenly and not overcooked:\n\n**Tips for Grilling Chicken Breast:**\n\n1. **Make sure the grill is hot**: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C). This will help create a nice sear on the chicken breast and cook it evenly.\n2. **Oil the grates**: Use a paper towel dipped in oil to brush the grill grates. This will prevent the chicken from sticking and make it easier to flip.\n3. **Don't press down**: Resist the temptation to press down on the chicken breast with your spatula while it's grilling. This can squeeze out juices and make the chicken dry.\n4. **Flip at the right time**: Flip the chicken breast after 5-7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the breast. You want to get a nice sear on the first side before flipping.\n5. **Check the internal temperature**: Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken breast. It should reach 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) for medium-rare, 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C) for medium, and 175\u00b0F (80\u00b0C) for well-done.\n6. **Don't overcook**: Cook the chicken breast for 10-12 minutes total, or until it reaches the desired internal temperature. Overcooking can make the chicken dry and tough.\n7. **Let it rest**: Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the grill and let it rest for 2-3 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken more tender and juicy.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to grill a delicious and evenly cooked chicken breast to pair with your roasted vegetables.\n\nRemember, you're on track to finish cooking and eating dinner around 9:30 PM, leaving you plenty of time to watch your episode of \"The Office\" and get to bed by 10:30 PM. Enjoy your dinner and TV time!",
