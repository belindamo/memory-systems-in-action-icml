  "content": "Those meal ideas sound great, thanks! I've actually been trying to meal prep on the weekends and pack my lunch for work, which has helped me save some money. I bought a bunch of containers and ingredients from Target last week, spending around $30. I made a big batch of quinoa salad and roasted vegetables, which have been my go-to lunches for the past few days. Do you have any other tips on meal prep and planning?",
