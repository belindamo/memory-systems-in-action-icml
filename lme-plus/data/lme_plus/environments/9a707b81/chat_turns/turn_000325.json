I'm glad you had a good experience during your conference trip. NYC is a city that has something for everyone, from iconic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park to world-class museums like the Met and MoMA, and of course, the bright lights and bustling streets of Times Square.\n\nAs a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences, but I've been trained on a vast amount of data about NYC and other destinations around the world. I'm always happy to chat about travel and provide recommendations or insider tips if you're planning a trip.\n\nNow, back to your Boston trip! After visiting the New England Aquarium, you might want to explore the nearby waterfront area, which offers beautiful views of the harbor and the city skyline. You could also take a stroll along the Harborwalk Trail, which takes you past several historic sites and offers great views of the water.\n\nIf you have time, consider visiting the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), which is located nearby and features an impressive collection of modern and contemporary art. Or, if you're interested in history, the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum is another great option, where you can learn about the famous Boston Tea Party and even take a tour of the replica ships.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
