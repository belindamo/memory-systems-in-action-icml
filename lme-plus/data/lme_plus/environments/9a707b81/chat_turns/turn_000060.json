  "content": "That's really helpful! I've been trying to reduce my food waste by planning my meals and making a grocery list beforehand. I've been using an app to track my spending and stay on top of my budget. According to the app, I've spent around $250 on groceries in the past two weeks, which is slightly above my target of $200. I'm hoping to get back on track this week by planning some cheaper meals and avoiding impulse buys. Do you have any tips on how to stay on track with my budget and avoid overspending at the grocery store?",
