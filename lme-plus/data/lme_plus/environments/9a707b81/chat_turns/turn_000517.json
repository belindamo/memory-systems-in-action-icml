When the tourism industry is done in a sustainable way and with the interests of the locals and the environment in mind, it can bring enormous benefits to a region. These benefits include an increase in employment opportunities, economic stability, cultural exchange, and a greater understanding of different cultures. Therefore, there is a need for tourism stakeholders to aim at sustainable tourism and promote the development of the destination in a balanced way.\n\nThank you for your questions, and if you have any further queries, please feel free to ask!",
