It's a perfect way to showcase fresh strawberries, and with a few tips, you can create a truly unforgettable dessert. Here are some secrets to making the perfect shortcake:\n\n1. **Use the right flour**: Look for a high-protein flour, such as bread flour or all-purpose flour with a high protein content (around 12-13%). This will help the shortcake hold its structure and provide a tender crumb.\n2. **Don't overmix**: Mix the dough just until the ingredients come together in a shaggy mass. Overmixing can lead to a dense, tough shortcake.\n3. **Use cold ingredients**: Cold butter, cold cream, and cold eggs will help create a flaky, tender shortcake.\n4. **Don't overbake**: Shortcake should be lightly golden and still tender in the center. Overbaking will make it dry and crumbly.\n5. **Use the right sugar**: Granulated sugar is traditional, but you can also try using turbinado or Demerara sugar for a slightly caramel-like flavor.\n6. **Add a touch of salt**: A pinch of salt will balance the sweetness and enhance the flavors of the strawberries and cream.\n7. **Let it rest**: Allow the dough to rest for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax, making the shortcake easier to work with.\n8. **Don't over-sweeten the strawberries**: Let the natural sweetness of the strawberries shine by only adding a touch of sugar to the sliced strawberries. You can also try using a mixture of granulated and confectioner's sugar for a more nuanced flavor.\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Strawberry Shortcake Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups (250g) high-protein flour\n* 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 cup (115g) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n* 3/4 cup (180ml) heavy cream, chilled\n* 1 large egg, chilled\n* 2 cups sliced strawberries, plus more for serving\n* Confectioner's sugar, for dusting\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the cold butter and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work it into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.\n3. In a small bowl, whisk together the heavy cream and egg until well combined. Pour the cream mixture over the flour mixture and gently fold until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass.\n4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times until it comes together.\n5. Roll the dough out to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thickness. Use a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass to cut out shortcakes. Gather the scraps, re-roll, and cut out more shortcakes.\n6. Place the shortcakes on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each.\n7. Brush the tops with a little extra heavy cream and sprinkle with granulated sugar.\n8. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until lightly golden. Allow the shortcakes to cool on a wire rack.\n9. Split the shortcakes in half horizontally using a serrated knife.\n10. Spoon sliced strawberries over the bottom half of each shortcake, followed by a dollop of whipped cream. Top with the top half of the shortcake and dust with confectioner's sugar.\n\nTips for assembling the shortcake:\n\n* Make sure the shortcakes are completely cool before assembling to prevent them from becoming soggy",
