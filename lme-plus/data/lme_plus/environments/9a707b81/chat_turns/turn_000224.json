  "content": "It's understandable that you may prefer to focus on specific areas of martial arts such as fighting techniques and strength training. However, maintaining and improving flexibility can contribute to your performance in these areas.\n\nFor example, training in martial arts works muscles commonly neglected in other forms of exercise such as weight lifting. Resistance training increases muscle stability, which may make you feel stronger, but inflexible muscles can inhibit your range of motion, compromising your technique and overall performance. Stretching also has benefits for injury prevention and recovery, which are important for maintaining a healthy and consistent training schedule.\n\nUltimately, a balanced approach to martial arts training that includes flexibility can help you develop a more well-rounded, effective, and sustainable practice in the long term.",
