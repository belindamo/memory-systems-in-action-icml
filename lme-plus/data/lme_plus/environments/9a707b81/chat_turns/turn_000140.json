  "content": "I'm getting excited about my upcoming trip to Grayson Highlands State Park. Speaking of trips, I went on a solo fishing trip to Lake Troutman back in early April.

Anyway, back to my question - do you know if there are any good fishing spots near the campsite we're planning to stay at?",
