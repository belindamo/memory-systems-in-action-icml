However, if you're considering replacing it with a more water-efficient model, that's a fantastic idea!\n\nThere are many excellent options available in the market. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Dual-Flush Toilets**: These toilets have two buttons or levers, allowing you to choose between a full flush (usually 1.6 gallons per flush) and a partial flush (usually 0.8 gallons per flush) for liquid waste. Some popular brands include:\n\t* Toto: Known for their high-quality and water-efficient toilets, Toto offers a range of dual-flush models.\n\t* Kohler: Kohler's dual-flush toilets are WaterSense certified and offer significant water savings.\n\t* American Standard: American Standard's dual-flush toilets are designed for comfort and water efficiency.\n2. **Low-Flow Toilets**: These toilets use significantly less water per flush than traditional toilets. Look for models with the WaterSense label, which indicates they meet EPA standards for water efficiency. Some popular brands include:\n\t* Niagara: Niagara's Stealth toilet uses an impressive 0.8 gallons per flush and is WaterSense certified.\n\t* Gerber: Gerber's Ultra Flush toilet uses 1.1 gallons per flush and is also WaterSense certified.\n\t* Mansfield: Mansfield's Summit toilet uses 1.28 gallons per flush and features a powerful flush system.\n\nWhen shopping for a new toilet, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Water efficiency**: Look for toilets with the WaterSense label or those that use 1.28 gallons per flush or less.\n* **Flush performance**: A toilet's MaP (Maximum Performance) score indicates its ability to remove waste effectively. A higher MaP score means better performance.\n* **Comfort and features**: Consider the toilet's comfort level, bowl shape, and features like heated seats, bidets, or advanced flushing systems.\n* **Price and warranty**: Balance your budget with the toilet's quality, features, and warranty.\n\nBefore making a final decision, research and read reviews to find the best fit for your needs and budget.\n\nRemember to also consider factors like installation costs, as they can vary depending on your location and plumber.\n\nI hope this helps you in your search for a more water-efficient toilet!",
