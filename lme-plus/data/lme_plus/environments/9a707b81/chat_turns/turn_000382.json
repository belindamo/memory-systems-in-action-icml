  "content": "To create a mechanical pressure-sensitive valve activation mechanism, you can use a mechanical pressure switch or a spring-loaded valve. Here's an outline of how it could work:\n\n1. Mechanical pressure switch or spring-loaded valve: Replace the electronic pressure sensor and solenoid valve with a mechanical pressure switch or a spring-loaded valve. This component will act as both the pressure sensor and the valve, releasing air when the desired pressure is reached.\n2. Calibration: Calibrate the mechanical pressure switch or spring-loaded valve to respond to the desired tire pressure set by the user. The user would set the desired tire pressure using a dial or an adjustable spring tension mechanism. The valve should remain closed during the tire inflation process until the desired pressure is reached.\n3. Valve activation: When the tire pressure reaches the desired value, the mechanical pressure switch or spring-loaded valve will open due to the increased pressure acting on the valve mechanism. This will release excess air from the system, preventing further inflation of the tire.\n4. Valve deactivation: The valve would close once the pressure inside the tire drops slightly below the desired pressure, stopping the release of air. This ensures that the tire remains at the desired pressure after the excess air is released.\n\nA mechanical pressure-sensitive valve activation mechanism can offer a simple, cost-effective, and robust alternative to an electronic system. However, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and fine-tuning as an electronic system. It's essential to choose the appropriate solution based on your design goals, user experience requirements, and the target market for your product.",
