  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to the specific timeline of filming each scene in Inception, but I can provide you with some information about the zero-gravity sequence. The zero-gravity sequence involved building a rotating hallway set that rotated a full 360 degrees. A mobile gimbal was mounted beneath the rotating set, which allowed the actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ariadne, to perform the fight choreography in zero gravity. The sequence took six weeks to film and is considered one of the most memorable sequences in the film. The rotating set was so large that it had to be built at the Cardington Studios in Bedfordshire, England, which is one of the largest enclosed spaces in Europe. In addition, several other scenes in the film also have impressive visual effects and took a considerable amount of time to create.",
