Having someone to share the experience with can help you stay accountable, provide moral support, and even make the studying process more enjoyable.\n\nIt's great that you're meeting up regularly to review material and discuss challenges. This type of collaborative learning can help you both stay on track, clarify any doubts, and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nHaving someone who understands what you're going through can be incredibly valuable. You can relate to each other's struggles and frustrations, and offer words of encouragement when needed. This can help build a sense of camaraderie and make the studying process feel less isolating.\n\nAdditionally, studying with a friend can also help you learn from each other's perspectives and approaches. You may find that Alex has a different way of understanding a particular concept, which can help you see it in a new light. Similarly, you may be able to help Alex with areas where they're struggling.\n\nRemember to celebrate each other's progress, no matter how small, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. You're both in this together, and supporting each other will make the journey to certification much more enjoyable and rewarding.\n\nKeep up the good work, and I'm sure you'll both do great on your certification exams!",
