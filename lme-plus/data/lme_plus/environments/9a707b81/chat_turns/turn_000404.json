Here are some recommendations for a good bass amp suitable for a beginner like you:\n\n**Solid-State Bass Amps:**\n\n1. **Fender Rumble 15:** A compact, lightweight amp with a punchy sound and a built-in overdrive channel. It's perfect for small practice sessions and gigs.\n2. **Hartke HD15:** A compact, affordable amp with a clear, articulate sound and a built-in limiter to prevent distortion.\n3. **Ampeg BA-110:** A compact, versatile amp with a range of tones and a built-in compressor to even out your dynamics.\n\n**Combo Bass Amps:**\n\n1. **Peavey MAX 115:** A compact, all-in-one combo amp with a powerful sound and a built-in tuner.\n2. **Ibanez IBZ10B:** A compact, lightweight combo amp with a clear, punchy sound and a built-in overdrive channel.\n3. **Yamaha TRBX504:** A compact, versatile combo amp with a range of tones and a built-in compressor to even out your dynamics.\n\n**Key Features to Consider:**\n\n1. **Wattage:** For a beginner, 10-50 watts is plenty for small practice sessions and gigs.\n2. **Speaker size:** A 10-15 inch speaker is a good starting point for a beginner, as it provides a good balance between tone and portability.\n3. **Channels:** A single-channel amp is fine for a beginner, but if you want to experiment with different tones, look for an amp with multiple channels.\n4. **EQ controls:** Look for an amp with a simple EQ section (bass, mid, treble) to help you shape your tone.\n5. **Price:** Bass amps can range from under $100 to over $500, so set a budget and look for an amp that fits within it.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Try before you buy:** If possible, try out different amps before making a purchase to find the one that sounds and feels right to you.\n2. **Read reviews:** Check out reviews from other bassists to get a sense of an amp's strengths and weaknesses.\n3. **Consider a amp with a headphone output:** If you plan to practice late at night or in a noise-sensitive environment, an amp with a headphone output can be a lifesaver.\n4. **Don't forget a cable and strap:** Make sure you have a good quality bass cable and strap to complete your setup.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun playing bass and experimenting with different tones and techniques!\n\nAs you're borrowing a bass guitar from your friend, make sure to take good care of it and return it in the same condition. Who knows, you might just catch the bass bug and decide to get your own bass guitar in the future!",
