I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I'm starting from scratch with each conversation.\n\nBut I'm glad to hear that you're happy with your decision to stick with the cat tree you have! Adding new scratching pads and toys is a great way to keep things fresh and interesting for Luna. It's wonderful that you're taking such good care of her and her toys.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns about cat care or toys, feel free to ask! I'm here to help.",
