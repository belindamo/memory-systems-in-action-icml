  "content": "F45 Training is an excellent choice for a high-intensity workout. They're known for their fast-paced, functional training classes that combine cardio and strength exercises.\n\nF45 Training primarily offers group classes, but they also provide personal training options. Here's a breakdown of what they offer:\n\n**Group Classes:** F45 Training offers a variety of group classes, each with a unique focus and intensity level. Some popular classes include:\n\n* F45 Training: Their signature class, which combines cardio and strength exercises in a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format.\n* Panthers: A strength-focused class with an emphasis on weightlifting and resistance training.\n* Hollywood: A cardio-based class with a focus on agility, speed, and endurance.\n* Brooklyn: A strength and cardio class with a focus on functional movements and conditioning.\n\n**Personal Training:** F45 Training offers one-on-one personal training sessions, which can be customized to fit your specific fitness goals and needs. These sessions are typically 45 minutes long and can be scheduled at a time that suits you.\n\n**Small Group Training:** F45 Training also offers small group training sessions, which are typically 2-4 people per session. These sessions provide a more personalized approach than group classes but are still more affordable than one-on-one training.\n\nKeep in mind that availability and pricing for personal training and small group training may vary depending on the location and trainer.\n\nBefore signing up, I recommend checking the F45 Training website or contacting your local studio to:\n\n* Check the schedule and availability of classes and personal training sessions\n* Ask about pricing and any promotions or discounts\n* Inquire about the experience and qualifications of the trainers\n* Learn more about their approach to fitness and how it aligns with your goals\n\nIt's great that you and Emily are looking to try out a new workout routine together! Having a workout buddy can be a great motivator.",
