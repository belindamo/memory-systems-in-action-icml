  "content": "I'd be happy to help you create a personalized schedule that suits your energy levels and productivity patterns.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your energy levels and productivity patterns? For example:\n\n1. What time of day do you typically feel most energized and focused?\n2. Are you a morning person, afternoon person, or do you have a different productivity peak?\n3. Do you have any periods of the day when you tend to feel sluggish or less productive?\n4. How many hours of focused work can you realistically do in a day before you start to feel burnt out?\n5. Are there any specific tasks or activities that tend to drain your energy or boost your productivity?\n\nAlso, considering your meeting on Wednesday at 2 pm, how much buffer time do you think you'll need to follow up on next steps? Would 30 minutes, 1 hour, or more be sufficient?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your rhythms and needs, I can help you create a schedule that works with your strengths and limitations.",
