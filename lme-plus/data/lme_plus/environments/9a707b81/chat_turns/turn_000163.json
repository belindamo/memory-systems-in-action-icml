It shows that you've put extra effort into the gift and care about your coworkers' feelings.\n\nHere are a few ideas for personalized notes:\n\n* A simple \"Thank you for being an amazing team!\" or \"Wishing you a nutty holiday season!\"\n* A heartfelt message expressing your appreciation for their hard work and dedication\n* A funny joke or pun related to nuts (e.g., \"You're the mac to my cheese, the peanut butter to my jelly...\")\n\nAs for gift bags, you can choose something simple yet elegant, like a brown paper bag with a twine tie, or something more festive, like a red or green bag with a holiday design. You could also consider adding a decorative ribbon or a gift tag with a personal message.\n\nIf you want to take it to the next level, you could even create a custom label or sticker with your company's logo or a fun design. This can add a professional touch and make the gift feel more bespoke.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be sincere and genuine in your gesture. Your coworkers will appreciate the thought and effort you put into the gift, regardless of the packaging.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you going to add a personalized note or gift bag to your variety pack?",
