Set aside daily reading time: Establish a regular time each day when you and your child can read together. This could be in the morning, afternoon or before bedtime. Make it a habit, so your child knows when to expect reading time. 2. Keep books within reach: Have books in different parts of the house where your child can easily access them, such as in the living room, bedroom, or playroom. This way, they can pick up a book anytime they feel like reading. 3. Make it fun: Engage your child with the story by using different voices and sound effects. Ask them questions about the story, characters or illustrations to get them involved. 4. Read everywhere: Read to your child everywhere, including in the car, on the bus, or in the park. Carry a book with you all the time, so if your child is feeling restless, you can distract them with a good story. 5. Lead by example: Children learn by example, so read in front of them. This lets them know that reading is important and enjoyable. 6. Reward reading: Give your child positive feedback and incentives for reading. For example, you could offer them a treat after they finish a book or a small toy for every five books they read. Remember, the key is to make reading a regular part of your child's daily routine and to keep it fun and enjoyable.",
