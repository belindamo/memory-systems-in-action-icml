I want to express my appreciation for my coworkers' hard work and dedication, and a heartfelt message will make the gift even more special. I'll keep it simple and sincere, something like \"Thank you for being an amazing team! Wishing you a happy and relaxing holiday season.\"\n\nBy the way, I'm also planning to give my coworker Sarah a coffee maker for her birthday, which is coming up soon. I got it on sale for $70, and I think she'll really love it.",
