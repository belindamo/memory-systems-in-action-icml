  "content": "I think I can help answer some of those questions. I've been leaning towards action movies and dramas lately, and within those genres, I've been watching a lot of superhero movies and historical dramas. As for viewing times, I usually watch movies during my free time on weekends, and I prefer watching them in the evening. I'm not really a binge-watcher, I like spacing out my movies over time. In terms of mood-based viewing, I think I do associate certain movies with certain moods. For example, if I'm feeling energized, I might watch an action movie, and if I'm feeling emotional, I might watch a drama or rom-com. As for influences and recommendations, I usually find out about new movies through social media or online reviews. I'm open to exploring new directors, actors, or franchises based on recommendations, and I've actually discovered some new favorite movies that way.",
