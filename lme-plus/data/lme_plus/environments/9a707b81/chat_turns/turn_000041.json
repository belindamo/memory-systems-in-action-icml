Given your concerns about acne and hyperpigmentation, I'll suggest some lightweight moisturizers with SPF and hyaluronic acid that might work well for you. Since your facial cleanser has a pH level of 5.5, you'll want to look for moisturizers with a similar pH range to maintain skin health.\n\nHere are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel**: This lightweight, oil-free moisturizer has a pH level of 5.5 and contains hyaluronic acid to provide long-lasting hydration. It's non-comedogenic and won't clog pores, making it suitable for acne-prone skin. It also has SPF 50 for daily sun protection.\n2. **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid**: This moisturizer has a lightweight, fluid texture and a pH level of 5.5. It's formulated with caffeine and shea butter to soothe and hydrate the skin, while also providing SPF 50 protection. It's suitable for combination skin and won't clog pores.\n3. **EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46**: This moisturizer has a lightweight, non-greasy texture and a pH level of 5.5. It contains hyaluronic acid and vitamin E to provide hydration and antioxidant protection. It's also fragrance-free and non-comedogenic, making it suitable for acne-prone skin.\n4. **Dermalogica Daily Moisturizing Cream**: This moisturizer has a lightweight, whipped texture and a pH level of 5.5. It contains hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and vitamin E to provide long-lasting hydration and antioxidant protection. It's also formulated with tea tree oil to help control acne and reduce inflammation.\n5. **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**: This rich yet lightweight moisturizer has a pH level of 5.5 and contains hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and hyaluronic acid to provide long-lasting hydration and repair the skin's barrier. It's also fragrance-free and non-comedogenic, making it suitable for acne-prone skin.\n\nRemember, everyone's skin is unique, so it's possible you may need to try a few options to find the one that works best for you. Start with a small sample or a travel-sized product to test it out before committing to a full-size purchase.\n\nAlso, don't forget to use sunscreen with at least SPF 30 daily, even on cloudy days, to prevent further hyperpigmentation.",
