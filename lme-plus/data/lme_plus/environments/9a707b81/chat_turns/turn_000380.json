  "content": "Yes, it's possible to design a system without the momentary pause. One approach is to use a flow-based pressure sensing mechanism that can measure tire pressure while air is flowing. This method involves creating a pressure drop across an orifice or flow restrictor, which allows the pressure sensor to measure the tire pressure accurately. Here's a basic outline of how it could work:\n\n1. Flow restrictor: Install a flow restrictor or an orifice in the air passage between the compressor and the tire. This component creates a pressure drop across itself when air flows through it, isolating the tire pressure from the air hose and compressor pressure.\n2. Pressure sensor: Use a pressure sensor that measures the pressure on the tire side of the flow restrictor or orifice. This could be a mechanical (e.g., Bourdon tube, diaphragm) or electronic sensor (e.g., piezoelectric, strain gauge). The sensor would be connected to the air passage between the flow restrictor and the tire.\n3. User setting: Allow the user to set the desired tire pressure using a dial or a digital interface. This setting would determine the activation point for the pressure-sensitive valve or solenoid valve.\n4. Pressure-sensitive valve: Connect the pressure sensor to a pressure-sensitive valve or a solenoid valve. This valve would remain closed during the tire inflation process.\n5. Valve activation: When the tire pressure reaches the desired value, the pressure sensor sends a signal to the pressure-sensitive valve or solenoid valve, causing it to open. This will release excess air from the system, preventing further inflation of the tire.\n6. Valve deactivation: The valve would close once the pressure inside the tire drops slightly below the desired pressure, stopping the release of air. This ensures that the tire remains at the desired pressure after the excess air is released.\n\nBy using a flow-based pressure sensing mechanism, you can create a system that accurately measures tire pressure without requiring a momentary pause. This design allows for continuous inflation while ensuring the pressure relief mechanism activates at the correct pressure level, maintaining the desired tire pressure and preventing overinflation.",
