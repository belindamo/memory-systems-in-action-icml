Remember to:\n\n1. **Start slow and progress gradually**: Ease into the exercises and weights to avoid fatigue and prevent injuries. Gradually increase the intensity and weight as your body adapts.\n2. **Focus on proper form and technique**: Make sure to perform the exercises correctly to target the right muscles and avoid injury.\n3. **Listen to your body**: Rest and recover when needed. If you feel fatigued or experience pain, take an extra day off or modify the exercises to make them easier.\n4. **Balance strength training with swimming**: Don't forget to balance your strength training with your swimming workouts. Aim to do strength training on non-consecutive days to allow for recovery time.\n5. **Mix it up**: Vary your exercises and routines to avoid plateaus and prevent overuse injuries.\n\nRemember, consistency and patience are key. Stick to your plan, and you'll start to see improvements in your swimming endurance over time.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your training, and I hope you crush your triathlon goals!",
