  "content": "For someone who's not an experienced hiker, the Eagle Falls Trail would be a good option as it is a shorter and moderate level hike. The trail is well-maintained and offers breathtaking views of Eagle Falls and Emerald Bay. The trail is only 2.3 miles round trip, and the elevation gain is gradual, making it a good option for novice hikers. However, it is always important to check the trail conditions and weather before embarking on any hike, especially for beginners.",
