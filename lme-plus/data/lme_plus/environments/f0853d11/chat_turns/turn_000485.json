This schedule allows you to fit in your meditation and yoga practice before starting your day, which can help set a positive tone and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nRemember to be flexible and adjust the schedule as needed. If you need a few extra minutes of sleep or have an unexpected commitment, don't stress about it. Just try to prioritize your meditation and yoga practice as much as possible.\n\nAlso, don't forget to leave some buffer time in your schedule for any unexpected things that might come up. You might want to consider adding a 10-15 minute buffer between your yoga routine and getting ready for the day, just in case you need a little extra time to get ready.\n\nHow does this schedule look to you?",
