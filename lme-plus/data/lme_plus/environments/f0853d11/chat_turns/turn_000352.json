Try indoor activities: If the weather is really bad, try indoor activities like yoga or stretching.\n\n3. Find indoor alternatives to outdoor activities: If you normally hike or run outside, find indoor alternatives like walking on a treadmill or using an elliptical machine.\n\n4. Embrace the weather: Sometimes it can be quite invigorating to get out and embrace the seasonal weather. Try splashing in puddles, jumping in leaves or snow, or simply taking a walk with a raincoat or umbrella.\n\n5. Find indoor spaces with outdoor scenes: Consider going to a greenhouse or indoor botanical garden, aquarium or zoo to still connect with the environment and serene natural spaces.\n\nRemember to prioritize your safety and comfort when deciding whether to venture outside in the cold or rainy weather.
