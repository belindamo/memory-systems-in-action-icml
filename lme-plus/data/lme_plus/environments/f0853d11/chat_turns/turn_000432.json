This allows your body to recover and rebuild from the physical stress of exercise, which is important for making progress and avoiding injury.\n\nAs a beginner, it's better to start with 3 times per week and gradually increase the frequency as your body adapts. This will help you build a consistent habit and reduce the risk of burnout or overtraining.\n\nHere's an example of what your weekly exercise routine could look like:\n\n* Monday: Jogging (30 minutes, moderate intensity)\n* Tuesday: Rest day\n* Wednesday: Biking (30 minutes, moderate intensity)\n* Thursday: Rest day\n* Friday: Strength training (30-40 minutes, moderate intensity)\n* Saturday: Rest day\n* Sunday: Long, slow jog or bike ride (45-60 minutes, low-moderate intensity)\n\nAs you get more comfortable, you can add an extra day of exercise or increase the intensity and duration of your workouts. Remember to listen to your body and take extra rest days if you need them.\n\nIt's also important to remember that rest days are not just about physical recovery, but also mental recovery. Exercise can be mentally taxing, so make sure to take time to relax and recharge.\n\nIn terms of rest days, aim to take at least one or two complete rest days per week, where you avoid any intense physical activity. You can still do light activities like stretching, yoga, or walking on these days, but avoid anything that feels strenuous or taxing.\n\nRemember, consistency and patience are key. Stick to your routine, and don't be afraid to make adjustments as needed. Good luck, and have fun!",
