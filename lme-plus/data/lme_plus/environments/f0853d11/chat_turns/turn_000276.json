Here are some tips to help you find your moderate pace:\n\n**Perceived Exertion (RPE)**:\n\n1. **Scale of 1-10**: Rate your perceived exertion on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is extremely easy and 10 is extremely hard.\n2. **Moderate pace**: Aim for an RPE of 5-6, which should feel like a comfortable, sustained effort. You should be able to hold a conversation, but it might be a bit challenging.\n\n**Heart Rate (HR)**:\n\n1. **Monitor your heart rate**: Use a heart rate monitor or a fitness tracker to track your heart rate during swimming.\n2. **Zone 3-4**: Aim for a heart rate zone of 3-4, which corresponds to a moderate intensity. This is usually around 50-70% of your maximum heart rate.\n3. **Calculate your max HR**: Estimate your maximum heart rate using the formula: 220 - your age.\n\n**Swim Speed**:\n\n1. **Time yourself**: Swim a 25-50 meter lap and time yourself.\n2. **Moderate pace**: Aim for a time that feels comfortable, but still challenges you. For example, if you're swimming 25 meters, aim for a time of 20-30 seconds.\n3. **Use a pace clock**: Many pools have pace clocks on the walls. Use these to track your time and adjust your pace accordingly.\n\n**Other Factors**:\n\n1. **Breathing**: At a moderate pace, you should be able to breathe every 2-3 strokes.\n2. **Stroke rate**: Focus on a smooth, efficient stroke rate. Aim for 30-40 strokes per minute.\n3. **Body position**: Maintain a horizontal body position, with your hips and legs engaged.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a pace that feels sustainable for the duration of your workout. As you get more comfortable, you can adjust your pace to challenge yourself further.\n\nFor Phase 1, focus on finding a moderate pace that allows you to complete the workout without feeling exhausted. As you progress to Phase 2 and 3, you can increase the intensity and challenge yourself further.",
