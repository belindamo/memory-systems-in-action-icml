I've been really into discovering new music lately, and I've been using the \"Discover Weekly\" and \"Release Radar\" playlists on Spotify to find new artists and songs. Last week, I discovered a new artist called Tameca Jones, and I've been listening to her album \"Leave It Alone\" non-stop. Her music is a great mix of soul, R&B, and indie rock, and I've been recommending it to all my friends.",
