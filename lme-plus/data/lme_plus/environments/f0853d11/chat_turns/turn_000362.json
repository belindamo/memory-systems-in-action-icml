  "content": "I completely understand. It's great that you finally took the step to see a specialist, even though it might have been uncomfortable or felt like a burden. It's essential to prioritize your own health and well-being, especially when you're caring for others.\n\nIt's common to downplay our own health concerns or put others' needs before our own, but neglecting your own health can ultimately affect your ability to care for others. By taking care of yourself, you're actually being a better caregiver and family member in the long run.\n\nRemember, taking care of your physical and mental health is not selfish; it's necessary. By addressing your herniated disk and taking the time to recover, you'll be able to return to your daily activities with more energy, strength, and resilience.\n\nIt's great that you've taken this important step, and I'm sure your loved ones will understand and support you in your recovery. If you need someone to talk to or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself during this recovery period. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Keep in mind that it's okay to ask for help, take breaks, and prioritize your own needs. You got this!",
