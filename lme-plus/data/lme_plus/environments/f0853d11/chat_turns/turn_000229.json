  "content": "The impact of climate change on coastal cities is a pressing concern, and there are several excellent non-fiction books that explore this topic in-depth. Here are some highly recommended books that focus on the effects of climate change on coastal cities:\n\n1. **\"Rising: Dispatches from the New American Shore\" by Elizabeth Rush**: This book is a beautifully written and deeply reported exploration of the impact of sea level rise on coastal communities across the United States. Rush travels to vulnerable areas, from the Outer Banks to Miami, to document the lives of people living on the front lines of climate change.\n2. **\"The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, and the Remaking of the Civilized World\" by Jeff Goodell**: This book is a compelling and accessible exploration of the impact of sea level rise on coastal cities around the world. Goodell visits cities like Miami, Rotterdam, and Venice to document the effects of rising waters and the efforts to adapt to this new reality.\n3. **\"Sea Level Rise: A Politics of the Ocean\" by John Brock**: This book takes a more academic approach, examining the political and social implications of sea level rise on coastal cities. Brock argues that the response to sea level rise will require a fundamental transformation of our relationship with the ocean and the way we govern coastal areas.\n4. **\"Tideland: The Rising Tide of Global Risk and the Future of Our Coastal Cities\" by Cynthia Barnett**: This book explores the intersection of sea level rise, coastal development, and urbanization, highlighting the risks and consequences of our growing coastal populations. Barnett argues that we need to rethink our approach to coastal development and prioritize resilience and adaptation.\n5. **\"High Tide on Main Street: Rising Sea Level and the Coming Coastal Crisis\" by John Englander**: This book provides a comprehensive overview of the impacts of sea level rise on coastal cities, including flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Englander, a leading expert on sea level rise, argues that we need to take immediate action to prepare for the coming coastal crisis.\n\nThese books offer a range of perspectives and approaches to understanding the impact of climate change on coastal cities. They're all highly readable and well-researched, making them great resources for anyone looking to dive deeper into this critical topic.",
