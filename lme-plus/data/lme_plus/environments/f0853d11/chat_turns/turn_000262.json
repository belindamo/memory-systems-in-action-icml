But I can certainly provide you with general tips and advice on how to care for your basil plant in a shadier spot!\n\nBasil typically thrives in partial shade, especially in warmer climates. If your balcony receives direct sunlight for most of the day, it's no wonder your basil plant is struggling. Here are some tips to help your basil plant adjust to a shadier spot:\n\n1. **Provide filtered sunlight**: Move your basil plant to a spot that receives indirect sunlight, such as an east- or west-facing balcony. You can also use a sheer curtain or shade cloth to filter the intense sunlight.\n2. **Adjust the watering schedule**: Basil plants in shadier spots might require less water, as the soil takes longer to dry out. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. Water only when the soil feels dry to the touch.\n3. **Maintain humidity**: Basil loves humid environments. You can place the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier nearby to maintain a humid microclimate.\n4. **Fertilize sparingly**: Feed your basil plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended strength. Overfertilization can be detrimental to basil plants.\n5. **Prune regularly**: Pinch off flower buds to encourage leaf growth and prevent the plant from going to seed. Trim off any leggy stems to maintain a bushy shape.\n6. **Monitor temperature**: Most basil varieties prefer daytime temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C). Avoid placing your basil near drafty areas or extreme temperature fluctuations.\n\nAs for your snake plant, it's great to hear that it's thriving! Snake plants are known for their low-maintenance requirements, so it's not surprising that it's doing well with your current care routine. Keep up the good work!\n\nRemember, every plant is unique, so observe your basil plant's response to the new shadier spot and adjust your care accordingly.
