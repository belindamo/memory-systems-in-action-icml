  "content": "Certainly! One recent breakthrough in mental health research that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is related to the treatment of severe depression. In 2019, the FDA approved a new medication called esketamine for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression - a type of depression that does not respond to traditional antidepressant medications. Esketamine is a nasal spray that works by inhibiting the activity of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain. It is the first new type of treatment for depression to be approved in decades.\n\nNIMH supported research on the clinical trial for esketamine, which was conducted over several years and involved over 800 participants. The study found that treatment with esketamine, when added to traditional antidepressants, significantly improved depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. The outcome of this research was a significant step forward in the understanding of how brain chemistry influences depression and provides a new treatment option for individuals living with this debilitating condition.",
