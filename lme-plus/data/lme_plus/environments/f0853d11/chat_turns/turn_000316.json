  "content": "As an AI language model, I can say that there are certain sub-genres of rock music that have historically placed a greater emphasis on acoustic instrumentation than others. For example, folk rock, country rock, and singer-songwriter are genres that regularly incorporate acoustic instruments like the acoustic guitar, mandolin, fiddle, piano, and harmonica. \n\nAcoustic instruments are also popular in acoustic rock, which is a sub-genre that prioritizes the acoustic sound over the electric sound typically associated with rock music. Other sub-genres that frequently use acoustic instruments include indie rock, alternative rock, and even metal, where acoustic guitars have been used as a counterpoint to the heavier electric guitars.\n\nHowever, in general, the use of acoustic instruments in rock music is not limited to any specific genre or sub-genre, and many rock bands across different styles frequently incorporate acoustic instruments into their music.",
