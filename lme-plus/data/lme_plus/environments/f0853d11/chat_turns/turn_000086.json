It's recommended that you take the time you need to reflect on the relationship, process your emotions, and determine what you truly want in a partner. This could mean waiting a few months or longer, but ultimately, the decision is up to you. Consider seeking the guidance of a therapist or counselor to help you make the best decision for yourself.",
