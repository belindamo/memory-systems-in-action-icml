There are many effective and gentle options available. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **DEET-based repellents:** DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is a common active ingredient in insect repellents. While it's effective, it can be harsh on skin and clothing. Look for DEET concentrations between 20-30% for a good balance between effectiveness and skin tolerance.\n2. **Picaridin-based repellents:** Picaridin is a synthetic compound that mimics DEET's effectiveness without the same skin irritation risks. It's often recommended for people with sensitive skin. Look for concentrations around 20%.\n3. **Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus (OLE) repellents:** OLE is a natural compound derived from the leaves of the lemon-scented eucalyptus tree. It's a popular alternative to DEET and picaridin-based repellents. OLE concentrations typically range from 30-40%.\n4. **Permethrin-treated clothing:** Permethrin is a synthetic insecticide that can be applied to clothing and gear. It's a great option if you plan to spend extended periods outdoors. You can buy permethrin spray or have your clothing treated professionally.\n\nSome popular insect repellent brands that are known for being gentle on skin include:\n\n* Natrapel\n* Sawyer\n* Cutter\n* REPEL\n* Coleman\n\nWhen choosing an insect repellent, make sure to:\n\n* Always read the label and follow instructions\n* Apply repellent only to exposed skin and clothing\n* Avoid applying repellent to damaged skin or wounds\n* Reapply as directed by the product's instructions\n* Wash your hands thoroughly after applying repellent\n\nRemember to also take other measures to prevent insect bites, such as:\n\n* Wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and closed-toe shoes\n* Avoiding peak mosquito hours (dawn and dusk)\n* Staying in well-ventilated areas\n* Eliminating standing water around your campsite or accommodation\n\nStay protected and enjoy your lake trip!",
