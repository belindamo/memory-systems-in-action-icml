Schedule outdoor time: Set aside some time each day or week for outdoor activities and put it in your schedule like any other appointment.\n\n2. Take breaks outside: If you work indoors or spend a lot of time inside, try taking breaks outside to get some fresh air and sunshine.\n\n3. Join a group or class: Group activities like hiking, cycling, or bird watching can be a great way to connect with others who enjoy outdoor activities and can help you stay motivated.\n\n4. Mix it up: Don't be afraid to try different outdoor activities, and find what works best for you. Mixing up your routine can help keep things interesting and allow you to explore different areas and environments.\n\n5. Set small goals: Start with small, achievable goals like walking for 20 minutes a day or practicing a new yoga pose outdoors. As you gain confidence and see progress, you can gradually increase the difficulty and duration of your activities.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself and take it slow, especially if you're new to outdoor activities or dealing with mental health challenges. Outdoor activities are a great way to improve your wellbeing, reduce stress, and feel more connected to nature.",
