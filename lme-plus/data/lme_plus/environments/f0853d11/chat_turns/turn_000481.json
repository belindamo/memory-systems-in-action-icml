  "content": "I'd be happy to help you schedule time for your daily meditation and yoga routine.\n\nTo get started, can you please tell me a bit more about your current schedule and preferences? For example:\n\n1. What are your wake-up and bedtime hours?\n2. What are your work/school hours (if applicable)?\n3. Do you have any fixed commitments or appointments that you need to schedule around (e.g., classes, meetings, family time)?\n4. How much time do you want to dedicate to meditation and yoga each day?\n5. Do you have a preferred time of day for your meditation and yoga practice (e.g., morning, evening, lunch break)?\n6. Are there any specific days of the week when you have more free time or flexibility in your schedule?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your schedule and preferences, I can help you block out time for your daily meditation and yoga routine.",
