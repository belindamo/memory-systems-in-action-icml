  "content": "It sounds like you have a bit of a different schedule on weekends.\n\nLet's assume you want to aim for a consistent wake-up time of 6:30 am on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 8:30 am on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).\n\nFor your daily meditation and yoga routine, how much time do you want to dedicate to each activity? Would you like to aim for a short and sweet 10-15 minute meditation session, or perhaps a longer 30-minute practice? And for yoga, would you like to aim for a 30-minute flow class, or a shorter 15-20 minute practice?\n\nAlso, do you have a preferred time of day for your meditation and yoga practice? For example, do you want to do them first thing in the morning to set a positive tone for the day, or perhaps in the evening to unwind before bed?\n\nLastly, are there any specific days of the week when you have more free time or flexibility in your schedule? For example, do you have a lunch break at work that you could use for meditation or yoga, or do you have a quieter evening on certain days of the week?",
