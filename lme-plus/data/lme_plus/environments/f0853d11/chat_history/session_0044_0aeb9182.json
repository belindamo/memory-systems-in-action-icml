For example:\n\n1. What are your wake-up and bedtime hours?\n2. What are your work/school hours (if applicable)?\n3. Do you have any fixed commitments or appointments that you need to schedule around (e.g., classes, meetings, family time)?\n4. How much time do you want to dedicate to meditation and yoga each day?\n5. Do you have a preferred time of day for your meditation and yoga practice (e.g., morning, evening, lunch break)?\n6. Are there any specific days of the week when you have more free time or flexibility in your schedule?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your schedule and preferences, I can help you block out time for your daily meditation and yoga routine."

Would you like to aim for a short and sweet 10-15 minute meditation session, or perhaps a longer 30-minute practice? And for yoga, would you like to aim for a 30-minute flow class, or a shorter 15-20 minute practice?\n\nAlso, do you have a preferred time of day for your meditation and yoga practice? For example, do you want to do them first thing in the morning to set a positive tone for the day, or perhaps in the evening to unwind before bed?\n\nLastly, are there any specific days of the week when you have more free time or flexibility in your schedule? For example, do you have a lunch break at work that you could use for meditation or yoga, or do you have a quieter evening on certain days of the week?"

This schedule allows you to fit in your meditation and yoga practice before starting your day, which can help set a positive tone and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nRemember to be flexible and adjust the schedule as needed. If you need a few extra minutes of sleep or have an unexpected commitment, don't stress about it. Just try to prioritize your meditation and yoga practice as much as possible.\n\nAlso, don't forget to leave some buffer time in your schedule for any unexpected things that might come up. You might want to consider adding a 10-15 minute buffer between your yoga routine and getting ready for the day, just in case you need a little extra time to get ready.\n\nHow does this schedule look to you?"
