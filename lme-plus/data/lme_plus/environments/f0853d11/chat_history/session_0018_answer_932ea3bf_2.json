      "content": "Oxybenzone and octinoxate are two common chemical active ingredients found in many chemical-based sunscreens. While they're effective at protecting human skin from UV rays, they've been shown to have devastating effects on coral reefs and marine life.\n\n**Oxybenzone:**\n\n* Oxybenzone is a benzophenone-type chemical that's commonly used in sunscreens, skincare products, and hair care products.\n* It's been found to cause coral bleaching, which is when corals expel their algal symbionts, turning white and often leading to their death.\n* Oxybenzone can also damage coral DNA, making it difficult for them to recover from bleaching events.\n* In addition to coral, oxybenzone has been shown to harm other marine life, including sea urchins, fish, and mussels.\n\n**Octinoxate:**\n\n* Octinoxate is another common chemical active ingredient in sunscreens, often used in combination with oxybenzone.\n* It's been found to cause coral bleaching and can also induce coral larvae to encyst, making it difficult for them to settle and form new colonies.\n* Octinoxate has also been shown to affect the development and growth of sea anemones, a crucial component of coral reef ecosystems.\n\n**How do oxybenzone and octinoxate affect coral reefs?**\n\n* When swimmers wear sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate, these chemicals can wash off their skin and into the water, particularly in areas with high tourist activity.\n* These chemicals can then accumulate in the water and sediment, causing harm to coral reefs and other marine life.\n* Coral reefs are already facing numerous threats, including climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. The presence of oxybenzone and octinoxate can further exacerbate these issues, making it even more challenging for coral reefs to recover.\n\n**What can you do to help?**\n\n* Choose mineral-based sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which are generally considered safer for coral reefs.\n* Opt for reef-safe sunscreens that are specifically labeled as \"non-toxic\" or \"reef-friendly.\"\n* Apply sunscreen responsibly: use it in moderation, and reapply after swimming or sweating.\n* Consider wearing protective clothing, such as swim shirts or hats, to reduce your need for sunscreen.\n* Support organizations working to protect coral reefs and promote sustainable tourism practices.\n\nIn 2018, Hawaii became the first state to ban the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate, effective January 2021. This move aims to protect the state's coral reefs and marine ecosystems. Other destinations, like the U.S. Virgin Islands, are also considering similar bans.\n\nRemember, every small action counts in protecting our ocean's delicate ecosystems. By making informed choices, we can help preserve the beauty and biodiversity of coral reefs for future generations.",
