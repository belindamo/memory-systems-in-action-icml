  "content": "Process:\nIn a computer system, a process is an instance of a running program. It is an executing instance of a program that has a unique process identifier (PID), a current state (running, waiting, or terminated), and an execution context that includes the contents of the program counter and registers.\n\nDifferences between Process and Program:\nProgram and process are two different concepts in computer science. A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that performs a specific task. On the other hand, a process is an instance of a running program. Here are some key differences between the two:\n\n1. A program is a set of instructions that are stored on disk, while a process is a running instance of a program in memory.\n2. A program can be considered as a passive entity, while a process is an active entity.\n3. A program can exist without being executed, but a process cannot exist without being executed.\n\nLife Cycle of a Process:\nThe life cycle of a process refers to the various stages that a process goes through during its lifetime. These stages include:\n\n1. New: In this stage, a process is created and initialized, and the necessary resources are allocated.\n2. Ready: In this stage, a process is waiting to be assigned to a processor for execution.\n3. Running: In this stage, a process is assigned to a processor and is executing.\n4. Blocked: In this stage, a process is waiting for some event to occur, such as the completion of an I/O operation.\n5. Terminated: In this stage, a process has completed its execution and is terminated. The operating system then frees up the resources that were allocated to the process.\n\nDuring the life cycle of a process, the process may transition from one state to another depending on the various events that occur. For example, a process that is running may be blocked if it requires an I/O operation to complete, and it will transition back to the running state once the I/O operation has completed.\n\nOverall, the life cycle of a process is an important concept in operating systems, as it helps to manage the execution of processes and ensure that they have access to the necessary resources during their lifetime.",
