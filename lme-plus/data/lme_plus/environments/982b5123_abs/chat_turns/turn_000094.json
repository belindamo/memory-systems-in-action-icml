  "content": "You're a fan of their dreamy soundscapes and Heather's unique vocals! \"My Mind Makes Noises\" is a great album, and it's wonderful that you're obsessed with it.\n\nAs for Pale Waves' tour plans, they do have some festival appearances lined up, but I couldn't find any confirmations for Chicago music festivals this summer. However, it's always possible that they might announce additional dates or festivals in the coming weeks.\n\nKeep an eye on Pale Waves' social media accounts and website for tour updates. You can also sign up for their newsletter or follow local music promoters and festival organizers in Chicago to stay informed about potential shows or festival additions.\n\nIn the meantime, you might want to explore other indie-pop and dream-pop acts that share similarities with Pale Waves. Some recommendations include:\n\n1. The 1975 - As I mentioned earlier, they're a great influence on Pale Waves' sound.\n2. Billie Eilish - While not exactly similar, Billie's atmospheric and introspective sound might appeal to Pale Waves fans.\n3. The Japanese House - Amber Bain's dreamy, electro-pop project often explores themes of love and relationships.\n4. MUNA - This LA-based trio creates atmospheric, synth-heavy indie-pop with introspective lyrics.\n5. Hatchie - Harriette Pilbeam's dream-pop project is perfect for fans of lush, atmospheric soundscapes and catchy hooks.\n\nThese artists might help you discover new music and satisfy your cravings until Pale Waves announces a Chicago show.\n\nWhat do you think about these recommendations?",
