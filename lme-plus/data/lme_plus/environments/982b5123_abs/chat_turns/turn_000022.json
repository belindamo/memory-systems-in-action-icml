Having plenty of trash bags and recycling bins on hand will ensure that you don't run out during the party.\n\nAssigning volunteers to monitor the stations is a fantastic idea. They can help keep the area clean, make sure the bins don't get too full, and encourage guests to recycle and dispose of their trash properly.\n\nReminding your guests to recycle and dispose of their trash properly is also a great idea. You could even consider adding a few signs around the party area to remind them to \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle\" and to \"Keep the Party Green\".\n\nHere are a few more ideas to consider to make your party even more eco-friendly:\n\n* **Use reusable utensils and plates**: Instead of using disposable utensils and plates, consider using reusable ones. This will reduce the amount of waste generated during the party.\n* **Choose eco-friendly decorations**: Opt for decorations that are made from recycled materials or can be reused. You could also use natural elements like flowers, branches, or leaves to create a beautiful and eco-friendly decor.\n* **Encourage carpooling**: Encourage your guests to carpool or use public transportation to reduce the carbon footprint of the party.\n\nBy implementing these ideas, you'll not only have a fun and memorable party, but you'll also be doing your part to reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of the event.\n\nNow, let's talk about the playlist. Have you thought about the type of music you want to play during the party? Do you have a playlist ready, or do you need some suggestions?",
