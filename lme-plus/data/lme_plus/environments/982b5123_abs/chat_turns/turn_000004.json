  "content": "When a page fault occurs in a computer system, the operating system takes the following steps to handle it:\n\n1. The processor generates a page fault interrupt, which transfers control to the operating system.\n2. The operating system checks the page fault address to determine the location of the page that caused the fault.\n3. The operating system checks if the page is in memory or not. If the page is not in memory, it initiates a page replacement algorithm to make room for the page.\n4. The operating system identifies a victim page that is to be replaced and writes it back to the disk if it has been modified.\n5. The page is read from the disk and loaded into the main memory.\n6. The page table is updated to reflect the new location of the page in memory.\n7. The processor is restarted at the point where it was interrupted, and the instruction causing the page fault is executed again.\n8. If the page fault was caused by a protection violation, the operating system terminates the process or raises a signal to the process.\n9. If the page fault was caused by a stack overflow, the operating system grows the stack and restarts the instruction causing the page fault.\n\nThese steps ensure that the required page is loaded into memory and the process can continue executing without any interruption. The page fault handling mechanism is an essential part of virtual memory management, which enables a computer system to run larger applications than the available physical memory size.",
