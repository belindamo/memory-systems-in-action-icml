  "content": "I'm excited to try out these tips and drills to improve my forehand serve. I think I'll start with the wall drill to focus on keeping my racket face closed and using my wrist snap to generate power. I'll also try to practice my serve in slow motion to develop control and consistency. One question I have is, how often should I practice my serve to see significant improvement? Should I practice my serve every day or a few times a week?",
