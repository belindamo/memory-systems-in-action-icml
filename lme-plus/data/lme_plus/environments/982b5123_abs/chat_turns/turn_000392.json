Shinkansen trains connect major cities like Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Hiroshima, with speeds reaching up to 320 km/h (200 mph).\n\n* **Types of Shinkansen trains:**\n\t+ **Nozomi ()**: The fastest Shinkansen, stopping at only major stations.\n\t+ **Mizuho ()**: Similar to Nozomi, but with fewer stops.\n\t+ **Hikari ()**: Slower than Nozomi and Mizuho, but still very fast, with more stops.\n\t+ **Kodama ()**: The slowest Shinkansen, stopping at all stations.\n\n**Limited Express trains ()**: These trains are faster than regular express trains and often have reserved seating. They connect cities and regions, with some routes featuring scenic views.\n\n* **Types of Limited Express trains:**\n\t+ **Wide View ()**: Trains with larger windows for scenic routes, like the Wide View Hida and Wide View Shinano.\n\t+ **Sleeping cars ()**: Overnight trains with berths, like the Twilight Express and Hokutosei.\n\t+ **Luxury trains ()**: High-end trains with premium amenities, like the Shiki-shima and Seven Stars.\n\n**Express trains ()**: These trains are slower than Limited Express trains, with more stops, but still faster than local trains.\n\n* **Types of Express trains:**\n\t+ **Rapid ()**: Faster than local trains, with fewer stops.\n\t+ **Local ()**: Stop at every station, often used for short distances.\n\n**Other trains:**\n\n* **Suburban trains ()**: Commuter trains for short distances, often with frequent stops.\n* **Private railways ()**: Non-JR trains, like Tokyo's subway system, which require separate tickets or passes.\n\nWith your JR Pass, you'll have access to most JR trains, including Shinkansen, Limited Express, and Express trains. However, some private railways and luxury trains might require additional fees or separate tickets.\n\nWhen using your JR Pass, keep in mind:\n\n* **Reservations**: Some trains, like the Shinkansen and Limited Express, require seat reservations, which can be made at train stations or online.\n* **Non-reserved seats**: Some trains have non-reserved seats, which are available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n* **Peak seasons**: Trains can be very busy during peak seasons, like cherry blossom season, Golden Week, or Obon.\n\nNow that you know the different types of trains in Japan, you can plan your journey with confidence!",
