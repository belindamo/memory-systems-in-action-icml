However, many athletes are able to find ways to make it work by prioritizing and maximizing their time. Here are a few ways that athletes can balance their philanthropic efforts with their career:\n\n1. Incorporating their efforts into their business interests: Many athletes have started their own charitable organizations or business ventures that allow them to give back while also pursuing their career goals. For example, a baseball player might start a foundation that supports youth sports programs, or invest in a business that provides job training opportunities in underserved communities.\n\n2. Prioritizing their time: Athletes often have busy schedules during the season, but many of them still find time to give back in their communities. They may schedule their philanthropic efforts during the offseason or on days off during the season. Additionally, some athletes make time for their charitable efforts by getting up early or staying up late to work on their projects.\n\n3. Partnering with other organizations: Many athletes partner with existing charitable organizations to support their causes. This allows them to leverage the resources and expertise of these organizations to make a bigger impact in their communities. For example, a baseball player might partner with a local Boys and Girls Club to support their youth programs.\n\nOverall, it takes dedication, time management skills, and a passion for making a difference to balance philanthropic efforts with a baseball career, but many athletes find it to be rewarding and fulfilling work.",
