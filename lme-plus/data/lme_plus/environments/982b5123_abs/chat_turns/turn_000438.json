  "content": "Hi everyone! I'm Little J and I'm playing Michelle Obama for Black History Month. Today, I want to tell you all about this amazing woman who was born in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nMichelle grew up with her parents and older brother Craig. Her parents were both hard workers and encouraged Michelle to always do her best. She went to a good school and was very smart. Michelle loved to play sports, especially basketball and she was very good at it too!\n\nMichelle grew up to become one of the most important people in our country. She is most known for being the First Lady of the United States when her husband Barack Obama was the President. Michelle traveled all around the world, speaking to people and helping them. She wrote a book about her life and encouraged people to live healthy and active lives. Michelle made a big impact on the country and she is loved by many people.\n\nBut did you know that Michelle is also a funny person? She likes to tell jokes and make people laugh. She's also a big music lover and loves to dance. Michelle is not just a serious person, she knows how to have fun too!\n\nMichelle Obama is such an important and amazing person, and I'm so lucky to be able to play her for Black History Month. She has made a big impact on our country and she is loved by many people. I hope that when I grow up, I can be like Michelle and make a difference in the world. Thank you for listening to my speech about Michelle Obama!",
