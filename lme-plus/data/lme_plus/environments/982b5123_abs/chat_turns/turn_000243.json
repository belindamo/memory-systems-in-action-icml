  "content": "Yes, there is already a growing emphasis on well-being and happiness in policy-making at both the national and international levels. For example, the United Nations has recognized the importance of well-being in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that focus on improving people's lives in a holistic and sustainable manner.\n\nAt the national level, several countries have introduced well-being budgets or well-being indices, which seek to incorporate well-being metrics in policy-making. The objective of such initiatives is to build policies that not only promote economic growth but also consider individuals' well-being, social goals, and environmental sustainability.\n\nOverall, as we recognize the limitations of existing measures of progress like GDP, there is likely to be more emphasis on happiness and well-being in policy-making in the future. It reflects a shift in focus towards more people-centered, holistic policies that address the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of development for more sustainable and equitable outcomes.",
