  "content": "It seems like the problem is that the original date string in cell B2 is in GMT-4, but the formula is treating it as GMT. To convert it to GMT-5, you can use the following formula:\n```scss\n=TEXT((B2-(4/24)-(5/24)),\"MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss AM/PM\")\n```\nThis formula will subtract 4 hours (to account for the GMT-4 time zone) and then another 5 hours (to convert to GMT-5) from the date and time in cell B2. Place this formula in a new cell, and the result should be:\n```\n01/17/2023 12:26:31 PM\n```\nThis result is the date and time from cell B2, converted to GMT-5 and kept in the format `MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss AM/PM`.",
