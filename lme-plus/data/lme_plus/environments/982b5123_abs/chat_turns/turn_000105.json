I think one area I'd like to focus on is my forehand serve, as I feel like I'm not getting enough power and consistency on that particular serve. I've noticed that when I'm serving with my forehand, my racket face tends to open up too much, which results in a softer serve. Do you have any specific tips or drills to help me improve my forehand serve?",
