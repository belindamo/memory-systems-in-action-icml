I'm also curious about the dream journal idea, I'll try to keep track of my dreams for a week or two to see if I notice any patterns. By the way, I've been going to bed pretty late lately, usually between 12:30 am to 1:30 am, do you think that could be affecting my sleep quality and dreams as well?",
