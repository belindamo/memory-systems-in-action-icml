Attending training sessions twice a week for the next month will definitely help you build consistency and see significant progress in your net shots and returns.\n\nSince you're committed to improving, I'd like to add a few more drills to help you reinforce your training sessions with Coach Mark:\n\n**Additional Drills:**\n\n1. **Net Shot Accuracy Drill:** Set up a series of small targets at the net, such as empty water bottles or small cones. Practice hitting net shots to aim for these targets, focusing on accuracy and control.\n2. **Return of Serve Drill with Movement:** Practice returning serves while moving forward, backward, and laterally. This will help you develop your footwork and reaction time.\n3. **Game-Like Scenario Drill:** Practice game-like scenarios with your partner, such as playing out a rally from the net, returning a serve, and then playing a shot to the back of the court. This will help you develop your decision-making and shot selection.\n\n**Tips to Maximize Your Training Sessions:**\n\n1. **Focus on Quality Over Quantity:** Instead of trying to hit as many shots as possible, focus on making each shot count. Take your time, and aim for quality over quantity.\n2. **Listen to Coach Mark's Feedback:** Pay attention to Coach Mark's feedback and adjust your technique accordingly. Ask questions if you're unsure about any aspect of your game.\n3. **Video Record Yourself:** Record your training sessions to analyze your technique, identify areas for improvement, and track your progress over time.\n4. **Stay Consistent:** Attend your training sessions regularly, and make sure to practice outside of the sessions as well. Consistency is key to improving your game.\n\nRemember to stay positive, persistent, and patient with your progress. It's great that you're taking proactive steps to improve your game, and with dedication and hard work, you'll see significant improvements in your net shots and returns.\n\nHow do you feel about the training sessions with Coach Mark?
