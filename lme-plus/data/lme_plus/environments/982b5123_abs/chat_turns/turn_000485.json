  "content": "That sounds great! I'm really excited to explore the Bay Area. By the way, speaking of road trips, I recall that about six weeks ago, I drove to my sister's place, which is about 2 hours away from my hometown, to help her move into her new apartment. We spent the entire day packing and unpacking boxes, and in the evening, we ordered pizza and watched a movie together. I remember that I had to take a detour on my way back due to a road closure caused by a landslide. Do you have any tips on how to prepare for road closures or unexpected detours during a road trip?",
