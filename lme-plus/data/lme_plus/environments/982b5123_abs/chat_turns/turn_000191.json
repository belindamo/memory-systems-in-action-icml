Monitoring your hashtag performance is also a great way to identify which hashtags are driving the most engagement and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\nFor LinkedIn, using LinkedIn Insights will provide you with valuable data on post views, engagement rate, and click-through rate, which will help you understand how your content is resonating with your audience. Tracking your follower growth rate and post shares will also give you insights into how your content is being shared and whether it's driving engagement.\n\nUsing a third-party software like Hootsuite is also a great way to streamline your content calendar and ensure consistency across both platforms. It's also helpful for tracking your performance across multiple platforms in one place.\n\nIt's great to hear that you'll be tracking lead generation, conversion rate, and return on ad spend (ROAS) to measure the success of your campaign. These metrics will give you a clear understanding of whether your social media efforts are driving tangible results for your business.\n\nRemember to also track your campaign's performance over time, and make adjustments to your strategy based on the data. It's also important to set clear goals and objectives for your campaign, so you can measure success and make data-driven decisions.\n\nHow often do you plan to review and analyze your social media performance, and what adjustments do you plan to make to your strategy based on the data?",
