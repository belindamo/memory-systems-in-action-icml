  "content": "Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin have a long history of collaboration, and they've worked on several projects together beyond \"The Prom.\" Here are a few notable examples:\n\n1. **The Wedding Singer** (2006) - This musical comedy, based on the Adam Sandler movie, was their first major collaboration. Sklar wrote the music, and Beguelin wrote the book and lyrics. The show premiered on Broadway in 2006 and received several Tony Award nominations.\n2. **Elf: The Musical** (2010) - Sklar and Beguelin teamed up again to create the music and lyrics for this holiday musical, based on the Will Ferrell movie. The show premiered on Broadway in 2010 and has since become a seasonal favorite.\n3. **Aladdin** (2011) - Beguelin wrote the book and lyrics for this Disney musical, with music by Alan Menken. Sklar served as the music supervisor and orchestrator. The show premiered in Seattle in 2011 and later opened on Broadway in 2014.\n4. **The Rhythm Club** (2013) - Sklar and Beguelin collaborated on this musical, set in the 1930s, about a group of young musicians trying to make it big in New York City. The show premiered at the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut.\n\nWhile they haven't worked on any other projects together recently, both Sklar and Beguelin have continued to pursue individual projects in the world of musical theater.\n\nIt's great to hear that you're enjoying show tunes, including \"Hamilton\" and \"Dear Evan Hansen\"! Lin-Manuel Miranda and Benj Pasek & Justin Paul are indeed masters of their craft, and their work has helped to shape the modern musical theater landscape.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more show tunes, I'd recommend checking out some other contemporary musicals like \"In the Heights,\" \"Be More Chill,\" or \"Hadestown.\" Let me know if you need more recommendations or have any other questions!",
