I've been working as a marketing specialist at a tech startup for the past 8 months, and I've noticed that our audience is most active on Twitter during lunch breaks and after work.

Thanks for the guidance! \n\nNow, I'm curious about how to measure the success of my social media campaign. Can you walk me through some key metrics I should track to determine if my campaign is performing well?",
