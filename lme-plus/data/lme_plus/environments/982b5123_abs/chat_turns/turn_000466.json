The prices are:\n\t* Oroweat 100% Whole Wheat Bread (24 slices): $2.99\n\t* Safeway Kitchens 100% Whole Wheat Bread (24 slices): $2.49 (same price you mentioned)\n\t* Dave's Killer Bread 100% Whole Wheat Bread (24 slices): $3.49\n2. **Trader Joe's**: Trader Joe's has a private-label 100% whole wheat bread option:\n\t* Trader Joe's 100% Whole Wheat Bread (24 slices): $2.49 (same price you mentioned)\n3. **Target**: Target has a few options for 100% whole wheat bread:\n\t* Market Pantry 100% Whole Wheat Bread (24 slices): $2.49 (same price you mentioned)\n\t* Nature's Own 100% Whole Wheat Bread (24 slices): $2.99\n\t* Dave's Killer Bread 100% Whole Wheat Bread (24 slices): $3.49\n\nIt looks like all three stores have the same price point of $2.49 for their store-brand or private-label 100% whole wheat bread options. If you're looking for a better deal, you might consider shopping during sales or using digital coupons (if available). However, it seems like $2.49 is the standard price for a 24-slice loaf of 100% whole wheat bread in your area.\n\nIf you'd like to explore other options or consider shopping at different stores, feel free to let me know!",
