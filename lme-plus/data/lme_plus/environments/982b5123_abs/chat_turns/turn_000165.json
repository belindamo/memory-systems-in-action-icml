  "content": "For a time series analysis and a choropleth map, you have several Python libraries to choose from, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Here's a brief rundown to help you decide:\n\n**Matplotlib and Seaborn:**\n\n* **Pros:**\n\t+ Well-established and widely used libraries\n\t+ Great for creating static visualizations\n\t+ Easy to customize and fine-tune\n* **Cons:**\n\t+ Not ideal for interactive visualizations\n\t+ Can be verbose and require more code\n\nMatplotlib is a great choice for creating static visualizations, and Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib, providing a higher-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics. If you're comfortable with Matplotlib and want to create static visualizations, you can use Seaborn's `lineplot` function for the time series analysis and `heatmap` function for the choropleth map.\n\n**Plotly and Bokeh:**\n\n* **Pros:**\n\t+ Ideal for interactive visualizations\n\t+ Easy to create interactive dashboards and reports\n\t+ Can be used for web-based applications\n* **Cons:**\n\t+ Steeper learning curve compared to Matplotlib and Seaborn\n\t+ Can be slower for large datasets\n\nPlotly and Bokeh are both well-suited for interactive visualizations and can be used to create web-based applications. Plotly is known for its ease of use and has a wide range of visualization options, while Bokeh provides a more extensive set of tools for building custom dashboards.\n\nFor your specific use case, I'd recommend using Plotly for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Interactive visualization**: Plotly's interactive visualizations will allow users to zoom in, hover over data points, and explore the data in more detail.\n2. **Ease of use**: Plotly has a relatively low barrier to entry, and its API is easy to learn, even for those without extensive experience with interactive visualizations.\n3. **Built-in support for choropleth maps**: Plotly has built-in support for choropleth maps, making it easy to create an interactive map to show the number of cases by country.\n\nIf you're new to Plotly, you can start by using its `line` function for the time series analysis and `choropleth` function for the choropleth map. Plotly also has an extensive gallery of examples and a comprehensive documentation to help you get started.\n\nUltimately, the choice of library depends on your personal preference, the complexity of your project, and the level of interactivity you want to achieve. If you're comfortable with Matplotlib and Seaborn, you can still use them to create static visualizations. However, if you want to create interactive visualizations, Plotly or Bokeh might be a better fit.",
