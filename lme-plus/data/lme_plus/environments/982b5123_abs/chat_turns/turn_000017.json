  "content": "I'm thinking of having a classic BBQ menu with burgers, hot dogs, and sides like coleslaw and baked beans. I might also have a few veggie options like grilled vegetables and a salad bar. For activities, I was thinking of setting up a few lawn games like cornhole and giant Jenga, and maybe even having a playlist with some fun summer tunes. I also want to have a little area for the kids with some outdoor toys and games.",
