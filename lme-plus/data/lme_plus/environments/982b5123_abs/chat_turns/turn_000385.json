  "content": "I'm planning a trip to Japan in March for the Cherry Blossom season and I'm trying to finalize my accommodations.

By the way, I was just thinking that if I were to drive from LA to Santa Barbara, it'd take around 2.5 hours, which is pretty reasonable considering the average speed of a car on a highway is around 40 miles per hour.",
