  "content": "I'm thrilled to hear that! \"The Alice Network\" is an excellent choice to follow up \"The Silent Patient\". Both books share some similarities, such as strong female characters, intricate plots, and a blend of psychological suspense and historical elements.\n\nKate Quinn's writing is indeed exceptional, and she's masterful at crafting complex, relatable characters. Charlie and Eve are both fascinating and flawed, and their stories will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nAs you read \"The Alice Network\", you'll notice that Quinn's writing style is quite different from Alex Michaelides'. While \"The Silent Patient\" is more of a psychological thriller with a strong focus on the mystery, \"The Alice Network\" is a historical fiction novel with thriller elements. Quinn's writing is more descriptive, and she takes her time to build the atmosphere and setting, which is perfect for a historical novel.\n\nOne thing you might appreciate is that both books feature strong, independent women who drive the story forward. Alicia in \"The Silent Patient\" and Charlie and Eve in \"The Alice Network\" are all complex, multi-dimensional characters who are not afraid to take risks and challenge the status quo.\n\nI'm excited to hear your thoughts on \"The Alice Network\" once you've finished reading it! Do you think you'll be reading more historical fiction or psychological thrillers in the future?",
