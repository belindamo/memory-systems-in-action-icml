Shinjuku is a bustling business district with plenty of restaurants, bars, and entertainment options, while Harajuku is known for its fashion, shopping, and youth culture.\n\nConsidering your budget, the hostel in Shinjuku for $30 a night seems like a great deal. You'll be in the heart of the city, with easy access to Shinjuku Station, which is a major transportation hub. However, keep in mind that hostels can be quite basic, and you might be sharing a room with other travelers.\n\nThe Airbnb in Harajuku for $50 a night might offer more comfort and privacy, but it's significantly more expensive. Harajuku is a fantastic area, but it's a bit more touristy than Shinjuku, and you might find it more crowded and noisy.\n\nHere are some questions to consider:\n\n* Are you looking for a more social atmosphere, or do you prefer a quieter, more private space?\n* Are you willing to sacrifice some comfort and amenities for a lower price?\n* How important is location to you? Do you want to be in the heart of the action, or are you okay with a short commute?\n\nAs for your LA to Santa Barbara drive, I think there might be a small mistake in your calculation. The average speed on a highway is usually around 65-70 mph (105-113 km/h), not 40 mph. According to Google Maps, the drive from LA to Santa Barbara typically takes around 2-3 hours, depending on traffic.\n\nBut let's focus on your Japan trip for now! Which option do you think you're leaning towards, and what are your priorities for your accommodations?",
