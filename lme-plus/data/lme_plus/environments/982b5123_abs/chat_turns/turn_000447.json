  "content": "I've already booked a viewing for the flat in Marchmont, and I'm planning to ask the landlord about the internet and utility costs, as well as the condition of the furniture and appliances. I've also been in touch with my flatmates through a WhatsApp group, and we've been discussing things like kitchen appliances and social events. One of my flatmates, Rachel, suggested that we plan a flat-warming party for the weekend of August 20th, which sounds like a great idea. Do you have any advice on how to make the party a success?",
