  "content": "The hostel in Shinjuku is a great option, and you're right to consider the noise level. While Shinjuku is a bustling area, there are some quieter pockets and hostels that might suit your needs.\n\nShinjuku is a large ward, and the noise level can vary depending on the specific location. Here are some tips to help you find a quieter hostel in Shinjuku:\n\n1. **Look for hostels in the north or west parts of Shinjuku**: These areas are generally quieter than the southern part, which is closer to Shinjuku Station and the busiest streets. Neighborhoods like Yoyogi-Uehara, Okubo, or Takadanobaba might offer a more peaceful atmosphere.\n2. **Check the hostel's location and reviews**: Research the hostel's exact location and read reviews from previous guests. Look for comments about the noise level, and see if the hostel has any soundproofing or quiet hours.\n3. **Opt for a hostel with a higher floor**: If you're concerned about street noise, consider a hostel with rooms on higher floors (5th floor or above). This can help reduce the noise level.\n4. **Search for hostels with a \"quiet\" or \"relaxing\" atmosphere**: Some hostels specifically market themselves as peaceful or quiet, so keep an eye out for these keywords in the description.\n\nHere are a few Shinjuku hostels that might fit the bill:\n\n* **Nui.Tokyo Central Hostel**: Located in the Yoyogi-Uehara area, this hostel is known for its peaceful atmosphere and has a quiet policy after 10 PM.\n* **Book and Bed Tokyo**: This hostel is in the Takadanobaba area and has a more laid-back vibe. They also have a quiet time from 10 PM to 8 AM.\n* **Shinjuku Guest House**: This guesthouse is in the Okubo area and is known for its cozy atmosphere. They have a quiet policy from 10 PM to 8 AM.\n\nKeep in mind that Shinjuku is still a bustling area, and you might hear some noise, especially if you're a light sleeper. However, these hostels might offer a more peaceful experience than others in the area.\n\nRemember to always research and read reviews before making a final decision. If you're still unsure, you could consider booking a hostel with a free cancellation policy or a short-term booking to test the waters before committing to a longer stay.",
