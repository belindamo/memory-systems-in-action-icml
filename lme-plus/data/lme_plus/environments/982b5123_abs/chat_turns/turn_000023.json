  "content": "I've been thinking about the playlist, and I want it to be a mix of upbeat summer tunes that will get people in the mood for a fun day outdoors. I was thinking of including some classic summer jams, like beach music and reggae, as well as some more modern pop and rock songs. I want the playlist to be energetic and lively, but also laid-back and relaxing.\n\nI've started making a playlist, but I'm open to suggestions. Do you have any ideas for summer songs that would be perfect for a BBQ?",
