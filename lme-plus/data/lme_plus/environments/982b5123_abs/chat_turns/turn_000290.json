  "content": "The epoch time of January 1, 1970, is widely used as a reference point for computing time in modern computer systems. However, in the Microsoft Excel program, the default reference point for computing time is December 30, 1899, which is why the number of seconds is calculated relative to this date instead of January 1, 1970.\n\nBoth reference points have been widely used in different computing systems, and the choice of which to use depends on the particular requirements and constraints of the system in question. In the case of Microsoft Excel, the use of December 30, 1899, as the reference point allows for dates to be represented as simple serial numbers, which can make certain date-related calculations and operations easier to perform.",
