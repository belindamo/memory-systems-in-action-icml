      "content": "here is some additinal background information on the parent company to consider : The \u201cAcadian Advantage\u201d is about building differently \u2013 it combines industry-leading processes and a clear commitment to ensuring the project is delivered on time, on budget and of superior quality.\n\nEvery project we undertake is backed by strict project management processes \u2013 processes that ensure our project team can deliver the best client experience every single time. We begin by creating an Accurate Master Schedule where communication with our client and teams on the ground is key to ensure all deliverables are preplanned. As a company, we believe in sharing best practices between our site and planning teams in order to deliver new and innovative solutions to your build. We also build in the schedule change orders options and timelines to ensure both the client and our teams are aware of the impacts these can have on the Master Schedule and final building delivery and commissioning.\n\nWe believe the key ingredient of the Acadian Advantage is preplanning and communication. These are reflected in a series of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for each of the processes (both project and client management) required to deliver successful projects. These SOPs limit the bottlenecks that can impact the Master Schedule during the construction process.\n\nHow we deliver the Acadian Advantage for our clients\nACADIAN\\_Advantage+icons.jpg\nTime\nACADIAN\\_Advantage+icons.jpg\nCost\nACADIAN\\_Advantage+icons.jpg\nQuality\nACADIAN\\_Advantage+icons.jpg\nScope\nACADIAN\\_Advantage+icons.jpg\nSafety\nTime\nWe implement Daily Huddles to manage daily work with trades and set milestones for those specific days and we involve all parties in scheduling to provide consistency across the project.\n\nCost\nWe show the impact of proper planning with suppliers and trades to ensure everyone is effective at delivering each project.\n\nQuality\nWe set the expectations right from the start with each stakeholder by asking this key question: Would you accept this in your own house? We produce mock-ups to get approval and quality and we also include rigorous QA, QC inspections. \n\nScope\nWe set out clear expectations from the start. We ensure these are clear and written down for each stakeholder \u2013 what\u2019s included and what\u2019s excluded - and we review resource sharing to provide consistency.\n\nSafety\nSafety on our build sites is our top priority. To achieve compliance, we make safety personal to each on-site worker. We make front-end paperwork and proper workflow readily available and use daily housekeeping practices to make each site as safe as possible. It\u2019s all about consistency and our company culture.\n\nThroughout the entirety of any project, our project manager will provide continuous communication and reporting to the client. Communications will occur in person, on phone/conference calls, in emails, and in written form. Our project manager will also ensure there is open and constant communication with all stakeholders to ensure understanding of timing, deliverables and ensuring our team is meeting all expectations."
