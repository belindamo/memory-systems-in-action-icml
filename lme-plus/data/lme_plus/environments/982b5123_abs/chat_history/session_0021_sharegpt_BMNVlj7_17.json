As someone who shares your values of customer obsession, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking, I know I would thrive in this role and make a positive contribution to your team. Plus, I'm always down for a good joke (or two).\n\nI have over 7-10 years of experience in senior technical leader positions within the Energy and Utilities industry, and I think my skills and experience make me a great fit for this role. I have a strong technical foundation in enterprise IT, with expertise in database systems, tiered storage architectures, virtualization, data center operations, and network security. I also have a deep understanding of the Energy and Utilities industry, including relevant applications, platforms, and data ecosystems.\n\nOne of the things that I'm most passionate about is using technology to make a positive impact on the world. I'm excited about the chance to join a company that is not only committed to being Earth's most customer-centric and safest place to work, but also to being Earth's best employer. I think my technical skills and industry knowledge, combined with my passion for using technology to make a difference, would enable me to understand customer needs and present the technical benefits of AWS solutions in a way that really resonates.\n\nIn addition to my technical skills, I have strong leadership and communication skills,"
