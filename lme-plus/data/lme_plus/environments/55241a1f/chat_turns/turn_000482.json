Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and put it in a saucepan with 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender.\n\n2. While the rice is cooking, heat the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside to cool.\n\n3. When the rice is done, transfer it to a large bowl and add the rice vinegar mixture. Stir well to combine, then let the rice cool to room temperature.\n\n4. Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Slice the avocado into thin strips.\n\n5. Lay a sheet of nori seaweed onto a sushi mat or a clean kitchen towel.\n\n6.
