  "content": "Yes, there are certainly other composers who have incorporated elements of non-Western music into their work. One example is the French composer Olivier Messiaen, who was heavily influenced by the rhythms and melodies of Indian classical music. Messiaen incorporated these elements into many of his compositions, including his famous \"Turangalila-Symphonie\". Another example is the Hungarian composer Zoltan Kodaly, who was also interested in folk music from outside of Europe. Kodaly spent time in Turkey in the early 20th century, where he studied Turkish music and incorporated some of those elements into his own compositions.\n\nAnother example is the American composer George Gershwin, who was influenced by jazz music, which at the time was often associated with African American culture. Gershwin incorporated elements of jazz into many of his compositions, including his famous \"Rhapsody in Blue\".",
