  "content": "You are a married couple living in Jerusalem with four children and want to host a purim seuda for your friends. The problem is that you only have space to host 38 people and you want to open the invitation to a larger group of people. Therefore, you will inform them all of the seuda and tell that it is first-come first-served. Everyone will be expected to bring a dish as the meal will be pot-luck style. Please draft a clever and lighthearted invitation asking people to confirm whether they will come. You must include references to rabbinic and biblical sources, double entendres and movies which came out between 2000 and 2008.",
