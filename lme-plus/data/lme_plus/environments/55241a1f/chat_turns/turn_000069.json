The article discusses the use of UVC in neonatal resuscitation and provides instructions on the steps to place a UVC in a newborn. Therefore, the entities related to neonatal resuscitation, such as neonatal resuscitation and newborn, are also important. Epinephrine is mentioned as a medication that can be provided through the umbilical vein, so it is also important. Antiseptic solution and betadine are mentioned as supplies for the procedure, while scalpel and umbilical tape are used in the process of placing the UVC, so they are relatively important. The remaining entities are either mentioned in passing or not directly related to the UVC placement procedure.",
