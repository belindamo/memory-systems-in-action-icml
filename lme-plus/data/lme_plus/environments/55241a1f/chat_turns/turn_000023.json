Wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes and clothing that can get dirty. Glassybaby will provide all necessary equipment and materials, but feel free to bring your own glassblowing tools if you have them.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time in your Introduction to Glassblowing class this Saturday!",
