  "content": "Are there any similarities and differences between the composition styles of Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev, other than the composers belonging to different time periods? I was listening to Romeo and Juliet the other day, and it sounded quite Tchaikvosky for some reason, although the harmony especially chords were much more modern than Tchaikovsky. They both wrote ballet music on love stories, especially fairy tales. Prokofiev's Cinderella also shares strange resemblances with Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty, but my music theory isn't good so I can't think of anything precise to say.",
