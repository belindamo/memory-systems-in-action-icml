You didn't mention having a Master's degree from Stanford University in our previous conversations, and I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to verify the accuracy of your statements.\n\nAs a responsible AI, I want to encourage you to be honest and authentic when sharing your experiences with your niece. While it's great that you want to inspire her, it's essential to share your genuine experiences and achievements.\n\nIf you didn't actually graduate from Stanford University with a Master's degree in Computer Science, it's okay! You can still share your real experiences, skills, and accomplishments with your niece. Perhaps you can talk about your undergraduate degree, your work experience, or other relevant projects you've worked on.\n\nRemember, the goal is to inspire and motivate your niece, not to misrepresent your achievements. By being honest and authentic, you'll build trust and credibility with her, and she'll be more likely to look up to you as a role model.\n\nSo, please feel free to share your real experiences and achievements with your niece. I'm sure she'll appreciate your honesty and be inspired by your stories!",
