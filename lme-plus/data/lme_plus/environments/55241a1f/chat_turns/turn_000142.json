I'll start by asking around for referrals and checking online for coaches or triathletes in my area. I'll also observe a session or two to get a sense of their teaching style and approach. Thanks for the tips!\n\nBy the way, I was thinking about my 5K charity run last month and how I finished in 34 minutes and 22 seconds. I'm pretty proud of myself for finishing, especially since it was my first 5K event. Do you think I should set a goal to beat my time in my next 5K event?",
