Johnson's landmark education reform, providing federal funding to support low-income students.\n\n1972: Title IX - The law provided equal opportunities for girls and women in education programs receiving federal financial assistance.\n\n1980s-1990s: The Standards Movement - The US began to implement higher standards for learning, leading to the creation of standardized testing and curriculum standards.\n\n1990s-2000s: Inclusive Education - This movement focused on providing education to students with disabilities in mainstream classrooms, rather than segregating them into special education classes.\n\n2001: No Child Left Behind - This law required states to administer annual standardized tests and imposed penalties on schools that failed to meet their goals.\n\n2010: Common Core State Standards - The Common Core standards aimed to provide consistent and rigorous expectations for student learning across states.\n\n2015: Every Student Succeeds Act - The ESSA reauthorized the ESEA and shifted much of the responsibility for accountability and school improvement to states and local districts.\n\nOverall, these policy changes reflect an ongoing effort to improve the quality of education and ensure that all students have access to the opportunity to learn and grow.",
