Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Split your workout into muscle groups**: Divide your workout into 2-3 days, targeting different muscle groups each day. This will help you avoid overworking any one group and ensure you're covering all major areas. A common split is:\n\t* Day 1: Chest and Triceps\n\t* Day 2: Back and Biceps\n\t* Day 3: Legs and Shoulders\n2. **Include exercises for each major muscle group**: Make sure to include exercises that target the following muscle groups:\n\t* Chest: bench press, dumbbell press, push-ups\n\t* Back: pull-ups, rows, lat pulldowns\n\t* Shoulders: shoulder press, lateral raises, front raises\n\t* Arms: bicep curls, tricep extensions\n\t* Legs: squats, lunges, leg press\n\t* Core: planks, crunches, Russian twists\n3. **Choose compound exercises**: Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups at once, which can help you save time and increase overall muscle growth. Examples include:\n\t* Squats (legs, glutes, core)\n\t* Deadlifts (legs, back, core)\n\t* Bench press (chest, shoulders, triceps)\n4. **Incorporate a mix of rep ranges**: Vary your rep ranges to target different muscle fibers:\n\t* 3-5 reps for strength and power\n\t* 8-12 reps for hypertrophy (muscle growth)\n\t* 12-15 reps for endurance\n5. **Don't forget to warm up and cool down**: Always warm up with 5-10 minutes of cardio and dynamic stretching to prevent injuries. After your workout, cool down with static stretches to help with recovery.\n6. **Start with a manageable routine and progress gradually**: Don't try to do too much too soon. Start with a routine you can handle, and gradually increase the intensity, weight, or reps as you get stronger.\n\nHere's an example routine to get you started:\n\n**Day 1: Chest and Triceps**\n\n1. Warm-up: 5 minutes on the treadmill\n2. Barbell bench press (3 sets of 8-12 reps)\n3. Incline dumbbell press (3 sets of 10-15 reps)\n4. Tricep pushdowns (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n5. Tricep dips (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n6. Cool-down: 5 minutes of stretching\n\nRemember to adjust the weights, reps, and exercises based on your fitness level and goals. It's also a good idea to consult with a personal trainer or fitness professional if you're new to working out.\n\nYou've got this! Get moving, and have a great workout!",
