  "content": "The \"magic bullet\" is a term used to describe the bullet that is believed by some to have caused multiple non-fatal injuries to President John F. Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally while they were riding in an open car during the 1963 assassination. The bullet, which was later recovered and identified as a 6.5mm bullet of the type used in the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building, is known as the \"magic bullet\" because of the seemingly impossible trajectory that it is said to have taken in order to cause the wounds to both Kennedy and Connally, who were sitting in front of and slightly to the right of Kennedy.\n\nThe Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination, concluded that the bullet that struck Kennedy and Connally was fired from the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and that Lee Harvey Oswald, who was also found to be on the sixth floor at the time of the shooting, was the lone gunman. The commission also concluded that the bullet that struck Kennedy and Connally was the \"magic bullet\" that caused the non-fatal injuries to both men. However, the theory of the \"magic bullet\" has been widely criticized by conspiracy theorists and others who argue that the bullet's trajectory and the wounds it is said to have caused are physically impossible and that there must have been more than one gunman involved in the assassination.",
