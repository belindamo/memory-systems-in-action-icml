Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros of including your undergraduate GPA:**\n\n1. **Demonstrated academic achievement**: A high GPA can indicate to employers that you're a strong student and have a solid academic foundation in your field.\n2. **Relevance to the job**: If the job description specifically mentions a GPA requirement or preference, it's a good idea to include it to show you meet the criteria.\n3. **Recent graduates**: If you're a recent graduate, your GPA might be a more significant factor in your application, as you may not have extensive work experience yet.\n\n**Cons of including your undergraduate GPA:**\n\n1. **Irrlevant to the job**: If the job description doesn't mention GPA, and you have significant work experience, your GPA might not be as relevant to the position.\n2. **Negative impact**: If your GPA is low, it could potentially harm your chances of getting hired, even if you have other strong qualifications.\n3. **Focus on skills and experience**: In the data science field, employers often prioritize skills, experience, and portfolio over academic credentials.\n\nFor data science jobs, it's common to focus on showcasing your technical skills, experience, and achievements rather than your undergraduate GPA. If you have:\n\n* Relevant work experience in data science or a related field\n* A strong portfolio of projects or contributions to open-source projects\n* Proficiency in key data science tools and technologies\n\nYou might consider omitting your undergraduate GPA from your resume. However, if you have a high GPA (e.g., 3.5 or higher) and you're a recent graduate, it might be worth including to demonstrate your academic achievement.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether to include your undergraduate GPA. If you do choose to include it, make sure it's presented in a clear and concise manner, and that it doesn't distract from your more relevant skills and experiences.\n\nDo you have any other questions about preparing your resume or application materials for data science jobs?",
