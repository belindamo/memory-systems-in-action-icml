We aim to solve the problem of seamless cross-border payment for remote workers and employees of blockchain-based companies by offering a platform where employees can create wallets to receive and store funds and where employers can manage their payroll system. We plan to build a platform that will enable users to create wallets, deposit and withdraw funds from their wallets, and bulk payments for employers to pay many workers in one go. We also have a going-to-market plan that will help us grow and scale by onboarding new users to our platform through both online and offline methods that will create awareness about LumenPay and by creating partnerships with SMEs.\n\nMarket Needs:\nThe shift to remote work and the rise of blockchain-based companies have created a need for a payment system that facilitates seamless cross-border payment for employees and remote workers. Traditional payroll systems are often not well-suited to the needs of these workers, who may not have bank accounts or may be located in countries with limited financial infrastructure. LumenPay aims to address these needs by offering a platform that is specifically designed for the payment of employees and freelancers working on the blockchain.\n\nTo research the needs of businesses that pay their employees in cryptocurrency, we conducted interviews or surveys with businesses in the target market and analyzed existing data on their payment practices and challenges. This research identified gaps and pain points in the current market and helped us understand the features and functionality that businesses would value in a payroll platform. Based on this research, we developed the following product roadmap:\n\nProduct Roadmap:\n\n* June-Sep: Research and Development of the LumenPay Platform\n* Oct-Nov: Website landing page, start community development and marketing through social media and direct sales calls\n* June 2022-Sep 2022: Research and development of the LumenPay platform's core features\n* Oct 2022-Dec 2022: MVP (company employee dashboard, add employees to the payroll dashboard, bulk payments to employees at set intervals), anchors (onramping and off ramping with Stellar anchors), beta test and early user onboarding, move to the mainnet and launch an early beta test, start community development and marketing to build the community and user base through social media and direct sales calls, start talking to investors and making partnerships with companies (Celo, KotaniPay), launch DAO on",
