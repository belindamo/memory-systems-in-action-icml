I'm excited to share more about what you can expect during your Introduction to Glassblowing class at Glassybaby.\n\n**Class Format:**\n\nThe Introduction to Glassblowing class is a 2-hour hands-on class, divided into several segments:\n\n1. **Introduction and Demonstration** (15-20 minutes): Your instructor will introduce themselves, explain the basics of glassblowing, and demonstrate the process of gathering, marvering, and shaping hot glass.\n2. **Hands-on Glassblowing** (1 hour): You'll work in small groups of 2-3 students, with one instructor per group. You'll take turns gathering glass from the furnace, marvering, and shaping your own glass ornament or small vessel. Your instructor will guide you through each step, providing hands-on assistance and feedback.\n3. **Cooling and Finishing** (20-30 minutes): After you've shaped your glass, it will need to cool slowly in a special oven called an annealer. While your glass is cooling, your instructor will explain the finishing process and answer any questions you may have.\n4. **Final Touches** (10-15 minutes): Once your glass has cooled, you'll inspect your creation, and your instructor will help you add any final touches, such as cleaning or signing your piece.\n\n**Hands-on Time:**\n\nYou can expect to have around 45-60 minutes of hands-on glassblowing time, depending on the class size and the complexity of the project. During this time, you'll work closely with your instructor to create your own glass piece.\n\n**Instructor Guidance:**\n\nYour instructor will be with you every step of the way, providing guidance, demonstrations, and hands-on assistance. They'll help you understand the basics of glassblowing, troubleshoot any issues, and ensure that you have a fun and safe experience.\n\n**Glass Piece:**\n\nAt the end of the class, you'll take home your very own glass ornament or small vessel, which you'll have created during the class. This is a great way to commemorate your first glassblowing experience and show off your new skills!\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* Wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes and clothing that can get dirty.\n* Bring a water bottle and a snack, as you'll be working with hot glass and might get thirsty.\n* Don't worry if you're new to glassblowing \u2013 your instructor will guide you through every step, and it's okay to make mistakes!\n* Be prepared to get a bit messy and have fun!\n\nI hope this helps you feel more prepared and excited for your Introduction to Glassblowing class at Glassybaby!",
