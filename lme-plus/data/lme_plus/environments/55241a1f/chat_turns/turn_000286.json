  "content": "I'm really excited to learn more about bookbinding and preservation. As for my favorite part about my rare book, I have to say it's the historical significance of it being a first edition from 1830. I feel like I'm holding a piece of literary history in my hands, and that's really special to me. The binding and illustrations are also beautiful, but it's the story behind the book that really draws me in.",
