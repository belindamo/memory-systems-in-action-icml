I'd be happy to help you plan your bird watching trip.\n\nSince you're heading to the coastal area next weekend, you're likely to catch the tail end of the spring migration, which is an excellent time to spot shorebirds and waterfowl. Here are some fantastic spots to consider:\n\n1. **Beaches and Mudflats**: Look for areas with shallow water, mudflats, and sandbars, as these are ideal habitats for shorebirds like sandpipers, plovers, and oystercatchers. Some popular beaches for birding include:\n\t* Cape May Point State Park (NJ)\n\t* Assateague Island National Seashore (MD)\n\t* Chincoteague Island (VA)\n2. **Estuaries and Bays**: These areas are crucial stopovers for waterfowl, such as ducks, geese, and mergansers, during their migration. Try:\n\t* Delaware Bay (DE/NJ)\n\t* Chesapeake Bay (MD/VA)\n\t* Barnegat Bay (NJ)\n3. **Wetlands and Marshes**: These habitats are perfect for spotting herons, egrets, and other waterbirds. Don't miss:\n\t* Cape May Wetlands State Natural Area (NJ)\n\t* Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge (DE)\n\t* Eastern Neck National Wildlife Refuge (MD)\n4. **Piers and Jetties**: These structures can attract a variety of birds, including gulls, terns, and shorebirds. Check out:\n\t* Cape May Pier (NJ)\n\t* Ocean City Pier (MD)\n\t* Virginia Beach Fishing Pier (VA)\n\nBefore you head out, make sure to:\n\n* Check the weather forecast and plan accordingly. Strong winds or rough seas might make it difficult to spot birds.\n* Bring appropriate gear, including binoculars, a spotting scope, and a field guide to help with identification.\n* Dress in layers and wear comfortable shoes or boots, as you'll likely be walking and standing for extended periods.\n* Consider joining a guided birding tour or connecting with local birding groups to maximize your chances of spotting new species.\n\nIt's great to hear that you attended a bird watching workshop at your local library! That's a fantastic way to learn from experienced birders and get excited about the hobby. You might also want to explore online resources, such as eBird or the Audubon Society, to stay up-to-date on birding news, migration patterns, and species sightings in your area.\n\nHave a fantastic birding trip, and I hope you spot many new species!",
