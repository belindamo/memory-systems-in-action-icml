  "content": "I don't have personal experiences seeing movies. however, bad lighting can be distracting and take the viewer out of the immersive experience of watching a film. for example, inconsistent or overly bright lighting can make it difficult to see the actors and the scene clearly, which can take away from the overall visual impact of the film. bad lighting can also feel unprofessional and lower the production value of the movie. in some cases, filmmakers may use bad lighting intentionally as an artistic choice to create a particular mood or atmosphere, but this is rare and requires great skill and intentionality. generally speaking, bad lighting can detract from the impact of a movie and make it more challenging for the viewer to connect emotionally with the story being told.",
