  "content": "To add Samba and share the watched folder in OctoPrint to your local network, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install Samba on your OctoPrint machine by running the following command:\n```\nsudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin\n```\n1. Create a new Samba configuration file by running the following command:\n```\nsudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n```\n1. Add the following lines to the configuration file, replacing \"/path/to/watched/folder\" with the actual path to the watched folder on your OctoPrint machine:\n```\n[OctoPrint]\n  comment = OctoPrint Watched Folder\n  path = /path/to/watched/folder\n  browseable = yes\n  read only = no\n  guest ok = no\n  create mask = 0644\n  directory mask = 0755\n  force user = pi\n```\n1. Save and close the configuration file.\n2. Restart the Samba service by running the following command:\n```\nsudo service smbd restart\n```\n1. Add a Samba user for the Snapmaker user by running the following command:\n```\nsudo smbpasswd -a Snapmaker\n```\n1. Follow the prompts to set a password for the Snapmaker user.\n2. You should now be able to access the watched folder from other devices on your local network by browsing to \"\\[OctoPrint IP address]\\OctoPrint\" in the file explorer. The Snapmaker user will be able to authenticate with the password you set.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.",
