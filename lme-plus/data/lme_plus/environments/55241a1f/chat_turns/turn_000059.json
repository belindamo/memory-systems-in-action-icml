  "content": "Dear friends,\n\nWe hope this invitation finds you well. As the saying goes, \"Mishenichnas Adar marbin b'simcha\" (When Adar begins, we increase in joy). This year, we would like to share that joy with you at our Purim Seuda!\n\nIn honor of the holiday, where we celebrate Queen Esther's bravery and the saving of the Jewish people, we are inviting you to come and join us for a potluck feast. Just like Queen Esther, who invited King Ahasuerus and all of the Jews to a feast in Shushan (Esther 5:4), we too would like to open our doors to you.\n\nHowever, our Jerusalem apartment can only hold 38 guests, so it will be first-come first-served. So, we say to you what King Ahasuerus said to Esther, \"If I have found favor in your eyes, come to the dinner I will prepare for you.\" (Esther 5:4)\n\nIn keeping with the festive spirit of the holiday, we ask that each of you bring a dish to share, just like in the movie \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" where the guests bring a dish to the table.\n\nSo, let us come together to celebrate the holiday of Purim with food, drink, and merriment. Please let us know if you can join us for this special Seuda by replying \"Hineini\" (Here I am) to this invitation.\n\nWishing you all a Happy Purim!\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Names]",
