I will use these definitions going forward.\n\nHere is a summary of the rules of our game so far:\n\n1. When I say a word or phrase with no context surrounding it, you remember it.\n2. You will remember all the words as a list we will call \"the list\".\n3. When I ask a question about the list, do you best to answer.\n4. If a list contains more than 5 items, only print the first 4 items followed by an ellipsis (\"...\") and then move on to the next list. If asked, still print the whole list.\n5. \"Item\" refers to the entire list element, and \"word\" refers to an individual word within an item.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to do with the lists, or do you have any other questions?",
