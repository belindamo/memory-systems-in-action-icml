  "content": "Well, musicians do influence each other. In fact I think Stravinsky himself was heavily influenced by Tchaikovsky and Debussy, so hmmm, I do somewhat hear Stravinsky in Prokofiev. But I can't really hear any traces of Debussy's influence in Prokofiev. Yes, both sound modern and romantic, but Debussy's music obviously seems more atmospherical, uses more dissonant chords, and doesn't place such a heavy emphasis on melody. Also, Debussy seems to be engaged with musical exoticism, which, in my opinion, is somewhat similar to Dvorak (I'm also curious in your opinion on this), and I can't immediately name many other classical composers who do this.",
