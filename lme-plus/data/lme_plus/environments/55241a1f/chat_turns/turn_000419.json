Here's a suggestion:\n\n* Schedule your online meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\nThis way, you'll have the actual meeting time from 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM (assuming they usually last 30 minutes longer than expected), and then an additional 30 minutes of buffer time from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM to account for any overruns or wrap-up time.\n\nBy blocking out this 1.5-hour window, you'll ensure that you have enough time for the meeting and some extra time to spare, without overcommitting yourself or feeling rushed.\n\nDoes this sound like a good plan to you?",
