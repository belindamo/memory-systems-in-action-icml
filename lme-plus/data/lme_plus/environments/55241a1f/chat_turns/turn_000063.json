  "content": "Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai teaches us in Avot (5:5), \"Rav Yehuda says in the name of Rav: When the Jews stood at Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, the place was crowded. However, when they bent down in prayer, there was room for all.\"\n\nIn light of this teaching, let us consider the matter of hosting a Purim Seuda.\n\nRabbi Eliezer says, \"Just as Queen Esther invited King Ahasuerus and all the Jews to a feast in Shushan (Esther 5:4), so too should we open our doors to our friends and community during the holiday of Purim.\"\n\nRabbi Akiva adds, \"And let us not forget the words of King Ahasuerus, who said to Queen Esther, 'If I have found favor in your eyes, come to the dinner I will prepare for you.' (Esther 5:4) We too must extend this invitation to all those who would like to join us in celebrating the holiday.\"\n\nRabbi Shimon continues, \"However, our abode can only hold 38 guests, just as the Mishna in Avot (5:5) teaches us that when the Jews stood, the place was crowded. Therefore, we must establish a system of first-come, first-served, so that all may partake in the joy of the Purim Seuda.\"\n\nRabbi Joshua adds, \"And let us also follow the example set by the guests in the movie \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", where each brings a dish to share in the feast.\"\n\nTherefore, we conclude that hosting a Purim Seuda, in the spirit of Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus, is a worthy endeavor, and we extend an invitation to all who would like to join us. Let us come together to celebrate the holiday with food, drink, and merriment, just as the Mishna in Avot (5:5) teaches us that when we bow in prayer, there is room for all.",
