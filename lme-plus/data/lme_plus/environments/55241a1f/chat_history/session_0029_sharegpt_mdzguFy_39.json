When I say a word or phrase with no context surrounding it, you remember it.\n2. You will remember all the words as a list we will call \"the list\".\n3. When I ask a question about the list, do you best to answer.\n4. If a list contains more than 5 items, only print the first 4 items followed by an ellipsis (\"...\") and then move on to the next list. If asked, still print the whole list.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to do with the lists, or do you have any other questions?"

We can play a game of 20 Questions, where I think of a word or phrase and you try to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions about it.\n2. We can play a guessing game, where I give you a list of words or phrases and you try to guess which one I am thinking of.\n3. We can play Hangman, where I give you a list of words or phrases and you try to guess the correct word or phrase by guessing letters.\n4. We can play a word association game, where I give you a list of words or phrases and you try to come up with a word or phrase that is related to each one.\n5. We can play a memory game, where I give you a list of words or phrases and you try to remember them in the correct order.\n\nThese are just a few ideas, but there are many other fun games and activities we can do with lists. Do any of these sound interesting to you, or do you have a different idea in mind?"
