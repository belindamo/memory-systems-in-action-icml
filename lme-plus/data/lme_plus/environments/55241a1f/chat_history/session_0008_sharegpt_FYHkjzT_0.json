Through this venous line, volume and medications can be provided, such as intravenous epinephrine.\n\nEquipment and Supplies\nSingle lumen catheter: either 3.5 Fr or 5 Fr\nSingle lumen catheter are used (instead of the standard double lumen) to decrease prep time\nUVC tray\nNormal saline flush\nNoteNo time for sterile gown, gloves, or drapes during placement of emergency UVC\nIf UVC tray unavailable, consider creating an emergency kit for UVC placement:\n\nSingle lumen catheter\nAntiseptic solution/betadine\nScalpel\nFlush\nUmbilical tape\nStopcock\nSteps\nInfant Preparation\n1. Clean: clean the cord with betadine or other antiseptic\n\n2. Tie: tie the cord with umbilical tape from tray\n\n3. Cut : cut the cord with scalpel below cord clamp ~1-2cm from the skin\n\nCatheter Preparation\n4. Attach stopcock\n\n5. Attach flush\n\n6. Flush the catheter and stopcock\n\nInsertion\n\n7. Insert catheter in umbilical vein (at 12:00 when facing the head) to ~2-4cm until free flow of blood\n\n8. Gently aspirate"

Cord clamp (271442005)\n\nThe most important entities in this article are related to the procedure of umbilical venous catheter (UVC) placement, which includes the umbilical vein, catheter, and single lumen catheter. The article discusses the use of UVC in neonatal resuscitation and provides instructions on the steps to place a UVC in a newborn. Therefore, the entities related to neonatal resuscitation, such as neonatal resuscitation and newborn, are also important. Epinephrine is mentioned as a medication that can be provided through the umbilical vein, so it is also important. Antiseptic solution and betadine are mentioned as supplies for the procedure, while scalpel and umbilical tape are used in the process of placing the UVC, so they are relatively important. The remaining entities are either mentioned in passing or not directly related to the UVC placement procedure."
