      "content": "You are a married couple living in Jerusalem with four children and want to host a purim seuda for your friends. The problem is that you only have space to host 38 people and you want to open the invitation to a larger group of people. Therefore, you will inform them all of the seuda and tell that it is first-come first-served. Everyone will be expected to bring a dish as the meal will be pot-luck style. Please draft a clever and lighthearted invitation asking people to confirm whether they will come. You must include references to rabbinic and biblical sources, double entendres and movies which came out between 2000 and 2008."

      "content": "Dear friends,\n\nWe hope this invitation finds you well. As the saying goes, \"Mishenichnas Adar marbin b'simcha\" (When Adar begins, we increase in joy). This year, we would like to share that joy with you at our Purim Seuda!\n\nIn honor of the holiday, where we celebrate Queen Esther's bravery and the saving of the Jewish people, we are inviting you to come and join us for a potluck feast. Just like Queen Esther, who invited King Ahasuerus and all of the Jews to a feast in Shushan (Esther 5:4), we too would like to open our doors to you.\n\nHowever, our Jerusalem apartment can only hold 38 guests, so it will be first-come first-served. So, we say to you what King Ahasuerus said to Esther, \"If I have found favor in your eyes, come to the dinner I will prepare for you.\" (Esther 5:4)\n\nIn keeping with the festive spirit of the holiday, we ask that each of you bring a dish to share, just like in the movie \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" where the guests bring a dish to the table.\n\nSo, let us come together to celebrate the holiday of Purim with food, drink, and merriment. Please let us know if you can join us for this special Seuda by replying \"Hineini\" (Here I am) to this invitation.\n\nWishing you all a Happy Purim!\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Names]"

One of the sources that needs to be incorporated is the statement of the Mishna in Avot (5:5) that when the Jews stood it was crowded but when they bowed there was room."

      "content": "Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai teaches us in Avot (5:5), \"Rav Yehuda says in the name of Rav: When the Jews stood at Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, the place was crowded. However, when they bent down in prayer, there was room for all.\"\n\nIn light of this teaching, let us consider the matter of hosting a Purim Seuda.\n\nRabbi Eliezer says, \"Just as Queen Esther invited King Ahasuerus and all the Jews to a feast in Shushan (Esther 5:4), so too should we open our doors to our friends and community during the holiday of Purim.\"\n\nRabbi Akiva adds, \"And let us not forget the words of King Ahasuerus, who said to Queen Esther, 'If I have found favor in your eyes, come to the dinner I will prepare for you.' (Esther 5:4) We too must extend this invitation to all those who would like to join us in celebrating the holiday.\"\n\nRabbi Shimon continues, \"However, our abode can only hold 38 guests, just as the Mishna in Avot (5:5) teaches us that when the Jews stood, the place was crowded. Therefore, we must establish a system of first-come, first-served, so that all may partake in the joy of the Purim Seuda.\"\n\nRabbi Joshua adds, \"And let us also follow the example set by the guests in the movie \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", where each brings a dish to share in the feast.\"\n\nTherefore, we conclude that hosting a Purim Seuda, in the spirit of Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus, is a worthy endeavor, and we extend an invitation to all who would like to join us. Let us come together to celebrate the holiday with food, drink, and merriment, just as the Mishna in Avot (5:5) teaches us that when we bow in prayer, there is room for all."
