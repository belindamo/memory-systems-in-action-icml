Alternatively, you can also try checking your phone or computer for any notes or reminders you may have made earlier."

Examples include Capstar, Comfortis, and Trifexis.\n3. **Collars**: Flea collars like Seresto and Scalibor release a steady dose of flea preventative medication over time.\n\nFor kittens, it's essential to choose a product that's specifically formulated for their age and weight. Some products are only suitable for kittens over 6 weeks old or weighing a certain amount.\n\nHere are a few popular flea prevention medications for kittens:\n\n* **Revolution**: A topical treatment that protects against fleas, ticks, heartworms, and other parasites. Suitable for kittens as young as 6 weeks old.\n* **Capstar**: An oral medication that kills fleas and ticks within 30 minutes.

I realized I forgot to get a scratching post, so I ordered one online, and it arrived on February 20th. Do you have any tips on how to introduce the scratching post to my kitten?"

That's wonderful!\n\nIntroducing a scratching post to your kitten is a great step in helping her develop good scratching habits and saving your furniture. Here are some tips to help you introduce the scratching post to your little furball:\n\n1. **Place it strategically**: Position the scratching post near areas where your kitten likes to scratch, such as near her favorite sleeping spot or in a high-traffic area. This will encourage her to use the post instead of your furniture.\n2. **Make it appealing**: Sprinkle some catnip or treats around the base of the post to make it more appealing to your kitten. You can also try rubbing a toy or a cloth with your scent on it around the post to make it more attractive.\n3. **Start with a gradual introduction**: Begin by placing the scratching post near your kitten's favorite scratching spot, but not directly on top of it. Let her get used to the sight and smell of the post before encouraging her to use it.\n4. **Encourage scratching**: Gently place your kitten's paws on the scratching post and encourage her to scratch. You can do this by holding a toy or a feather teaser near the post to entice her to swat and scratch.\n5. **Reward good behavior**: Praise and reward your kitten with treats and affection when she uses the scratching post. This positive reinforcement will help her associate the post with good behavior.\n6. **Be patient**: It may take some time for your kitten to get used to the scratching post, so be patient and don't get discouraged if she doesn't take to it immediately.\n7. **Trim the nails**: Make sure your kitten's nails are trimmed to avoid damaging the scratching post or your furniture.\n\nRemember, every kitten is different, so it's essential to observe your kitten's behavior and adjust your approach accordingly.\n\nHow's your kitten doing so far? What's her personality like?"

This is a great sign of a strong bond between you two, and it's something to cherish and nurture as she grows.\n\nHow's Luna's vocalization?
