  "content": "The museum's fossil collection is indeed a treasure trove of wonders! As it happens, the museum is currently planning an exciting new exhibit on hadrosaurs, with a special focus on the Edmontosaurus. The exhibit is titled \"Hadrosaurs: The Duck-Billed Giants of the Cretaceous\" and is scheduled to open in about six months.\n\nThe exhibit will feature an impressive collection of hadrosaur fossils, including several Edmontosaurus specimens, as well as interactive displays, videos, and immersive experiences. Some of the highlights include:\n\n1. **A nearly complete Edmontosaurus skeleton**: The museum has recently acquired a stunning Edmontosaurus fossil, which will be the centerpiece of the exhibit. The skeleton is remarkably well-preserved, with many of its bones still articulated in their original position.\n2. **Hadrosaur skin impressions**: The exhibit will feature several hadrosaur skin impressions, which will give visitors a unique glimpse into the texture and pattern of these dinosaurs' skin.\n3. **Interactive beak simulation**: Visitors will be able to try out a simulated hadrosaur beak, learning how these remarkable creatures used their distinctive bills to gather and process food.\n4. **Life-sized hadrosaur models**: The exhibit will feature life-sized models of several hadrosaur species, including the Edmontosaurus, allowing visitors to get up close and personal with these incredible creatures.\n5. **Fossil preparation lab**: The museum will also be setting up a fossil preparation lab as part of the exhibit, where visitors can watch paleontologists and preparators at work, cleaning and conserving hadrosaur fossils.\n\nThe museum is also planning a range of accompanying programs and events, including lectures, workshops, and family activities. If you're interested in staying up-to-date on the exhibit's progress and receiving notifications about upcoming events, I recommend checking the museum's website or social media channels for more information.\n\nI hope you're as excited as I am about this upcoming exhibit!",
