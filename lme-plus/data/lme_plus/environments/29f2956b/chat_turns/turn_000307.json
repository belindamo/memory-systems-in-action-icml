I'd be delighted to share some fascinating facts about the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!\n\nHabitat:\nTyrannosaurus Rex roamed North America during the Late Cretaceous period, around 68-65 million years ago. Its habitat was likely a mix of forests, rivers, and coastal areas, with a subtropical to temperate climate. Fossil evidence suggests that T-Rex inhabited a region known as Laramidia, which is now western North America.\n\nBehavior:\nT-Rex was an apex predator, and its behavior was likely centered around hunting and scavenging. Its remarkable characteristics, such as:\n\n1. **Exceptional eyesight**: Its eyes were positioned on the front of its skull, allowing for binocular vision, which would have helped it judge distances and track prey.\n2. **Powerful legs**: Its massive legs and strong muscles enabled it to run at speeds of up to 30 km/h (18.6 mph), making it a formidable hunter.\n3. **Formidable bite force**: T-Rex had the strongest bite of any dinosaur, with a force of around 6-9 tons per square inch (psi). This would have allowed it to crush the bones of its prey.\n4. **Feathers and skin**: Fossil evidence suggests that T-Rex had feathers, which might have been used for display or insulation. Its skin was likely scaly, with possible quill knobs (where feathers attach to bone).\n\nSome interesting behaviors that scientists have inferred from fossil evidence and comparisons with modern birds (T-Rex's closest living relatives) include:\n\n* **Hunting strategies**: T-Rex might have used ambush tactics, lying in wait for prey near water sources or using its exceptional eyesight to spot prey from a distance.\n* **Scavenging**: It's likely that T-Rex would have fed on carrion, especially if it encountered a fresh kill or a carcass.\n* **Social behavior**: There's evidence to suggest that T-Rex might have lived in small family groups, possibly with a dominant individual leading the pack.\n\nThe new T-Rex skeleton on display at the Natural History Museum is an incredible addition to their collection. You're lucky to have seen it up close!\n\nDo you have any specific questions about the T-Rex or would you like to know more about other dinosaurs?",
