  "content": "Yes, Sir Arnold, we have been discussing the possibility of establishing a committee to investigate the recent wave of layoffs and identify any underlying causes or factors that may be contributing to the problem. The committee would be tasked with conducting research and analysis, gathering data on the affected industries and regions, and engaging with relevant stakeholders, including companies, labor unions, and other interest groups. The committee would also explore potential policy solutions or interventions to address the root causes of the layoffs and promote job growth and economic development. Would you like me to provide further details on the proposed committee?",
