  "content": "Referees use technology during a game only when they need to review a play, and typically, it happens a few times during a game. The number of reviewable plays and the criteria for reviewing them varies across different basketball leagues and governing bodies. For example, in FIBA Europe competitions, referees can use video replay to review specific incidents, such as basket interference, buzzer-beater shots, and fouls at the end of quarters or overtimes.\n\nRegarding the pace of the game, video replay can slow the game down, as referees may need extra time to review plays. However, most leagues and governing bodies have implemented systems to minimize delays and avoid disrupting the flow of the game. For instance, in some leagues, referees communicate with officials in the replay center, who review the play and provide a quick decision without stopping the game.\n\nThere are also time limits for reviewing plays in some leagues and competitions to ensure that games are not delayed too much. For example, in the NBA, referees can use the replay system to review the validity of a made basket within the last two minutes of the game or overtime, and the review must be completed within 90 seconds. Similarly, in EuroLeague games, referees have 60 seconds to review a play via the video replay system.",
