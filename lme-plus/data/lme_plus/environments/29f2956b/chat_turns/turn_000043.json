  "content": "If you wanted to try something more adventurous than jet boating, but still slightly less intense than bungee jumping or skydiving, I'd suggest trying out zip lining. This activity will take you on a high-speed adventure through the forest canopy, allowing you to take in breathtaking views of Queenstown from above. Ziplining typically involves minimal physical exertion and is generally considered a safe and beginner-friendly activity. It's a great intermediate step before moving on to more extreme adventures like bungee jumping or skydiving.",
