  "content": "The basic, broad classifications of sounds that humans can make with their mouth and vocal chords are called phonetic segments or phonemes. These sounds can be divided into several broad categories based on the way they are produced. The main categories are:\n\n1. Vowels: These are sounds that are produced with an open vocal tract and no obstruction of the airflow. The position of the tongue and the shape of the lips determine the quality of the vowel sound.\n2. Consonants: These are sounds that are produced with some degree of obstruction or constriction of the airflow in the vocal tract. They can be further divided into several subcategories based on the manner and place of articulation:\n* Stops: sounds produced with complete obstruction of the airflow (e.g. /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/).\n* Fricatives: sounds produced with a partial obstruction of the airflow (e.g. /f/, /v/, /s/, /z/, /h/).\n* Affricates: sounds produced by a combination of a stop and a fricative (e.g. /t\u0283/, /d\u0292/).\n* Nasals: sounds produced with the velum lowered, allowing air to escape through the nose (e.g. /m/, /n/, /\u014b/).\n* Laterals: sounds produced with the airflow passing around the sides",
