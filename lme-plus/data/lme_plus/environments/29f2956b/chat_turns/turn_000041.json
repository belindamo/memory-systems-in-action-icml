  "content": "If you're a newbie to adventure activities and are looking for a less extreme experience, I would recommend trying out jet boating. It's a thrilling ride that takes you through the scenic Shotover Canyon, but doesn't require the same level of physical exertion or risk-taking as some of the other activities on the list. It's also a good way to get a feel for the adrenaline rush that's characteristic of Queenstown's adventure activities. From there, you can gradually work your way up to the more extreme activities based on your comfort level.",
