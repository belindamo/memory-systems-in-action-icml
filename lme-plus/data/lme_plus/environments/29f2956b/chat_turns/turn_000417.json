  "content": "Sir Arnold, the decision regarding who will lead the investigation has not been made yet. As I mentioned earlier, the appointment of the investigation's leader would depend on various factors, such as the scope of the investigation, the qualifications and experience required to carry out the research, and the availability of suitable candidates.\n\nIn general, the committee leader would need to have a deep understanding of the labor market and the economic factors that affect job growth and layoffs. They should also possess strong analytical and communication skills, as well as experience leading research teams and working with stakeholders from various sectors.\n\nThe selection process for the committee leader would involve a rigorous evaluation of candidates to ensure that they are impartial, objective, and free from conflicts of interest. The final decision would be made based on a careful review of the candidates' credentials and suitability for the role.",
