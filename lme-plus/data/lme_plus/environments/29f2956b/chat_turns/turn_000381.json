This will help draw the customer's eye to various products and add depth to your display.\n3. **Group similar products together**: Organize your soaps and candles by type, scent, or color to create a cohesive look. This makes it easy for customers to find what they're looking for and compare products.\n4. **Add some greenery**: Incorporate some fresh flowers, plants, or greenery to bring a pop of color and freshness to your display. This can also tie in with the summer theme.\n5. **Use decorative containers**: Display your soaps and candles in decorative containers, baskets, or jars that complement your products and theme. This adds a touch of elegance and can make your products stand out.\n6. **Highlight best-sellers**: Showcase your most popular products or new releases prominently to grab attention. Use signs or flags to draw attention to these products.\n7. **Add some texture**: Mix different textures, such as wood, fabric, or rattan, to add visual interest to your display.\n8. **Incorporate lighting**: Use string lights, lanterns, or spotlights to highlight specific products or create a warm ambiance. This can especially help draw attention to your candles!\n9. **Make it interactive**: Consider adding a \"smell station\" where customers can test different scents or a \"soap-making demo\" area to engage customers and create a memorable experience.\n10. **Branding and signage**: Don't forget to clearly display your brand name, logo, and contact information. Use signs to highlight promotions, prices, or special offers.\n\nSome specific ideas for your handmade soaps and candles could be:\n\n* Creating a \"Soap Bar\" with different soap flavors and scents arranged like a colorful rainbow\n* Building a \"Candle Pyramid\" with candles of varying sizes and colors\n* Designing a \"Summer Scent Garden\" with soaps and candles arranged to resemble a garden, complete with artificial flowers and greenery\n\nRemember to keep your display easy to navigate, well-organized, and visually appealing. You want to make it easy for customers to find what they're looking for and be drawn to your products!\n\nI hope these ideas help you create an eye-catching display for the Summer Fest event!",
