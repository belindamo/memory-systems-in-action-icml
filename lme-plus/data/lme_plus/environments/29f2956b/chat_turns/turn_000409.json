The committee would be tasked with conducting research and analysis, gathering data, and engaging with relevant stakeholders, with the goal of producing a set of recommendations for promoting job growth and economic development. The committee's findings and recommendations would be based on the best available evidence and insights, and would be presented to the government for consideration and action.\n\nIn order to ensure the committee's independence, it may be necessary to establish certain protocols and guidelines to govern its work, including guidelines for appointing members, rules for information sharing and communication, and procedures for ensuring transparency and accountability. These measures would help to maintain the integrity and credibility of the investigation and ensure that its findings and recommendations are well-informed and actionable.",
