Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation.\n\nIf you'd like, you can tell me what you need to pick up from Petco, and I can help you create a list or remind you of common items people often buy at Petco. Alternatively, you can also try checking your phone or computer for any notes or reminders you may have made earlier.",
