This discount is designed to reward responsible homeowners who are taking steps to protect their new investment.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* The discount is available to new homeowners who purchase a Liberty Mutual policy within 12 months of buying their new home.\n* The discount amount varies by state and location, but it's typically around 5% to 10% off your annual premium.\n* To qualify, you'll need to provide proof of purchase, such as a copy of your deed or settlement statement, and confirm that you've purchased your home within the past 12 months.\n* The discount will be applied to your policy premium for as long as you own the home and maintain continuous coverage with Liberty Mutual.\n\n**Other Discounts:**\n\nIn addition to the new homeowner discount, Liberty Mutual offers a range of other discounts that you may be eligible for, including:\n\n* Multi-policy discount: If you have other insurance policies with Liberty Mutual, such as auto or life insurance, you may be eligible for a multi-policy discount.\n* Claims-free discount: If you haven't filed a claim in a certain number of years, you may be eligible for a claims-free discount.\n* Protective devices discount: If you have certain safety features in your home, such as smoke detectors, burglar alarms, or deadbolt locks, you may be eligible for a protective devices discount.\n* Roofing discount: If you have a newer roof or a roof made with impact-resistant materials, you may be eligible for a roofing discount.\n\nLiberty Mutual's discounts can add up quickly, so it's worth reviewing your policy to see which ones you're eligible for.\n\nDo you have any other questions about Liberty Mutual's discounts or policies?",
