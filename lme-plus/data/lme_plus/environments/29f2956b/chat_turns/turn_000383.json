The amount you should allocate depends on several factors, such as the size of your booth, the type of materials you choose, and the complexity of your design. Here are some rough estimates for different display materials and decorations:\n\n**Basic Display Materials:**\n\n* Tables: $20-$50 (you might already have these)\n* Tablecloths: $10-$30\n* Risers or crates: $10-$20\n* Baskets or containers: $10-$30\n* Signs: $10-$50\n\nTotal estimated cost: $60-$180\n\n**Mid-Range Decorations:**\n\n* Artificial flowers or greenery: $20-$50\n* Decorative lighting (string lights or lanterns): $20-$50\n* Themed decorations (e.g., beach balls, inflatables): $20-$50\n* Fabric or paper backdrops: $20-$50\n\nTotal estimated cost: $80-$200\n\n**Premium Decorations:**\n\n* Custom signage or banners: $50-$100\n* High-end decorative containers or displays: $50-$100\n* Professional-grade lighting or special effects: $50-$100\n* Fresh flowers or live plants: $50-$100\n\nTotal estimated cost: $200-$400\n\nAs a rough estimate, I'd recommend budgeting around $150-$300 for a basic to mid-range display that still looks professional and visually appealing. This should cover the cost of tables, tablecloths, risers, baskets, signs, and some decorative elements.\n\nIf you want to splurge on premium decorations or custom elements, you can adjust your budget accordingly. Remember, the key is to create a cohesive and inviting display that showcases your products without breaking the bank.\n\nTips to save money:\n\n* Repurpose materials you already have, like old crates or baskets.\n* Shop during sales or discounts for decorative items.\n* Consider DIY projects, like making your own signs or decorations.\n* Keep your design simple and focus on highlighting your products.\n\nBy planning ahead and setting a budget, you'll be able to create a beautiful and effective display that showcases your handmade soaps and candles without overspending.",
