Ziptrek Ecotours - This company offers a variety of zip line tours that take you through the forest canopy and offer incredible views of Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu. They have a range of tours available, including a twilight tour that takes place during sunset.\n\n2. Skyline Queenstown - This attraction offers a gondola ride to the top of the Skyline complex, where you'll find a range of activities including zip lining. The zip line ride takes you on a thrilling journey through the forest and offers stunning views of Queenstown and the surrounding area.\n\n3. Shotover Canyon Swing and Canyon Fox - Although not strictly a zip line activity, the Canyon Fox and Canyon Swing offered by Shotover Canyon are adrenaline-pumping and involve flying through the air.
