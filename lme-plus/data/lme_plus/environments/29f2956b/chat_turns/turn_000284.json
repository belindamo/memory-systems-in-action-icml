Please reach out to your friends who you think can align with the principles of NATS and would be interested in service \n2. Friends who would like to have a good time around Memorial Day weekend (food + entertainment + network + many educational/informative/ business seminars)\n3. Know of any potential sponsors (corporate or individual) but need help from one of the NATS core members \n4. Businesses that can get benefited by putting up a stall or a booth or would like to participate in information sessions \n5. Businesses that would need brand awareness through our marketing channels \n6. People who just want to get their ads into a souvenir \n7. Finally, we know all of you are putting in time but if you are kind of to donate that would be greatly appreciated as well",
