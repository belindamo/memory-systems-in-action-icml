  "content": "\"We at Harmony Healthcare International, Inc. acknowledge the concern raised by NAB regarding the lack of clarity in our marketing efforts for our 8 week Requirements of Participation (ROP) Free-Key Friday Webinar Series. We apologize for any confusion caused and want to assure NAB that we have taken immediate steps to correct the issue. We have corrected 20 points across the internet, including 8 mentions on YouTube, 7 mentions on our currently available Shopify products, and 5 on our website and blog. Additionally, we have replaced all existing hyperlinks with new ones directing viewers to our YouTube channel.\n\nWe understand the importance of clear and accurate marketing and want to assure NAB that we will be more cognizant in the future and take necessary actions to prevent similar issues from arising again. We have also made sure that all materials now contain the disclaimer that obtaining Continuing Education (CE) Credits and a certificate for each course requires registration and a fee of $59.99 on shop.harmony-healthcare.com.\n\nWe would like to assure NAB that we have taken the necessary steps to correct this issue, and we will comply with the NAB procedures for providing information on the remediation of this concern within thirty (30) days. We understand that if the issue is not resolved, further action may be taken and we will do everything in our power to avoid that. We value our NAB sponsor status and will do everything necessary to maintain it.\"",
