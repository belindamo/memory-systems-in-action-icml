  "content": "Congratulations on considering repotting Felix! Since you've had him for only three weeks, it's likely that he's still adjusting to his new environment. Before deciding on a pot size, let's assess Felix's current situation:\n\n1. **Check the roots:** Gently remove Felix from his pot and inspect the roots. If the roots have filled the pot or are circling, it's a good time to repot. If the roots still have plenty of room to grow, you might not need to repot just yet.\n2. **Assess the soil:** Evaluate the condition of the potting mix. If it's broken down, compacted, or showing signs of nutrient depletion, it's a good idea to repot with fresh soil.\n3. **Consider Felix's growth rate:** Fiddle leaf figs can grow rapidly, especially if they're receiving adequate light, water, and nutrients. If Felix is growing quickly, he might need more room to expand.\n\nBased on your situation, I recommend using a pot that's **one size larger** than the current one. This will give Felix's roots some extra room to grow without overwhelming him with too much new soil.\n\nUsing a pot that's two sizes larger might be too drastic, especially if Felix is still adjusting to his new environment. A larger pot can lead to:\n\n* Overwatering: More soil means more water can be retained, which can cause root rot if Felix isn't adapted to it.\n* Nutrient imbalance: Fresh potting mix can be too rich for Felix, leading to nutrient imbalances or burning.\n\nBy using a pot that's one size larger, you'll provide Felix with a comfortable amount of room to grow without introducing too many changes at once.\n\nRemember to choose a well-draining potting mix and a pot with good drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Also, keep an eye on Felix's response to the repotting and adjust your care accordingly. Good luck, and I hope Felix thrives in his new home!",
