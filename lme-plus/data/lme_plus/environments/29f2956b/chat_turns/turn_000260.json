  "content": "In a terse or mathematical notation, we can represent the set of places of articulation (PA) as:\nPA = {Bilabial, Labiodental, Dental, Alveolar, Postalveolar, Palatal, Velar, Uvular, Glottal}\n\nThe set of manners of articulation (MA) as:\nMA = {Stop, Fricative, Affricate, Nasal, Lateral, Approximant}\n\nAnd the set of voiced or unvoiced (V) as:\nV = {Voiced, Unvoiced}\n\nEach phoneme can be represented as a tuple of an element from each of the above sets. For example, the sound /p/ can be represented as (Bilabial, Stop, Unvoiced) and the sound /m/ can be represented as (Bilabial, Nasal, Voiced).\n\nIt's worth noting that this is a simplified representation, and in practice, sounds can be more complex and may involve various other features such as stress, tone and intonation. However, this representation gives us a good starting point for describing the sounds of a language, and can be useful in analyzing and comparing the sounds of different languages, as well as constructing a new one.",
