  "content": "The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the Jinja2 template, specifically on the line where you are trying to use the `ipaddr()` function.\n\nIt seems that the variable `net_config.cluster_wide_snat` is not a valid IP address, which is causing the `ipaddr()` function to raise an `Invalid IP` exception.\n\nThe `Invalid IP` exception is raised when the `ipaddr()` function is not able to parse the provided string as a valid IP address. It could be that the variable is empty or has a different value than you expect.\n\nYou can check the type of the variable `net_config.cluster_wide_snat` to see if it's a string,\n```\n{% if net_config.cluster_wide_snat is string %}\n    {{ net_config.cluster_wide_snat|ipaddr().ipv4() }}\n{% else %}\n    This variable is not a string\n{% endif %}\n```\nAlso, check the value of `net_config.cluster_wide_snat` if it's a valid IP address.\n\nYou can use the `debug` module to print out the value of `net_config.cluster_wide_snat` to see if it's what you expect it to be.\n\nIt's also possible that the variable `net_config.cluster_wide_snat` is not defined or is not being set correctly, you should check the variables that you are using in your template and make sure that they are defined and have the expected values.\n\nIt's also possible that you have an error in your code logic that is causing the variable `net_config.cluster_wide_snat` to not be set correctly, you should take a look at the code logic to see if it's working correctly.",
