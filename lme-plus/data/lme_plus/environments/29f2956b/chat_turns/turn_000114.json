  "content": "I've been meaning to explore more non-fiction books, especially on self-improvement and productivity. These recommendations sound really interesting, especially \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" and \"Atomic Habits\". I've heard a lot about these books, but I've never gotten around to reading them. Do you think it's better to listen to non-fiction audiobooks at a faster speed, since they're more informative and less focused on storytelling?",
