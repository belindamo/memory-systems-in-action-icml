  "content": "The size of the product of the three sets; places of articulation (PA), manners of articulation (MA), and voiced or unvoiced (V) is the number of possible unique combinations of elements from each set.\n\nThe size of the PA set is 9.\nThe size of the MA set is 6.\nThe size of the V set is 2.\n\nThe size of the product of these three sets is (9 x 6 x 2) = 108.\n\nSo in this case, the product of these three sets would have 108 possible unique combinations of elements from each set.\nIt means that there are 108 different possible phonemes that can be created by combining one element from each of the three sets.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all of these possible combinations will necessarily be present in any given language, and some languages may have unique sounds that do not fit neatly into this set of possibilities.",
