Today, NATS is one of the largest non-profit national organizations for Telugu people living in North America\nSo far volunteers solicited, collected, and disbursed funds for charitable purposes to meet the goals of the organization; and to preserve, propagate and perpetuate Telugu cultural heritage in North America. Our flagship has been a 24x7 helpline 1-888-483-5848 to provide immediate assistance for anyone needing help\nBi-annually NATS conducts a 3-day convention where approximately 8000 people attend to celebrate Telugu culture. This year we are planning to celebrate our 7th annual convention at Raritan Convention Center from May 26-28. This three-day mega event includes various cultural, literary, and business symposiums, shark tanks, continuing Education classes, Women's forums, and career development for the younger generation.\nEvery year we invite a few dignitaries (e.g. Vice President of India Mr. Venkaiah Naidu, Apple Ex-CEO John Scully, Kapil Dev, Dean of Wharton Business School, etc.) state governors for the main event. We are planning to do the same.",
