Here are some tips to help you focus on the essential details:\n\n**Prioritizing Information:**\n\n1. **Identify your key finding:**\n\t* What is the most important or surprising result from your research?\n\t* What is the main contribution of your work?\n2. **Focus on the \"so what\" factor:**\n\t* Why is your research important or relevant?\n\t* What are the implications of your findings?\n3. **Highlight the unique aspect:**\n\t* What sets your research apart from others in the field?\n\t* What new insight or perspective do you bring to the topic?\n4. **Emphasize the benefits:**\n\t* How does your research benefit society, the environment, or a specific group?\n\t* What are the practical applications of your findings?\n5. **Leave out the details:**\n\t* Avoid getting bogged down in methodology or technical details.\n\t* Focus on the big picture and the key takeaways.\n\n**What to Leave Out:**\n\n1. **Methodology:**\n\t* Unless your methodology is particularly innovative or unique, it's not essential to include in the elevator pitch.\n\t* Focus on the results and implications rather than the process.\n2. **Background information:**\n\t* Assume your audience has some basic knowledge of the topic.\n\t* Avoid providing too much context or background information.\n3. **Minor findings:**\n\t* Focus on the most important or significant results.\n\t* Leave out secondary or minor findings that don't contribute to the main message.\n4. **Jargon and technical terms:**\n\t* Avoid using technical language or jargon that might confuse your audience.\n\t* Use simple, clear language to convey your message.\n5. **Unnecessary details:**\n\t* Leave out any information that's not essential to understanding your research.\n\t* Focus on the key message and the main points you want to convey.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you're researching the impact of climate change on coffee production. Here's an example of what you might include and exclude from your elevator pitch:\n\n**Include:**\n\n* The main finding: \"Climate change is projected to reduce coffee production by 50% in the next decade.\"\n* The \"so what\" factor: \"This will have significant economic and social impacts on coffee farmers and communities.\"\n* The unique aspect: \"Our research is the first to quantify the effects of climate change on coffee production at a global scale.\"\n* The benefits: \"Our findings can inform sustainable agriculture practices and help coffee farmers adapt to changing climate conditions.\"\n\n**Exclude:**\n\n* Methodology: \"We used a combination of climate models and machine learning algorithms to analyze coffee production data.\"\n* Background information: \"Coffee is an important crop for many countries and has a significant impact on the global economy.\"\n* Minor findings: \"We also found that coffee production in Ethiopia is more resilient to climate change than previously thought.\"\n* Jargon: \"Our research employed a robust statistical analysis using Bayesian inference and generalized linear models.\"\n\nBy focusing on the most important information and leaving out the details, you can craft a clear and concise elevator pitch that effectively communicates your research to a broad audience.",
