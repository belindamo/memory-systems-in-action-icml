  "content": "Yes, there have been efforts to incorporate non-Western perspectives on gender into Western understandings of gender. In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the limitations of the Western binary view of gender (male/female) and the need to adopt a more nuanced and inclusive approach.\n\nOne approach that has been proposed is the concept of \"gender pluralism,\" which recognizes the existence of multiple genders and gender expressions across different cultures. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding gender as a social construct that is shaped by cultural norms and traditions, rather than as a natural and universal biological category.\n\nThere have also been efforts to incorporate the perspectives of non-Western people and communities into Western gender studies. For example, scholars and activists have highlighted the importance of inclusion and diversity in feminist movements, and have worked to center the experiences and perspectives of women and gender non-conforming individuals from marginalized communities.\n\nOverall, there is a growing recognition of the need to broaden and diversify our understanding of gender, and to incorporate the insights and perspectives of all cultures and communities.",
