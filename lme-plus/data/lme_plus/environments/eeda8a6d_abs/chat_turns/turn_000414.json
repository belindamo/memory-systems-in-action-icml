Propagating plants from cuttings is a great way to share plants with friends and family, and it's also a cost-effective way to expand your own plant collection.\n\nCongratulations on taking the first step by taking cuttings from your Pothos plant! You're off to a great start by changing the water every few days to prevent bacterial growth and promote root development.\n\nHere are some tips to increase the chances of successful propagation:\n\n1. **Choose healthy parent plants**: Make sure the parent plant is healthy and vigorous. This will ensure that the cuttings are taken from a strong, disease-free plant.\n2. **Take the right cuttings**: For Pothos, take 4-6 inch stem cuttings with at least two nodes (the joint where a leaf meets the stem). Cut just below a node, as this is where roots are most likely to form.\n3. **Remove lower leaves**: Remove lower leaves from the cutting, leaving only a few leaves at the top. This helps prevent the cutting from rotting and promotes rooting.\n4. **Use a rooting hormone**: Consider using a rooting hormone powder or liquid to stimulate root growth. This can increase the chances of successful propagation.\n5. **Provide the right environment**: Place the cuttings in a bright, indirectly lit area with temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C). Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause the water to become too warm and promote bacterial growth.\n6. **Monitor water quality**: Change the water regularly to prevent bacterial growth. You can also add a few drops of apple cider vinegar or a commercial rooting stimulator to the water to promote root growth.\n7. **Wait for roots to develop**: Allow the cuttings to develop roots for 2-4 weeks before planting them in soil. You can check for roots by gently tugging on the cutting; if it resists being pulled out of the water, it's likely developed roots.\n8. **Plant at the right time**: Plant the cuttings in well-draining soil when you see a robust root system. Water thoroughly and keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.\n\nWhen you're ready to plant the cuttings, make sure to:\n\n* Plant them in a well-draining potting mix.\n* Water thoroughly after planting.\n* Provide bright, indirect light.\n* Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to successfully propagate your Pothos cuttings. Good luck, and I hope you'll soon have new, thriving plants to enjoy!",
