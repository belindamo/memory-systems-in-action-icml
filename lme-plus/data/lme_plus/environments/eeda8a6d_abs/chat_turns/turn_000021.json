  "content": "I'm using Single-Shot AF with my 100-400mm lens, which is a native Sony E-mount lens. The issue happens indoors, usually when I'm shooting in a dimly lit room. I haven't noticed any specific behaviors or patterns, it just fails to focus sometimes. I haven't tried cleaning the lens or sensor yet, but I did update my camera's firmware recently, except for the latest one which I've been putting off. By the way, I spent last weekend organizing my photography equipment and found some old stuff I thought I lost, including a remote shutter release and some extra batteries for my old Canon EOS 60D.",
