However, I need a bit more information from you.\n\nCould you please share your location or the city you're in? That way, I can provide you with more tailored recommendations.\n\nRegarding the book, I'm glad you returned it to Emily! \"The Nightingale\" is a wonderful novel, and I'm sure she'll appreciate getting it back.\n\nOnce I have your location, I can suggest some local classes or studios that might interest you.",
