The typical length of a DLP ranges from one to two years after practical completion has been reached, with a further DLP applying to previously remedied defective works.\n\nA DLP benefits both the principal and the construction contractor in managing their respective risks under the construction contract. From the principal's perspective, a DLP provides comfort in taking over the works, knowing that the contractor is obliged to remedy any defects discovered during the DLP. It also ensures that the contractor is incentivized to perform the work to the required standard. Additionally, the principal avoids the added burden of engaging a third-party contractor for defects rectification work.\n\nFrom the construction contractor's perspective, a DLP allows for payment of final milestone payments or progress claims without delay due to minor defects in the works. It also enables the contractor to maintain the integrity of any fitness for purpose warranties or design life warranties given under the contract by carrying out any defects rectification work themselves.\n\nThere are some common misconceptions about DLPs. Firstly, the expiry of a DLP does not necessarily mean that the contractor's obligation with regard to the works also comes to an end. Under Australian law, the principal may still have a right at common law to pursue the contractor for damages for breach of contract if defects in the works transpire. The period of time that the principal has to make a claim at common law for damages depends on whether the construction contract is executed as a deed or an agreement and applicable state legislation. If the contract is executed as a deed, the principal will have up to 12 years from the date the defect occurs to bring a claim for damages against the contractor. If the contract is executed as an agreement, this period is up to 6 years.\n\nSecondly, specific performance of a construction contract (i.e. defect rectification) may not be granted by the courts unless exceptional circumstances apply. Providing for defects rectification is critical in common law-based construction contracts to create a period during which the principal is entitled to require defects rectification, and the contractor is given an opportunity to rectify.\n\nIn summary, DLPs play a crucial role in managing risks for both the principal and contractor in construction contracts in Australia. It is essential to understand the legal framework around DLPs and common misconceptions to ensure a successful project outcome.",
