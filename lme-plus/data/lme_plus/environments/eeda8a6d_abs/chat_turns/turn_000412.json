It sounds like you're doing a great job taking care of your Spider Plant.\n\nMisting your plant every morning is an excellent way to maintain humidity and provide it with the moisture it needs. Spider Plants love high humidity, and misting helps to simulate the tropical environment they're native to.\n\nThe fact that it's already producing new baby plants (spiderettes) is a great sign of its health and happiness. Spiderettes are a natural way for Spider Plants to propagate, and they can be easily separated and potted up to create new plants.\n\nSome tips for managing the spiderettes:\n\n* Wait until the spiderettes have developed their own roots and are about 1-2 inches in diameter before separating them from the mother plant.\n* Use a sharp, clean knife or pruning scissors to cut the spiderette from the mother plant, leaving a small piece of stem attached to the baby plant.\n* Pot the spiderette in a well-draining potting mix, and keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.\n* Provide the new plant with bright, indirect light and maintain high humidity until it's established.\n\nYou can also consider sharing the spiderettes with friends or family members who might appreciate a new plant. Spider Plants are great for propagating and sharing, and they make wonderful gifts.\n\nKeep up the great work, and enjoy watching your Spider Plant thrive!",
