Reaching out to David can be a wonderful way to reconnect with your friend and learn from his photography experiences.\n\nAs for the activity, it really depends on your friendship and what you both enjoy. If you both love hiking, going on a hike together could be a fantastic way to catch up while exploring nature and taking some photos. David might even be able to give you some tips on photography while you're out on the trail.\n\nOn the other hand, grabbing coffee can be a more low-key, relaxed way to chat and catch up. You could ask David to bring some of his photography gear or share some of his favorite photos, and have a more focused conversation about photography.\n\nWhy not consider a combination of both? You could plan a hike and then grab coffee or lunch afterwards to discuss your experiences and photos? Whatever you choose, I'm sure David will appreciate the opportunity to share his passion with you and reconnect.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to reach out and reconnect with your friend. Good luck, and have fun!",
