By the way, last Wednesday I took a half-day off from work to attend my niece's school play, and it was really nice to spend quality time with my sister and her family. It's made me realize I need to prioritize some solo activities, like reading and meditation, to help me recharge for the week ahead. Do you have any tips on how to fit in time for personal projects, like my novel writing, into my daily routine?",
