  "content": "Thank you for providing more information about your setup and issue.\n\nIt's great that you're using a native Sony E-mount lens, which should ensure optimal autofocus performance. Since you're experiencing issues with Single-Shot AF, I'll provide some suggestions to help improve autofocus performance in low-light conditions:\n\n**Lens and Camera Settings:**\n\n1. **Check the lens's minimum focus distance**: Make sure you're not trying to focus on a subject that's too close to the minimum focus distance of your 100-400mm lens. This can cause autofocus issues.\n2. **Enable AF Micro Adjustment**: Go to Camera Settings > AF2 > AF Micro Adj., and set it to On. This feature helps fine-tune the autofocus for your specific lens.\n3. **Adjust the AF Drive Speed**: Go to Camera Settings > AF2 > AF Drive Speed, and set it to Fast or Faster. This can help the camera focus more quickly in low light.\n4. **Try Zone or Flexible Spot AF Area**: Instead of using the Wide AF area, try using Zone or Flexible Spot to focus on a specific area of the subject.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Clean the lens and sensor**: Even if you haven't noticed any issues, it's a good idea to clean your lens and sensor to ensure optimal performance. Use a soft brush or a blower to remove any debris, and a microfiber cloth to clean the lens.\n2. **Update your firmware**: I recommend updating your camera's firmware to the latest version, as it may include autofocus performance improvements.\n3. **Use the camera's built-in autofocus assist light**: If your lens has a built-in autofocus assist light, enable it to help the camera focus in low light.\n4. **Experiment with different ISO settings**: While increasing the ISO can help autofocus performance, it can also introduce noise. Try different ISO settings to find a balance between autofocus performance and image quality.\n\n**Remote Shutter Release and Old Equipment:**\n\nIt's great that you found your old remote shutter release and extra batteries! A remote shutter release can be very useful for reducing camera shake and noise when taking photos. You might consider using it to minimize camera movement when shooting in low light.\n\nAs for your old Canon EOS 60D, it's always exciting to revisit old equipment. If you're feeling nostalgic, you could try using it again and see how it compares to your Sony A7III.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to try any of these suggestions. If the issue persists, we can further troubleshoot or explore other possibilities.",
