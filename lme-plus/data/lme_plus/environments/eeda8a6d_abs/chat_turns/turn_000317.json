  "content": "That's amazing to hear! Saving time and reducing stress are huge benefits of meal prep, and it's great that you're experiencing those advantages. Having a sense of control over your meals and knowing that you have healthy options ready to go can be really empowering.\n\nIt's fantastic that you've noticed an improvement in your overall health and energy levels since starting to cook more and meal prep. Eating more plant-based is a great choice, and cooking at home allows you to make informed decisions about the ingredients and nutrients that go into your meals.\n\nSous vide and air frying are both fantastic techniques for preparing healthy snacks and sides. Sous vide is so versatile, and it's amazing for cooking proteins and veggies to perfect doneness. Air frying is a great way to make crispy foods without all the extra oil, and it's so easy to use.\n\nHave you found that cooking and meal prep have also influenced your social life or relationships in any way? For example, do you find yourself hosting dinner parties or cooking for friends and family more often?\n\nAnd are there any new cooking techniques or ingredients you're excited to try out in the future?",
