  "content": "With that information, I can help you calculate your sales tax for the past month.\n\nIn California, you'll need to calculate the sales tax based on your total sales revenue. Since your sales tax rate is 8.25%, you can calculate the sales tax as follows:\n\nSales Tax = Total Sales Revenue x Sales Tax Rate\n= $2,070 x 0.0825\n= $170.58\n\nSo, your total sales tax for the past month is $170.58. You'll need to report and pay this amount to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA).\n\nAs a reminder, you'll need to file your sales tax return and make the payment by the due date to avoid any penalties or interest. The due date for sales tax returns in California is typically the last day of the month following the reporting period. For example, if your reporting period is August, your sales tax return and payment would be due by September 30th.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help with filing your sales tax return, you can contact the CDTFA or consult with a tax professional.",
