While Korean names can sometimes be written using Hanja, which are Chinese characters used in the Korean language, not all Korean names have corresponding Hanja. Here, I'll try to provide Hanja for the names I previously suggested, but please note that some of these translations may not be exact or may not have a direct corresponding character in Hanja.\n\n1. \uc11c\uc544 (Seo-ah) \u2013 \u745e\u5a25\n2. \ud558\uc740 (Ha-eun) \u2013 \u6cb3\u6069\n3. \uc9c0\uc720 (Ji-yoo) \u2013 \u667a\u88d5\n4. \uc5f0\uc6b0 (Yeon-woo) \u2013 \u84ee\u96e8\n5. \uc18c\ud76c (So-hee) \u2013 \u7d20\u559c\n6. \ubbfc\uc9c0 (Min-ji) \u2013 \u654f\u667a\n7. \uc218\ube48 (Su-bin) \u2013 \u79c0\u5f6c\n8. \ub098\ub798 (Na-rae) \u2013 \u7f85\u854a\n9. \uc608\ub9b0 (Ye-rin) \u2013 \u9e97\u6797\n10. \ud61c\uc6d0 (Hye-won) \u2013 \u6167\u5713\n\nPlease keep in mind that the Hanja provided may not be the only possible representation for each name, as different Hanja characters can have the same pronunciation in Korean.
