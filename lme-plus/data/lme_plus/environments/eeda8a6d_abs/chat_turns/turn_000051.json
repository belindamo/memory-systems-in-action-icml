Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nBenefits of a defects liability period\n\nA defects liability period can help both the principal and the construction contractor in managing their respective risks under the construction contract.\n\nFrom the principal\u2019s perspective, a defects liability period is useful for the following reasons:\n\n1. even if minor defects in the works exist, a defects liability period can help the principal get comfortable with the grant of practical completion and taking over of the works in the knowledge that the construction contractor has an obligation to remedy any punch list items and any defects that come to light during the defects liability period;\n\n2. it ensures that the construction contractor is incentivised to perform the works to the required standard as it will not be entirely off the hook once practical completion has been achieved; and\n\n3. the principal does not have the added burden of managing the interface risk and added cost that would result from engaging a third party contractor for defects rectification work. Any new contractor will be unfamiliar the original construction work and will need to devote time and resources to familiarising itself with these, the nature of the defect and the best method of rectification.\n\nFrom the construction contractor\u2019s perspective, a defects liability means:\n\n1. that payment of any final milestone payment (which can often be sizeable) or final progress claim which it is entitled to be paid is not held up by minor defects in the works as it has the ability to rectify these post-practical completion; and\n\n2. by carrying out any defects rectification work itself, the construction contractor can take comfort that the integrity of any fitness for purpose warranties or design life warranties it has given under the contract are maintained.",
