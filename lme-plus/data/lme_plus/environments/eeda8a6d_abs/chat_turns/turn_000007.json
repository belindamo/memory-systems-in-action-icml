Choose the right seat: The left side of the train from La Spezia to Levanto offers the best views of the villages and coastline. 2. Timing: Try to take the train during off-peak hours to avoid crowds, and consider taking the train in the later afternoon or evening to watch the sunset over the sea. 3. Stretch your legs: Get off the train at the different villages and take a hike or walk around to experience the unique beauty of each one. 4. Plan ahead: Trains in this area can be delayed, so be sure to plan your day accordingly to avoid rushing. 5. Bring a camera: The views from the train are breathtaking, so make sure to bring a camera to capture the beauty of the coastline and the villages. 6. Bring snacks: The train ride can be a bit long, and there is no on-board catering. So, bringing some snacks and water can be helpful and enjoyable. I hope these tips help you have a wonderful time on your Cinque Terre Train ride!",
