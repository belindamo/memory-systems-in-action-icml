It's a very competitive scholarship, and only a few students receive it each year.\n2. **Melbourne Research Scholarship**: This scholarship is awarded to international students who are pursuing a research degree (e.g., PhD, MPhil, or Masters by Research) at the University of Melbourne. It's a prestigious scholarship that covers tuition fees, living expenses, and other research-related costs.\n3. **Australia Awards Scholarship**: This scholarship is funded by the Australian government and is awarded to international students from developing countries to study in Australia.
