However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal location or remember specific conversations about your daily activities like lunch with Emily. I'm a new conversation every time you interact with me.\n\nTo provide you with relevant recommendations, could you please share your city or zip code? That way, I can suggest local classes or studios that offer beginner classes in painting or photography.\n\nIf you're not comfortable sharing your exact location, you can also try searching online for \"painting classes near me\" or \"photography classes near me\" to find studios or classes in your area. Additionally, websites like Meetup.com or online course platforms like Udemy, Coursera, or Skillshare often offer classes and workshops in various creative fields.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
