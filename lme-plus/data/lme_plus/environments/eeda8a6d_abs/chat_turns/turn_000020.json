Please answer the following questions:\n\n1. What type of autofocus mode are you using (Single-Shot AF, Continuous AF, or Manual Focus)?\n2. What is the lens you're using, and is it a native Sony E-mount lens or an adapted lens?\n3. What are the lighting conditions like when you're experiencing the issue (e.g., indoor, outdoor, dimly lit, etc.)?\n4. Are you using any special autofocus settings or features, such as Eye AF, Face Detection, or Lock-on AF?\n5. Have you noticed any specific behaviors or patterns when the autofocus fails, such as:\n\t* The camera fails to focus at all\n\t* The camera focuses on the wrong subject or area\n\t* The camera takes a long time to focus\n\t* The camera hunts back and forth before settling on a focus point\n6. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps already, such as cleaning the lens or sensor, or resetting the camera settings?\n\nBased on your input, here are some general tips and settings you can try to improve autofocus performance in low-light conditions:\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Increase the ISO**: In low-light conditions, increasing the ISO can help the camera's autofocus system perform better. However, be mindful of noise and grain in your images.\n2. **Use a lens with a wide aperture**: A lens with a wide aperture (like f/1.4 or f/2.8) can help the camera focus better in low light.\n3. **Use the built-in autofocus assist light**: If your lens has a built-in autofocus assist light, enable it to help the camera focus in low light.\n\n**Camera Settings:**\n\n1. **Switch to Contrast-Detection AF**: In the Camera Settings, go to AF2 > AF System, and set it to Contrast-Detection AF. This mode can be more accurate in low light.\n2. **Enable AF Illuminator**: Go to Camera Settings > AF2 > AF Illuminator, and set it to On. This will enable the autofocus assist light on your lens (if available).\n3. **Adjust the AF Area**: Try using a smaller AF area, such as Zone or Flexible Spot, to help the camera focus on a specific area.\n4. **Use Center Lock-on AF**: Go to Camera Settings > AF2 > Lock-on AF, and set it to Center. This can help the camera track a subject in low light.\n5. **Disable Face Detection**: If you're not shooting portraits, try disabling Face Detection to prevent the camera from getting distracted by faces in low light.\n6. **Try Manual Focus**: If all else fails, try using manual focus with the aid of focus peaking or the camera's built-in focus magnification feature.\n\nPlease let me know if you've tried any of these settings or if you have any additional information about your issue. I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot the problem.",
