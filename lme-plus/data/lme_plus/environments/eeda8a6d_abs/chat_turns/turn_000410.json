They're indeed wonderful plants, and with proper care, they can thrive.\n\nSpider Plants prefer a humid environment, typically between 50-70% relative humidity. Here are some tips to help maintain high humidity for your Spider Plant:\n\n1. **Grouping plants**: Place your Spider Plant alongside other plants, as they'll create a microclimate that maintains humidity. This method is especially effective if you have a small, closed space like a office cubicle.\n2. **Mist regularly**: Mist your Spider Plant with water daily, especially during dry winter months or in air-conditioned spaces. You can use a spray bottle to gently mist the leaves and surrounding air.\n3. **Humidifier**: Consider investing in a small humidifier, especially if you have multiple plants or live in a dry climate. Place the humidifier near the plant to maintain a consistent humidity level.\n4. **Tray with pebbles and water**: Place the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles. As the water evaporates, it'll increase the humidity around the plant. Make sure not to let the pot sit in the water, as this can cause root rot.\n5. **Cover with a cloche**: If you live in a dry climate, consider covering the pot with a cloche or a clear plastic bag to create a mini-greenhouse effect. This will help maintain humidity and promote healthy growth.\n6. **Avoid drafts**: Keep your Spider Plant away from direct drafts, air vents, or extreme temperature fluctuations, which can dry out the air and stress the plant.\n7. **Monitor temperature**: Spider Plants prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). Avoid placing the plant near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to maintain a humid environment that your Spider Plant will appreciate. Remember to adjust your humidity levels based on your plant's response and the changing seasons.\n\nHow's your Spider Plant looking after the repotting? Are you noticing any new growth or baby plants (spiderettes) forming?",
