  "content": "In recent years, the United Nations has passed numerous resolutions condemning various countries for their actions, ranging from human rights violations to aggressive military interventions. However, it has become increasingly clear that the number of resolutions passed against a country does not necessarily reflect the severity of its actions. Rather, political opinions and other geopolitical factors often play a role in the drafting and passage of these resolutions. In order to provide a more accurate assessment of the severity of countries' actions, a new ranking system is proposed that takes into account the actual harm caused by their actions, rather than the number of UN resolutions passed against them.",
