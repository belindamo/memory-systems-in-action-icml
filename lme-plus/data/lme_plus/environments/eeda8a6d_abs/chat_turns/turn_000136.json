  "content": "Gouramis can be a bit territorial and aggressive, especially during feeding times. Adding schooling fish like lemon tetras or zebra danios can indeed help distract them and reduce aggression, but it's essential to consider a few things before making any additions:\n\n1. **Gourami compatibility:** Gouramis, especially males, can be quite aggressive towards other fish, especially those with long fins or similar shapes. Lemon tetras and zebra danios are generally peaceful, but they might still be targeted by aggressive gouramis. Make sure your gouramis are not overly aggressive and are compatible with the schooling fish you plan to add.\n2. **Tank size and space:** A 20-gallon tank can be a bit small for multiple species, especially if you already have gouramis. Ensure you have enough space for the schooling fish to swim and establish their own territory without feeling crowded or harassed.\n3. **Feeding dynamics:** Gouramis are opportunistic feeders and might see the schooling fish as competition for food. Make sure to provide plenty of hiding places and visual barriers to reduce competition during feeding times. You can also try feeding your gouramis separately or using a feeding ring to contain their food.\n4. **Schooling fish size:** Lemon tetras and zebra danios are small fish, and gouramis might see them as prey. Ensure the schooling fish are large enough to not be seen as a snack by your gouramis.\n\nIf you've considered these factors and still want to add schooling fish, here are some tips to help reduce aggression:\n\n* **Introduce the schooling fish in a group:** Adding a school of 10-15 lemon tetras or zebra danios can help distract your gouramis and reduce aggression.\n* **Provide plenty of hiding places:** Add plants, rocks, or other decorations to create hiding places and visual barriers, which can help reduce aggression and stress.\n* **Increase water changes:** Regular water changes can help reduce aggression and stress in your tank.\n* **Monitor and adjust:** Observe your tank closely and be prepared to make adjustments if you notice any signs of aggression or stress.\n\nRemember, every tank is unique, and what works for one tank might not work for another. Keep a close eye on your tank's dynamics, and be prepared to make changes if necessary.",
