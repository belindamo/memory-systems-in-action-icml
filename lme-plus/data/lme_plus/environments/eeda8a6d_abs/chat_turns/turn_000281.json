  "content": "At the smaller market on August 15th, I sold around 10 candles and 5 soaps. Typically, customers buy 1-2 items from me at a market. The Harvest Market is expected to have around 500 attendees and will run for 1 day. There are a few other vendors selling candles and soaps, but I'm confident in my products' unique scents and quality.",
