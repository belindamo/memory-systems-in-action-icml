  "content": "I currently do a mix of cardio and weightlifting at the gym, with a focus on building my upper body strength. I've been doing a lot of push-ups, bicep curls, and tricep dips. As for my current endurance level, I'd say I'm decent - I can sustain a moderate-intensity workout for about 30-40 minutes without feeling exhausted. My goal is to be able to run 3 miles without stopping by the end of March. I've been trying to incorporate more physical activity into my daily routine, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator and going for short walks during lunch.",
