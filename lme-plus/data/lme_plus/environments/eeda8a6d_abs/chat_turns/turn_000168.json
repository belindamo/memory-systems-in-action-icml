  "content": "Gender non-conformity may manifest differently in cultures that have historically recognized more than two genders. In some of these cultures, individuals who do not conform to the traditional masculine or feminine roles may be considered a third or fourth gender. These individuals may have specific roles within their communities, such as performing spiritual, ceremonial, or artistic duties.\n\nIn some Native American cultures, for example, individuals who did not conform to traditional gender roles were often regarded as \"Two-Spirit,\" a term that encompasses a range of gender non-conforming identities. Two-Spirit people were often respected and honored for their unique perspectives and abilities, and they may have fulfilled important roles within their communities, such as serving as healers or mediators.\n\nIn other cultures, such as the Hijra community in India, gender non-conforming individuals may form distinct social groups and live in specific geographic areas. Hijras are biologically male individuals who identify as neither male nor female and perform transgender roles in society. These individuals may have a unique cultural identity, separate from the majority culture, and may face social discrimination and stigma.\n\nOverall, gender non-conformity in cultures that recognize more than two genders may manifest in diverse and complex ways, and may include specific roles, social groups, and cultural identities.",
