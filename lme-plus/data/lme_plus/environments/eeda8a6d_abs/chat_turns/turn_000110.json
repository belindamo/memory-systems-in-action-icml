  "content": "M\u0101ui, a curious and adventurous person, decides to find out where fire comes from by extinguishing all the fires in the world. The villagers are frightened and ask their leader, Taranga, to help solve the problem. Taranga suggests that someone must go to see the great goddess Mahuika and ask her for fire. None of the villagers are eager to go, so M\u0101ui offers to set out in search of Mahuika. He finds her on a scorching mountain, where she is a being made of fire. Mahuika is initially hesitant to give M\u0101ui fire, but eventually gives him a fingernail of fire as a gift. M\u0101ui tricks Mahuika multiple times by asking for more fire and extinguishing it, until Mahuika is furious and throws a burning toenail at M\u0101ui. M\u0101ui escapes by turning into a hawk, but the flames chase him and he calls on his ancestor T\u0101whirim\u0101tea for help. T\u0101whirim\u0101tea sends a torrent of rain to put out the fires and Mahuika loses much of her power.",
