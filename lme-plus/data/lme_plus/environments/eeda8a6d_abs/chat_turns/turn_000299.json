  "content": "Yes, open-source GIS tools can be used to create a comprehensive situational awareness system during natural disasters. Some popular open-source GIS tools are QGIS, GRASS GIS, and GeoServer.\n\nThese tools can be used to create maps and visualizations that display information such as the location and severity of the disaster, the distribution of affected populations, and the location of relief resources. They can also be used to track the progress of relief efforts and to identify areas that still require assistance.\n\nHere's an example code snippet using Python and the QGIS library to load a shapefile of disaster-affected areas and display it on a map:\n```python\nimport os\nfrom qgis.core import *\nfrom qgis.gui import *\nfrom PyQt5.QtGui import *\nfrom PyQt5.QtCore import *\n\n# Set up QGIS application\napp = QgsApplication([], False)\nQgsApplication.setPrefixPath(\"C:/OSGeo4W64/apps/qgis\", True)\nQgsApplication.initQgis()\n\n# Load shapefile\nshp_path = \"path/to/affected/areas.shp\"\nlayer_name = \"Affected Areas\"\nlayer = QgsVectorLayer(shp_path, layer_name, \"ogr\")\n\n# Add layer to map\nQgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer)\n\n# Set up map canvas\ncanvas = QgsMapCanvas()\ncanvas.setExtent(layer.extent())\ncanvas.setLayers([layer])\n\n# Show map\ncanvas.show()\n```\nThis code will load a shapefile of disaster-affected areas and display it on a map using the QGIS library. Similar code can be used to display other types of data, such as relief resources or population distribution.",
