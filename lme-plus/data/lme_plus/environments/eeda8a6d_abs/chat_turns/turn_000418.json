It sounds like your plants are thriving, and the fertilizer is definitely playing a role in their success.\n\nSucculents, in particular, can be quite responsive to fertilization, especially when they're young and actively growing. Since your succulent has doubled in size, it's clear that it's receiving the nutrients it needs to thrive.\n\nFebruary 10th was a great time to plant your succulent, as it's a good time to start new plants indoors before the weather warms up. By providing it with the right conditions, including adequate light, water, and nutrients, you've created an ideal environment for it to grow.\n\nHere are a few more tips to keep in mind to ensure your succulent continues to thrive:\n\n1. **Water carefully**: Succulents need infrequent but thorough watering. Make sure the soil is dry to the touch between waterings to prevent root rot.\n2. **Provide good lighting**: Most succulents prefer bright, indirect light. If you're growing your succulent indoors, consider placing it near a south-facing window or using grow lights.\n3. **Maintain good air circulation**: Succulents need air circulation to prevent fungal diseases. Keep your plant at least 6-8 inches away from any walls or other obstacles.\n4. **Fertilize sparingly**: While fertilizer is important, succulents don't need a lot of nutrients. Continue to fertilize your succulent at a moderate frequency (e.g., every 4-6 weeks) to avoid over-fertilization.\n5. **Prune and propagate**: As your succulent grows, you can prune it to encourage new growth and prevent it from becoming leggy. You can also propagate the cuttings to create new plants.\n\nBy following these tips and continuing to provide your succulent with the right care, it should continue to thrive and bring you joy for months to come.\n\nHow do you plan to care for your succulent as it continues to grow? Do you have any questions about pruning or propagating succulents?",
