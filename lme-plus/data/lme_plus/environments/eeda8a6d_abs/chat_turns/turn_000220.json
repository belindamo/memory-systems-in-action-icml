Peak hours are typically between 12 pm and 4 pm EST (when most users are on their lunch break or finishing work).\n2. **Weekdays:** Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday tend to be the best days for engagement, as users are more active during the week.\n3. **Avoid Mondays and Fridays:** These days tend to have lower engagement rates, possibly due to the Monday blues and pre-weekend excitement.\n\n**Niche-Specific Insights:**\n\nFor #travelphotography, #wanderlust, and #adventuretime, you might want to consider the following:\n\n1. **Weekends:** While engagement might be lower on weekends, many people have more free time to browse and plan their next adventure.
