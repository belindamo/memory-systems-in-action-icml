  "content": "It sounds like there are several usability issues with your current implementation of the Artifact CI or CI integration page. Here are some possible suggestions for improving the user experience:\n\n1. Allow attaching a single promotion workflow to multiple Artifact CIs: To address the challenge of attaching a single promotion workflow to multiple Artifact CIs, you could add a bulk edit feature that allows users to select multiple Artifact CIs and attach the same promotion workflow to all of them at once.\n2. Improve the naming and labeling of the page: To avoid confusion for users, you could consider renaming the page to something more descriptive, such as \"Docker Image Repository Management\" or \"CI Integration Management.\" Additionally, you could improve the labeling of the page elements to make it clear what each field and button does.\n3. Streamline the process of attaching promotion workflows: To make it less tedious and time-consuming to attach promotion workflows to Artifact CIs, you could introduce a drag-and-drop or bulk edit feature that allows users to quickly assign a promotion workflow to multiple Artifact CIs at once. You could also provide default promotion workflows for common use cases, such as promoting from development to production, to save users time and effort.\n4. Conduct user testing and gather feedback: To ensure that your improvements address the actual pain points of your users, it may be helpful to conduct user testing and gather feedback on the existing implementation. This can help you identify specific areas where users are struggling and prioritize improvements that will have the most impact.",
