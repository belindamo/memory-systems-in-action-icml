  "content": "That's correct. Even when all nodes are honest, blocks will occasionally get orphaned if two miners discover blocks nearly simultaneously. This can happen because it takes time for a new block to propagate through the network, and if two miners discover blocks at roughly the same time, they may broadcast their blocks to different subsets of the network before they are aware of each other's blocks.\n\nWhen this happens, some nodes may receive one block first and consider it to be the valid chain, while other nodes receive the other block first and consider it to be the valid chain. The two blocks will be competing to be included in the blockchain, and the network will effectively be split into two competing branches.\n\nIn this situation, the network will eventually converge on a single chain as new blocks are added to one of the competing branches. The branch that grows faster and becomes longer will eventually be considered the valid chain, and the blocks on the other branch will become orphaned and discarded. This process is called chain reorganization, and it is a natural and expected part of the blockchain's operation.\n\nOverall, even when all nodes are honest, blocks can occasionally get orphaned due to the nature of block propagation and the possibility of miners discovering blocks nearly simultaneously. However, the network is designed to converge on a single chain through the process of chain reorganization, ensuring that the blockchain remains secure and valid.",
