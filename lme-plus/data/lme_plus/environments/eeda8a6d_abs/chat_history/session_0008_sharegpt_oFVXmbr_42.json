Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nBenefits of a defects liability period\n\nA defects liability period can help both the principal and the construction contractor in managing their respective risks under the construction contract.\n\nFrom the principal\u2019s perspective, a defects liability period is useful for the following reasons:\n\n1. even if minor defects in the works exist, a defects liability period can help the principal get comfortable with the grant of practical completion and taking over of the works in the knowledge that the construction contractor has an obligation to remedy any punch list items and any defects that come to light during the defects liability period;\n\n2. it ensures that the construction contractor is incentivised to perform the works to the required standard as it will not be entirely off the hook once practical completion has been achieved; and\n\n3. the principal does not have the added burden of managing the interface risk and added cost that would result from engaging a third party contractor for defects rectification work. Any new contractor will be unfamiliar the original construction work and will need to devote time and resources to familiarising itself with these, the nature of the defect and the best method of rectification.\n\nFrom the construction contractor\u2019s perspective, a defects liability means:\n\n1. that payment of any final milestone payment (which can often be sizeable) or final progress claim which it is entitled to be paid is not held up by minor defects in the works as it has the ability to rectify these post-practical completion; and\n\n2. by carrying out any defects rectification work itself, the construction contractor can take comfort that the integrity of any fitness for purpose warranties or design life warranties it has given under the contract are maintained."

Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nCommon misconceptions about defects liability periods\n\nIt is important for both the principal and the construction contractor to be aware that under Australian law, the expiry of a defects liability period does necessarily mean that the construction contractor\u2019s obligation with regard to the works also comes to an end.\n\nA defects liability period creates a contractual obligation under which the construction contractor is required to return to the site and rectify any defects identified in the works it has performed. However, the principal may still have a right at common law to pursue the construction contractor for damages for breach of contract if any defects in the works transpire.\n\nThe period of time that the principal has to make a claim at common law for damages will depend on whether the construction contract is executed as a deed or an agreement and applicable state legislation. If the construction contract is executed a deed, the principal will have up to 12 years from the date the defect occurs to bring a claim for damages against the construction contractor. If the construction contract is executed as an agreement, this period is up to 6 years.\n\nA second misconception occasionally affects international parties that are less familiar with common law legal concepts as they apply in Australia. The standard remedy under common law for defects in the works is a claim in damages. Specific performance of a construction contract (namely defect rectification) may not be granted by the courts, unless exceptional circumstances apply. Providing for defects rectification is critical in common law-based construction contracts to create a period during which the principal is entitled to require defects rectification and the construction contractor is given an opportunity to rectify."

The typical length of a DLP ranges from one to two years after practical completion has been reached, with a further DLP applying to previously remedied defective works.\n\nA DLP benefits both the principal and the construction contractor in managing their respective risks under the construction contract. From the principal's perspective, a DLP provides comfort in taking over the works, knowing that the contractor is obliged to remedy any defects discovered during the DLP. It also ensures that the contractor is incentivized to perform the work to the required standard. Additionally, the principal avoids the added burden of engaging a third-party contractor for defects rectification work.\n\nFrom the construction contractor's perspective, a DLP allows for payment of final milestone payments or progress claims without delay due to minor defects in the works. It also enables the contractor to maintain the integrity of any fitness for purpose warranties or design life warranties given under the contract by carrying out any defects rectification work themselves.\n\nThere are some common misconceptions about DLPs. Firstly, the expiry of a DLP does not necessarily mean that the contractor's obligation with regard to the works also comes to an end. Under Australian law, the principal may still have a right at common law to pursue the contractor for damages for breach of contract if defects in the works transpire. The period of time that the principal has to make a claim at common law for damages depends on whether the construction contract is executed as a deed or an agreement and applicable state legislation. If the contract is executed as a deed, the principal will have up to 12 years from the date the defect occurs to bring a claim for damages against the contractor. If the contract is executed as an agreement, this period is up to 6 years.\n\nSecondly, specific performance of a construction contract (i.e. defect rectification) may not be granted by the courts unless exceptional circumstances apply. Providing for defects rectification is critical in common law-based construction contracts to create a period during which the principal is entitled to require defects rectification, and the contractor is given an opportunity to rectify.\n\nIn summary, DLPs play a crucial role in managing risks for both the principal and contractor in construction contracts in Australia. It is essential to understand the legal framework around DLPs and common misconceptions to ensure a successful project outcome."
