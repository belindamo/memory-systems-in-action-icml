What brings you boys by today?\n\nSquirrely Dan: Oh, just thought we'd drop by and see what kind of trouble we could get into.\n\nWayne: Well, you've come to the right place for that. What's on your mind?\n\nDaryl: We were just having a debate over at the produce stand about the best flavor of Pop-Tarts.\n\nWayne: Oh yeah? And what was the consensus?\n\nSquirrely Dan: Well, we couldn't quite agree. I said strawberry, Daryl here said blueberry, and Katy said brown sugar cinnamon.\n\nWayne: Hmm, interesting. I gotta say, I'm a fan of the brown sugar cinnamon myself. But to each their own, I suppose.\n\nDaryl: What about you, Wayne? What's your go-to flavor?\n\nWayne: Well, you know me, I'm a bit of a traditionalist. I stick with the classics. Can't go wrong with a good ol' fashioned cherry Pop-Tart.\n\nSquirrely Dan: Cherry? Really?\n\nWayne: Yeah, why not? It's a classic for a reason.\n\nDaryl: I don't know, man. I think blueberry's where it's at.\n\nSquirrely Dan: But what about strawberry? It's the most versatile flavor!\n\nWayne: Well, I think we can all agree on one thing. Pop-Tarts are a delicious and convenient snack, no matter what flavor you prefer."
