As for my current endurance level, I'd say I'm decent - I can sustain a moderate-intensity workout for about 30-40 minutes without feeling exhausted.

I've been taking yoga classes on Saturday mornings and I feel like it's really helped with my flexibility and balance."

      "content": "Yoga is an excellent addition to your fitness routine! It's great that you've already been taking classes on Saturday mornings. You can definitely continue to incorporate yoga into your routine while doing HIIT and steady-state cardio. Here are some tips to help you balance yoga with your cardio workouts:\n\n1. **Schedule yoga on non-consecutive days**: Try to schedule your yoga classes on days when you're not doing HIIT or steady-state cardio. This will help your body recover from the intense cardio workouts and allow you to focus on flexibility and relaxation.\n2. **Make yoga a recovery day**: Consider doing yoga on your active recovery days (e.g., after a hard cardio workout) to help your body recover and stretch out your muscles.\n3. **Keep yoga sessions shorter and gentler**: If you need to do yoga on a day when you're also doing cardio, try to keep your yoga session shorter (30-45 minutes) and focus on gentle flows, stretching, and relaxation.\n4. **Focus on yoga as a supplement**: View yoga as a supplement to your cardio workouts, rather than a replacement. This will help you prioritize your cardio goals while still benefiting from the flexibility, balance, and relaxation that yoga provides.\n5. **Try yoga styles that complement cardio**: Look for yoga styles that are more dynamic and flow-based, such as Vinyasa or Ashtanga. These styles can help improve your cardiovascular endurance and complement your HIIT workouts.\n6. **Use yoga as a warm-up or cool-down**: You can also use yoga as a warm-up or cool-down for your cardio workouts. This can help increase blood flow, reduce injury risk, and improve flexibility.\n\nHere's an example of how you could incorporate yoga into your routine:\n\nMonday: HIIT workout\nTuesday: Strength training\nWednesday: Rest day or active recovery (yoga)\nThursday: Steady-state cardio\nFriday: HIIT workout\nSaturday: Yoga class\nSunday: Rest day or active recovery\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust your schedule as needed. If you find that you're feeling fatigued or struggling to recover, you may need to adjust your yoga schedule or intensity.\n\nKeep up the great work, and enjoy your yoga practice!"
