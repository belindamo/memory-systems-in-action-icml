He watched the flames flicker and dance and thought to himself, \"I wonder where fire comes from.\"\nM\u0101ui, being the curious person that he was, decided that he needed to find out. In the middle of the night, while everyone was sleeping, M\u0101ui went from village to village and extinguished all the fires until not a single fire burned in the world. He then went back to his whare and waited.\nThe next morning there was an uproar in the village.\n\"How can we cook our breakfast, there's no fire!\" called a worried mother.\n\"How will we keep warm at night?\" cried another.\n\"We can't possibly live without fire!\" the villagers said to one another.\nThe people of the village were very frightened. They asked Taranga, who was their rangatira, to help solve the problem.\n\"Someone will have to go and see the great goddess, Mahuika, and ask her for fire,\" said Taranga.\nNone of the villagers were eager to meet Mahuika, they had all heard of the scorching mountain where she lived. So M\u0101ui offered to set out in search of Mahuika, secretly glad that his plan had worked.\n\"Be very careful,\" said Taranga. \"Although you are a descendant of Mahuika she will not take kindly to you if you try and trick her.\"\n\"I'll find the great ancestress Mahuika and bring fire back to the world,\" M\u0101ui assured his mother.\nM\u0101ui walked to the scorching mountain to the end of the earth following the instructions from his mother and found a huge mountain glowing red hot with heat. At the base of the mountain M\u0101ui saw a cave entrance. Before he entered, M\u0101ui whispered a special karakia to himself as protection from what lay beyond. But nothing could prepare M\u0101ui for what he saw when he entered the sacred mountain of Mahuika.\nMahuika, the goddess, rose up before him, fire burning from every pore of her body, her hair a mass of flames, her arms outstretched, and with only black holes where her eyes once were. She sniffed the air.\n\"Who is this mortal that dares to enter my dwelling?\"\nM\u0101ui gathered the courage to speak, \"It is I, M\u0101ui, son of Taranga.\"\n\"Huh!\" Yelled Mahuika. \"M\u0101ui, the son of Taranga?\"\n\"Yes the last born, M\u0101ui-tikitiki-a-Taranga.\"\n\"Well then, M\u0101ui-tikitiki-a-Taranga, welcome, welcome to the essence of the flame, welcome my grandchild.\"\nMahuika stepped closer to M\u0101ui, taking a deep sniff of his scent. M\u0101ui stood completely still, even though the flames from Mahuika's skin were unbearably hot.\n\"So... why do you come, M\u0101ui-tikitiki-a-Taranga?\" Mahuika finally asked.\nM\u0101ui said, \"The fires of the world have been extinguished, I have come to ask you for fire.\" Mahuika listened carefully to M\u0101ui, and then she laughed. She pulled a fingernail from one of her burning fingers and gave it to him.\n\"Take this fire as a gift to your people. Honour this fire as you honour me.\"\nSo M\u0101ui left the house of Mahuika taking with him the fingernail of fire.\nAs M\u0101ui walked along the side of the road he thought to himself, \"What if Mahuika had no fire left, then where would she get her fire from?\"\nM\u0101ui couldn't contain his curiosity. He quickly threw the fingernail into a stream and headed back to Mahuika's cave.\n\"I tripped and fell,\" said M\u0101ui. \"Could I please have another?\"\nMahuika was in a good mood. She hadn't spoken to someone in quite some time and she liked M\u0101ui. She gladly gave M\u0101ui another of her fingernails.\nBut M\u0101ui soon extinguished this fingernail as well and returned to Mahuika with another excuse.\n\"A fish splashed my flame as I was crossing the river,\" M\u0101ui said.\nMahuika provided another of her fingernails, not suspecting that she was being tricked.\nThis continued for most of the day until Mahuika had used all her fingernails and had even given up her toenails. When M\u0101ui returned to ask for another, Mahuika was furious. She knew M\u0101ui had been tricking her and threw the burning toenail to the ground.\nInstantly M\u0101ui was surrounded by fire and chased from the cave.\nM\u0101ui changed himself into a hawk and escaped to the sky, but the flames burned so high that they singed the underside of his wings, turning them a glowing red.\nM\u0101ui dived towards a river, hoping to avoid the flames in the coolness of the water, but the immense heat made the water boil.\nM\u0101ui was desperate. He called on his ancestor T\u0101whirim\u0101tea for help. \"T\u0101whirim\u0101tea atua o ng\u0101 hau e wh\u0101, \u0101whinatia mai!\"\nThen, a mass of clouds gathered and a torrent of rain fell to put out the many fires. Mahuika's mountain of fire no longer burned hot.\nMahuika had lost much of her power, but still she was not giving up. She took her very last toenail and threw it at M\u0101ui in anger. The toenail of fire missed M\u0101ui and flew into the trees, planting itself in the Mahoe tree, the T\u014dtara, the Patete, the Pukatea, and the Kaik\u014dmako trees. These trees cherished and held onto the fire of Mahuika, considering it a great gift.\nWhen M\u0101ui returned to his village he didn't bring back fire as the villagers had expected. Instead he brought back dry wood from the Kaik\u014dmako tree and showed them how to rub the dry sticks together forming friction which would eventually start a fire. The villagers were very happy to be able to cook their food once more and to have the warmth of their fires at night to comfort them.\nM\u0101ui satisfied his curiosity in finding the origin of fire, although he very nearly paid the ultimate price in doing so. To this day the Kahu, the native hawk of Aotearoa, still retains the red singed feathers on the underside of its wings, a reminder of how close M\u0101ui was to death.\nThis is the story of how M\u0101ui brought fire to the world.\nAuthor: Wiremu Grace\n\u2014\n\nFirst, generate a summary of the text."
