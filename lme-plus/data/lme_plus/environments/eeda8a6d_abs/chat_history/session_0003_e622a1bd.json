      "content": "I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the autofocus issue with your Sony A7III in low-light conditions.\n\nTo better assist you, can you please provide some more information about the issue you're experiencing? Please answer the following questions:\n\n1. What type of autofocus mode are you using (Single-Shot AF, Continuous AF, or Manual Focus)?\n2. What is the lens you're using, and is it a native Sony E-mount lens or an adapted lens?\n3. What are the lighting conditions like when you're experiencing the issue (e.g., indoor, outdoor, dimly lit, etc.)?\n4. Are you using any special autofocus settings or features, such as Eye AF, Face Detection, or Lock-on AF?\n5. Have you noticed any specific behaviors or patterns when the autofocus fails, such as:\n\t* The camera fails to focus at all\n\t* The camera focuses on the wrong subject or area\n\t* The camera takes a long time to focus\n\t* The camera hunts back and forth before settling on a focus point\n6. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps already, such as cleaning the lens or sensor, or resetting the camera settings?\n\nBased on your input, here are some general tips and settings you can try to improve autofocus performance in low-light conditions:\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Increase the ISO**: In low-light conditions, increasing the ISO can help the camera's autofocus system perform better. However, be mindful of noise and grain in your images.\n2. **Use a lens with a wide aperture**: A lens with a wide aperture (like f/1.4 or f/2.8) can help the camera focus better in low light.\n3. **Use the built-in autofocus assist light**: If your lens has a built-in autofocus assist light, enable it to help the camera focus in low light.\n\n**Camera Settings:**\n\n1. **Switch to Contrast-Detection AF**: In the Camera Settings, go to AF2 > AF System, and set it to Contrast-Detection AF. This mode can be more accurate in low light.\n2. **Enable AF Illuminator**: Go to Camera Settings > AF2 > AF Illuminator, and set it to On. This will enable the autofocus assist light on your lens (if available).\n3. **Adjust the AF Area**: Try using a smaller AF area, such as Zone or Flexible Spot, to help the camera focus on a specific area.\n4. **Use Center Lock-on AF**: Go to Camera Settings > AF2 > Lock-on AF, and set it to Center. This can help the camera track a subject in low light.\n5. **Disable Face Detection**: If you're not shooting portraits, try disabling Face Detection to prevent the camera from getting distracted by faces in low light.\n6. **Try Manual Focus**: If all else fails, try using manual focus with the aid of focus peaking or the camera's built-in focus magnification feature.\n\nPlease let me know if you've tried any of these settings or if you have any additional information about your issue. I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot the problem."

      "content": "I'm using Single-Shot AF with my 100-400mm lens, which is a native Sony E-mount lens. The issue happens indoors, usually when I'm shooting in a dimly lit room. I haven't noticed any specific behaviors or patterns, it just fails to focus sometimes. I haven't tried cleaning the lens or sensor yet, but I did update my camera's firmware recently, except for the latest one which I've been putting off. By the way, I spent last weekend organizing my photography equipment and found some old stuff I thought I lost, including a remote shutter release and some extra batteries for my old Canon EOS 60D."

      "content": "Thank you for providing more information about your setup and issue.\n\nIt's great that you're using a native Sony E-mount lens, which should ensure optimal autofocus performance. Since you're experiencing issues with Single-Shot AF, I'll provide some suggestions to help improve autofocus performance in low-light conditions:\n\n**Lens and Camera Settings:**\n\n1. **Check the lens's minimum focus distance**: Make sure you're not trying to focus on a subject that's too close to the minimum focus distance of your 100-400mm lens. This can cause autofocus issues.\n2. **Enable AF Micro Adjustment**: Go to Camera Settings > AF2 > AF Micro Adj., and set it to On. This feature helps fine-tune the autofocus for your specific lens.\n3. **Adjust the AF Drive Speed**: Go to Camera Settings > AF2 > AF Drive Speed, and set it to Fast or Faster. This can help the camera focus more quickly in low light.\n4. **Try Zone or Flexible Spot AF Area**: Instead of using the Wide AF area, try using Zone or Flexible Spot to focus on a specific area of the subject.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Clean the lens and sensor**: Even if you haven't noticed any issues, it's a good idea to clean your lens and sensor to ensure optimal performance. Use a soft brush or a blower to remove any debris, and a microfiber cloth to clean the lens.\n2. **Update your firmware**: I recommend updating your camera's firmware to the latest version, as it may include autofocus performance improvements.\n3. **Use the camera's built-in autofocus assist light**: If your lens has a built-in autofocus assist light, enable it to help the camera focus in low light.\n4. **Experiment with different ISO settings**: While increasing the ISO can help autofocus performance, it can also introduce noise. Try different ISO settings to find a balance between autofocus performance and image quality.\n\n**Remote Shutter Release and Old Equipment:**\n\nIt's great that you found your old remote shutter release and extra batteries! A remote shutter release can be very useful for reducing camera shake and noise when taking photos. You might consider using it to minimize camera movement when shooting in low light.\n\nAs for your old Canon EOS 60D, it's always exciting to revisit old equipment. If you're feeling nostalgic, you could try using it again and see how it compares to your Sony A7III.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to try any of these suggestions. If the issue persists, we can further troubleshoot or explore other possibilities."

Both Craigslist and eBay are popular platforms for buying and selling used photography gear. Here are some tips to help you get a good price for your flash:\n\n1. **Research the market**: Check online marketplaces like eBay, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace to see what similar flashes are selling for. This will give you an idea of the price range you can expect.\n2. **Gather information**: Make sure you have the flash's make, model, and any relevant accessories (e.g., diffuser, stand, etc.). Take clear, high-quality photos of the flash from multiple angles.\n3. **Clean and prepare the flash**: Make sure the flash is in good working condition, and clean it thoroughly before taking photos. Consider including any original packaging, manuals, or accessories to increase the sale value.\n4. **Write a detailed description**: When creating your listing, include as much information as possible, such as:\n\t* The flash's condition (e.g., used, excellent condition, minor scratches, etc.)\n\t* Any features or settings it has (e.g., TTL, manual mode, bounce head, etc.)\n\t* The type of camera it's compatible with (e.g., Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc.)\n\t* Any additional accessories included\n5. **Set a competitive price**: Based on your research, set a competitive price for your flash. You can start with a slightly higher price and be open to negotiations.\n6. **Choose the right platform**: Decide whether to sell on Craigslist, eBay, or both. eBay tends to have a larger audience, but you'll need to pay a small fee for listing and selling. Craigslist is free, but you'll need to be more cautious when dealing with potential buyers.\n\nRemember to follow safety guidelines when selling online, such as meeting potential buyers in a public place and being cautious of scams.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider selling your flash as a bundle with other photography gear you no longer need. This can attract more buyers and increase the overall sale value.\n* Be prepared to answer questions from potential buyers and provide additional photos or information as needed.\n* Keep your listing up-to-date and respond quickly to inquiries to increase the chances of selling your flash quickly.\n\nGood luck with the sale, and I hope you get a good price for your flash!"
