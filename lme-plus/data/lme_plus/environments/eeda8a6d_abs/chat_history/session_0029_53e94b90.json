      "content": "Fair dinkum! You're gonna love gettin' familiar with Aussie coffee culture, mate!\n\nA \"flat white\" is a type of coffee drink that's super popular in Australia and New Zealand. It's a staple in most cafes, and you'll hear locals ordering it left and right.\n\nA flat white is a double shot of espresso topped with a thin layer of microfoam (steamed milk that's been frothed to a silky smooth texture). The milk is heated to a specific temperature and texture, which is crucial to a good flat white. The ratio of espresso to milk is usually around 1:3 to 1:5, so it's stronger than a latte but not as strong as a straight espresso.\n\nThe key characteristics of a flat white are:\n\n1. Strong, rich espresso flavor\n2. Thin layer of microfoam (not too much, not too little)\n3. Smooth, velvety texture\n4. No visible layers or separation between the espresso and milk\n\nWhen you order a flat white, you might hear the barista ask, \"Would you like it strong or weak?\" This refers to the ratio of espresso to milk. If you prefer a stronger coffee flavor, ask for it \"strong.\" If you prefer a milder flavor, ask for it \"weak.\"\n\nNow, go ahead and order a flat white like a local: \"G'day, can I get a flat white, thanks?\""
