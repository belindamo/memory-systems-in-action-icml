  "content": "The best time of year to visit the orangutan rehabilitation center in Kalimantan is between July and September, during the dry season. This is when the weather is most favorable and there is less chance of rainforest flooding, which can make it difficult to access some parts of the center. Additionally, during this time, there is more fruit available for the orangutans to eat, making it easier to observe them in their natural habitat.",
