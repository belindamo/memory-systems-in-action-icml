  "content": "While there is some debate and conflicting evidence, drinking moderate amounts of caffeine during pregnancy is generally considered safe and is unlikely to cause a complete miscarriage. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests that pregnant individuals limit their caffeine intake to less than 200 milligrams per day, which is roughly the amount found in one 12-ounce cup of coffee.\n\nHowever, excessive consumption of caffeine has been associated with a slightly increased risk of miscarriage, particularly in the first trimester when the risk of miscarriage is already highest. The exact threshold for what constitutes \"excessive\" caffeine intake is still a matter of debate and likely depends on individual factors like tolerance and body weight.\n\nIt is important for pregnant individuals to talk to their healthcare provider about their caffeine consumption and any other lifestyle factors that could affect their pregnancy. Additionally, it is always a good idea to read food and drink labels to be aware of the amount of caffeine in products, as caffeine is not just found in coffee but also in tea, chocolate, sodas and other beverages.",
