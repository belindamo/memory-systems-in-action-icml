  "content": "Sizing can be a challenge, especially when shopping online! Athleta's sizing can run a bit differently than other brands, so it's great that you're being cautious. Here are some tips to help you ensure a good fit:\n\n**1. Check the Size Chart:** Athleta provides a detailed size chart on their website, which includes measurements for each size. Make sure to check the chart for the specific style you're interested in, as measurements can vary between styles.\n\n**2. Know Your Measurements:** Take your measurements before ordering. Athleta's size chart is based on body measurements, not garment measurements. Measure your natural waist, hips, and inseam to determine your best fit.\n\n**3. Read Reviews:** Check out reviews from other customers who have purchased the same style. They often provide valuable insights into the fit, comfort, and sizing of the leggings. Look for reviews from customers with similar body types or measurements to yours.\n\n**4. Consider the Fabric:** Athleta's fabrics can affect the fit of their leggings. For example, their Powervita fabric is known for its four-way stretch, which can provide a more comfortable fit. If you're unsure, consider contacting Athleta's customer service to ask about the fabric and how it will fit.\n\n**5. Order Multiple Sizes (If Possible):** If you're still unsure, consider ordering multiple sizes and trying them on at home. Athleta offers free returns and exchanges, so you can easily swap out for a different size if needed.\n\n**6. Contact Customer Service:** Athleta's customer service is known for being helpful and responsive. If you have any questions about sizing or fit, don't hesitate to reach out to them. They can provide personalized advice and help you determine the best size for your needs.\n\n**7. Consider Visiting a Store:** If possible, visit an Athleta store to try on leggings before buying online. This will give you a better sense of the fit and feel of the fabric.\n\n**Athleta's Sizing Tips:**\n\n* If you're between sizes, Athleta recommends sizing down for a more compressive fit or sizing up for a more relaxed fit.\n* Their leggings are designed to fit snugly, so don't be afraid to size down if you're unsure.\n* If you have a larger bust or hips, consider sizing up for a more comfortable fit.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be more likely to get a great fit with Athleta's leggings with pockets. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and take your time when making a purchase online. Happy shopping!",
