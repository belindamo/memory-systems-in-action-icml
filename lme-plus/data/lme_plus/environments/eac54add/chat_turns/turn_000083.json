  "content": "A complete miscarriage is typically diagnosed using an ultrasound or pelvic exam to confirm that the uterus is empty, and there are no products of conception remaining. Blood tests may also be done to check the levels of pregnancy hormones in the body, which will typically drop significantly after a complete miscarriage.\n\nThere are a few potential risks associated with a complete miscarriage, including:\n\n1. Infection: In some cases, tissue left behind after a miscarriage can lead to infection, which can be treated with antibiotics.\n\n2. Heavy bleeding: While some bleeding is normal after a miscarriage, heavy bleeding (like soaking through a pad in an hour or less) may require medical attention.\n\n3. Emotional effects: Miscarriage can be emotionally challenging for many women and their partners, and may require support from friends, family, or a mental health professional.\n\n4. Future pregnancy: While a complete miscarriage does not typically affect a woman's ability to get pregnant in the future, there may be some increased risk of complications in future pregnancies, particularly if the miscarriage was caused by an underlying condition like endometriosis or hormonal imbalances.",
