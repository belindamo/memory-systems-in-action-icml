I'm not sure yet, but I'll take a closer look at each of them to see if I can cut back on any. Thanks for the tips! By the way, I just remembered that I also bought a new laptop from Best Buy's online store on May 25th, which was a big purchase. Can I add that to the spreadsheet template you provided earlier?",
