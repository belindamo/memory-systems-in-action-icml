Online play allows you to play with friends or strangers, and it's a great way to practice and improve your skills.\n\n**Solo play:**\n\nWhile Azul is designed for 2-4 players, there is a solo variant that allows you to play against an automated opponent. The solo mode is a great way to practice and improve your skills, but it's not as engaging as playing with human opponents.\n\nOverall, Azul is an excellent choice for playing with your neighbors or friends, either in-person or online. It's a fun, interactive, and strategic game that's perfect for a casual game night.",
