  "content": "In general, excessive physical activity or lifting heavy objects is not considered a common cause of a complete miscarriage. While there are exceptions, most miscarriages occur due to genetic abnormalities, problems with the placenta, infections or health conditions, rather than specific physical activities.\n\nExercising and staying active during pregnancy can actually have several benefits, including lowering the risk of gestational diabetes, improving sleep quality, and reducing the risk of complications during delivery. However, it is important for pregnant individuals to talk to their healthcare provider about appropriate exercise levels and any activity restrictions they may need to follow based on their individual health and pregnancy.\n\nIn rare cases, physical trauma or injury may cause a miscarriage. However, this usually involves a significant impact, such as a car accident, rather than everyday activities like lifting heavy objects or exercising. If a person is concerned that their activities might be putting their pregnancy at risk, they should speak with their healthcare provider.",
