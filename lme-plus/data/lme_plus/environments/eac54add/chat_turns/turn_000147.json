  "content": "Azul's scoring system is one of its most interesting and unique aspects.\n\n**Scoring in Azul:**\n\nIn Azul, you score points for creating beautiful mosaics by placing tiles in your personal player board. The scoring system is based on the patterns and sets you create, rather than completing specific features like in Carcassonne. Here's a breakdown of the scoring:\n\n1. **Completed sets**: When you complete a set of tiles of the same color, you score points for that set. The more tiles in the set, the more points you score.\n2. **Patterns**: Azul features several pattern lines on the player board, which are divided into sections of 1-5 tiles. When you complete a pattern line, you score points based on the number of tiles in that line.\n3. **Glazing**: As I mentioned earlier, glaze tiles are special tiles that allow you to modify your mosaic and score additional points. When you place a glaze tile, you score points based on the number of adjacent tiles of the same color.\n4. **End-game scoring**: At the end of the game, you score points for any incomplete sets, patterns, and glaze tiles on your board.\n5. **Bonus points**: There are several bonus points available throughout the game, such as completing a specific pattern or using all the tiles of a certain color.\n\n**Key scoring differences from Carcassonne:**\n\n1. **No feature-based scoring**: Unlike Carcassonne, you don't score points for completing specific features like roads, cities, or monasteries.\n2. **Pattern-based scoring**: Azul's scoring is more focused on creating patterns and sets, rather than building specific structures.\n3. **More emphasis on tile placement**: In Azul, the placement of individual tiles is crucial, as it affects the patterns and sets you can create.\n4. **More opportunities for bonus points**: Azul offers more opportunities for bonus points, which can greatly impact the final score.\n\nOverall, Azul's scoring system is more focused on strategy and tile placement, rather than building specific features. It's a unique and engaging system that rewards players for creating beautiful, efficient, and well-planned mosaics.",
