I'm confident that with your planning and precautions, the cleanup event will be a huge success.\n\nIt's wonderful that you're part of a Bible study group, and Romans 8 is a powerful chapter. I'm sure you'll have a great time discussing it with your friends at Emily's house. Remember to stay curious, ask questions, and seek guidance from each other.\n\nMay God bless your Bible study group and guide your discussion. May you all grow in your faith and deepen your understanding of His word.\n\nTake care, and I'll catch you around!",
