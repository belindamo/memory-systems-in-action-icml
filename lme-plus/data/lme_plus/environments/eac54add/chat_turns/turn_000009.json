Marigolds and sunflowers are excellent choices, and here are some other flowers that can attract beneficial insects:\n\n**Pollinator-Friendly Flowers:**\n\n* **Bee Balm (Monarda didyma):** Attracts bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds with its red, pink, or purple flowers.\n* **Lavender (Lavandula spp.):** Attracts bees, butterflies, and hoverflies with its calming, fragrant flowers.\n* **Zinnias (Zinnia spp.):** Attracts bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds with their bright, colorful flowers.\n* **Cosmos (Cosmos bipinnatus):** Attracts bees, butterflies, and hoverflies with their dainty, feathery flowers.\n* **Dahlias (Dahlia spp.):** Attracts bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds with their showy, pom-pom-like flowers.\n\n**Beneficial Insect-Attracting Flowers:**\n\n* **Dill (Anethum graveolens):** Attracts ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and other pests.\n* **Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare):** Attracts ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, similar to dill.\n* **Calendula (Calendula officinalis):** Attracts ladybugs, lacewings, and hoverflies, which prey on aphids and other pests.\n* **Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus):** Attracts aphid-eating insects like lacewings and hoverflies.\n* **Borage (Borago officinalis):** Attracts beneficial insects like bees and predatory wasps.\n\n**Tips for Incorporating Flowers into Your Garden:**\n\n* Plant a variety of flowers that bloom at different times to provide a constant source of nectar and pollen for beneficial insects.\n* Choose flowers that are native to your region, as they'll be more attractive to local beneficial insects.\n* Plant flowers in clusters or groups to create a \"pollinator patch\" that's easy for beneficial insects to find.\n* Avoid using pesticides, which can harm or kill beneficial insects. Instead, adopt integrated pest management strategies that prioritize natural pest control methods.\n* Consider adding a water source, like a shallow dish or birdbath, to provide drinking water for beneficial insects.\n\nBy incorporating these flowers into your garden, you'll be creating a welcoming habitat for beneficial insects that can help with pest control and pollination.
