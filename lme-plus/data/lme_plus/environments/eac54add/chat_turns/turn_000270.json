I've been trying to improve my bird identification skills, and I think it's time for me to start carrying a field guide with me on my bird watching trips. By the way, I've been seeing a lot of birds in my backyard lately, especially since I installed a bird feeder and birdbath. I've seen House Sparrows, Mourning Doves, and Downy Woodpeckers visiting the feeder, and a Blue Jay even stopped by the birdbath for the first time on March 5th.",
