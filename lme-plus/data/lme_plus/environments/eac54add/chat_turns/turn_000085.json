  "content": "A complete miscarriage can happen without any symptoms or noticeable bleeding and cramping; this is called a missed miscarriage. In this case, the pregnancy has ended, but the body has not yet expelled the products of conception.\n\nA missed miscarriage is often diagnosed during a routine prenatal checkup or ultrasound, where no fetal heartbeat is detected, or the fetus appears smaller than expected.\n\nA complete miscarriage can also occur with symptoms, which typically include bleeding, cramping, and the passing of tissue from the uterus.\n\nThe exact cause of a miscarriage is often unknown, but it may occur due to chromosomal abnormalities, hormonal imbalances, or problems with the uterus or cervix. Other factors that can increase the risk of miscarriage include age, smoking, drug and alcohol use, certain chronic medical conditions like diabetes, and infections. It is important to note that the majority of miscarriages are beyond a person's control and are not caused by anything they did, ate, or thought.",
