  "content": "Balancing tone can be a delicate task, especially when combining drama and dark humor! Here are some tips to help you achieve a harmonious balance:\n\n1. **Know your audience**: Understanding who your target audience is will help you gauge how much humor to inject into your drama. If your film is geared towards a more mature audience, you may be able to get away with darker, edgier humor.\n2. **Use humor to contrast drama**: Dark humor can be an effective way to break the tension and provide relief in intense dramatic scenes. However, be careful not to undermine the emotional impact of the drama.\n3. **Make sure the humor is organic**: The humor should arise naturally from the characters and situations, rather than feeling forced or artificial. This will help the tone feel more authentic and balanced.\n4. **Use subtlety**: Dark humor can be powerful when used subtly. Avoid hitting your audience over the head with obvious jokes or one-liners. Instead, opt for more understated, dry humor.\n5. **Establish a consistent tone**: While you want to balance drama and humor, it's essential to establish a consistent tone throughout the film. This will help the audience know what to expect and invest in the story.\n6. **Test and refine**: Show your script to others and get feedback on the tone. Be open to making adjustments and refinements to find the right balance.\n\nAs for the Sundance Film Festival, yes, I'm familiar with it!
