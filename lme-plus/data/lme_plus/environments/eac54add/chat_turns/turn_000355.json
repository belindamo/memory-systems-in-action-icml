However, they'll do best in medium to bright indirect light. Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to become scorched.\n\n**Watering:** Snake Plants are drought-tolerant, but they still need some water. Water your Snake Plant:\n\n* Water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering is the most common cause of death in Snake Plants.\n* Water thoroughly, making sure the pot drains well to prevent waterlogged soil.\n* Watering once a week is a good starting point, but adjust based on your climate and potting mix. In the winter months, reduce watering to once every 2-3 weeks.\n* Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water.\n\n**Humidity:** Snake Plants prefer a relatively low humidity environment, around 40-50%. You can achieve this by placing the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles or using a humidifier.\n\n**Temperature:** Keep your Snake Plant in an area with a consistent temperature between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). Avoid placing it near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n\n**Fertilization:** Feed your Snake Plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n\n**Pruning:** Remove any dead or damaged leaves to maintain the plant's appearance and prevent the spread of disease. You can also trim off any brown or yellow tips.\n\n**Potting mix:** Use a well-draining potting mix to prevent waterlogged soil. A mix with perlite, vermiculite, or sand will help with drainage.\n\n**Pot size:** Snake Plants prefer to be slightly root-bound, so don't pot them up too quickly. Wait until the plant has outgrown its container or is showing signs of nutrient deficiency.\n\n**Propagation:** Snake Plants are easy to propagate through leaf cuttings or division. Simply cut off a healthy leaf, remove lower leaves, and plant it in a pot filled with moistened potting mix. Keep the soil consistently moist until roots develop.\n\nBy following these care tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a Snake Plant expert!\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
