  "content": "Exposure to certain chemicals can increase the risk of a complete miscarriage, although the exact chemicals and levels of exposure needed to cause a miscarriage are not always clear. Environmental factors like pollution, toxins and chemicals in the workplace, and exposures to chemicals in consumer products may increase the risk of miscarriage or other pregnancy complications.\n\nPregnant women should try to limit their exposure to chemicals as much as possible. They can do this by avoiding cigarette smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illicit drugs, which are well-known risks for pregnancy complications.\n\nTo help protect their pregnancy, pregnant women should also:\n\n- Avoid exposure to pesticides, insecticides, and other toxins from chemicals in the workplace, have protective gear like gloves, goggles, respiratory masks available as needed.\n- Avoid using harsh cleaning products that contain chemicals like ammonia, bleach or solvents, instead use cleaning products that are labeled safe for use in pregnancy.\n\n- Avoid exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury that are found in some fish, some types of pottery, and certain industrial exposures.\n\n- Use natural or organic personal care products, such as shampoos, soaps, and lotions, which contain fewer synthetic chemicals than conventional products.\n\nIt is important for pregnant individuals to discuss the potential risks of chemical exposures with their healthcare provider and take necessary precautions to avoid exposure to chemicals as much as possible.",
