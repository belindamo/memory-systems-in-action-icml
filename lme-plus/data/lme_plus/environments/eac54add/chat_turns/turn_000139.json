  "content": "Repotting is an essential part of plant care, and both Snake Plants and Peace Lilies will benefit from regular repotting. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Snake Plant Repotting:**\n\n* **Frequency:** Repot your Snake Plant every 2-3 years in the spring or summer when it becomes pot-bound. You can check if it's time to repot by gently removing the plant from its pot and inspecting the roots. If the roots have filled the pot and are circling, it's time to upgrade.\n* **Pot size:** Choose a pot that is only 1-2 sizes larger than the current one. Snake Plants prefer to be slightly root-bound, so don't go too big.\n* **Soil:** Use a fresh, well-draining potting soil, and gently remove any dead or damaged roots before repotting.\n* **Special considerations:** Snake Plants can be top-heavy, so make sure the new pot is heavy enough to prevent it from toppling over. You can also divide and propagate the plant during repotting, as Snake Plants can become quite large.\n\n**Peace Lily Repotting:**\n\n* **Frequency:** Repot your Peace Lily every 2-3 years in the spring or summer when it becomes pot-bound. Peace Lilies tend to outgrow their pots quickly, so keep an eye on the plant's size and adjust the pot size accordingly.\n* **Pot size:** Choose a pot that is 1-2 sizes larger than the current one. Peace Lilies prefer to have some room to grow, but don't like to be too root-bound.\n* **Soil:** Use a fresh, well-draining potting soil, and gently remove any dead or damaged roots before repotting.\n* **Special considerations:** Peace Lilies can be sensitive to root disturbance, so handle the roots gently during repotting. Also, make sure the new pot has good drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil.\n\n**General Repotting Tips:**\n\n* **Choose a healthy time:** Repot your plants during the growing season (spring and summer) when they're actively producing new growth.\n* **Water carefully:** Water your plants well before repotting to make the soil easier to handle.\n* **Handle with care:** Be gentle when handling the roots and stems to avoid damaging them.\n* **Monitor and adjust:** Keep an eye on your plants after repotting and adjust their care routine as needed.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to give your Snake Plant and Peace Lily the room they need to thrive. Happy repotting!",
