  "content": "The lifespan of an electric car battery depends on several factors, including its quality, usage, maintenance, and environmental conditions. In general, the battery of an electric car can last between 8-10 years or even more with proper care and usage.\n\nAdditionally, most electric car manufacturers offer a warranty on the battery for 8-10 years, which ensures that the battery will be replaced if it fails prematurely during that period.\n\nWhile electric car batteries may require replacement eventually, the cost of battery replacements is likely to decrease over time as the technology improves, and more volume is produced, reducing the cost per unit.\n\nTherefore, while you may incur a cost in replacing an electric car battery, it is unlikely to be a \"huge cost\" and should be considered as part of the regular maintenance cost of owning an electric vehicle.",
