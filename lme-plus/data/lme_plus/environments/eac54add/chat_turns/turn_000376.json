Here are some tips to help you sort and label your photos:\n\n1. **Create a folder structure**: Start by creating a main folder for your beach trip, and then create subfolders within it. You can organize them by:\n\t* Day (e.g., Friday, Saturday, Sunday)\n\t* Activity (e.g., Beach, Water Sports, Sunset, Foodie Fun)\n\t* Location (e.g., Beach, Airbnb, Local Attractions)\n\t* Category (e.g., Landscapes, Portraits, Wildlife)\n2. **Use descriptive file names**: Instead of leaving the default camera-generated file names, rename them to something more descriptive. For example:\n\t* \"2023-07-15_Beach_Sunset_1.jpg\"\n\t* \"Airbnb_Cozy_Living_Room.jpg\"\n\t* \"Surfing_Lesson_Teacher.jpg\"\n3. **Add keywords and tags**: Most photo management software, like Google Photos, Adobe Lightroom, or Apple Photos, allow you to add keywords and tags to your photos. This makes it easy to search for specific photos later. Use keywords like \"beach,\" \"sunrise,\" \"sand,\" \"water,\" \"friends,\" or \"family\" to help you quickly find related photos.\n4. **Create an album or collection**: Once you've organized your photos, create an album or collection that showcases your favorite shots. This will make it easy to share your photos with friends and family or relive the memories yourself.\n5. **Geotag your photos**: If your camera or phone has GPS capabilities, geotag your photos to associate them with specific locations. This will help you remember where each photo was taken.\n\nRegarding your cozy Airbnb, you might consider creating a separate folder or album just for those photos. You could include shots of the exterior, interior, and any unique features that made it special.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* Consider creating a \"Best of\" folder or album to showcase your favorite photos from the trip.\n* If you have a lot of similar photos (e.g., multiple shots of the same sunset), consider creating a \" burst\" or \"sequence\" folder to store them.\n* Don't forget to backup your photos to an external hard drive or cloud storage service to ensure they're safe and accessible in the future.\n\nI hope these tips help you organize your beach trip photos and relive the wonderful memories of your getaway!",
