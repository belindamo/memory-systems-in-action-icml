  "content": "That's amazing! Attending Sundance is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the film industry, network with other creatives, and get inspired by the latest cinematic trends. It's even more special that you got to catch up with an old friend from film school who's now working as a programmer for the festival. Those connections can be invaluable in the industry!\n\nSeeing \"The Whale\" and \"Women Talking\" on the big screen must have been an incredible experience. Both films are thought-provoking and emotionally resonant, and I'm sure they sparked some interesting conversations and reflections.\n\nAs a programmer, your friend must have had some great insights into the festival selection process and what makes a film stand out. Did you get a chance to pick their brain about what they look for in a submission or any trends they're seeing in the industry?\n\nAlso, what were some of your favorite films or discoveries from the festival? Were there any standout performances, directors, or cinematographers that caught your attention?",
