Just last week, I bought a new pair of sneakers from Adidas on the 10th, and then I got a discount code for 20% off on my birthday, which is on the 12th, so I ended up buying a new handbag from Coach on the 15th. Can you help me find a way to keep tabs on my spending?"

Adidas sneakers: Purchased on 10th (amount spent: ?)\n2. Coach handbag: Purchased on 15th with 20% discount (amount spent: ?)\n\nTo help you track your expenses, I recommend using one of the following methods:\n\n**Option 1: Spreadsheets**\n\nCreate a simple spreadsheet with columns for:\n\n* Date\n* Store/Website\n* Item(s) purchased\n* Amount spent\n* Discount/Coupon used (if applicable)\n\nYou can use Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to create a spreadsheet. Update it regularly with each new purchase.\n\n**Option 2: Budgeting Apps**\n\nConsider using a budgeting app like:\n\n* Mint: Connects to your bank accounts and credit cards to track expenses.\n* Personal Capital: Tracks income and expenses, including online shopping.\n* Spendee: A user-friendly app for tracking daily expenses.\n\nThese apps can help you categorize your purchases, set budgets, and receive alerts when you go over budget.\n\n**Option 3: Browser Extensions**\n\nBrowser extensions like:\n\n* CamelCamelCamel (for Amazon purchases)\n* PriceZombie (for tracking price history)\n* Honey (for finding discounts and tracking expenses)\n\ncan help you track your online shopping expenses and provide price history and discount alerts.\n\n**Tips to stay on top of your expenses:**\n\n1. Set a budget for online shopping each month.\n2. Use cashback or rewards credit cards for online purchases.\n3. Avoid impulse buying by implementing a 30-day waiting period before making non-essential purchases.\n4. Unsubscribe from promotional emails to reduce temptation.\n5. Review your bank statements regularly to ensure accuracy.\n\nWhich method appeals to you, or do you have another system in mind?"
