I've heard great things about the musical, and I've been listening to the soundtrack of The Book of Mormon since March 1st, 2022, which has a similar irreverent and over-the-top style. I'm hoping to score tickets to a touring production of The Book of Mormon soon, and I think Moulin Rouge! might be a great fit for me as well.",
