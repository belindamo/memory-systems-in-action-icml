Twist your torso to left and right, touching your hands to the ground each time. (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n\n**3. Leg raises**: Lie on your back with arms extended overhead and legs straight. Lift your legs off the ground, keeping them straight, and hold for 1-2 seconds. (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n\n**4.
