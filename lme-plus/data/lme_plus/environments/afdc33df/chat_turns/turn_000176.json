  "content": "The music video for \"The Only Exception\" was directed by Brandon Chesbro and features the band performing in a large, ornate room. The video also tells the story of a young couple, played by actors Danielle Andrade and Logan Huffman, who experience ups and downs in their relationship.\n\nIn an interview with MTV, Hayley Williams explained that the concept for the video was inspired by the introspective nature of the song. She says, \"We wanted to create a video that was more about universal love than it was about personal love.\" Williams also noted that she had been a fan of Chesbro's work and was excited to work with him on the project.\n\nChesbro himself has said that he was drawn to the song's melancholic tone and wanted to create a dream-like atmosphere for the video. He specifically chose the location, a grand mansion in Wilmington, North Carolina, to give the video a \"European, classic architecture\" feel.\n\nOverall, the music video for \"The Only Exception\" has been well-received for its emotional depth and storytelling.",
