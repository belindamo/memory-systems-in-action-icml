I've been watching a lot of TV shows lately, especially The Great and Bridgerton, which have amazing costumes and production design that remind me of the grandness of live theater. I binge-watched The Great's second season from December 18th to 22nd, 2021, and finished Bridgerton's second season on April 10th, 2022.",
