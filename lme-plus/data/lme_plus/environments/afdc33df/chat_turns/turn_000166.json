  "content": "To calculate the total number of households or families attending the reunion, you can use a formula that groups the guests by their last name and counts the unique last names. Here's a formula you can use:\n\n**Formula:**\n\n=SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(MATCH(B:B, B:B, 0), MATCH(B:B, B:B, 0))>0, 1))\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `MATCH` function finds the relative position of each last name in the range `B:B` within the same range.\n2. The `FREQUENCY` function calculates the frequency of each last name in the range.\n3. The `IF` function checks if the frequency is greater than 0, meaning the last name is unique.\n4. The `SUM` function adds up the number of unique last names, giving you the total number of households or families.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* Column B contains the last names of the guests.\n* Guests with the same last name are considered part of the same household or family.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose you have the following data in column B:\n\n| Last Name |\n| --- |\n| Smith |\n| Smith |\n| Johnson |\n| Johnson |\n| Johnson |\n| Williams |\n| Williams |\n| Davis |\n| Davis |\n| Davis |\n| Brown |\n\nThe formula would return a result of 5, indicating that there are 5 households or families attending the reunion: Smith, Johnson, Williams, Davis, and Brown.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If you have guests with different last names within the same household (e.g., a married couple with different last names), you may need to modify the formula to group them together.\n* You can also use this formula to count the number of households or families that have responded positively to the invitation by adding a criteria to the formula, such as `=SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(MATCH(B:B, B:B, 0), MATCH(B:B, B:B, 0))>0, IF(J:J=\"Responded Yes\", 1)))`\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
