Here's a suggested template:\n\n| Relative's Name | Relationship to You | Address | Phone Number | Email | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| John Smith | Uncle | 123 Main St | 555-1234 | [john.smith@email.com](mailto:john.smith@email.com) |  |\n| Rachel Johnson | Cousin | 456 Elm St | 555-5678 | [rachel.johnson@email.com](mailto:rachel.johnson@email.com) | 16 years old |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nYou can add more columns or rows as needed, and sort the list by name, relationship, or any other category that's helpful to you.\n\n**Option 2: Online Family Tree Tools**\n\nThere are many online tools that allow you to create a family tree and keep track of relatives, such as:\n\n* Ancestry.com\n* FamilySearch.org\n* MyHeritage.com\n* FamilyTreeMaker.com\n\nThese tools often have features like contact information, photos, and notes, which can be helpful for your family reunion planning.\n\n**Option 3: Paper-Based Template**\n\nIf you prefer a low-tech approach, you can create a paper-based template using a notebook or a printable worksheet. Here's an example:\n\n**Family Reunion Invitation List**\n\n**Parent's Name:** [Your Dad's Name]\n\n**Relative's Name** | **Relationship to You** | **Address** | **Phone Number** | **Email** | **Notes**\n---------------------|----------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|----------\nJohn Smith | Uncle |  |  |  |\nRachel Johnson | Cousin |  |  |  | 16 years old\n... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...\n\nYou can print out multiple copies of this template and fill them out by hand.\n\nWhichever option you choose, be sure to include columns or sections for the following information:\n\n* Relative's name\n* Relationship to you (e.g., parent, sibling, cousin, aunt, uncle, etc.)\n* Address\n* Phone number\n* Email address\n* Any notes or special instructions (e.g., \"Rachel is 16, please include her in the youth activities\")\n\nRemember to update your list regularly as you gather more information, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance!",
