The meanings and values that people attach to this flower are shaped by social, cultural, and political factors, which are constantly changing in response to new historical events and global trends.\n\nFor example, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic may change the way people celebrate and appreciate the blooming of Sakura, as public gatherings may be limited or canceled in some areas. On the other hand, the increasing interest in environmental sustainability and the protection of natural resources may lead to more efforts to preserve and protect Sakura trees and other natural beauty.\n\nAdditionally, as global communication and cultural exchange continue to increase, the meanings and values of Sakura may become even more diverse and complex, reflecting the different perspectives and experiences of people from different countries and cultures. Overall, it is likely that the cultural significance of Sakura will continue to evolve and adapt to the changing times, while still retaining its beauty and symbolic value.",
