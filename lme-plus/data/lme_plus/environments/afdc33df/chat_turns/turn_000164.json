  "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nAssuming your spreadsheet is set up with the columns I suggested earlier, here are some formulas you can use to automatically count the number of guests, kids, and adults:\n\n**Formula 1: Total Guests**\n\n=COUNTA(B:B)\n\nThis formula counts the number of cells in column B (First Name) that contain data, giving you the total number of guests.\n\n**Formula 2: Total Kids**\n\n=COUNTIFS(I:I, \"<18\")\n\nAssuming you've added an \"Age\" column (I), this formula counts the number of cells in column I that contain a value less than 18, giving you the total number of kids.\n\n**Formula 3: Total Adults**\n\n=COUNTIFS(I:I, \">17\")\n\nThis formula counts the number of cells in column I that contain a value greater than or equal to 18, giving you the total number of adults.\n\n**Formula 4: Total Responded Yes**\n\n=COUNTIFS(J:J, \"Responded Yes\")\n\nAssuming you've added an \"RSVP Status\" column (J), this formula counts the number of cells in column J that contain the exact text \"Responded Yes\", giving you the total number of guests who have responded positively.\n\nYou can place these formulas in separate cells, such as cells A1, A2, A3, and A4, to display the results.\n\n**Example:**\n\n| Formula | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| =COUNTA(B:B) | 25 |\n| =COUNTIFS(I:I, \"<18\") | 5 |\n| =COUNTIFS(I:I, \">17\") | 20 |\n| =COUNTIFS(J:J, \"Responded Yes\") | 18 |\n\nIn this example, the spreadsheet has 25 total guests, 5 kids, 20 adults, and 18 guests who have responded positively.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to adjust the column letters (e.g., B, I, J) to match your actual spreadsheet column letters.\n* If you want to count specific age ranges (e.g., 5-12, 13-17), you can modify the COUNTIFS formulas accordingly.\n* You can also use these formulas as a starting point to create more complex calculations, such as calculating the total number of guests by generation or relationship.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with tracking your family reunion guests!",
