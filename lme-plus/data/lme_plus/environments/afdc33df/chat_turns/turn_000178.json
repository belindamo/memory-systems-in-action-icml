  "content": "The idea of incorporating a string section in \"The Only Exception\" was the brainchild of producer Rob Cavallo. Cavallo has worked with numerous renowned artists, including Green Day, My Chemical Romance, and Goo Goo Dolls, and has produced multiple albums for Paramore, including \"Brand New Eyes,\" which features \"The Only Exception.\"\n\nIn an interview with Alternative Press, Hayley Williams credited Cavallo for introducing the idea of a string section to the song. Williams said that the original demo of the song was more of a \"straight-up ballad,\" but Cavallo suggested adding the strings to give it a more \"timeless,\" cinematic feel.\n\nThe strings were recorded separately from the main instrumental parts of the song, and Cavallo has explained that he deliberately made them prominent in the mix to create a sense of \"heightened emotion.\" The strings can be heard throughout the song but are most prominent in the chorus and bridge.\n\nOverall, the addition of the string section has been widely praised for adding an extra layer of depth and emotion to an already poignant song.",
