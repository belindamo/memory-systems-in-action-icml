Start with a weight that you can handle: It's important to start with a weight that's appropriate for your strength level. Lifting weights that are too heavy can lead to improper form and injury. 2. Focus on maintaining proper posture: Keep your shoulders back and down, and avoid arching your back or hunching your shoulders. Maintain a neutral spine throughout the exercise. 3. Use a full range of motion: Make sure to move through the full range of motion for each exercise. This helps to ensure that you're targeting the right muscles and reducing the risk of injury. 4. Breathe properly: Exhale as you lift the weight and inhale as you lower it. This helps to maintain steady breathing and control throughout the exercise. 5. Use a spotter: If you're working with heavy weights, it's always a good idea to have a spotter nearby to assist you if needed. Remember, safety should always come first when lifting weights. If you are unsure about proper form, seek guidance from a certified strength and conditioning coach or personal trainer.",
