  "content": "Yes, the noise and traffic of a busy airport can be a significant annoyance for people living nearby, especially during peak travel times. However, airport authorities are increasingly implementing measures to address these issues, such as better sound insulation and noise mitigation programs, along with sustainable transportation options for travelers. Additionally, proximity to the airport also brings significant economic benefits, as we discussed earlier. It is important to strike a balance between economic growth and quality of life concerns.
