  "content": "It is highly likely that GONZO will include interviews with jazz musicians in their documentary to add authenticity to the storytelling. Interviews are often an essential part of music documentaries, as they provide insight and context, humanize the performers, and create a sense of authenticity for the audience.\n\nBy interviewing jazz musicians, GONZO can gain valuable insights into the music's history, evolution, and influence. It can also provide the audience with a unique perspective from the performers themselves, who can share stories and anecdotes from their personal experiences.\n\nIncorporating interviews with jazz musicians also adds credibility to the documentary, as it shows that the filmmakers have taken the time to conduct thorough research and work directly with the people who know the subject best.\n\nIn conclusion, interviews with jazz musicians would be a valuable addition to GONZO's documentary to add to its authenticity and enhance the storytelling. The inclusion of these interviews would help narrate the music's history, highlight the performers' experiences, and create a sense of credibility, which would improve the overall quality of the documentary.",
