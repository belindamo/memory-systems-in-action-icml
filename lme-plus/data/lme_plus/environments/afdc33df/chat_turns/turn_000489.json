  "content": "The cognitive functions are a set of psychological processes that are used by individuals to perceive, process, and understand information. These functions can be organized into a hierarchy, known as the cognitive stack, which reflects the order in which they are typically used. The cognitive stack is a key concept in the theory of personality type, developed by Carl Jung and popularized by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). According to this theory, each person has a preferred cognitive stack, which is based on their personality type.\n\nThe four cognitive functions in the cognitive stack are:\n\n1. Sensing (S) function: This function is concerned with collecting and processing information about the physical world. It is oriented towards the present and focuses on facts and details. People who prefer the sensing function are practical, down-to-earth, and focused on the here and now.\n2. Intuition (N) function: This function is concerned with processing information about patterns, possibilities, and the future. It is oriented towards the future and focuses on abstract ideas and concepts. People who prefer the intuition function are imaginative, innovative, and forward-thinking.\n3. Thinking (T) function: This function is concerned with logical analysis and decision-making. It is objective and impersonal, and focuses on evaluating information based on its logical consistency. People who prefer the thinking function are logical, analytical, and objective.\n4. Feeling (F) function: This function is concerned with values and emotions, and is oriented towards interpersonal relationships. It is subjective and personal, and focuses on evaluating information based on its emotional impact. People who prefer the feeling function are empathetic, sensitive, and attuned to the feelings of others.\n\nEach person has a preferred way of using each of these functions, and these preferences are reflected in their personality type according to the MBTI. For example, someone who prefers the sensing function may be classified as an ISTJ (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging) type, while someone who prefers the intuition function may be classified as an ENFP (Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving) type.",
