This can lead to a significant increase in screen time, especially if you're watching Reels repeatedly or spending a lot of time editing and perfecting your own videos.\n* Potential for mindless scrolling: Instagram Reels can be addictive, and it's easy to get sucked into a vortex of scrolling through videos without realizing how much time has passed.\n\n**Engaging with a new fashion influencer:**\n\n* Increased screen time: Following a new influencer means you'll likely be spending more time on Instagram, scrolling through their feed, watching their stories, and reading their captions. This can lead to an increase in screen time, especially if you're checking their account frequently.\n* Potential for comparison and FOMO: Following a fashion influencer can lead to feelings of comparison and FOMO (fear of missing out), which can cause you to spend more time on social media, trying to keep up with the latest trends or feeling like you need to purchase certain products.\n\n**Organizing WhatsApp groups:**\n\n* Temporary increase in screen time: Organizing 50 WhatsApp groups is a significant task, and it's likely you spent a lot of time on your phone doing so. However, once you've organized your groups, your screen time might decrease as you'll be more efficient in managing your conversations.\n* Potential for reduced distractions: On the other hand, having organized groups might help you reduce distractions and minimize the time you spend on WhatsApp, as you'll be able to quickly find the conversations that matter and avoid unnecessary notifications.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of your screen time, consider tracking your activities for a week or two. You can use built-in features like Screen Time on iOS or Digital Wellbeing on Android, or third-party apps like RescueTime or Moment. This will give you a clear picture of how much time you're spending on social media, and which apps are taking up the most time.\n\nRemember, being aware of your screen time is the first step to making positive changes. You can then set boundaries, goals, and limits for yourself to ensure you're using social media in a way that aligns with your values and priorities.",
