To better understand your situation and provide the most appropriate advice, I have a few questions for you:\n\n1. How many teachers are you looking to include in this team?\n2. What are the key subjects or areas of focus you want the team to cover?\n3. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the available teachers in your school?\n4. Are there any specific challenges or goals you have for this team (e.g., improving student engagement, addressing a particular learning need, etc.)?\n5.
