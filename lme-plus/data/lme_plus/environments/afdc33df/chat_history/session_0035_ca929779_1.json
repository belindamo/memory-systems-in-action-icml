The crunchy veggies complement the creamy hummus perfectly.\n\n**2.

Mediterranean Delight: Cucumber, Cherry Tomato, and Red Onion with Tzatziki Sauce**\nThe cool, refreshing flavor of tzatziki (a Greek yogurt-based sauce with cucumber, garlic, and dill) pairs beautifully with the crunchy veggies.\n\n**4. Spicy Kick: Carrot, Jicama, and Red Bell Pepper with Spicy Roasted Red Pepper Dip**\nThe sweetness of the carrot and jicama balances out the heat from the spicy dip, made with roasted red peppers, garlic, and chili flakes.\n\n**5. Fresh Fusion: Zucchini, Yellow Squash, and Cherry Tomato with Lemon-Herb Yogurt Dip**\nThe light, refreshing flavor of the lemon-herb yogurt dip complements the delicate taste of the summer squash and cherry tomatoes.\n\n**6. Crunchy Delight: Celery, Apple, and Carrot with Almond Butter**\nA sweet and savory combination, the crunchy apple and celery pair nicely with the creamy almond butter.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Offer a variety of dips to cater to different tastes and dietary restrictions.\n* Consider adding some crudit\u00e9s like broccoli, cauliflower, or snap peas to the selection.\n* For a fun twist, serve the dips in small mason jars or ramekins with a label or a flag indicating the flavor.\n* If you want to add some extra flavor, sprinkle some fresh herbs like parsley, basil, or dill on top of the veggie sticks.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create a delicious and healthy snack spread for your brunch guests!"
