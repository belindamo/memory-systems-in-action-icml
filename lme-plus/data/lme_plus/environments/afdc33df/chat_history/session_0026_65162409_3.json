      "content": "Once is a beautiful and intimate musical that explores complex emotions through its music. The soundtrack's focus on acoustic instruments and poetic lyrics creates a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere that resonates deeply.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've been enjoying the Dear Evan Hansen soundtrack! The music in Dear Evan Hansen is indeed very introspective and emotional, and it's no surprise that you'd be drawn to Once's similar tone.
