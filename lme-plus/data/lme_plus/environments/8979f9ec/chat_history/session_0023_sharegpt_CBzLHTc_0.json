      "content": "Let's consider the Linux operating system as the opted one.\n\n1. Non-centralized application: Linux is an open-source operating system, which means that its source code is publicly available and can be modified by anyone. This leads to a non-centralized approach to applications, as developers from all over the world can contribute to the development and improvement of applications, resulting in a diverse and constantly evolving software ecosystem.\n\nMerits:\n\n* Encourages collaboration and innovation\n* Provides access to a large number of free and open-source applications\n\nShortcomings:\n\n* Lack of a central authority may result in lower quality control and compatibility issues\n* The abundance of choices can be overwhelming for some users\n2. Full access: In Linux, the user has full access to the system and its components, including the operating system and all installed applications. This means that users can modify and customize the system to meet their specific needs and requirements.\n\nMerits:\n\n* High degree of control and customization\n* Allows for troubleshooting and fixing issues\n\nShortcomings:\n\n* Higher degree of technical expertise is required to make full use of the system\n* Increased risk of security and stability issues if used improperly\n3. Licensing freedom: Linux is distributed under various open-source licenses, which means that users are free to use, modify, and distribute the operating system and its components.\n\nMerits:\n\n* Freedom to use the operating system for any purpose\n* Ability to make changes to the operating system and its components\n\nShortcomings:\n\n* Some users may prefer the commercial support offered by proprietary operating systems\n* Lack of central authority may result in compatibility issues between different distributions\n4. Partial hardware support: Linux supports a wide range of hardware, but may not have native drivers for all devices. This means that some hardware may not work as well or may not work at all with Linux.\n\nMerits:\n\n* Large community of developers working on hardware support\n* Lower hardware requirements compared to some other operating systems\n\nShortcomings:\n\n* Lack of support for some hardware devices\n* Compatibility issues with some older or less common hardware devices\n5. Multi-layered run levels: Linux uses run levels to control system operations and the services that are started at boot time. Different run levels correspond to different modes of operation, such as single-user mode, system maintenance mode, and multiuser mode.\n\nMerits:\n\n* Allows for easy customization of system behavior\n* Enables flexibility and control over system operations\n\nShortcomings:\n\n* Requires understanding of the run level system and its associated services\n* Some users may prefer a more straightforward approach to system operation."
