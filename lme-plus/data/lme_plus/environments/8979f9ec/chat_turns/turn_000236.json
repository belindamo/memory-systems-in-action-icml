Several community organizations and stakeholders have expressed support for the city's strategic plan focused on equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), highlighting the importance of creating a more inclusive and equitable city.\n\nMoreover, the community has also appreciated the city's efforts to engage with them and gather feedback on service delivery. Brampton's financial assistance programs and accessible transportation options have also been praised for their effectiveness in helping low-income residents and individuals with disabilities access essential services.\n\nHowever, there is still a long way to go in fully addressing issues of equity and access in the provision of regional services. The city must continue to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable service delivery model, and it will need to continue engaging with communities to ensure that their needs and concerns are being met.",
