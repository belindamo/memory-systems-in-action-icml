However, both Breaking Bad and Stranger Things are highly acclaimed and widely popular TV shows that have garnered critical and commercial success, so it depends on your personal preferences. Breaking Bad is a crime drama that follows a high school chemistry teacher who begins producing and selling methamphetamine after he is diagnosed with cancer. Stranger Things, on the other hand, is a science fiction-horror series set in the 1980s that explores mysterious events and supernatural forces in a small town. Both series have loyal fan bases and are highly bingeable, so you can't go wrong with either choice.",
