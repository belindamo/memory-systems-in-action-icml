I recently found an old, rare vinyl record of The Beatles' \"Please Please Me\" album at a garage sale, and I got it for $10. After researching online, I found out it's worth around $100 to $200. I'm planning to list it on Discogs soon. Do you have any tips on how to take good photos and write an accurate description to attract potential buyers?",
