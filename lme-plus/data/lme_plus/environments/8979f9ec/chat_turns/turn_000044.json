  "content": "Here are a few studies that report coefficients of friction between animal manure and plastic surfaces:\n\n1. Zhang, G., Zhu, J., & Zhu, S. (2011). Coefficient of friction of dairy manure against plastic surfaces. Transactions of the ASABE, 54(2), 515-521.\n2. Wu, Z., Chen, Y., Cai, Z., & Zhou, S. (2019). Study on the friction characteristics of cow manure and plastic surface. IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 611(1), 012058.\n3. Chen, Y., Cai, Z., Wu, Z., Li, Y., & Zhou, S. (2020). Experimental study on the friction characteristics of pig manure and plastic surface. Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1643(1), 012112.\n4. Ogunjimi, L. A., & Womac, A. R. (2009). Frictional properties of poultry litter: a preliminary study. Applied Engineering in Agriculture, 25(2), 215-220.\n\nThese studies provide information on the coefficient of friction for different types of animal manure and plastic surfaces. However, it is worth noting that the specific coefficient of friction in a given situation may be different due to variations in factors such as moisture content and surface roughness.",
