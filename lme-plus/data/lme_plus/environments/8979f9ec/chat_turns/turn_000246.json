  "content": "I'm glad you're taking proactive steps to prepare for your thesis defense!\n\nHowever, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal information or university's specific deadlines. I'm a conversational AI, I don't have the ability to know your personal schedule or university's requirements.\n\nI recommend checking your university's graduate school website, thesis guidelines, or contacting your thesis advisor, Dr. Smith, to confirm the exact deadline for your thesis defense. They can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nIn the meantime, it's great that you're thinking ahead and preparing early. You can start reviewing your research, organizing your notes, and outlining your defense presentation. This will help you feel more confident and prepared when the time comes.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be over-prepared than under-prepared for your thesis defense. Good luck, and I hope everything goes smoothly!",
