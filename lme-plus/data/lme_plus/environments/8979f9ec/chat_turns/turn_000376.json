Swans - Swans have been pushing musical boundaries since the early 1980s, and their sound has evolved dramatically over the years. They're known for creating intense, hypnotic soundscapes that challenge the listener in every way possible. If you're looking for something that's edgy and confrontational, try their 2014 album \"To Be Kind\".\n\n2. Xiu Xiu - Xiu Xiu is the brainchild of Jamie Stewart, and their music is characterized by its dark, experimental soundscapes and emotional intensity. If you're looking for something that's both avant-garde and emotionally powerful, try their 2017 album \"FORGET\".\n\n3. Arca - Venezuelan-born producer Arca creates music that's both experimental and emotionally visceral, often blurring the lines between genres and exploring the possibilities of sound. Try her 2020 self-titled album \"KiCk i\" for a taste of her unique style.\n\n4. Death Grips - Death Grips' music is a unique blend of abrasive noise, industrial beats, and MC Ride's aggressive, confrontational delivery. Their music has been described as \"hyper-aggressive\" and \"acutely aware of how far it can push listeners\". If you're looking for something edgy that's guaranteed to make a statement, try their 2012 album \"The Money Store\".\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or would like more specific recommendations in the avant-garde vein.",
