You can also sow them on the surface and rake them in lightly.\n2. **Spacing**: Plant marigold seeds about 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) apart. As they grow, you can thin them out to about 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) apart to allow for good air circulation and sunlight penetration.\n3. **Soil temperature**: Marigolds can tolerate a wide range of soil temperatures, but they prefer warmer soil. Wait until the soil has warmed up to at least 60\u00b0F (15\u00b0C) before planting.\n4. **Lighting**: Marigolds love full sun, so choose a location that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.\n5. **Watering**: Keep the soil consistently moist during the first few weeks after planting. Once established, marigolds are relatively drought-tolerant, but they'll still appreciate regular watering.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Marigolds are easy to direct sow, and they germinate quickly, usually within 7-10 days.\n* Marigolds come in a variety of sizes and colors, so make sure to check the specific instructions on the seed packet for any specific growing requirements.\n* Marigolds are natural repellents for nematodes, whiteflies, and other pests that can harm tomatoes, so plant them around the perimeter of your tomato bed for added protection.\n* Deadhead marigold flowers regularly to encourage more blooms and prevent seed production.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to grow vibrant and pest-repelling marigolds around your tomatoes!\n\nHappy planting, and I hope you enjoy the benefits of companion planting!",
