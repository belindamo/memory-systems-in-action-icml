For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.\"\n4. **Luke 15:11-24** - The Parable of the Prodigal Son, a powerful story of forgiveness and new beginnings.\n5. **Micah 7:19** - \"You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.\"\n\n**Prayers:**\n\n1. **The Prayer of Saint Francis**: \"Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.

Amen.\"\n3. **A Prayer for New Beginnings**: \"Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the opportunity to start anew. Help me to leave my past behind and walk in your light. Guide me on the path of righteousness and give me the courage to follow your will. Amen.\"\n\n**Reflection Questions:**\n\n1. What areas of my life do I need to forgive myself or others?\n2. How can I apply the concept of new beginnings to my daily life?\n3. What are some ways I can demonstrate God's love and forgiveness to others?\n\nRemember, forgiveness and new beginnings are not one-time events, but rather ongoing processes.
