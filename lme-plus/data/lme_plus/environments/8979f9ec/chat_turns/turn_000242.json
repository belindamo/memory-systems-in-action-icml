Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Digital Note-taking Apps:**\n\t* Evernote: Allows you to create notebooks, tags, and stacks to organize your research journal entries. You can also search and filter your notes using keywords.\n\t* OneNote: Similar to Evernote, OneNote offers notebooks, sections, and tags to help you categorize your entries.\n\t* Simplenote: A minimalistic note-taking app that allows you to tag and pin important notes.\n2. **Research-specific Tools:**\n\t* Trello: A project management tool that uses boards, lists, and cards to organize your research journal entries. You can create boards for different topics, lists for subtopics, and cards for individual entries.\n\t* Zotero: A citation management tool that also allows you to take notes and organize them using tags, collections, and folders.\n\t* Mendeley: A reference manager that offers a notes feature, which you can organize using tags, folders, and filters.\n3. **Tagging and Categorization Systems:**\n\t* Tagcrowd: A web-based tool that helps you create a visual representation of your tags and categories, making it easier to identify patterns and relationships.\n\t* Coggle: A diagramming tool that allows you to create mind maps, flowcharts, and concept maps to visualize your research and categorize your entries.\n4. **Spreadsheets and Databases:**\n\t* Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel: Create a spreadsheet to organize your research journal entries using columns for date, topic, tags, and notes.\n\t* Airtable: A database tool that allows you to create custom tables, forms, and views to organize your research journal entries.\n5. **Paper-based Systems:**\n\t* Bullet Journal: A analog note-taking system that uses symbols, colors, and indexing to categorize and organize your entries.\n\t* Index Cards: Use physical index cards to write down your research journal entries, and organize them using tabs, stickers, or color-coding.\n\nExperiment with these tools and apps to find the one that best suits your research style and needs. Remember to choose a system that you enjoy using, as it will make it more likely that you'll stick to it and maintain your research journal.\n\nGood luck with your thesis proposal, and I hope these suggestions help you stay organized!",
