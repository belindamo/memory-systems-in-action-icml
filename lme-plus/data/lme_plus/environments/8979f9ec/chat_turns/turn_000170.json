But I can provide you with the information below.\n\nIf an extra is not able to complete a scene or perform as expected during filming, the production team may have several options to handle the situation. \n\nFirstly, they may attempt to coach or guide the extra to achieve the desired performance. This can be done by providing specific instructions, demonstrating the desired behavior, or offering feedback and encouragement.\n\nIf the extra is still unable to perform as expected, the production team may choose to replace the extra with another individual who can meet the requirements of the scene. This can be done by contacting an agency or casting service to find suitable replacements.\n\nLastly, if the extra is unable to complete the scene due to an unexpected emergency or illness, the production team may need to make adjustments to the script or schedule to accommodate the situation. This can involve rewriting the scene or rescheduling the shoot to a later date.",
