Here are some popular options that pair well with eggs:\n\n1. **Roasted bell peppers**: Sweet and smoky, roasted bell peppers add a pop of color and flavor to your frittata.\n2. **Caramelized onions**: Slow-cooked onions are sweet and savory, adding a rich flavor to your frittata.\n3. **Mushrooms**: Earthy mushrooms, especially cremini, shiitake, or a mix, work beautifully in a frittata. Try saut\u00e9ing them with garlic and thyme for added flavor.\n4. **Zucchini**: Grilled or saut\u00e9ed zucchini adds moisture and a hint of summer freshness to your frittata.\n5. **Spinach and kale**: Wilted greens like spinach and kale pack a nutritional punch and add a vibrant green color to your frittata.\n6. **Roasted sweet potatoes**: Diced sweet potatoes add a sweet, comforting element to your frittata.\n7. **Asparagus**: Blanched or grilled asparagus tips add a delicate, springtime flavor to your frittata.\n8. **Broccoli**: Steamed or saut\u00e9ed broccoli florets work well in a frittata, especially if you're looking for a nutrient-packed breakfast option.\n9. **Cauliflower**: Like broccoli, cauliflower is a great addition to a frittata, especially when roasted or saut\u00e9ed with garlic and lemon.\n10. **Garlic scapes**: If you have garlic scapes on hand, chop them up and add them to your frittata for an aromatic, savory flavor.\n\nFeel free to mix and match these veggies to create your perfect combination. A general rule of thumb is to use 1-2 cups of chopped veggies per 6-egg frittata.\n\nSome tips for making a great veggie frittata:\n\n* Use room temperature eggs for easier whisking and a fluffier frittata.\n* Don't overfill the skillet with veggies \u2013 leave some room for the eggs to set.\n* Don't overmix the egg mixture \u2013 you want to maintain the texture of the veggies.\n* Use a non-stick skillet or a well-seasoned cast-iron pan to prevent the frittata from sticking.\n* Let the frittata cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving \u2013 it'll be easier to slice and serve.\n\nI hope this helps! Do you have any favorite veggies you're excited to add to your frittata?",
