  "content": "Florence Nightingale's approach to nursing has remained relatively the same over time, with some updates and advances based on modern medical practices and technologies. Her emphasis on sanitation, hygiene, and personalized care are still considered essential aspects of nursing practice.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of new medical technologies, such as automated medical records and advanced diagnostic tests, nursing practice has evolved to integrate these technologies into patient care, while still adhering to Nightingale's core principles.\n\nAdditionally, the role of nurses has expanded beyond the traditional bedside care to include leadership positions, research, and advocacy. Despite these changes, Nightingale's approach to nursing continues to influence every aspect of the profession, and her legacy remains essential in shaping contemporary nursing practice.",
