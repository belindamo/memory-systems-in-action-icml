Here are some suggestions for table lamps and floor lamps that would work well:\n\n**Table Lamps:**\n\n1. **Task lamps**: Look for lamps with adjustable arms or heads that allow you to direct the light exactly where you need it. This will help you focus the light on your book or reading material.\n2. **Soft-shade lamps**: Lamps with soft, linen or silk shades can create a warm, cozy glow. Consider lamps with a rounded or oval shape to add to the cozy ambiance.\n3. **Ceramic or metal lamps**: Lamps made from ceramic or metal can add a warm, earthy feel to your reading nook. Look for lamps with a distressed or vintage finish to add character.\n\n**Floor Lamps:**\n\n1. **Floor lamps with soft shades**: Similar to table lamps, floor lamps with soft shades can create a cozy atmosphere. Look for lamps with a large, rounded shade to cast a warm glow.\n2. **Torchieres**: Torchieres are floor lamps that direct the light upward, creating a warm, ambient glow. They can add a cozy feel to your reading nook without being too harsh.\n3. **Adjustable arm floor lamps**: Floor lamps with adjustable arms can be directed to provide task lighting for your reading material, while also casting a warm glow around the room.\n\n**Lighting Tips:**\n\n1. **Warm white light**: Opt for lamps with warm white light (2700K-3000K) instead of cool white light (3500K-5000K). Warm white light is more flattering and easier on the eyes.\n2. **Dimmable**: Consider lamps with dimmer switches or install a dimmer outlet to adjust the light level to your liking.\n3. **Layered lighting**: Combine your lamp with natural light from the window or other light sources to create a layered, cozy atmosphere.\n\nSome popular brands for cozy lamps include:\n\n* Table lamps: Lumens, Crate & Barrel, West Elm\n* Floor lamps: Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, CB2\n\nRemember to choose a lamp that fits your personal style and the overall aesthetic of your reading nook.
