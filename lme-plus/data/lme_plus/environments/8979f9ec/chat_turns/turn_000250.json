However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I wasn't present at the academic writing workshop, and I don't recall Dr. Johnson's specific tips.\n\nBut don't worry! I can still provide you with some general tips and resources on how to structure a compelling introduction for your thesis:\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Start with a hook**: Grab the reader's attention with an interesting fact, statistic, or thought-provoking question.\n2. **Provide context**: Give the reader a brief overview of the research area, its significance, and its relevance to the field.\n3. **State the research question or problem**: Clearly articulate the central question or problem your thesis aims to address.\n4. **Preview the main arguments or findings**: Give the reader a sense of what to expect from your research and its contributions.\n5. **Establish your research gap**: Identify the gaps in current research and how your study aims to fill those gaps.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n1. **The Writing Center at UNC Chapel Hill**: Offers a comprehensive guide to writing a thesis introduction, including examples and tips.\n2. **Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL)**: Provides a detailed guide to writing a thesis introduction, including a sample introduction and exercises.\n3. **Thesis Whisperer**: A blog by Dr. Inger Mewburn, offering practical advice on writing a compelling thesis introduction.\n4. **How to Write a Thesis** by Rowena Murray: A book that provides guidance on writing a thesis, including a chapter on crafting a strong introduction.\n\nRemember, the key to a compelling introduction is to make it clear, concise, and engaging.
