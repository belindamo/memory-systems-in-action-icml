Congratulations on taking the initiative to share your passion with the world.\n\nFor recording software, there are several options suitable for beginners. Here are a few popular ones:\n\n1. **OBS Studio (Free)**: A popular, user-friendly, and free screen recording software that's great for beginners. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n2. **Audacity (Free)**: A free, open-source digital audio workstation (DAW) that's perfect for recording and editing audio. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n3. **GarageBand (Free for Mac users)**: A user-friendly DAW that comes pre-installed on Macs. It's great for beginners and can handle multitrack recording.\n4. **DaVinci Resolve (Free/Paid)**: A professional-level video editing software that also has a built-in audio recorder. It's free, with optional paid upgrades. Available for Windows and Mac.\n5. **Bandcamp (Paid)**: A user-friendly DAW specifically designed for musicians. It offers a free trial, and then it's $19.99/month or $199/year.\n\nFor beginners, I'd recommend starting with OBS Studio or Audacity, as they're both free and easy to use. OBS Studio is more geared towards screen recording, while Audacity is a more traditional DAW.\n\nBefore you start recording, make sure you have:\n\n* A good quality microphone (even a decent built-in laptop mic or a USB microphone like the Blue Yeti will do)\n* A camera (your smartphone's camera or a dedicated camera like a Canon EOS or GoPro)\n* Adequate lighting in your practice space\n* A tripod to stabilize your camera\n* A quiet practice space with minimal background noise\n\nWhen you're ready to record, simply:\n\n1. Set up your camera and microphone\n2. Open your chosen recording software\n3. Create a new project and set the input device to your microphone\n4. Press record and start playing!\n\nRemember to have fun and be yourself in front of the camera. Your enthusiasm and passion for drumming will shine through to your audience.\n\nDo you have any questions about setting up your recording equipment or using the software?",
