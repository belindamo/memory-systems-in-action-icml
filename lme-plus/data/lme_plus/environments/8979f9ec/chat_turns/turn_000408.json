Here are some tips to help you gather your digital receipts:\n\n1. **Search your inbox**: Use your email provider's search function to look for keywords like \"receipt,\" \"order confirmation,\" \"invoice,\" or \"purchase\" to find receipts in your inbox.\n2. **Check your spam folder**: Sometimes, receipts might end up in your spam folder, so make sure to check it as well.\n3. **Sort by date**: Sort your inbox by date to find receipts from a specific time period, like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.\n4. **Use filters**: If you use Gmail, you can create filters to automatically sort receipts into a specific label or folder. For example, you can create a filter that looks for emails with the word \"receipt\" in the subject line and applies a label called \"Receipts.\"\n5. **Check your promotions or social tabs**: If you use Gmail, check your Promotions or Social tabs, as some receipts might end up there.\n6. **Look for receipts in subfolders**: If you have subfolders in your inbox, check them as well, as some receipts might be hiding in there.\n7. **Check your email accounts**: If you have multiple email accounts, make sure to check each one for receipts.\n8. **Search your email clients**: If you use email clients like Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird, search for receipts within those applications as well.\n\nOnce you've gathered all your digital receipts, you can start uploading them to Shoeboxed or any other receipt management app you choose.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* If you've deleted some receipts, try checking your email trash or deleted items folder to see if they're still recoverable.\n* If you've made purchases through online marketplaces like Amazon or eBay, you can often find your receipts in your account history or order history sections.\n* Consider setting up a rule or filter in your email provider to automatically forward new receipts to your Shoeboxed email address (or any other receipt management app you choose).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to gather all your digital receipts and get them organized in no time!",
