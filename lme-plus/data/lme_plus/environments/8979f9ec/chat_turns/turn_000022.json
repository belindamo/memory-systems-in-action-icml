  "content": "I'm thinking of replacing some of the lights in my home with more energy-efficient options. I've been paying attention to my energy consumption lately and want to make some changes. By the way, I finally got around to fixing the one in my bedroom that had been broken for months - the switch wasn't working, but I replaced it and it's working great now. Can you recommend some good LED bulbs for the laundry room?",
