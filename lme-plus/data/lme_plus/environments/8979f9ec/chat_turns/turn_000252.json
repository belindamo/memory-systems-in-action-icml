  "content": "Crafting a good research question is a crucial step in the research process! While I don't recall Dr. Johnson's specific advice, I can offer some general tips on how to create a focused and specific research question:\n\n**Characteristics of a good research question:**\n\n1. **Specificity**: Avoid broad or vague questions. Instead, focus on a specific aspect of the topic.\n2. **Clarity**: Ensure your question is easy to understand and free of ambiguity.\n3. **Relevance**: Align your question with the research area and its significance.\n4. **Originality**: Aim to contribute something new to the existing body of knowledge.\n5. **Feasibility**: Ensure your question is answerable within the scope of your research and resources.\n\n**Tips to craft a good research question:**\n\n1. **Conduct preliminary research**: Read literature, explore existing studies, and identify gaps or areas that need further investigation.\n2. **Identify your research interests**: Reflect on what aspects of the topic fascinate or puzzle you.\n3. **Narrow down your focus**: Break down a broad topic into smaller, manageable parts.\n4. **Use open-ended questions**: Instead of yes/no questions, use open-ended questions that encourage exploration and inquiry.\n5. **Refine your question**: Iterate on your question, seeking feedback from peers, mentors, or experts in the field.\n\n**Examples of research questions:**\n\n1. What is the impact of social media on mental health in young adults?\n2. How does the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare affect patient outcomes?\n3. What are the effects of climate change on coastal ecosystems?\n\n**Resources:**\n\n1. **The Research Question**: A guide by the University of Toronto's Writing Centre, offering tips and examples for crafting a research question.\n2. **Developing a Research Question**: A tutorial by the University of California, Berkeley's Library, providing guidance on creating a focused research question.\n3. **Research Question Examples**: A collection of examples from various fields, provided by the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Writing Center.\n\nRemember, a well-crafted research question serves as the foundation for your entire research project. Take your time, and don't be afraid to refine your question as you delve deeper into your research.",
