  "content": "I'm on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn. My content is a mix of personal and professional stuff, like travel photos, quotes, and work-related updates. I post a variety of things, like photos, links, and status updates. I try to post at least once a week on each platform, but I've been more active on Twitter lately. My goal is to increase my following and engagement across all platforms. On Instagram, for example, I noticed that among all my beach photos, the one that got the most engagement had 57 likes and 15 comments.",
