Here are some tips to help you keep your shelf organized and dust-free:\n\n**Organizing Tips:**\n\n1. **Categorize and group:** As you mentioned, grouping by franchise is a great way to start. You can also consider grouping by theme, character, or release date.\n2. **Use dividers or separators:** Use dividers or separators to create distinct sections within your shelf, making it easier to navigate and preventing figurines from getting jumbled together.\n3. **Assign a home:** Designate a specific spot for each figurine, making it easier to find and return them to their designated spot.\n4. **Keep similar sizes together:** Grouping figurines of similar sizes together can create a visually appealing display and make it easier to dust.\n\n**Dust-Free Tips:**\n\n1. **Dust regularly:** Use a soft-bristled brush or a microfiber cloth to gently dust your figurines and shelf.

If possible, place your shelf away from direct sunlight or use UV-filtering glass.\n3. **Climate control:** Keep your shelf away from extreme temperatures, humidity, or moisture to prevent damage to your figurines.\n4. **Rotate your display:** Periodically rotate your figurines to create a fresh display and prevent fatigue.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep your collectible figurine shelf organized, dust-free, and looking its best!\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with your display.
