Indigenous people should be consulted on this and involved in the evaluation process.\n\n4. Develop culturally sensitive policies and programs: Policies and programs should be developed with an understanding of the cultural context of Indigenous communities.\n\n5. Develop long-term strategies: Supporting Indigenous communities requires long-term strategies that go beyond short-term election cycles or project funding. Governments should develop a long-term strategy that accounts for the complex and diverse needs of Indigenous peoples.\n\n6. Consistency in actions: Governments should ensure that their actions are aligned with their words.
