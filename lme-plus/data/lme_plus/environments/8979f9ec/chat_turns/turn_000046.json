  "content": "I apologize for the error in my previous response. I was mistaken and there does not appear to be a specific study on the coefficient of friction between dry chicken manure and plastic surface. I could not find any relevant research articles or studies on this specific topic. However, there are studies on the coefficient of friction between other types of animal manure and various surfaces, such as soil, concrete, and metal. These studies may provide some insight into the potential behavior of chicken manure on a plastic surface.\n\nOne study that might be relevant is \"Friction characteristics of dairy cattle manure on various surfaces\" by Brumm et al. (2004), which investigated the coefficient of friction between dairy cattle manure and several surfaces, including concrete, metal, and plastic. While this study did not specifically test chicken manure, it may still provide some useful information on the behavior of animal manure on different types of surfaces.\n\nHere is the citation for the study:\nBrumm, M. C., Cheng, H. W., & Stinn, J. P. (2004). Friction characteristics of dairy cattle manure on various surfaces. Applied Engineering in Agriculture, 20(5), 579-583.",
