  "content": "NGC's population reports are indeed more detailed and can be a valuable resource for researching the rarity of your coins. The extra detail can be well worth the potentially longer turnaround time, especially if you're trying to determine the scarcity of specific coins.\n\n**NGC's Population Report Advantages:**\n\n1. **More granular data:** NGC breaks down their population reports into more specific categories, such as:\n\t* Total graded population\n\t* Population by grade (e.g., MS-65, MS-66, etc.)\n\t* Population by mint mark (if applicable)\n\t* Population by variety (if applicable)\n\t* Census data (i.e., the number of coins graded at each level)\n2. **More detailed rarity information:** NGC's population reports provide a better understanding of the rarity of specific coins, which can help you:\n\t* Identify rare or scarce coins in your collection\n\t* Determine the potential value of your coins\n\t* Make informed buying and selling decisions\n3. **Better research capabilities:** With NGC's detailed population reports, you can:\n\t* Research the scarcity of specific coins and varieties\n\t* Identify trends and patterns in the population data\n\t* Compare the rarity of different coins and series\n\n**Turnaround Time Considerations:**\n\nWhile NGC's turnaround times can be longer than PCGS', it's essential to weigh the importance of the detailed population reports against the wait time. If you're willing to wait a few extra weeks for the more detailed information, it might be worth it.\n\n**Tips to Minimize Wait Times:**\n\n1. **Choose a faster tier:** NGC offers faster turnaround times for certain tiers, such as their \"Express\" or \"Rush\" services.\n2. **UseNGC's online submission tools:** NGC's online submission process can help streamline the process and reduce wait times.\n3. **Batch submissions:** Submitting multiple coins at once can help reduce the overall wait time per coin.\n\n**Ultimately, it's up to you:**\n\nIf you're willing to wait a bit longer for the more detailed population reports, NGC might be the better choice for you. However, if you need your coins graded quickly, PCGS might be a better fit. Consider your priorities and weigh the importance of the population reports against the wait time.",
