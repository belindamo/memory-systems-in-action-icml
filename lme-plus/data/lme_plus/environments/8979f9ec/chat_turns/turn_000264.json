I think you'll find that the \"Landscape\" profile and adjusting the white balance to \"Shade\" or \"Cloudy\" will give your beach scenes a nice warm and inviting tone.\n\nAnd yeah, the \"Portraits\" profile is a great starting point for your beach portraits. Just remember to adjust the settings to account for the bright, sunny conditions and to enhance the skin tones. You might also want to use the \"Spot Healing Brush\" or \"Clone Stamp\" tool to remove any blemishes or objects from the image.\n\nIf you want to take your beach portraits to the next level, you could also try using some of Lightroom's advanced tools, such as the \"Gradient Filter\" or \"Local Adjustments\" to add a warm glow or enhance the colors of the scene.\n\nMost importantly, have fun editing and experimenting with different looks and styles! It's all about finding the look that works best for your images and your personal style.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'm here to help. Happy editing!",
