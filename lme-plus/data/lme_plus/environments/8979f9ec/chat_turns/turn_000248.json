Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation, and I don't retain any information from previous chats.\n\nBut I'm happy to chat with you and provide guidance and support as you work on your thesis! It's great that you're aware of your progress and are hoping to make good headway before your defense. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need any help along the way!",
