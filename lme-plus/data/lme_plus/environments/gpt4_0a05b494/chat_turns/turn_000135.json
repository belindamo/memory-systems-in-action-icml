At that time, LeBron was still playing for the Los Angeles Lakers and was having a remarkable season, as usual. He's an incredible player, and it's no surprise that he continues to dominate the league even at an advanced age for an NBA player.\n\nHowever, if you want to know about his current performance, I recommend checking out the latest news and highlights on the NBA website, ESPN, or other sports websites. They'll have the most up-to-date information on his stats, games, and overall performance this season.",
