  "content": "Thank you so much! I think I'm going to need to take my own advice and remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. It's easy to get caught up in expectations and feel like I need to make a million new friends right away, but that's just not realistic.\n\nYou're right, the most important thing is to focus on building connections and having fun. I'm going to try to approach this meetup with an open mind and a positive attitude, and see where things go from there. Wish me luck!\n\nAnd thank you again for all your help and advice. It really means a lot to me, and I feel so much more confident and prepared going into this meetup.",
