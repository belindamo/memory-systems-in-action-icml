  "content": "If your final goal is to predict the grouped labels and then separate them into their original individual labels, you can approach this in two stages.\n\nFirst, you would train a multiclass classification algorithm on the training data to predict the grouped labels. To do this, you would need to preprocess the text data and create a new set of labels that correspond to the grouped labels you have created. Once you have trained the model, you can then evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\nNext, you would need to separate the grouped labels into their original individual labels. To do this, you could train binary classifiers for each pair of labels that were grouped together. For example, if you grouped \"Politics\" with \"World News\" to create a combined label, you could train a binary classifier to separate news articles that are about \"Politics\" from those that are about \"World News.\" You would repeat this process for each pair of labels that were grouped together.\n\nOnce you have trained the binary classifiers, you can then use them to predict the individual labels for each news article that was assigned a grouped label in the first stage. You could do this by applying each binary classifier to the news articles that were assigned the corresponding grouped label. This would give you the predicted label for each news article.\n\nKeep in mind that this approach requires more work and can be more complex, as you need to train multiple binary classifiers to separate the grouped labels into their individual labels. However, it can be a useful way to refine the predictions of your model and provide more specific labels for each news article.",
