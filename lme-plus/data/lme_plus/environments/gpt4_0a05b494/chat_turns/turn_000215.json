The island's climate is characterized by two seasons: a dry season from April to October and a wet season from November to March.\n\nDuring March, Kauai is transitioning from the wet season to the dry season, so you may experience a few scattered showers, especially in the northern and eastern parts of the island. However, the rainfall is generally less frequent and less intense compared to the wettest months of the year.\n\nThe average temperature in Kauai during March ranges from 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) to 79\u00b0F (26\u00b0C). It's a great time to enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, swimming, and snorkeling as the ocean temperatures are pleasant, averaging around 76\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). It's also a good time for whale watching as it's still the tail end of the humpback whale season.\n\nOverall, March is a great time to visit Kauai if you want to avoid the crowds and enjoy mild weather. Just be sure to pack for both warm and rainy conditions and check the weather forecast regularly to plan your activities accordingly.",
