  "content": "Speaking of Sydney, I actually met a tourist from Australia last Thursday on the subway when I was on my way to work. He was lost in the city and I helped him navigate the subway map. We ended up chatting about our jobs and hobbies, and he even sent me a photo of the Sydney Opera House the next day. Do you have any recommendations for must-try food or drinks while I'm in Sydney?",
