  "content": "That sounds like an amazing day! Mickey's Soundsational Parade is a classic Disneyland parade that's always a crowd-pleaser, and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance is an incredible attraction that immerses you in the Star Wars universe.\n\nHowever, I have to correct you - Mickey's Soundsational Parade ended its run in 2022, and Rise of the Resistance is still a popular attraction, but it's not new anymore. It's possible that you might have visited during a time when both were available, but if you're planning to visit again, you should check the Disneyland website for the current entertainment schedule and attraction lineup.\n\nThat being said, I'm glad you have fond memories of your previous visit, and I'm sure you'll create new ones on your next trip to Disneyland!",
