However, I can say that social media has definitely had a huge impact on the music industry, both positive and negative. On one hand, social media has made it easier for artists to connect with their fans and promote their music, regardless of their geographic location or whether they have major label backing. This has led to a more diverse and inclusive music industry, with a broader range of voices and genres being represented. On the other hand, social media has also led to issues like online harassment, cyberbullying, and the spread of misinformation. So while social media has definitely had a significant impact on the music industry, it's important to consider both the positive and negative effects.",
