However, I can keep a record of it for your reference:\n\n**Past Flight:**\n\n* Airline: American Airlines\n* Departure: February 10th, New York (JFK/LGA/EWR - please specify the exact airport if you know it)\n* Destination: Los Angeles (LAX)\n* Note: Poor experience reported\n\nIf you'd like to provide more details about the issues you faced, I can help you document them. This might be helpful if you need to follow up with the airline or provide feedback.\n\nLet's focus on your upcoming flights, though! Are there any other trips or flights you've booked for the year that you'd like to add to your itinerary?",
