Disneyland Forever was a limited-time fireworks show that ran from May 2015 to September 2016, and it's no longer being shown.\n\nHowever, Disneyland has had various nighttime spectaculars over the years, and currently, the main nighttime show is Disneyland's \"Disneyland Forever\" predecessor, Fantasmic!. Fantasmic! is a nighttime show that features fireworks, water effects, and live performances based on Disney movies and characters. The showtimes vary depending on the day and season, but you can check the official Disneyland website or the Disneyland app for the most up-to-date schedule.\n\nAdditionally, Disneyland sometimes offers special seasonal fireworks displays, such as the Halloween Screams fireworks during the Halloween season or the Believe... In Holiday Magic fireworks during the winter holiday season. Be sure to check the park schedule and website for any special events or fireworks displays during your visit.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I'm sure you'll find a spectacular nighttime show to enjoy with your friends at Disneyland!",
