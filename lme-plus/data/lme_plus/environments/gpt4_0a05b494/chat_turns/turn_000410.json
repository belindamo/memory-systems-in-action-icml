  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal views or preferences, but I can provide the following information:\n\nThe lack of crowds has a significant impact on Cardiff City's performances as well as on all other football teams. Playing in an empty stadium removes the atmosphere and energy that a crowd can provide, which can often motivate and inspire players to perform at their best. \n\nCardiff City, like many teams, have struggled to replicate their usual form without fans in the stadium. They have won fewer home games this season, which could be attributed to the lack of a supportive home crowd.\n\nHowever, it can also be argued that playing in empty stadiums can have benefits for some teams. For example, it can be easier for players to communicate and hear each other on the pitch without crowd noise. Additionally, the absence of crowd pressure and expectation may allow some players to perform more freely and without fear of making mistakes.\n\nOverall, it's difficult to say whether Cardiff City has an advantage or disadvantage without crowds as this can vary depending on the team's individual strengths and weaknesses. However, it's evident that the lack of fans in the stadium has impacted their performances.",
