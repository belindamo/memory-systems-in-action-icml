Speaking of fitness goals, I actually met a woman at a networking event for professionals in my industry last month, and we ended up talking for hours about the latest trends and challenges in our field. We exchanged business cards and have been in touch over email since then. She's been sending me some valuable insights and resources that have really helped me in my job. Do you have any recommendations for professional networking opportunities in Sydney?",
