You want to ensure the design doesn't become too cluttered or overwhelming. Start with one or two elements and see how they work together before adding more.\n\nUse a design tool like Canva or Adobe Illustrator to experiment with different patterns, textures, and elements. You can also search for pre-made design elements online or use a design resource website like Freepik or Creative Market.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your gift tag will turn out adorable!",
