  "content": "**Hill's Science Diet $5 Off Coupon Expiration**:\n\nI've checked the Hill's Science Diet website, and the $5 off coupon for new customers is a one-time use coupon that doesn't have a specific expiration date listed. However, it's always a good idea to redeem it as soon as possible, as offers can be withdrawn or changed at any time.\n\n**Stacking Digital Coupons with the $5 Off Coupon**:\n\nAs for stacking the digital coupons from your pet store loyalty app with the $5 off coupon, it depends on the specific store's policies. Some stores allow you to combine digital coupons with manufacturer's coupons, while others may not.\n\nYou can try the following:\n\n1. Check the terms and conditions of the digital coupons on your pet store loyalty app to see if they can be combined with other offers.\n2. Contact the pet store's customer service or check their website to see if they have a coupon policy that allows stacking.\n3. If you're unsure, you can try applying both the digital coupons and the $5 off coupon at checkout. If the system allows it, you'll see the combined discount applied to your purchase.\n\nKeep in mind that some stores may have specific rules or restrictions on coupon stacking, so it's always a good idea to review their policies before making a purchase.\n\nRemember to also check if your pet store loyalty app has any other offers or rewards that you can use in combination with the $5 off coupon and digital coupons. Happy shopping!",
