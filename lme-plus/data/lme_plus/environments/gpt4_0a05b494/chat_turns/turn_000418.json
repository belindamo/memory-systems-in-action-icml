  "content": "It is possible that some creative solutions put in place by clubs like Cardiff City could continue to be used even after the pandemic is over and fans are back in the stadiums. These new methods of fan engagement and creating a connection between the team and their supporters may have proved to be effective, and clubs may choose to keep them to enhance the overall matchday experience. \n\nFor example, the use of audio recordings of fan chants and cheers to produce artificial crowd noise can add to the excitement of the match, enhance viewers' experience at home, and make the game more enjoyable for both broadcasters and fans. Additionally, the giant boards with fans' pictures, and cardboard cutouts can help create a sense of community and inclusiveness among fans, and it can involve them more effectively in clubs' activities. \n\nOverall, although these solutions do not replace traditional fan involvement, they could serve as a complementary way of enhancing fan engagement and experiences on game days, making the experience more immersive and enjoyable for everyone involved.",
