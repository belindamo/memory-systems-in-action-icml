Here's an overview of the program and the application process:\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n* You must be an asylee, refugee, or have a similar status (e.g., Cuban/Haitian entrant, certified victim of human trafficking)\n* You must not be eligible for Medicaid or other federal means-tested programs\n* You must be within 8 months of your arrival in the US or the date of your asylum approval\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* RMA provides temporary medical assistance for essential medical services, including:\n\t+ Doctor visits and hospital care\n\t+ Prescription medications\n\t+ Laboratory tests and X-rays\n\t+ Maternity care\n\t+ Mental health services\n\t+ Substance abuse treatment\n\t+ Dental care (in some cases)\n* RMA may also cover some ancillary services, such as transportation and interpretation services\n\n**Application Process:**\n\n1. **Find your local Refugee Resettlement Agency (RRA):** RRAs are non-profit organizations that provide services to refugees and asylees. You can find your local RRA by contacting the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) or searching online.\n2. **Contact your RRA:** Reach out to your local RRA and ask about their RMA program. They will guide you through the application process and provide the necessary forms.\n3. **Gather required documents:** You'll need to provide documents to support your application, such as:\n\t* Asylum approval document (Form I-797)\n\t* Proof of identity (e.g., passport, ID card)\n\t* Proof of income (e.g., pay stubs, tax returns)\n\t* Proof of residency (e.g., lease agreement, utility bills)\n4. **Complete the application:** Your RRA will provide the application form, which typically includes a medical assessment and a financial assessment.\n5. **Submit the application:** Return the completed application to your RRA, along with the required documents.\n6. **Wait for approval:** The RRA will review your application and forward it to the ORR for approval. This process may take several weeks.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* RMA is a temporary program, and benefits are typically limited to 8 months from the date of your arrival or asylum approval.\n* RMA is not a substitute for health insurance, and you should explore other health insurance options, such as Medicaid or Marketplace plans, once you're eligible.\n* RMA may have varying benefits and eligibility requirements depending on your state or locality, so it's essential to check with your RRA for specific information.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have further questions or need assistance with the application process, feel free to ask.",
