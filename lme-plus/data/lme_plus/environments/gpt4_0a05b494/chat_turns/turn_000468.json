Here are some specific animal illustrations that would work well with the \"Snuggle Up\" text:\n\n1. **Teddy Bear**: A cuddly teddy bear is a classic choice for a baby boy theme. You can depict the bear snuggled up in a blanket, holding a heart, or giving a hug.\n2. **Lion Cub**: A lion cub is a sweet and playful addition to the \"Snuggle Up\" design. You can show the cub snuggled up in a ball, surrounded by hearts, or peeking out from under a blanket.\n3. **Monkey**: A monkey is a fun and curious creature that pairs well with the \"Snuggle Up\" message. You can depict the monkey snuggled up in a tree, holding a blanket, or giving a big hug.\n4. **Penguin**: A penguin is a charming and endearing animal that fits perfectly with the \"Snuggle Up\" theme. You can show the penguin snuggled up in a nest, holding a heart, or waddling around with a blanket.\n5. **Raccoon**: A raccoon is a cute and mischievous creature that adds a playful touch to the design. You can depict the raccoon snuggled up in a tree, holding a blanket, or peeking out from under a hat.\n\nRemember to keep the illustration simple, colorful, and playful to match the Baby Blocks font and the overall baby boy theme. You can use a design tool like Canva or Adobe Illustrator to create your own illustration, or find a pre-made illustration online.\n\nOnce you have your design, print it on a sturdy paper or cardstock, and attach it to the gift with a ribbon or twine. Add a small decorative element, like a tiny button or a paper clip, to give it an extra touch.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your cousin will love the adorable gift tag!",
