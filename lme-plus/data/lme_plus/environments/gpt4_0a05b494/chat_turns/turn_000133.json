However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to current information. My knowledge cutoff is around 2021, so I won't be able to provide you with the most up-to-date standings.\n\nBut I can suggest some ways for you to get the current standings:\n\n1. Check the official NBA website (nba.com) or the NBA app for the latest standings.\n2. Look up sports news websites like ESPN, Fox Sports, or CBS Sports for the current standings.\n3. Follow your favorite sports social media accounts or NBA teams' social media accounts for updates.\n\nIf you're interested in knowing the standings from my knowledge cutoff (2021), I can provide you with that information. Just let me know!",
