  "content": "Among the time tracking software options that I mentioned, Toggl Track and RescueTime offer free versions with limited features. Harvest, Hubstaff, and TimeDoctor offer a free trial period and then charge a monthly subscription fee based on the number of users.\n\nFor a small remote team on a tight budget, Toggl Track and RescueTime are good options to consider. Toggl Track has a free version that allows up to five users and basic features such as time tracking and reporting. RescueTime also has a free version that allows one user and limited features. Both tools offer affordable paid plans with more advanced features for growing remote teams.\n\nOverall, it's important to evaluate the features and pricing of each time tracking software option to determine which one is the most affordable and best suited for the needs of your small remote team.",
