Losing a bike seat can be frustrating, especially if it's a comfortable one.\n\nIt's great that you're considering upgrading your bike accessories, and the seat is a great place to start. A good saddle can make a huge difference in your riding comfort and overall experience.\n\nSince you mentioned your current seat came with your Trek FX 3 Hybrid bike, I'm assuming it's a stock saddle. While it's good that it's comfortable, you might find that upgrading to a higher-quality saddle can provide even more comfort and support.\n\nHere are some tips to consider when looking for a new saddle:\n\n1. **Riding style**: Think about your riding style and the type of terrain you typically ride on. If you're a casual rider, a more cushioned saddle might be suitable. If you're a more aggressive rider or ride on rough terrain, a saddle with more support and stability might be better.\n2. **Seat shape and size**: Consider the shape and size of the saddle. A wider saddle might be more comfortable for casual riding, while a narrower saddle might be better for more aggressive riding.\n3. **Materials**: Saddles can be made from a variety of materials, including leather, synthetic materials, and carbon fiber. Leather saddles are often more comfortable, but may require more maintenance. Synthetic materials are often more durable and easy to clean.\n4. **Cutout or recess**: Some saddles feature a cutout or recess in the middle to reduce pressure on sensitive areas. If you experience discomfort or numbness while riding, a saddle with a cutout might be a good option.\n5. **Brand and quality**: Look for reputable brands known for producing high-quality saddles, such as Brooks, Selle Italia, or Specialized.\n\nSome popular saddle options to consider:\n\n1. **Brooks Cambium**: A popular choice for comfort and support, with a range of models to suit different riding styles.\n2. **Selle Italia SLR**: A high-end saddle with a focus on comfort and performance.\n3. **Specialized Phenom**: A popular choice for road and mountain bikers, with a range of models to suit different riding styles.\n\nI recommend visiting your local bike shop and talking to the staff about your needs and preferences. They can help you find the perfect saddle for your riding style and budget.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you looking for a specific type of saddle or brand?",
