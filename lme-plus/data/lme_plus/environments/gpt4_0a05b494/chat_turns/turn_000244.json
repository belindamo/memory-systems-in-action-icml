  "content": "Thank you for sharing the list of labels you are working with. Based on this, you could group some of the labels together if they are similar in nature or difficult to distinguish from one another. Here is a potential grouping of the labels:\n\n* Group 1: \"Sci/Tech\" and \"Business\" (both related to technology and economics)\n* Group 2: \"World\" and \"Politics\" (both related to international affairs and government)\n* Group 3: \"ESG\" and \"Health\" (both related to social issues and well-being)\n* Group 4: \"Sports\" and \"Entertainment\" (both related to leisure and entertainment)\n\nUsing this grouping, you could train a multiclass classification algorithm on the training data to predict the grouped labels, then train binary classifiers to separate the grouped labels into their original individual labels. Alternatively, you could experiment with different grouping strategies to see which approach yields the best performance on your task.",
