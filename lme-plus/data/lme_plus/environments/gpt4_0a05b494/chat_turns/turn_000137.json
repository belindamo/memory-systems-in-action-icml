I can't provide you with the Lakers' recent performance, including their last 5 games.\n\nTo get the latest information on the Lakers' recent games, I recommend checking out the NBA website, ESPN, or other sports websites for updates on their current season, including scores, stats, and game recaps. You can also follow the Lakers' social media accounts or sports news outlets for the latest news and updates.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Lakers' performance during the 2020-2021 season or earlier, I'd be happy to try and help!",
