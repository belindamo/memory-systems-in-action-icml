By the way, speaking of road trips, I took a short 3-day road trip to the nearby mountains with my family a week after returning from San Francisco. We drove for about 4 hours to reach the campsite, where we pitched our tent and spent the evening roasting marshmallows and telling ghost stories. Do you have any recommendations for camping gear or tips for a comfortable camping experience?",
