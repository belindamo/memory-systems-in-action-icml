  "content": "Mickey's Soundsational Parade was a popular parade at Disneyland Resort in California, but it actually ended its run on July 17, 2022.\n\nHowever, don't worry! Disneyland has a new parade called Mickey's Toontown Gadget's Go Coaster Queue Parade that debuted on March 17, 2023. This new parade features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and their friends from Toontown, along with music, colorful costumes, and fun floats.\n\nAdditionally, Disneyland often has seasonal parades and special events throughout the year, so be sure to check the official Disneyland website or the Disneyland app for the most up-to-date information on parade schedules and times during your visit.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a magical time at Disneyland with your friends!",
