  "content": "Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance is still an extremely popular attraction in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge! While it's not as new as it was when it first opened, it remains one of the most popular rides in the park.\n\nThe ride's popularity can be attributed to its immersive experience, stunning visuals, and innovative technology. It's a truly unique attraction that combines trackless ride vehicles, screens, and live actors to create an unforgettable adventure.\n\nThat being said, the crowds and wait times for Rise of the Resistance have decreased slightly since its initial opening. You can still expect long wait times, especially during peak seasons like summer, holidays, and weekends. However, the wait times are generally more manageable than they were during its opening months.\n\nTo minimize your wait, consider using the Disneyland app to reserve a boarding group through the virtual queue system, which is usually available for Rise of the Resistance. You can also take advantage of early morning or late evening hours when crowds tend to be smaller.\n\nAdditionally, if you're planning to visit during the off-season (usually weekdays during the school year), you might find shorter wait times or even be able to walk onto the ride with minimal wait.\n\nOverall, Rise of the Resistance remains a must-ride attraction for many Disneyland visitors, and it's still an experience you won't want to miss!",
