This level of smokiness is great for showcasing the natural flavor of the brisket, with a hint of smoke in the background.\n* To achieve a light smoke flavor, you can smoke the brisket for a shorter period, typically 4-6 hours, using a milder wood like Apple or Cherry.\n\n**Medium Smokiness:**\n\n* A medium smoke flavor is a great balance between subtle and robust. This level of smokiness is perfect for those who want to taste the smoke, but still want to enjoy the natural flavor of the brisket.\n* To achieve a medium smoke flavor, you can smoke the brisket for 6-8 hours, using a wood like Hickory or Oak.\n\n**Robust Smokiness:**\n\n* A robust smoke flavor is perfect for those who love a strong, intense smoke flavor. This level of smokiness is great for those who want to experience the full, bold flavor of the wood.\n* To achieve a robust smoke flavor, you can smoke the brisket for 8-12 hours, using a strong wood like Mesquite or Pecan.\n\nRemember, the type of wood, temperature, and smoking time will all impact the level of smokiness. Experiment with different combinations to find your perfect level of smokiness!",
