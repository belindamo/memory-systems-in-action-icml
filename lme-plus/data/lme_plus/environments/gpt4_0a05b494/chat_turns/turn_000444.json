Since it's a different coupon, you can likely use it in addition to the $5 off coupon.\n3. **10% off entire purchase digital coupon from Petco**: This is a store coupon, and it's applicable to your entire purchase at Petco. Since it's a store coupon, it can be used in addition to the manufacturer's coupons.\n\nIn most cases, you can combine a manufacturer's coupon with a store coupon, as long as the coupons aren't identical or mutually exclusive. In this case, it seems like you can use all three together.\n\nHere's how your savings might look:\n\n* Hill's Science Diet product price: $X\n* $5 off Hill's Science Diet coupon: -$5\n* $1 off Hill's Science Diet coupon: -$1\n* 10% off entire purchase digital coupon from Petco: -$X * 0.10\n\nYour total savings would be $6 + ($X * 0.10), and your final price would be $X - $6 - ($X * 0.10).\n\nJust to confirm, I recommend checking with Petco's coupon policy or asking a store associate to ensure that you can combine these coupons. Some stores may have specific rules or restrictions on coupon stacking, so it's always better to double-check.\n\nYou're getting close to maximizing your savings!",
