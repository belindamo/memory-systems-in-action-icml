  "content": "Yes, some genres do tend to do better on social media than others. For example, pop music tends to perform well on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, where fans are more likely to share posts and tag their friends. Similarly, hip-hop and rap music tend to perform well on platforms like TikTok, where users can make TikTok dance videos set to popular hip-hop and rap songs. On the other hand, genres like classical music or jazz might not perform as well on social media, as their fan base tends to be more niche and less engaged on social media. However, it's important to note that social media can be unpredictable and there are always exceptions to these trends.",
