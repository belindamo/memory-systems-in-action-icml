      "content": "Yes, Congolese rumba music has had a significant impact on Latin American music, particularly in the 1960s and 70s. Congolese musicians like Tabu Ley Rochereau and Franco Luambo Makiadi gained international fame with their fusion of African rhythms and Latin American music, which they called \"soukous.\" \n\nIn the Caribbean, soukous rhythms fused with local rhythms to create new styles like zouk and compas. In Latin America, soukous rhythms influenced salsa music, specifically the \"salsa dura\" style, which features a fast and syncopated beat. Some Latin American artists, such as Celia Cruz, even recorded songs with Congolese musicians.\n\nOverall, Congolese rumba music's influence on Latin American music helped to create new and exciting hybrid genres, and this influence can still be heard in contemporary Latin music today."
