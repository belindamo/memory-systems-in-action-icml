      "content": "you have to adopt Jeremy\u2019s carefully tailored exercise regimen to make the cure permanent, and that\u2019s not always easy. Well, it\u2019s easy if you know how, and we work like crazy to show you how in the book (and in videos we\u2019ll refer to in a minute). \nFinally, you have to know\u2014as I said before\u2014that the book may not work for some of you. You\u2019re too far gone. Awfully damn sorry about that but about 20 percent of you\u2014Jeremy estimates, conservatively\u2014are going to have progressed to a stage where you are probably going to need traditional medical help, possibly including surgery. He\u2019ll tell you how to know if that means you. And a few more of you\u2014with back pain that is rooted primarily in muscle \u201ctrigger points\u201d (there\u2019s a terrific chapter on that)\u2014may need to turn to a chiropractor or physical therapist, at least briefly, to show you how to find and release muscle spasms. Then you come back to the book to lock in the change and make it permanent. But the basic claim\u2014that some 80 percent of you can get complete or significant pain relief permanently\u2014is solid. \nI asked Jeremy, early on, if he could back up that number by going through his records. He said he could not. (Oh, lord!) But, he said, he could remember every single one of the handful of patients he thought he could help who in fact he could not (excluding the ones he sent on for conventional medical help). He could count them on his fingers. I thought that was good enough. So, that 80 percent claim is not just solid, it is conservative.\nBasic Insight: You Got Yourself into This Mess, and Only You Can Get Yourself Out \nJeremy\u2019s success has been based on two great insights. The first was to realize (along with a handful of others, including Bill Fabrocini, who wrote the Introduction) that your own long-term behavior (how you carry yourself, your posture, and certain repetitive movements) is almost always the cause of your back pain. Sometimes it\u2019s trauma or a weird event but not often. And only changing behavior is going to effect a permanent cure. In other words, it\u2019s going to be up to you in the end. Jeremy will point the way and tell you exactly what to do: first to effect the cure and then to do maintenance. But you do the hard work. And\u2014as in the other Younger Next Year books\u2014exercise is going to be at the heart of it. Steady, whole-body exercise for the rest of your life. If you\u2019re new to all this, that may sound alarming\u2014steady exercise forever\u2014but it\u2019s not. In this, as in other things, exercise is going to turn out to be the key to the good life. \nThe second great insight was to realize that, while back pain seems local and specific, it is almost always a whole-body or at least whole-core problem in the end (we\u2019ll tell you all about the core in a bit). And a whole-body approach is indispensable to its cure. Drawing on those two insights, on his review of the available science, and on his own vast, clinical experience (he has been doing nothing but treating back pain his whole adult life), Jeremy has developed a technique that has had unprecedented success. \nYou are probably a bit of a student of back pain yourself if you\u2019ve had it for a while, but you are about to learn some new things. You will learn, for example, that back pain is not a \u201cdisease,\u201d as some doctors say. Nor, in most cases, is it the result of an accident or trauma. Or bad genes or bad luck. Or (mostly) psychological issues. Sometimes, but mostly not. And it is not from rolling over \u201cfunny\u201d in the night or picking up something heavy, carelessly. Or making love in some goofy and disgusting way. It\u2019s not the malfunction of a particular disc or vertebra or a spasm in a particular muscle, although it almost always \u201creads\u201d that way. A particular disc, spasm, or whatnot is the immediate source of the pain. But that\u2019s not what it\u2019s all about. Almost all back pain is a \u201cwhole-body\u201d problem, certainly a \u201cwhole-spine and core\u201d problem, caused by the way we live and move, over time. Caused by our rotten posture, by sitting curled over a computer eight hours a day for years and years, by our idleness, by the shameful weakness of our core. And\u2014a close corollary of the foregoing\u2014by the foolish ways we move, day in and day out. Fix those big problems carefully and the little problems, which actually cause the specific pain, go away. \nWhat we are going to do first, after giving you a background tour of your spine and its discontents, is teach you to find and maintain a neutral spine (the position that allows your spine to do its job with the least amount of stress and load\u2013and the least damage) all the time. Don\u2019t worry if that term doesn\u2019t mean anything to you now; it will mean a lot by the time we\u2019re done. It is the first and last key to your recovery. Then we\u2019re going to show you how to use the core to support the neutral spine. Next, we\u2019re going to teach you exercises to increase the strength and endurance of the core so it can do its primary job, which turns out to be supporting the neutral spine in the long term and keeping it stable. Finally, we\u2019re going to teach you to avoid triggering behaviors (like playing golf a certain way or bending over your computer for twenty years). Teach you how to move correctly, so that you maintain a neutral and stable spine all the time, even when doing the complex lifting and rotating motions that are part of daily life and exercise. We\u2019re going to teach you how to behave, frankly. And back pain will significantly go away. Easy-peasy.\nYou will want to know that Jeremy understands the specific problems\u2014the disc bulges, the \u201cpinched\u201d nerves, the muscle spasms, and all that\u2014as well as anyone in the professions, and we\u2019ll talk a good deal about those along the way. But his overarching insight is that it is a mistake to focus on those. Rather, he wants us to make fundamental (but manageable) behavioral changes that affect our entire core, our entire body. Then the specific problems that are making us crazy go away. Indeed, \nfundamental behavioral change is the only way to effect permanent change. Otherwise, local \u201cfixes\u201d\u2014like spinal fusions, laminectomies, discectomies . . . all the stuff you\u2019ve heard about from your medical doctor\u2014will usually offer only temporary relief. Blessed relief but temporary. The overall problem persists. And it will turn up in the abutting vertebrae or at another place down the kinetic chain (the complex chain of joints, discs, and connective tissue in and around the spine). Conventional medicine performs wonders. Obviously. And it has a huge role in acute situations. But it generally cannot achieve lifelong cures for chronic back pain. Only you can do that, and only with behavioral change and a certain exercise regimen. Jeremy can show you how.\nJeremy wants me to stress that we are most assuredly not putting down modern medicine. He comes from a long line of doctors, and he has the liveliest sense that modern medicine is miraculous. But there are areas where medicine is limited to fixing but not curing problems, areas where behavioral change matters much more. Heart disease is one of them, interestingly enough. And back pain is another. \nA closing word: Trees are bent by prevailing winds. Bodies are bent by prevailing postures and movements. Trees can live in their contorted condition. Bodies cannot. Our bodies are meant to stand erect on the earth. When they do not, they cry out to us. They cry out in pain. \nA NOTE ABOUT VIDEOS \nIf you are a visual learner, you may want to take a look at Jeremy\u2019s program of streamed videos (BackForever.com) on aspects of back pain. See the appendix for information. BackForever.com is by no means a substitute for the book, but it offers a different angle on the subject and some additional information that may be helpful."
