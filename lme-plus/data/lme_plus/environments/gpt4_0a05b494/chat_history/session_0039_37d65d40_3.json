Just make sure you have enough storage space and that the products won't expire before you can use them.\n7. **Stack your savings**: Combine your coupons with sales and other offers to maximize your savings.

Check the terms and conditions of the digital coupons on your pet store loyalty app to see if they can be combined with other offers.\n2. Contact the pet store's customer service or check their website to see if they have a coupon policy that allows stacking.\n3. If you're unsure, you can try applying both the digital coupons and the $5 off coupon at checkout. If the system allows it, you'll see the combined discount applied to your purchase.\n\nKeep in mind that some stores may have specific rules or restrictions on coupon stacking, so it's always a good idea to review their policies before making a purchase.\n\nRemember to also check if your pet store loyalty app has any other offers or rewards that you can use in combination with the $5 off coupon and digital coupons.

      "content": "You're a couponing mastermind! \n\nLet's break it down to see if you can use all three together:\n\n1. **Hill's Science Diet $5 off coupon**: This is a manufacturer's coupon, and it's specific to Hill's Science Diet products.\n2. **$1 off Hill's Science Diet coupon**: This is another manufacturer's coupon, and it's also specific to Hill's Science Diet products. Since it's a different coupon, you can likely use it in addition to the $5 off coupon.\n3. **10% off entire purchase digital coupon from Petco**: This is a store coupon, and it's applicable to your entire purchase at Petco. Since it's a store coupon, it can be used in addition to the manufacturer's coupons.\n\nIn most cases, you can combine a manufacturer's coupon with a store coupon, as long as the coupons aren't identical or mutually exclusive. In this case, it seems like you can use all three together.\n\nHere's how your savings might look:\n\n* Hill's Science Diet product price: $X\n* $5 off Hill's Science Diet coupon: -$5\n* $1 off Hill's Science Diet coupon: -$1\n* 10% off entire purchase digital coupon from Petco: -$X * 0.10\n\nYour total savings would be $6 + ($X * 0.10), and your final price would be $X - $6 - ($X * 0.10).\n\nJust to confirm, I recommend checking with Petco's coupon policy or asking a store associate to ensure that you can combine these coupons. Some stores may have specific rules or restrictions on coupon stacking, so it's always better to double-check.\n\nYou're getting close to maximizing your savings!"
