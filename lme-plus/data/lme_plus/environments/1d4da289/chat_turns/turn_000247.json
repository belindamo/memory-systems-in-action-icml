  "content": "Yes, there were some Puritans who pushed back against the strict moral code and sought to find ways to express their individuality and break free from the rigid social norms. One such group was the Antinomians who believed that individuals were saved by faith alone and not by their actions or adherence to religious laws. They also rejected the idea of predestination and believed that individuals had free will to choose their own spiritual path.\n\nAnother group was the Quakers who, while not strictly Puritans, were influenced by Puritanism and sought to reject the hierarchical structures and strict moral codes of Puritanism. Quakers believed in the notion of an \"inner light\" which guided individuals towards their own spiritual truth and emphasized the importance of personal experience and revelation.\n\nThere were also Puritan individuals who sought to push back against the strict moral codes, particularly those related to sexuality and the role of women in society. For example, Anne Hutchinson was a prominent Antinomian who challenged the authority of the male Puritan ministers and was eventually banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\nOverall, while the strict moral code of Puritanism was dominant, there were individuals and groups who sought to challenge and resist it in various ways.",
