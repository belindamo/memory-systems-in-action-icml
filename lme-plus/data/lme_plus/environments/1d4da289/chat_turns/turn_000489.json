If you have a PC with Windows 10 or later, you can subscribe to Xbox Game Pass for PC and access a library of games. You can download and install the Xbox app on your PC and then sign up for Xbox Game Pass from within the app. \n\nOnce you're subscribed, you can browse the library of games and download and play them on your PC. Keep in mind that not all games in the Xbox Game Pass library are available on PC, so make sure to check if the games you want to play are available on PC before you subscribe.",
