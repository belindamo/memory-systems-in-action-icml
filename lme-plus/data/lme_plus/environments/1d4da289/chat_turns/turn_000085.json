In general, books can have a significant impact on the development of unhealthy relationship dynamics, especially if they contain themes and messages that normalize or romanticize abusive and controlling behaviors. Some books, movies, and other media have been criticized for promoting toxic relationship patterns, such as romanticizing possessiveness, jealousy, manipulation, and even violence.
