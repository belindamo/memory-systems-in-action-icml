  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot speculate about the future, but there is hope for change in the sense that the conversation around healthy relationships and consent has shifted in recent years. More people are demanding greater accountability for harmful or problematic content in media, including literature. The publishing industry is showing more willingness to take responsibility for the books they publish and make changes to ensure that they are promoting healthy relationships and respectful behavior. Furthermore, there are efforts to create safe spaces where people can share their experiences with unhealthy relationship dynamics, and these conversations can contribute to greater awareness and understanding of the issue. It is crucial to continue these conversations and actively promote literature and other media that portray healthy and respectful relationship dynamics to create a safer and more inclusive society.",
