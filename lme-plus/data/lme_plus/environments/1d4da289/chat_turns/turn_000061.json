Here's a deeper dive into its features and how it works:\n\n**What is the PranaTracker?**\n\nThe PranaTracker is a wearable device that tracks your yoga practice, providing real-time feedback and correction on your form, technique, and breathing. It's designed to help you improve your practice, prevent injuries, and enhance your overall yoga experience.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nThe PranaTracker consists of a small, wearable sensor that you attach to your clothing or mat.

The data is then transmitted to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth, where you can view detailed feedback and analytics.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n1. **Real-time feedback**: The PranaTracker provides instant feedback on your form, technique, and breathing, helping you correct your alignment and movement in real-time.\n2. **Pose recognition**: The device recognizes and tracks over 100 yoga poses, including variations and modifications.\n3. **Breathing guidance**: The PranaTracker offers guidance on breathing techniques, helping you synchronize your breath with your movements.\n4. **Personalized feedback**: The device provides personalized feedback based on your practice style, goals, and level.\n5. **Analytics and tracking**: The PranaTracker tracks your progress, providing insights into your practice frequency, duration, and improvement over time.\n\n**How does it correct your form and technique?**\n\nThe PranaTracker uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and expert input from yoga instructors to provide corrective feedback. When you're practicing, the device detects deviations from proper form and technique, and offers suggestions for improvement. These corrections might include:\n\n1. **Adjusting your alignment**: The PranaTracker might suggest adjusting your alignment to engage the correct muscles or avoid strain on your joints.\n2. **Modifying your movement**: The device might recommend modifying your movement to improve your overall flow and technique.\n3. **Breathing adjustments**: The PranaTracker might offer guidance on breathing techniques to help you relax, focus, or energize.\n\n**What makes the PranaTracker unique?**\n\nThe PranaTracker stands out from other yoga trackers due to its real-time feedback and correction capabilities. This feature allows you to make adjustments on the fly, rather than reviewing your practice after the fact. The device's personalized approach, pose recognition, and breathing guidance also set it apart from other trackers.\n\nI hope this provides a better understanding of the PranaTracker and its features!
