You can also export the composition as a video file by choosing \"Composition\" > \"Add to Adobe Media Encoder Queue\" from the menu bar.\n\nStep 17: Reuse the script\nTo reuse the script in other projects, you can save it as a .jsx file. To do this, select the composition containing the script in the project window, then choose \"File\" > \"Export\" > \"Add to Adobe Media Encoder Queue\". In the export settings, choose \"Format\" > \"Extended Script Toolkit (.jsx)\", then choose a destination folder and click \"Export\". You can then use the .jsx file in other projects by importing it into the ExtendScript Toolkit and running it.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a colorful gradient circle using JSX code in the ExtendScript engine of After Effects, with the ADBE Effect Parade effect, and automate the effect controls using expressions. You can then save the script as a .jsx file and reuse it in other projects, making the process of creating colorful gradient circles more efficient and streamlined.",
