Here are some tips to help you handle windy conditions:\n\n1. **Dress wisely**: Wear clothing that provides some wind resistance, such as a windbreaker or a jersey with a wind-resistant fabric. This will help reduce the impact of the wind on your body.\n2. **Adjust your pace**: When riding into a headwind, slow down and conserve your energy. You'll need to expend more energy to maintain your speed, so pace yourself accordingly.\n3. **Tuck in**: When riding in a group, take advantage of drafting by tucking in behind other riders. This can help reduce the wind resistance and conserve energy.\n4. **Use your gearing**: If you have a geared bike, use a lower gear to maintain a comfortable cadence and reduce the strain on your legs.\n5. **Body positioning**: Adjust your body position on the bike to reduce wind resistance. Try to ride with a more aerodynamic position, such as lowering your head and shoulders, and tucking in your arms.\n6. **Take breaks**: If the wind is particularly strong, take breaks to rest and recover. This will help you recharge and maintain your energy levels.\n7. **Stay relaxed**: Try to stay relaxed and loose on the bike. Tension in your body will only make it harder to ride in windy conditions.\n8. **Use the wind to your advantage**: When the wind is at your back, take advantage of the tailwind and push your pace. This can be a great opportunity to make up time and gain momentum.\n\nRemember, safety first! If the wind is extremely strong, consider shortening your ride or postponing it to a calmer day.\n\nYou've got this! With your carbo-loading and these tips, you'll be well-prepared to tackle the wind and complete your 20-mile ride.",
