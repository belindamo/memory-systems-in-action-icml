  "content": "Yes, there are many songs where the original writer didn't get enough credit. Here are some examples:\n\n1. \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" by Eurythmics: This song was written by Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart, but many people attribute the vocals and overall success of the song to Lennox alone.\n\n2. \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" by The Righteous Brothers: This classic love song was written by legendary songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, but the duo rarely received the credit they deserved for their work.\n\n3. \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" by Michael Jackson: This hit song was written by Jackson himself, but many people only remember Jackson as a performer and don't credit him for his songwriting talents.\n\n4. \"Crazy\" by Patsy Cline: This country classic was written by Willie Nelson, but Cline's unforgettable performance has made the song more associated with her than Nelson.\n\n5. \"Valerie\" by Amy Winehouse: This hit song was actually a cover of a song by The Zutons, but Winehouse's soulful interpretation made the song her own and overshadowed the original.",
