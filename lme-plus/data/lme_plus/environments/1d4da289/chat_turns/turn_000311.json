  "content": "That's a great idea! Adding a \"Cooking Method\" column can help you track your cooking habits and identify areas where you might want to make changes. It's also a clever way to keep an eye on your food delivery habits, even if Bites isn't a real app.\n\nHere's an updated template with the added column:\n\n**Food Expense Tracker Template:**\n\n| **Date** | **Category** | **Item/Description** | **Cost** | **Location** | **Type** | **Cooking Method** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nFor the \"Cooking Method\" column, you can use the following options:\n\n* **Cooked at Home**: You prepared the meal yourself at home.\n* **Ordered In**: You ordered food from a restaurant or service and had it delivered or picked it up.\n* **Ate Out**: You dined at a restaurant or cafe.\n* **Other**: Any other cooking method, such as using a meal kit or having someone else cook for you.\n\nBy tracking your cooking method, you'll be able to see patterns and trends in your eating habits. You might discover that you're relying too much on food delivery services or that you're not cooking at home as often as you'd like. This information can help you make informed decisions about your eating habits and cooking routines.\n\nRemember, the key is to make the template your own and tailor it to your specific needs and goals. Feel free to add or modify columns as needed to get the most out of your food expense tracking!",
