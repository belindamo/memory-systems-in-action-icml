I'll focus on the value I can bring to the company and offer specific solutions for how I can apply my new skills to current projects. I'll also make sure to highlight my soft skills and be open to feedback and guidance. Additionally, I'll create a portfolio to showcase my work and achievements, and I'll share my expertise with others in the company. Thanks for the advice!",
