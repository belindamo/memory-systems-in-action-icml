But I can suggest a few options to help you find out the game time:\n\n1. **Check the Lakers' website or social media**: You can visit the official Los Angeles Lakers website or their social media pages (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) to find the game schedule and start time.\n2. **Use a sports app or website**: There are many sports apps and websites that provide schedules, scores, and updates, such as ESPN, Fox Sports, or NBA.com.\n3. **Ask a friend or search online**: You can ask one of your friends who's also attending the game or do a quick online search to find the game time.\n\nRemember to plan ahead, arrive at the sports bar with plenty of time to grab a good seat, and enjoy the game with your friends!",
