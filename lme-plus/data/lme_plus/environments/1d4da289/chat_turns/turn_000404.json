  "content": "This study aims to enhance the engineering education for non-majors by incorporating the concept of Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and addressing the need for education that responds to climate and ecological changes. The study uses robot programming as a tool to foster the development of global citizens. Non-majors often struggle with producing more than just motionless forms or solid productions, due to a lack of understanding of mechanisms and coding. The study proposes the use of the Convergence D-SteamRobot (DSR) to address this issue by blending humanities and engineering. This is achieved by presenting problems through books to increase empathy, integrating simple machine mechanisms, and creating prototypes to solve self-defined problems. Through this process, students determine the SDGs topic they want to solve and learn about the simple mechanical mechanism involved in producing the prototype. The educational model provides a constructivist learning environment that emphasizes empathy and exploration, encourages immersion and peer-learning, and improves divergent thinking and problem-solving skills.",
