It sounds like you had a great time, and the denim jacket was a great addition to your bright yellow sundress. The contrast between the bright, sunny dress and the casual, laid-back denim jacket must have looked really stylish and cool.\n\nIt's great that you have fond memories of wearing that dress, and I'm sure it'll continue to be a staple in your wardrobe for many more fun occasions!\n\nBy the way, since you mentioned the garden party, I have to ask: Did you have a favorite part of the party, or was there something that made it particularly special?",
