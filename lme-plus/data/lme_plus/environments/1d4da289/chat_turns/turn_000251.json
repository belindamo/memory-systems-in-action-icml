However, it can be argued that Puritanism's strict moral code was necessary for maintaining social order during their time. The Puritans lived in a time of great social and political upheaval, and many people were searching for stability and order in their lives.\n\nPuritanism provided a sense of structure and purpose for many people, and their strict moral code helped to create a cohesive and unified society. The emphasis on personal responsibility and accountability helped to instill a strong work ethic and a sense of duty among the Puritans, which was essential for building and maintaining a successful community.\n\nHowever, it is also true that the strict moral code of Puritanism could be oppressive and limiting for individuals. The constant monitoring and judgment of one's behavior by others created a highly moralistic and judgmental society that was not always tolerant of dissent or diversity.\n\nOverall, while Puritanism's strict moral code may have been necessary for maintaining social order in their time, it also had its limitations and drawbacks, particularly in terms of individual freedoms and expression.",
