Having a clear and focused mind will help you make intentional decisions about what to keep and what to let go of.\n\nWhen it comes to deciding what to keep and what to donate or discard, here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **The Hanger Trick**: Hang your tops with the hangers facing the opposite direction. When you wear an item, hang it back up with the hanger facing the normal direction. After a few months, consider donating or discarding items that are still facing the opposite direction.\n2. **The 1-Year Rule**: If you haven't worn an item in a year, it's likely you won't miss it if you let it go.\n3. **The 80/20 Rule**: As I mentioned earlier, 80% of the time, you likely wear 20% of your clothes. Identify your favorite, most-worn items and consider letting go of the rest.\n4. **The Joy Factor**: Does the item bring you joy when you wear it? Do you feel confident and comfortable in it? If not, it might be time to let it go.\n5. **The Fit Factor**: Be honest with yourself about the fit of each item. If it's too small, too large, or unflattering, consider letting it go.\n6. **The Condition Factor**: If an item is stained, torn, or damaged beyond repair, it's likely time to let it go.\n7. **The Duplicate Factor**: If you have multiple items that serve the same purpose, consider keeping only your favorite and letting go of the rest.\n8. **The Lifestyle Factor**: Consider your current lifestyle and whether the item still fits into your daily routine. If you've changed jobs, moved to a new climate, or shifted your hobbies, you might not need certain items anymore.\n9. **The 'Maybe' Box**: As you sort through your tops, place items you're unsure about into a 'maybe' box. Set a deadline, such as six months, and if you haven't worn or thought about the item by then, consider letting it go.\n10. **The 'One In, One Out' Rule**: To maintain your newly organized closet, adopt the rule that for every new item you bring in, you must let go of an old one.\n\nRemember, decluttering and organizing is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Be intentional with your decisions, and don't be afraid to let go of items that no longer serve you.\n\nAs you sort through your tops, ask yourself these questions and be honest with your answers. You got this!",
