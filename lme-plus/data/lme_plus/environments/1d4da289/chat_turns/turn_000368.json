Shadow is the easiest way to access a full PC, instantly, on all the devices you own. From $29,99 (commitment-free).\n\nAt SHADOW, we strive to become the definitive cloud platform for gamers, creatives, and businesses, because we believe that cloud technologies have the potential to bring technological freedom to all. In today\u2019s world, doing what you love shouldn\u2019t mean worrying about components and buying expensive gear. Anyone should be able to access high-end tech, so we set ourselves to break those limits for good. This single idea, with innovation, challenge and free-thinking at heart, brought us together to shape the way we experience technology.\n\nSHADOW\u2019s original product was released in 2016 with the promise of allowing all individuals to enjoy the power of a high-end PC from the cloud. Now a global cloud computing company chaired by Octave Klaba, OVHcloud founder, SHADOW looks forward notably through new cloud solutions for both personal and business use.\n\nWith Shadow, everyone can access a full Windows PC, in the cloud, from anywhere and with the device of their choice. Thanks to the efforts of R&D teams, we continue to improve and expand our service, all this while maintaining the same affordable price, despite the recent evolution of energy costs and various component shortages. In 2022, SHADOW\u2019s revamped subscription service featured a brand new Power Upgrade, including better performance and infinite possibilities.\n\nSHADOW\u2019s vision and ambitions go beyond pure cloud-computing. Also introduced in 2022, Shadow Drive is a safe and affordable online-storage solution built in partnership with Nextcloud, the world leading open-source file-sharing platform. Shadow Drive is fully secured through traffic encryption and will ultimately be available in all markets Shadow operates in, through its servers based and operated in Europe.\n\nSHADOW also offers its expertise to professionals and companies, with custom-built projects responding to their specific needs. In 2022, the company announced Shadow Business Solutions, SHADOW\u2019s cloud services dedicated to organizations and individuals seeking innovative and flexible cloud-based services to achieve their work.\n\nHow it all started, from gaming to the cloud:\n\nLike many young entrepreneurs, our co-founders lived for their passions: for them, it was technology and gaming.\n\nAs PC gaming equipment grew more and more expensive, they took an interest in cloud technology and thought of a concept: streaming a high-end Windows PC on an underpowered laptop.\n\nCloud computing had already been around for years, but the challenge here was much bigger. With this exciting project in mind, they brought together a small community of passionate collaborators, knowing that they could offer a new take on what they loved most: the tech and gaming industries.\n\nGoing above and beyond:\n\nToday, Shadow\u2019s cloud-computing service gathers tens of thousands of users, with one of the most robust streaming technologies on the market.\n\nInitially made for and by gamers, we want, with our new offers, to provide compelling alternatives for work and home environments. Now backed by solid strategic partnerships, including OVHcloudw and its worldwide infrastructure, Shadow aims to widen its ambitions.\n\nOur Core Business Platform, releasing in 2022, will open room for scalability and innovation, welcoming open-sourced API and paving the road for an even more secure environment. From cloud VR to an entirely new app ecosystem, our journey in the cloud is just beginning.\n\n\"At SHADOW, we have a clear ambition: to set personal technology free from its material boundaries, making it accessible and affordable to everyone in a safe environment. We're incredibly proud of the work that we've accomplished in the last few months and can\u2019t wait to unveil all the projects we are currently working on.\u201d - \u00c9ric S\u00e8le, CEO at SHADOW",
