  "content": "Those who rebelled against Puritanism's strict moral code and religious teachings were often seen as heretics and were ostracized and punished by the mainstream society.\n\nFor example, Anne Hutchinson was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony after challenging the authority of male Puritan ministers and preaching her own interpretations of scripture. The Antinomians were also viewed as heretical for rejecting the strict moral code and teachings of the Puritan church, and many were subject to public shaming and punishment.\n\nSimilarly, the Quakers faced persecution for their rejection of Puritan hierarchy and strict moral codes. They were often seen as a threat to the social and religious order of Puritan society, and many were subjected to fines, imprisonment, and other forms of punishment.\n\nOverall, those who rebelled against Puritanism's strict moral code were usually not accepted by the mainstream society, who viewed their actions as a threat to the social and religious order.",
