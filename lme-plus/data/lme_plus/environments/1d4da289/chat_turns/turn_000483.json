However, in terms of the most comprehensive game library for gamers, it depends on what kind of games you like to play. \n\nAs of 2021, Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass offers one of the most comprehensive game libraries for gamers. It includes several hundred games across various genres and platforms, including Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC games. The service offers both first-party titles and third-party games, including popular titles like Minecraft, Halo, Gears of War, Doom, and more. Additionally, it includes access to day-one releases for some new games. \n\nOther popular game streaming services such as PlayStation Now, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna also have a varied game library, but may not offer as many options as Xbox Game Pass.",
