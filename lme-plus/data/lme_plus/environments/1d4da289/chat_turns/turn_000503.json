  "content": "Like any antivirus software, there is always a possibility that McAfee's antivirus software may incorrectly flag a safe file or program as a threat. These false positives can occur due to various reasons, such as a corrupted file, a bug in the software, or a new and previously unknown threat that shares similarities with a safe file or program. However, McAfee works to minimize false positives by employing advanced detection technologies, such as machine learning and behavioral analysis, to analyze and identify potential threats more accurately.\n\nIf McAfee's antivirus software flags a safe file or program as a threat, users can submit the file or program to McAfee for analysis and resolution. McAfee provides a tool called \"GetSusp\" that enables users to scan files and report any false positives to McAfee's Threat Intelligence Exchange. Additionally, users can whitelist specific files or programs that are identified as safe but were flagged as a threat by the software to prevent further false positives in the future. It's important to note that while false positives can be inconvenient, they are a normal and expected occurrence in antivirus software and should not be a cause for concern if handled properly.",
