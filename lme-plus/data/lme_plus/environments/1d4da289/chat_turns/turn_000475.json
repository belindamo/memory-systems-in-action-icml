Since it's a sundress, it's likely made of a lightweight, breathable fabric, and it's probably not suitable for dry cleaning. Here are some tips to help you decide:\n\n1. **Check the care label**: Before doing anything, always check the care label on your sundress. If it says \"dry clean only,\" you should take it to a professional dry cleaner. However, if it says \"machine wash\" or \"hand wash,\" you can try cleaning it yourself.\n2. **Assess the stain**: If the sundress has a stain, you can try spot cleaning it first. Identify the type of stain and use a gentle cleaning solution or a stain remover. If the stain is particularly tough or large, you might need to take it to a professional cleaner.\n3. **Consider the fabric**: If your sundress is made of a delicate or silk-like fabric, it's best to avoid machine washing or dry cleaning, as it could damage the fabric. In this case, you can try hand washing it gently in cold water with a mild detergent.\n4. **Hand washing is an option**: If the care label allows it, you can try hand washing your sundress in cold water with a mild detergent. Gently swish the dress around, then let it air dry or tumble dry on a low setting.\n\nIf you're still unsure, it's always best to err on the side of caution and take your sundress to a professional cleaner. They can assess the fabric and stain, and provide the best cleaning method to ensure your dress looks its best.\n\nRemember to also clean any accessories, like a belt or scarf, according to their care labels to keep your entire outfit looking fresh and clean!",
