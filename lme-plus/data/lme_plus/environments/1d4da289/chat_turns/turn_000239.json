  "content": "Leaders in Assam have advocated for greater autonomy or independence from the national government in various ways, including:\n\n1. Demand for a separate state: The demand for a separate state of Assam has been raised since the 1960s. The movement gained momentum in the early 1980s, led by the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP).\n\n2. Demand for autonomy: The Assam Accord of 1985 granted Assam more autonomy in decision-making in various sectors such as education, culture, and language. However, some leaders have demanded more autonomy in areas such as finance, law and order, and natural resources.\n\n3. Opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA): The CAA, passed in 2019, has been opposed by many in Assam as it allows non-Muslim refugees from neighboring countries to gain Indian citizenship. The fear is that this will grant citizenship to a large number of Bengali Hindus in Assam, leading to a demographic shift and erosion of Assamese culture.\n\n4. Push for greater representation: Leaders in Assam have also pushed for greater representation in the central government and state-level decision-making. This includes demands for more Assamese-language media, more central government jobs for Assamese people, and more focus on Assamese culture in national policies.\n\nOverall, the push for greater autonomy or independence from the national government is rooted in long-standing historical and cultural grievances in Assam, including concerns about illegal immigration, demographic shifts, and cultural erosion.",
