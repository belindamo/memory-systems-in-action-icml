Nahri is a young con artist and thief living in 18th century Cairo. She's a clever and resourceful woman who has learned to rely only on herself in a world that seems determined to exploit and oppress her. Despite her tough exterior, she has a deep sense of empathy and a strong moral compass.\n\nThe story begins when Nahri accidentally summons a powerful djinn warrior, Dara, during one of her cons. This event sets off a chain reaction that propels Nahri into a world of magic, politics, and ancient secrets. She soon discovers that she's the last of a powerful tribe of magic-wielders, and that her lineage makes her a target for powerful forces seeking to control the magical world.\n\nAs Nahri navigates this new world, she finds herself torn between her growing feelings for Dara and her loyalty to her own humanity. She must confront the dark secrets of her past, the complexities of her own identity, and the treacherous politics of the magical world.\n\nThroughout the book, Nahri undergoes a significant transformation, from a street-smart thief to a powerful and determined woman who's willing to risk everything to protect her people and uncover the truth about her past. Her journey is fraught with danger, magic, and intrigue, but it's also a deeply personal exploration of identity, belonging, and the power of one's own heritage.\n\nOne of the things that sets Nahri apart is her agency and autonomy. She's a strong and independent character who drives the plot forward through her own actions and decisions. The City of Brass is very much a story about a woman claiming her power and her place in the world, and Nahri's journey is both inspiring and empowering.\n\nI think you'll find Nahri to be a compelling and relatable protagonist, and her story is sure to captivate you. Let me know what you think of the book once you've started reading it!",
