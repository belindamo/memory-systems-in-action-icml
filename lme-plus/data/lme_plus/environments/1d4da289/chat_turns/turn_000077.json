  "content": "At the moment, we do not have the technology to reach Proxima Centauri within our lifetime, even with the most advanced spacecraft we currently have. The fastest spacecraft ever launched, NASA's Parker Solar Probe, would take over 6,000 years to reach Proxima Centauri. For us to reach the star within a human lifespan, we need to develop new technologies that enable much faster interstellar travel, such as breakthrough propulsion systems that allow us to travel close to the speed of light. Therefore, we have to wait for new innovations in space travel before attempting to send humans to Proxima Centauri.",
