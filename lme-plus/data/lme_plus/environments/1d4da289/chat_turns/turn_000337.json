It's a great oxygenator and can help keep your tank's water clean.\n2. **Water Wisteria (Hygrophila difformis)**: A versatile, adaptable plant that can be trained to grow on driftwood or rocks. It's relatively low-maintenance and can tolerate a range of water conditions.\n3. **Cryptocorynes (Cryptocoryne spp.)**: These plants come in various shapes and sizes and are great for adding visual interest to your tank.
