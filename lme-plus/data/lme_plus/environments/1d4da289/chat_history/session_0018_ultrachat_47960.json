However, I do have information that Firefly is a science fiction television series, created by Joss Whedon, that tells the story of a motley crew of space travelers who travel aboard Serenity, a spaceship. The series was short-lived but garnered a devoted following and inspired the creation of the movie Serenity, which continues the story of the crew."

Some fans have also launched online campaigns urging Netflix or other streaming services to pick up the series. However, any news or updates on this matter remain scarce or nonexistent."
