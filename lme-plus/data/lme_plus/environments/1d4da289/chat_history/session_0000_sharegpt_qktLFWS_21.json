      "content": "This study aims to enhance the engineering education for non-majors by incorporating the concept of Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and addressing the need for education that responds to climate and ecological changes. The study uses robot programming as a tool to foster the development of global citizens. Non-majors often struggle with producing more than just motionless forms or solid productions, due to a lack of understanding of mechanisms and coding. The study proposes the use of the Convergence D-SteamRobot (DSR) to address this issue by blending humanities and engineering. This is achieved by presenting problems through books to increase empathy, integrating simple machine mechanisms, and creating prototypes to solve self-defined problems. Through this process, students determine the SDGs topic they want to solve and learn about the simple mechanical mechanism involved in producing the prototype. The educational model provides a constructivist learning environment that emphasizes empathy and exploration, encourages immersion and peer-learning, and improves divergent thinking and problem-solving skills."

      "content": "make it simple and clear coclusion of the the educational model use below sentences.\n\n- The rest of the education method, including ideating, prototyping, and sharing and improving, can then proceed as usual, with an emphasis on sustainability and the SDGs throughout.\n\nBy incorporating SDGs into the education method, students can develop a deeper understanding of the role of technology and engineering in creating a more sustainable future, and learn how they can contribute to making the world a better place.\n\nBy following these steps, non-majors in robot education can develop their computational thinking skills and become confident problem-solvers and critical thinkers.\n\nnon-majors in robot education can develop their computational thinking skills and become better problem-solvers and critical thinkers.\n\nstudents will learn about the role of robots in creating a more sustainable future, and how they can contribute to making the world a better place through their work in robotics and computational thinking, using books as a tool to gain a deeper understanding of real-world problems related to the SDGs.\n\nThe educational model provides a constructivist learning environment that emphasizes empathy and exploration, encourages immersion and peer-learning, and improves divergent thinking and problem-solving skills."

      "content": "The proposed educational model aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience for non-majors in robot education. By incorporating the SDGs and sustainability into the education method, students can develop an understanding of the impact of technology and engineering on the world, and their role in creating a more sustainable future. Through the use of books to gain empathy and understanding of real-world problems, students will develop their computational thinking skills, critical thinking abilities, and problem-solving skills. The model encourages hands-on learning, immersion, and collaboration, providing a constructive learning environment that enhances creativity, divergent thinking, and problem-solving skills."
