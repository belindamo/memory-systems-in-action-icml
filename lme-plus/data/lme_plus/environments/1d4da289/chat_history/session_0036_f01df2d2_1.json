      "content": "Congratulations on taking the first step towards tracking your eating habits and cooking routines!\n\nUnfortunately, I have to break the news to you that there is no food delivery app called \"Bites\" that I'm aware of. It's possible that it's a new or local app, or maybe it's a different name in your region. If you can provide more information about the app, I might be able to help you better.\n\nNow, let's talk about tracking your food expenses! There are many great apps and spreadsheets that can help you do that. Here are some popular options:\n\n**Apps:**\n\n1. **Mint**: A personal finance app that allows you to track your expenses, including food purchases. It also offers budgeting tools and alerts.\n2. **Personal Capital**: A financial management app that lets you track your income and expenses, including food-related transactions.\n3. **You Need a Budget (YNAB)**: A budgeting app that helps you track your expenses and stay on top of your finances.\n4. **Spendee**: A user-friendly app that allows you to track your daily expenses, including food purchases.\n5. **Food Diary** (iOS, Android): A simple app that lets you track your daily food intake and expenses.\n\n**Spreadsheets:**\n\n1. **Google Sheets**: A free online spreadsheet that you can use to create a budget template and track your food expenses.\n2. **Microsoft Excel**: A popular spreadsheet software that you can use to create a budget template and track your food expenses.\n\nYou can also create a simple spreadsheet using a template like this:\n\n| Date | Category | Item | Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023-02-15 | Groceries | Milk | $2.50 |\n| 2023-02-15 | Dining Out | Lunch at Joe's | $15.00 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nChoose an app or spreadsheet that fits your needs and comfort level.
