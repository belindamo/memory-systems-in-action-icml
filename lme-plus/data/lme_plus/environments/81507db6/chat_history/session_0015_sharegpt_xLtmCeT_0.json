      "content": "Here are a few tips to make your drawings in Procreate more childlike:\n\n1. Use bold, bright colors. Children's artwork is often characterized by the use of vibrant, eye-catching colors.\n2. Keep your lines simple and expressive. Children's drawings tend to be more gestural and less detailed, so try using loose, expressive lines rather than trying to be too precise.\n3. Experiment with different brush styles. Procreate has a wide range of brush options, including some that mimic the look of crayons, markers, and paint. Try using these to give your drawings a more childlike feel.\n4. Don't worry too much about perfection. Children's artwork is often imperfect, and that's part of its charm. Embrace mistakes and allow your drawings to be a little rough around the edges.\n5. Use simple shapes and forms. Children's drawings often use simple shapes and forms to create objects and characters. Try breaking your subjects down into basic shapes to give your drawings a more childlike quality.\n\nI hope these tips help! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask."
