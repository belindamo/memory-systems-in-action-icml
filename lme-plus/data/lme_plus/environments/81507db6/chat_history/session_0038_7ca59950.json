You can always check your email or food delivery app history to see when you last placed an order. If you're still unsure, you could try checking their menu online or giving them a call to ask about their current promotions or new menu items. Who knows, you might discover a new favorite dish!\n\nBy the way, have you tried any Korean dishes that you particularly enjoy? Korean cuisine offers a wide range of flavors and spices, from spicy kimchi stew to savory bibimbap. If you're looking for recommendations, I'd be happy to suggest some popular dishes or hidden gems.\n\nNow, back to your chicken fajitas! Do you have all the necessary ingredients, or do you need to make a quick trip to the grocery store?"

      "content": "Cast-iron skillets can be a bit finicky, but they're often amazing for cooking fajitas!\n\nIf you're unsure about the skillet's heat tolerance, it's better to err on the side of caution. Cast-iron skillets can be used at high heat, but they need to be seasoned properly and preheated gradually to prevent damage.\n\nHere are a few things to check before using your cast-iron skillet for fajitas:\n\n1. **Seasoning:** If the skillet is well-seasoned, it should have a non-stick surface. Check if the surface is smooth and even. If it's rusty or flaky, it's best to re-season the skillet before using it.\n2. **Heat tolerance:** Check the manufacturer's instructions or the skillet's bottom for a heat tolerance label. Some cast-iron skillets can handle high heat, while others may have a lower heat limit.\n3. **Preheating:** Preheat the skillet gradually over medium-high heat for about 5-10 minutes. This will help the skillet distribute heat evenly and prevent it from cracking.\n4. **Oil:** Use a high-smoke-point oil like avocado oil or peanut oil to prevent the oil from burning or smoking at high heat.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can always use a different skillet or cookware that's specifically designed for high-heat cooking, like stainless steel or carbon steel.\n\nIf you do decide to use the cast-iron skillet, make sure to cook the fajitas over medium-high heat, and adjust the heat as needed to prevent burning or scorching. Keep an eye on the temperature and adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to cooking with cast-iron skillets. If you're unsure, it's okay to use a different cooking vessel to ensure a delicious and safe meal."

      "content": "I think I see a pattern here! It sounds like you're a fan of spicy food, and you've got a good feeling about that cast-iron skillet.\n\nIf you're confident that the skillet heated up well last time, it's likely that it can handle the high heat needed for fajitas. Just remember to preheat it gradually, use a high-smoke-point oil, and keep an eye on the temperature to prevent burning or scorching.\n\nNow, about that spicy pork bibimbap... did you enjoy it? Bibimbap is such a great dish, and the spicy kick from the gochujang sauce adds an amazing depth of flavor. Have you tried making bibimbap at home, or is it a dish you prefer to order from the Korean place?\n\nBy the way, since you're making fajitas, I have to ask: do you have a favorite type of pepper or level of spiciness that you like to add to your fajitas?"

      "content": "I loved the spicy pork bibimbap, and I actually got it two weeks ago, on a Thursday, if I recall correctly. It was a rainy day, so I was happy to stay indoors and enjoy the food. Anyway, back to the fajitas - I think I'll stick to bell peppers and onions, but I do like a bit of heat, so I might add some diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers to give it a kick."

      "content": "I'm glad you enjoyed the bibimbap! It's always great to have a delicious meal on a rainy day.\n\nNow, let's talk about adding some heat to your fajitas! Bell peppers and onions are a classic combination, and adding diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers will definitely give it a nice kick. If you like a bit of heat, you could also consider adding some diced Anaheim or Poblano peppers to the mix. They have a slightly sweet and smoky flavor that pairs well with the spicy kick from the jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers.\n\nRemember, when working with hot peppers, it's all about balance. You can always add more heat, but it's harder to take it away once it's added. So, start with a small amount and taste as you go, adjusting the heat level to your liking.\n\nSince you mentioned you like a bit of heat, I have to ask: have you ever tried making your own hot sauce or salsa from scratch? It's a great way to customize the flavor and heat level to your taste, and it's surprisingly easy to make!\n\nNow, are you ready to get started on those fajitas? Do you have any questions about the recipe or cooking process?"
