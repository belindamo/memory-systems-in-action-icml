      "content": "Both 42 and 420 have become popular cultural references, but they are associated with very different things.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, 42 is most closely associated with \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" and its fictional representation as the \"Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.\" It has also been used more broadly as a symbol of science fiction fandom and geek culture.\n\n420, on the other hand, is most commonly associated with cannabis culture and the consumption of marijuana. It is celebrated by some as a day of cannabis appreciation on April 20th (4/20).\n\nIn terms of which reference is \"greater,\" it likely depends on the context and the audience. Both 42 and 420 have their own dedicated followings and can be used effectively as cultural references depending on the situation."
