Such serious offences trample on Hong Kong's rule of law, destroy Hong Kong's social order, damage Hong Kong's fundamental interests, and are a blatant challenge to the principle of \"one country, two systems\".\n\nThe spokesman said that the Central Government resolutely supports the HKSAR Government and the police in discharging their responsibilities in accordance with the law, and supports the respective HKSAR authorities in prosecuting the criminal responsibility of the perpetrators of violence in accordance with the law, in order to restore the normal social order of the society as soon as possible, protect the personal safety and property of the citizens, and maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong."

Hong Kong's media unanimously condemned this on 2 July, saying that the violence seriously violated the rule of law in Hong Kong, which is incompatible with the general harmonious development of society, and contrary to the general public's vision of living and working in peace and contentment. The media called for strict punishment of the thugs without tolerance, to reshape the environment of the rule of law and restore a peaceful environment to the people of Hong Kong.\n\nAn editorial in Ta Kung Pao newspaper states that the so-called \"peaceful and rational\" movement, in close collaboration with trouble-making local politicians and foreign powers, has continuously incited riots, thereby now revealing its true nature as a \"bloody and violent\" anti-government movement.\nThe editorial pointed out that these atrocities are essentially an attack on the vital interests of the people of Hong Kong. The editorial called on all Hong Kong citizens to stand together and give the police full support to enforce the law to punish the thugs severely and not tolerate them, and to expose the malign agents (\u201cblack hands\u201d) who manipulate from behind the scenes, in order to prevent future troubles.\n\nThe Hong Kong Commercial Daily newspaper pointed out that the demonstration had turned into a violent and extreme attack, which has damaged public facilities, and security and stability. Furthermore, the attack has damaged Hong Kong's core values and spirit, as well as Hong Kong's reputation and image in the international community.\n\nAn editorial in Sing Tao Daily newspaper stated that the majority of Hong Kong citizens yearn for peace and stability, and the behaviour of these violent extremists completely works against this wish. Faced with the trauma caused by the violence, all walks of life in Hong Kong should work together to curb this frenzy and bring society back on track. Members of Parliament, organizations from all sectors and the public must clearly say \"no\" to violence, and not let it worsen, especially among young people, so as to not exacerbate social unrest and damage Hong Kong\u2019s future.\n\nAn editorial in Ming Pao newspaper is titled \"Violence is violence\", pointing out that \"violence against the Legislative Council must be condemned most severely\". According to the editorial, Hong Kong is still free and open, and the vast majority of Hong Kong people are peaceful, rational and non-violent. The whole society must stand up and draw a clear line against violence, and must not take a conciliatory attitude. If violence is tolerated, it will only continue to spread and become more serious.\n\nHong Kong public opinion generally believes that Hong Kong's achievements today are hard-won and are the result of the hard work and construction of all Hong Kong citizens. Violence should not be allowed to destroy Hong Kong's values, rule of law and order. They call on the whole society to put aside their differences and work together to protect Hong Kong's achievements and beauty, and work together to create a better future."
