      "content": "Recipe: Goofy Foot Blackberry Fakie Sour\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 10 lbs Pilsner malt\n* 1 lb White wheat malt\n* 1 lb Flaked wheat\n* 1 lb Munich malt\n* 1 lb Acidulated malt\n* 1 oz Saaz hops (60 min)\n* 1 oz Saaz hops (5 min)\n* 8 lbs fresh or frozen blackberries (or blackberry puree)\n* Lactobacillus brevis\n* Saccharomyces cerevisiae (clean ale yeast, such as American Ale or California Ale)\n* Water and brewing salts to match desired water profile\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Mash-in with 4.5 gallons of water at 152\u00b0F (67\u00b0C) for 60 minutes.\n2. Vorlauf and sparge with 4.5 gallons of water at 168\u00b0F (76\u00b0C) to collect approximately 6.5 gallons of wort.\n3. Bring the wort to a boil and add the 1 oz of Saaz hops at the 60-minute mark.\n4. Continue boiling for 55 minutes, then add the second 1 oz of Saaz hops at the 5-minute mark before the end of the boil.\n5. Cool the wort to 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) and pitch the Lactobacillus brevis culture. Purge the fermenter headspace with CO2 to limit oxygen exposure.\n6. Allow the wort to sour for 2-4 days, until the desired level of sourness is reached. Monitor pH and taste frequently.\n7. Once the desired sourness is achieved, heat the wort to 180\u00b0F (82\u00b0C) for 15 minutes to kill off the Lactobacillus and halt the souring process. Cool the wort to 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C).\n8. Transfer the wort to a sanitized fermentation vessel and pitch the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast.\n9. Ferment at 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) for 7-10 days, or until the fermentation is complete.\n10. Add blackberries (or blackberry puree) to a sanitized secondary fermenter, and rack the beer onto the fruit.\n11. Allow the beer to sit on the fruit for 7-14 days, tasting periodically until the desired fruit flavor is achieved.\n12. Rack the beer off the fruit and cold crash for 48 hours to help clarify and settle any remaining sediment.\n13. Package the beer, carbonate to 2.5-3.0 volumes of CO2, and enjoy!\n\nName: \"Switch Stance Blackberry Shred\"\n\nThis name plays on the \"Goofy Foot\" theme, incorporating skateboarding terminology (\"switch stance\" and \"shred\") to create a fun and unique beer name that connects to the brewery's identity."
