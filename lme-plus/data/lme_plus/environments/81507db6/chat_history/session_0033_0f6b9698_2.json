Slowly lift your hips up towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top, and then lower back down.\n\n**Leg and Ankle Mobility:**\n\n1. **Ankle circles:** Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lift one foot off the ground and draw circles with your ankle, starting from small circles and increasing in size.\n2. **Calf raises:** Stand on the edge of a stair or step with your heels hanging off the edge.
