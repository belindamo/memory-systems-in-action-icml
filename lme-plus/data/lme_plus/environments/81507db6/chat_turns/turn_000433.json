Since I'm a text-based AI, I don't have access to your location, but I can suggest a few options to help you find a suitable route:\n\n1. **MapMyRun**: This popular route-finding website and app allows you to search for routes in your area. You can filter by distance, terrain, and elevation gain. Simply enter your location, set the distance to 10K, and adjust the elevation gain settings to find a route that suits your needs.\n2. **Strava**: Strava is a social network for athletes, and it also has a robust route-finding feature. You can search for routes in your area, filter by distance and elevation gain, and even see the routes that other runners in your area have created and shared.\n3. **Runkeeper**: Runkeeper is another popular running app that allows you to search for routes in your area. You can filter by distance, terrain, and elevation gain, and even see the routes that other runners have created and shared.\n4. **Local Running Clubs or Stores**: Reach out to local running clubs, running stores, or athletic clubs in your area. They often have knowledge of the best routes for running and can provide recommendations based on your preferences.\n5. **Google Maps**: You can use Google Maps to create your own route by plotting points along a road or trail. You can also use the \"Terrain\" feature to get an idea of the elevation gain along the route.\n\nWhen searching for a route, consider the following factors:\n\n* Elevation gain: Look for routes with minimal elevation gain or gradual inclines.\n* Road surface: Avoid routes with rough or uneven surfaces, especially if you're not used to running on trails.\n* Traffic: Choose routes with minimal traffic or designated bike lanes to ensure a safe running experience.\n* Scenic views: Pick a route with scenic views or interesting landmarks to keep you motivated and engaged.\n\nRemember to always check the route beforehand, especially if you're new to the area. You can drive or walk the route to get a feel for the terrain and make any necessary adjustments before your run.\n\nGood luck with your next 10K, and I hope you find a route that suits your needs!",
