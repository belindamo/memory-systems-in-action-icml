Here are some of its key features and how it handles multiple devices and traffic prioritization:\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n1. **Tri-band Wi-Fi**: Google Wifi uses a tri-band Wi-Fi system, which means it has three separate Wi-Fi bands: one 2.4 GHz band and two 5 GHz bands. This allows it to handle more devices and reduce congestion.\n2. **Mesh Network**: Google Wifi is a mesh network system, which means it uses multiple nodes (routers) to provide a strong and reliable Wi-Fi signal throughout your home. You can use up to 6 nodes to cover an area of up to 4,500 square feet.\n3. **Network Assist**: Google Wifi's Network Assist technology continuously monitors your network and optimizes it for the best performance. It automatically switches devices to the best Wi-Fi band and channel, and it can even switch devices to a different node if needed.\n4. **Traffic Prioritization**: Google Wifi allows you to prioritize certain devices or applications on your network. For example, you can prioritize your smart TV or online gaming console to ensure a smooth and lag-free experience.\n5. **Google Wifi App**: The Google Wifi app (available for Android and iOS) allows you to manage your network, see which devices are connected, and troubleshoot issues. You can also use the app to set up parental controls, guest networks, and more.\n6. **Security**: Google Wifi has built-in security features, including automatic firmware updates, malware protection, and encryption.\n\n**Handling Multiple Devices:**\n\nGoogle Wifi is designed to handle multiple devices with ease. It uses a technology called \"device steering\" to automatically switch devices to the best Wi-Fi band and channel. This ensures that each device gets the best possible connection and reduces congestion.\n\nGoogle Wifi can handle up to 150 devices per node, and since you can use up to 6 nodes, that's a total of 900 devices! However, it's worth noting that the actual number of devices you can connect will depend on the size of your home, the number of nodes you use, and the type of devices you're connecting.\n\n**Traffic Prioritization:**\n\nGoogle Wifi's traffic prioritization feature is called \"Quality of Service\" (QoS). It allows you to prioritize certain devices or applications on your network, ensuring that they get the bandwidth they need.\n\nYou can set up QoS rules in the Google Wifi app, and you can prioritize devices or applications based on their IP address, MAC address, or port number. For example, you can prioritize your smart TV's IP address to ensure a smooth streaming experience.\n\nGoogle Wifi also has a feature called \"Dynamic QoS,\" which automatically detects and prioritizes critical applications like video streaming and online gaming. This means that even if you don't set up custom QoS rules, Google Wifi will still prioritize these applications to ensure a smooth experience.\n\nOverall, Google Wifi is a fantastic mesh network system that's designed to provide a strong, reliable, and seamless Wi-Fi experience in your home. Its tri-band Wi-Fi, mesh network technology, and traffic prioritization features make it an excellent choice for homes with multiple devices and heavy internet usage.",
