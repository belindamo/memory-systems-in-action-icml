  "content": "There are several challenges that Cottbus has faced in attracting new businesses. One of the major challenges is the high level of competition from other cities in the region, such as Berlin and Dresden. These cities have well-established business environments, better transport infrastructure, and access to a more extensive pool of skilled labor, which makes it challenging for Cottbus to compete with them.\n\nAnother challenge is the relatively high unemployment rate in the city. While unemployment rates have been decreasing in recent years, they still remain relatively high compared to other cities in the region. This makes it difficult for the city to attract new businesses that require a highly skilled workforce.\n\nThe city has also faced challenges in attracting investment due to its location in Eastern Germany, which has experienced lower levels of economic growth compared to the rest of the country. This, coupled with the legacy of East Germany's socialist planning system, makes it challenging for the city to attract foreign investment.\n\nFinally, Cottbus has faced challenges in attracting and retaining young talent. Many young professionals leave the city to other parts of Germany or other countries for better job opportunities and a more vibrant social life.\n\nDespite these challenges, the city has been proactive in addressing them and has been working to promote its strengths, such as its skilled workforce, infrastructure, and quality of life to potential investors to attract new businesses to the city.",
