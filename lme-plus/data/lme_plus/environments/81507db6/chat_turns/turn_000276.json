  "content": "Google Wifi handles firmware updates in a seamless and automatic way, ensuring that your network stays secure and up-to-date with the latest features and improvements. Here's how it works:\n\n**Automatic Firmware Updates:**\n\nGoogle Wifi's firmware updates are automatic, which means you don't need to manually check for updates or install them yourself. The system is designed to update itself in the background, ensuring that you always have the latest security patches and features.\n\n**Update Schedule:**\n\nGoogle Wifi typically performs firmware updates during a maintenance window, which is usually between 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM local time. This is a quiet period when most users are not actively using their network, minimizing any potential disruptions.\n\n**How Updates Work:**\n\nHere's what happens during a firmware update:\n\n1. **Detection:** Google Wifi's cloud-based infrastructure detects a new firmware update and notifies your router.\n2. **Download:** The update is downloaded to your router in the background, without interrupting your internet connection.\n3. **Installation:** The update is installed on your router during the maintenance window (3:00 AM - 4:00 AM local time).\n4. **Reboot:** The router reboots to apply the update, which usually takes a few minutes.\n5. **Verification:** The router verifies the update and ensures that everything is working correctly.\n\n**Impact on Your Network:**\n\nDuring the update process, you might experience a brief interruption to your internet connection, usually around 2-5 minutes. This is because the router needs to reboot to apply the update. However, this is a rare occurrence, and most updates are applied seamlessly in the background without any noticeable impact on your network.\n\n**Notification:**\n\nAfter the update is complete, you'll receive a notification in the Google Wifi app, informing you that the update was successful. You can also check the app to see the update history and version number of your router's firmware.\n\nOverall, Google Wifi's automatic firmware updates ensure that your network stays secure, stable, and feature-rich, without requiring any manual intervention from you.",
