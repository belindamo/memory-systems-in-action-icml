  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have subjective experiences. However, I can provide a general picture of the economic landscape of Cottbus over the past decade.\n\nCottbus is a city in Eastern Germany that has undergone significant changes in its economic landscape over the past decade. Like many cities in Europe, Cottbus was impacted by the 2008 financial crisis, which led to a decline in economic growth and job losses.\n\nHowever, in the following years, the city experienced some recovery, thanks to the growing renewable energy sector. The solar industry, in particular, emerged as a major contributor to the city's economy, creating new job opportunities and attracting new businesses.\n\nDespite the growth of the renewable energy industry, Cottbus still faces some economic challenges, including high unemployment rates and a decline in population. The city has been working to attract new businesses and invest in infrastructure to support economic growth and development. The government has also been providing financial support to help businesses create new jobs and expand their operations.\n\nOverall, Cottbus's economic landscape has been gradually evolving over the past decade, driven largely by the growth of the renewable energy sector, and the city remains committed to supporting further economic growth and development in the years to come.",
