  "content": "My current aero kit is pretty basic, just a front lip and side skirts. I'm looking to upgrade to a more comprehensive kit that includes a rear diffuser, rear wing, and possibly a vented hood to improve airflow and downforce. I've been eyeing the APR Performance kit, but I'm also considering some other options.\n\nI've heard that a good aero kit can make a big difference in terms of high-speed stability and cornering ability. Do you think it's worth investing in a high-end kit, or would a more budget-friendly option be sufficient for my level of drifting?",
