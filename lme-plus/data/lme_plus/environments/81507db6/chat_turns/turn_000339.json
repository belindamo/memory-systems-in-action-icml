Hold for 5-10 seconds and release. Repeat 10-15 times.\n4. **Arm circles:** Hold your arms straight out to the sides and make small circles with your hands. Gradually increase the size of the circles as you continue.\n\n**Upper Body Flexibility:**\n\n1. **Chest stretches:** Stand in a doorway with your hands on the doorframe at shoulder height. Lean forward, stretching your chest and shoulders.\n2. **Shoulder rolls:** Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a circular motion. Repeat 10-15 times.\n3. **Neck stretches:** Slowly tilt your head to the side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder.
