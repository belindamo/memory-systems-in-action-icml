  "content": "Sure, here are some specific actions the Academy has taken to implement its diversity and inclusion initiatives:\n\n1. Membership rules: The Academy has implemented new membership rules to increase diversity among its voting membership. Starting in 2016, the Academy set specific goals to double the number of women and diverse members by 2020, and it has made progress towards those goals. In 2020, the percentage of women members increased from 31% to 33%, and the percentage of diverse members increased from 16% to 19%.\n\n2. Aperture 2025 initiative: The Aperture 2025 initiative is a five-year plan aimed at increasing diversity and inclusion in the film industry. The initiative includes efforts to increase representation both on and off screen, such as through mentorship programs, career development initiatives, and outreach to underrepresented communities.\n\n3. Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion: In 2020, the Academy established the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion to oversee and implement its diversity and inclusion initiatives. The office is responsible for developing and implementing strategies to increase diversity and inclusion within the Academy and the film industry as a whole.\n\n4. Acknowledging and addressing past issues: The Academy has acknowledged that it has historically had issues with diversity and inclusion and has taken steps to address those issues. For example, in 2016, it launched a series of conversations called \"Academy Dialogues,\" where members of the Academy discussed issues of diversity and inclusion in the industry.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the actions the Academy has taken to promote diversity and inclusion in the entertainment industry. Of course, there is still much work to be done to fully address the issue, but the Academy's efforts are a step in the right direction.",
