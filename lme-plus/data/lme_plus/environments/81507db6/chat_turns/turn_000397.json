  "content": "Cast-iron skillets can be a bit finicky, but they're often amazing for cooking fajitas!\n\nIf you're unsure about the skillet's heat tolerance, it's better to err on the side of caution. Cast-iron skillets can be used at high heat, but they need to be seasoned properly and preheated gradually to prevent damage.\n\nHere are a few things to check before using your cast-iron skillet for fajitas:\n\n1. **Seasoning:** If the skillet is well-seasoned, it should have a non-stick surface. Check if the surface is smooth and even. If it's rusty or flaky, it's best to re-season the skillet before using it.\n2. **Heat tolerance:** Check the manufacturer's instructions or the skillet's bottom for a heat tolerance label. Some cast-iron skillets can handle high heat, while others may have a lower heat limit.\n3. **Preheating:** Preheat the skillet gradually over medium-high heat for about 5-10 minutes. This will help the skillet distribute heat evenly and prevent it from cracking.\n4. **Oil:** Use a high-smoke-point oil like avocado oil or peanut oil to prevent the oil from burning or smoking at high heat.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can always use a different skillet or cookware that's specifically designed for high-heat cooking, like stainless steel or carbon steel.\n\nIf you do decide to use the cast-iron skillet, make sure to cook the fajitas over medium-high heat, and adjust the heat as needed to prevent burning or scorching. Keep an eye on the temperature and adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to cooking with cast-iron skillets. If you're unsure, it's okay to use a different cooking vessel to ensure a delicious and safe meal.",
