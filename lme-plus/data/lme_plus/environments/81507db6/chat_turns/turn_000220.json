Checking out The North Face and Canada Goose websites will give you a good idea of their latest offerings and technology.\n\nAnd, absolutely, considering a coat with a removable fleece liner or a waterproof and breathable membrane like Gore-Tex is a great idea! These features can greatly enhance the functionality and performance of your coat.\n\nA removable fleece liner can be a great asset, especially if you live in an area with varying temperatures. It allows you to adjust the coat's warmth and weight to suit the conditions. Plus, it can be a great layering piece on its own.\n\nA waterproof and breathable membrane like Gore-Tex, eVent, or similar technology is a must-have if you'll be using the coat in wet or snowy conditions. These membranes help keep you dry and comfortable by preventing water from entering the coat while allowing moisture to escape. This feature is especially important if you plan to use the coat for outdoor activities like hiking, skiing, or commuting in rainy or snowy weather.\n\nWhen considering a coat with a waterproof and breathable membrane, look for the following:\n\n1. **Waterproof rating**: Check the coat's waterproof rating, usually measured in millimeters (mm). A higher rating indicates greater water resistance.\n2. **Breathability**: Ensure the coat has a breathable membrane that allows moisture to escape, preventing buildup of condensation.\n3. **Membrane type**: Gore-Tex, eVent, and similar technologies are well-known for their performance and durability.\n4. **Seam sealing**: Check if the coat's seams are sealed to prevent water from entering through the stitching.\n\nSome popular coat styles that often feature removable fleece liners or waterproof and breathable membranes include:\n\n1. **Parkas**: Long, insulated coats with a waterproof and breathable membrane, often featuring a removable fleece liner.\n2. **Shell jackets**: Lightweight, waterproof, and breathable coats that can be worn on their own or layered under a fleece or insulated jacket.\n3. **3-in-1 coats**: Versatile coats that can be worn as a single layer or as a system with a removable fleece liner and waterproof shell.\n\nWhen shopping on ThredUp or eBay, you can filter your search by features like waterproof, breathable, or removable liner to find coats that meet your requirements.\n\nRemember to carefully check the condition, authenticity, and reviews of any used or second-hand coat you're considering, and don't hesitate to ask the seller questions if you need more information.",
