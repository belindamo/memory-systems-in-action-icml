Such serious offences trample on Hong Kong's rule of law, destroy Hong Kong's social order, damage Hong Kong's fundamental interests, and are a blatant challenge to the principle of \"one country, two systems\".\n\nThe spokesman said that the Central Government resolutely supports the HKSAR Government and the police in discharging their responsibilities in accordance with the law, and supports the respective HKSAR authorities in prosecuting the criminal responsibility of the perpetrators of violence in accordance with the law, in order to restore the normal social order of the society as soon as possible, protect the personal safety and property of the citizens, and maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.",
