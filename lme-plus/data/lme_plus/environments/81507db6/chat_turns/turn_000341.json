It's great that you're aware of your tendency to tense up your shoulders while dancing, and making a conscious effort to relax them will definitely help. Remember to breathe deeply and focus on the music, letting it guide your movements.\n\nShoulder rolls and chest stretches will help loosen up your upper body and improve your posture, which will, in turn, help you relax and move more fluidly on the dance floor. Don't forget to stretch after your workouts and dancing sessions to help your muscles recover and prevent injuries.\n\nKeep in mind that it might take some time to develop new habits and see improvements, so be patient and kind to yourself. Celebrate your small victories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.\n\nNow, go ahead and get ready to shine on that dance floor!",
