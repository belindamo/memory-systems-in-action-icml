Here are some effective and eco-friendly tips to help you get the job done:\n\n1. **Baking soda and vinegar**: Mix baking soda and vinegar to create a paste. Apply it to the shower walls, floor, and bathtub, and let it sit for 30 minutes. The acid in the vinegar will help break down soap scum and mineral deposits. Scrub with a non-abrasive sponge or cloth, then rinse with warm water.\n2. **Castile soap and water**: Dilute castile soap with warm water to create a gentle cleaning solution. Apply it to the shower and bathtub, then scrub with a soft-bristled brush or non-abrasive sponge. Rinse thoroughly with warm water.\n3. **Microfiber cloths**: Use microfiber cloths to clean the shower and bathtub. They're effective at picking up dirt and grime without leaving streaks or residue.\n4. **Essential oils**: Certain essential oils, like tea tree oil, lemon oil, and eucalyptus oil, have antibacterial and antifungal properties. Mix a few drops of your chosen oil with water in a spray bottle and use it to clean the shower and bathtub.\n5. **Steam cleaning**: Use a steam cleaner or a hot water-filled bucket with a long-handled brush to clean the shower and bathtub. Steam can help loosen soap scum and mildew without the need for harsh chemicals.\n6. **Regular maintenance**: To prevent soap scum and mildew buildup, clean your shower and bathtub regularly. Wipe down the shower walls and floor after each use, and clean the bathtub every 1-2 weeks.\n7. **Natural scrubbers**: Use natural scrubbers like borax, washing soda, or Epsom salt to gently remove tough stains and grime.\n\nRemember to always spot test any new cleaning solution or product on a small area before applying it to the entire shower and bathtub.\n\nI hope these tips help you clean your shower and bathtub effectively without relying on harsh chemicals!",
