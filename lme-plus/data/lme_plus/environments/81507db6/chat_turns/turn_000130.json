  "content": "It is certainly possible that a new treaty or agreement could emerge that will be as influential as the Treaty of Westphalia in shaping international relations. Given the constantly changing nature of global politics and the emergence of new challenges such as climate change, terrorism, and cyberwarfare, it is likely that new treaties and agreements will need to be developed to address these issues. For example, the Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, has been widely recognized as a significant achievement in international cooperation. The development of new international legal frameworks for regulating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering may also require the establishment of new treaties and agreements. Ultimately, the future of international relations will depend on the ability of global actors to work together to address shared challenges and uphold the principles that underlie the global system of states.",
