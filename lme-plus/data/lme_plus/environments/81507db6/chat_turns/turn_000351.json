  "content": "To decide which content types to prioritize, you can consider the following factors:\n\n1. Your business goals: What are you trying to achieve with your content? If you're trying to generate leads, for example, you might prioritize content types that are known for lead generation, such as gated pieces like e-books, whitepapers, and webinars. 2. Your target audience: Who are you trying to reach with your content, and what type of content do they engage with the most? If your audience consists of visual learners, for example, you might prioritize content types that are more visual, such as infographics, videos, or images. 3. Your resources: What is your team capable of creating and promoting? If you have a small team or limited resources, you might prioritize content types that are less resource-intensive, such as blogs or social media posts. 4. Your competition: What type of content is your competition creating, and is there an opportunity to differentiate yourself by focusing on a different content type? Ultimately, what content types you prioritize will depend on your specific business and circumstances. It's important to experiment with different content types and track your results to see what works best for you.",
