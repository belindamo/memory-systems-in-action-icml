Using the sweet potato chews as a reward during playtime with the cat tree is a purr-fect way to encourage Luna to engage in physical activity and associate the new treats with positive experiences!\n\nHere are some tips to make the most of this idea:\n\n1. **Hide and Seek**: Hide the sweet potato chews around the cat tree or on different levels, encouraging Luna to climb, jump, and search for them. This will not only provide mental stimulation but also exercise her physical skills.\n2. **Reward Climbing**: Place a few sweet potato chews on the highest level of the cat tree, encouraging Luna to climb up and retrieve them. This will help build her confidence and strength.\n3. **Treat Dispensers**: Try using treat-dispensing toys or puzzle toys filled with sweet potato chews and place them around the cat tree. This will challenge Luna to figure out how to get the treats out, keeping her engaged and stimulated.\n4. **Play and Reward**: Engage in playtime activities like chasing a laser pointer or feather toy around the cat tree, and reward Luna with sweet potato chews when she reaches a certain level or completes a task.\n5. **Make it a Routine**: Establish a regular playtime routine involving the cat tree and sweet potato chews. This will help Luna associate the activity with fun and rewards, making her more likely to engage in physical activity.\n\nRemember to always supervise Luna during playtime and ensure her safety while using the cat tree. With time and consistency, she'll learn to love the sweet potato chews and associate them with the fun and excitement of playtime!\n\nHow's Luna enjoying the cat tree so far? Has she claimed it as her own territory yet?",
