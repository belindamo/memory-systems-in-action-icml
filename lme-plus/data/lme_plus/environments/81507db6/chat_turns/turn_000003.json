Anti-psychotic medication is often the mainstay of treatment, which helps in reducing or getting rid of the symptoms of schizophrenia, like hallucinations and delusions. Antidepressant or anti-anxiety medications may also be prescribed to manage symptoms like anxiety or depression.\n\nTherapy can also help manage some of the psychological and social challenges that come with schizophrenia. Types of therapy that may be helpful include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family therapy, and social skills training.\n\nSocial support is also an essential part of the treatment of schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia often need support and guidance from loved ones and caregivers. It's important for family, friends or caregivers to learn about schizophrenia so that they can offer support, help prevent setbacks, and communicate with the healthcare team about the individual's progress.\n\nOverall, a comprehensive, tailored treatment plan that includes both medications and psychotherapy can help individuals with schizophrenia manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling lives.",
