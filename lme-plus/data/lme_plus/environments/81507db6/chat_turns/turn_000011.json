  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific plans the Academy has for holding people accountable for discrimination or creating a more inclusive work environment. However, it's worth noting that the Academy has acknowledged that diversity and inclusion are ongoing issues, and it is working to address them on multiple fronts.\n\nOne way the Academy can work towards a more inclusive environment is by promoting more diverse storytelling in the film industry. This means creating more opportunities for diverse filmmakers and actors, and providing a platform for stories that reflect different perspectives and experiences.\n\nAdditionally, the Academy can work to hold individuals and organizations within the industry accountable for discrimination. This could involve implementing stricter policies and consequences for discriminatory behavior, as well as providing more resources and support for those who experience discrimination.\n\nUltimately, it will take sustained effort and commitment from the Academy and the industry as a whole to create a truly inclusive environment. The work will involve both implementing specific initiatives and policies and fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect.",
