  "content": "Thank you for providing more information! Based on your description, it sounds like you're experiencing congestion and interference issues, which are common problems in homes with multiple devices and physical obstructions. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and improve your Wi-Fi connection:\n\n**1. Check your router's location and surroundings**:\nSince you have a lot of walls and furniture between your router and devices, try moving your router to a more central location in your home. This can help reduce interference and improve signal strength. Also, ensure your router is placed on a flat surface, away from any obstructions, and not hidden behind furniture or walls.\n\n**2. Upgrade your router's firmware**:\nComcast provides a list of approved routers for their service. Check if your router is on that list and if it's running the latest firmware. Upgrading your router's firmware can improve its performance, range, and ability to handle multiple devices.\n\n**3. Change your Wi-Fi channel**:\nAs I mentioned earlier, channel interference can cause connectivity issues. Use a Wi-Fi analyzer app (like Wi-Fi Analyzer for Android or WiFi Explorer for macOS) to scan for nearby networks and identify the least crowded channel. Then, log in to your router's settings and change the Wi-Fi channel to the recommended one.\n\n**4. Use Quality of Service (QoS) settings**:\nSince you have many devices connected, it's possible that some devices are hogging bandwidth. Enable QoS settings on your router to prioritize traffic for critical devices like your smart TV and laptops. This can help ensure that critical devices get the necessary bandwidth.\n\n**5. Consider upgrading your router**:\nIf your router is old or not designed to handle multiple devices, it might be time to upgrade. Look for a router that supports:\n\t* MU-MIMO (Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology, which allows the router to serve multiple devices simultaneously.\n\t* Dual-band or tri-band capabilities, which can help reduce congestion.\n\t* A strong signal strength and range.\n\n**6. Reduce interference from other devices**:\nOther devices in your home can interfere with your Wi-Fi signal. Try to:\n\t* Move cordless phones, microwaves, and other devices that operate on the 2.4 GHz frequency away from your router.\n\t* Switch to devices that use the 5 GHz frequency, which is less prone to interference.\n\n**7. Check for physical obstructions**:\nWhile you mentioned you have a lot of walls and furniture between your router and devices, try to minimize these obstructions as much as possible. Consider moving furniture or using a Wi-Fi range extender to improve signal strength.\n\n**8. Monitor your network usage**:\nUse tools like the Comcast app or a third-party network monitoring app to track your network usage and identify which devices are using the most bandwidth. This can help you optimize your network and device settings.\n\n**9. Consider a mesh network system**:\nIf you have a large home or many devices, a mesh network system can provide a stronger, more reliable signal throughout your home. Comcast offers their own mesh network system, xFi, which integrates with their internet service.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to improve your Wi-Fi connection and reduce the occurrence of slow speeds and dropped connections. If you're still experiencing issues, you may want to consider contacting Comcast support for further assistance or considering a professional network audit.",
