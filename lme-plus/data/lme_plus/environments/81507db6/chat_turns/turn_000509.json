  "content": "Christian philosophy viewed mathematics favorably as it reflected the deity's rule-bound and law-abiding nature. Saint Augustine compared mathematical knowledge to divine revelation and considered it to be perceived by an inner light. Boethius, on the other hand, was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, and he built on Pythagorean number theory and used mathematical calculations, such as the computus, to calculate the date of Easter. He also focused on numerological interpretations and the theory of musica in his works. Overall, mathematics was viewed as a valuable tool within the Christian worldview, and its study was considered to be a way of understanding the divine.",
