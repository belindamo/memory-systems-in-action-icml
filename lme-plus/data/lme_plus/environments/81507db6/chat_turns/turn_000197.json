Speaking of which, I'm glad I took that extra 30 minutes on Wednesday to catch up on the cleaning and get everything back in order, I feel like it really made a difference. Anyway, back to the bathroom cabinets - do you have any recommendations for specific storage containers or baskets that would work well for this type of organization project?",
