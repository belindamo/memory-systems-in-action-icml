  "content": "Area No. 2 (the second Filecoin virtual machine use case)\n\nPerpetual storage\nThe opportunity\nMany common-good datasets rely on stewarding organizations to ensure their preservation and continued accessibility (e.g. a government, corporation, or non-profit). Examples include crime statistics, inflation metrics, election results, environmental data records, etc.\n\nWhen this responsibility lies on a single organization, it can create a central point of failure and trust. If that organization goes away or changes motivation, the common-good data could be lost forever or manipulated, resulting in an inadmissible net loss for society.\n\nThe potential\nWith Filecoin actors, the responsibility of ensuring liveness of valuable data is can be shared collectively. Permissionless code running autonomously on-chain can guarantee the continuation and renewal of storage, with no risk of modification or alteration of the underlying datasets thanks to content-addressing.\n\nFunding mechanisms and decision-making can be coupled with Data DAOs and Staking Protocols to enable pay-once-store-forever mechanics.\n\nPlease write in English language.",
