Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Know your sizes**: Make sure you know your measurements and the brands' sizing charts to ensure a good fit.\n2. **Research**: Look up the original prices of the coats you're interested in to determine if the thrifted or second-hand price is a good deal.\n3. **Condition**: Check the condition of the coat carefully, looking for any signs of wear, stains, or damage.\n4. **Authenticity**: Be cautious of counterfeit products, especially on online marketplaces. Make sure to buy from reputable sellers and check the coat's tags, labels, and packaging.\n5. **Cleanliness**: Consider the cleanliness of the coat and whether it needs to be dry cleaned or washed before wearing.\n\nThredUp and eBay are both great options, but you can also try other online marketplaces like:\n\n1. **Poshmark**: A social commerce platform where users sell gently used clothing and accessories.\n2. **The RealReal**: A luxury consignment store that sells authenticated designer goods, including coats.\n3. **eBay**: A popular online auction site where you can find new and used coats from various sellers.\n4. **Local thrift stores**: Don't forget to check local thrift stores, charity shops, or consignment stores in your area for hidden gems.\n\nRemember, when thrift shopping or buying second-hand, you might need to be flexible with your expectations. You might not find the exact coat you want, but you can find a great alternative at a lower price.\n\nGood luck in your coat hunt, and I hope you find the perfect one!",
