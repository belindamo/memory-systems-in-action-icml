  "content": "Mathematics within Christian philosophy\nThe fall of the Roman empire implied that Greek manuscripts became buried in the libraries of\nsmall monasteries. The number of people being able to read Greek diminished. The pax romana\nhad secured a wide spread of Greek philosophy, and of Greek philosophical manuscripts, and\nalthough it had reached only a tiny part of the population, it was kept alive, in a way. Where geometria\nand arithmetica, even if mostly viewed practical or mystical, had been a part of Roman\nculture, the early Christians distanced themselves from the pagan Greek philosophers. The ideas\nbehind the Greek world order were not consistent with the notion of an omnipotent God. The\nnew Christian ideas proved to be much more supportive for mathematical practices, since the\nChristian God was a deity who favoured rules and laws, instead of the irrational and quarrelling\ngods of the antique civilisations. The divine rules and laws reflected favourable upon the ideas\nwithin geometria or arithmetica, and although there was no systematic use of mathematical\nknowledge within theology, there were several of the old Christian thinkers who tried to connect\nthe two fields. We will have a closer look at two of them.\nOne of the reasons for the popularity of Saint Augustine (354 - 430) was the fact that he was autodidact.\nIt was exactly the fact that he was not versed in the Greek philosophers, which made\nhim the ideal icon to the young religion. Later generations would consider him one of the church\nfathers, although he had been quite profane in his youth (\u201cdo grant me chastity, oh Lord, but just\nnot yet now!\u201d), but he did become very pious.\nAugustine himself didn\u2019t write about either geometria nor arithmetica, but as little as he knew\nthe subjects, he was impressed by the possibilities these subjects seemed to offer. In his De Libero\nArbitrio (\u201cOn free choice of the will\u201d), written between 387 and 395, he compared knowledge\nof arithmetica to divine revelation. As an example he took the observation that every number is\nas far from \u201cthe origin\u201d (meaning zero) as its double is from the original number:\nMathematical worlds 34\nIllustration I.7: a fries with educational situation from Roman days, found in the vicinity of Trier.\nThrough all the other numbers you will find what you found in the first two numbers, that is, in one and two:\nwhatever the number may be, counting from the beginning, this same number being added to it the number you\nreach is its double. How, then, do we recognise that this fact, which we recognise throughout all numbers, is\nunchangeable, sure, and certain? No one is aware of all numbers with any bodily sense, for they are innumerable.\nHow, then, do we know that this holds good throughout them all? By what idea or image do we see so sure\na truth so confidently throughout innumerable instances, unless we do it by an inner light, unknown to the bodily\nsense? By these and other such proofs those to whom God has given the gift of reasoning and who are not\ndarkened by obstinacy, must admit that the law and truth of number do not concern the bodily sense, that they\nare unalterably sure, and are perceived in common by all who reason.\nAlthough Augustine didn\u2019t say so explicitly, later Christian thinkers would interpret his words as\nsanctifying this form of knowledge. This was even strengthened by the fact that number and use\nof numerology was exuberant in the Old Testament books \u2014 as noted in the early paragraphs of\nthis chapter. God would have revealed arithmetica to Abraham. Until well into the 11th century,\none may find Christian thinkers who believed that God must have been well versed in geometria,\nsince Creation was so obviously harmonious, with perfect spheres, moving in perfect circular\nobits.\nAs a Christian thinker Boethius (480-524/525) was in many ways perpendicular to Augustine.\nFirst he had been raised in a wealthy and politically influential family, so he knew the Greek philosophers\nwell. As a consul, he was a public figure whose influence was beyond doubt. His translations\nof books by Aristotle and Plato were well-known. Second, apart from his love for numerological\ninterpretation, his ideas about arithmetica went far beyond what Augustine had favoured.\nBuilding on the praise by his \u201cpredecessor\u201d, he consciously opted for Pythagorean number theory\n\u2014 or what was considered to be part of that \u2014 instead of the knowledge of geometria. Most\nnoteworthy, his De institutio arithmetica would be illustrative for medieval knowledge of the\narithmetica, and focused on numerological interpretations and served as an introduction to the\ntheory of musica. Third and last, he gave a very practical and typical Christian use for arithmetica,\nby offering the rules for computus.\nThe computus was considered an important element in the calculation of time. To the presentday\nreader it is the most recognisable part of the medieval art of trying to establish a Biblical calendar,\nnotably used, for example in attempts to establish the day of Creation. The rules for computus\nwere used to calculate the day of Easter, which during the council of Nicea (325) was\nagreed to be on the first Sunday after the first full moon in spring. Boethius offered the rules that\nhelped to calculate the date, which made his book valuable to the Christian world. The knowledge\nof arithmetica and astronomia needed to understand the calculation must have been in\nthe head of Boethius, but is not to be found in the manuscripts of De institutio, which offers a\npractical calculation guide.\nWithout emergence of a mathematical practice, the high esteem in which numbers were held by\nByzantine scholars, is also reflected in the Pandectae (a Latin adaption of \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u2014 which\nwould translate to \u201ccovering everything\u201d), a codification of Roman law. The Pandects for example\nMathematical worlds 35\ncontained a couple of verdicts on inheritance that used numbers. One of the most curious, is\nabout a man who on his deathbed decided that his pregnant wife and child would have to split\nthe inheritance, where the wife would have a third of the money in case of a son, and two thirds\nif a girl would be born \u2014 the rest automatically being bequeathed to the child. After the death\nof the man, the widow gave birth to twins of different sex. Although to present-day ideas the\nproblem is not decidable, a verdict using ratios was nevertheless tempting and indeed put forward\nas the fair solution to this problem.\nDuring the Carolingian renaissance, around 800 AD, a new codification of the corpus of Christian\nknowledge was called for. From that moment onwards, the new type of aristocracy that had risen,\nbased on the possession of land, horses and the ability to fight, was supposed to educate its\nchildren in the so-called Artes liberales: the arts that had to be mastered by any free man. These\narts were subdivided into the trivium and quadrivium. The trivium (the later trivial matters!) consisted\nof grammar, rhetorics and dialectics. The quadrivium were the arithmetica, musica, geometria\nand astronomia. Although knowledge of these subjects was all very much depending on the\nMathematical worlds 36\nIllustration I.8: Page 4 verso of a tenth century Boethius manuscript from Lund university library.
