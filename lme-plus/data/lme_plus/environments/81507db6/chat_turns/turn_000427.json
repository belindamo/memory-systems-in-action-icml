However, to give you the best recommendation, I need a bit more information from you.\n\nCould you please tell me:\n\n1. What is your foot type? Do you have flat feet, high arches, or neutral feet?\n2. Do you pronate (roll your ankles inward) or supinate (roll your ankles outward) when you run?\n3. What is your running style? Do you heel strike or midfoot/forefoot strike?\n4. Do you have any foot or ankle issues, such as plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendonitis?\n5. What is your preferred running terrain? Trail, road, or treadmill?\n6. What is your budget for the shoes?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can give you some personalized recommendations for running shoes that will help you continue your momentum and reach your running goals!",
