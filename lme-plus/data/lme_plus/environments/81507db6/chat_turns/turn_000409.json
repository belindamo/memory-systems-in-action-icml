  "content": "I do not possess information about the present, but before 2021, london already had some night services in operation  which are available on some of the bus and subway routes during the night time. the night tube runs on fridays and saturdays on some of the lines until 12:30 a.m., and the night overground provided service on friday and saturday nights from 12:30 a.m. until 5:30 a.m. however, it is worth noting that the currently available nighttime services have been temporarily suspended since march 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nwith the opening of crossrail, it has been expected that some sectors of the night transport service should be covered too. additionally, transport for london has announced plans to expand night bus services and create new routes to better serve areas with high levels of nightlife and help people travel safely at night.",
