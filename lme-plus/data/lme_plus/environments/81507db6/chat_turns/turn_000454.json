  "content": "Now consider the Back-Propagation algorithm as feedback and the Neural Network as a closed loop system during training (Non-Convex Optimization). How might Root-Locus techniques be used to analyze the stability of the Neural Network? How stability be correlated with error landscape problems? How might Root-Locus or other feedback analysis techniques be used to model and avoided error landscape problems that might be related to instability of the Neural Network as feedback system during back-propagation?",
