  "content": "I'm looking for some fashion advice. I recently got a new pair of black leather boots from Zara and I love them. I wore them with my grey sweater and dark jeans to brunch on January 22nd and got a lot of compliments. I also wore my polished brown loafers to work on January 10th and got comments on how sharp I looked. Do you have any suggestions on what to wear with my boots for a casual dinner date this weekend?",
