It sounds like you're a fan of spicy food, and you've got a good feeling about that cast-iron skillet.\n\nIf you're confident that the skillet heated up well last time, it's likely that it can handle the high heat needed for fajitas. Just remember to preheat it gradually, use a high-smoke-point oil, and keep an eye on the temperature to prevent burning or scorching.\n\nNow, about that spicy pork bibimbap... did you enjoy it? Bibimbap is such a great dish, and the spicy kick from the gochujang sauce adds an amazing depth of flavor. Have you tried making bibimbap at home, or is it a dish you prefer to order from the Korean place?\n\nBy the way, since you're making fajitas, I have to ask: do you have a favorite type of pepper or level of spiciness that you like to add to your fajitas?",
