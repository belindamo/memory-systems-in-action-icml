Bell peppers and onions are a classic combination, and adding diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers will definitely give it a nice kick. If you like a bit of heat, you could also consider adding some diced Anaheim or Poblano peppers to the mix. They have a slightly sweet and smoky flavor that pairs well with the spicy kick from the jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers.\n\nRemember, when working with hot peppers, it's all about balance. You can always add more heat, but it's harder to take it away once it's added. So, start with a small amount and taste as you go, adjusting the heat level to your liking.\n\nSince you mentioned you like a bit of heat, I have to ask: have you ever tried making your own hot sauce or salsa from scratch? It's a great way to customize the flavor and heat level to your taste, and it's surprisingly easy to make!\n\nNow, are you ready to get started on those fajitas? Do you have any questions about the recipe or cooking process?",
