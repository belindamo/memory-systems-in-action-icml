Asking about the group's usual pace and terrain will give you a better understanding of what to expect and help you determine if the group is a good fit for you.\n\nAsking for tips as a beginner is also a great way to show that you're eager to learn and improve. Here are some specific questions you might consider asking:\n\n* What's the typical pace of the group, and are there any opportunities for slower riders to catch up or take breaks?\n* What kind of terrain do you usually ride on (e.g. flat, hilly, mountainous, paved, dirt trails)?\n* Are there any specific skills or knowledge that you recommend I focus on as a beginner (e.g. bike handling, gear shifting, braking)?\n* Are there any safety precautions or protocols that the group follows (e.g. wearing helmets, following traffic laws, using hand signals)?\n* Are there any resources or tips you can share for improving my cycling skills or preparing for longer rides?\n* How does the group communicate during rides (e.g. do you use radios, hand signals, or verbal cues)?\n\nRemember, there's no such thing as a \"dumb\" question, especially when it comes to safety and learning. Don't be afraid to ask, and I'm sure the group will be happy to help you out!"
