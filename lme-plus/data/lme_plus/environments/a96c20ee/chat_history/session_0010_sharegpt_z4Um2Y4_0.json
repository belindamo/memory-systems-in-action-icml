If the payment technology division of FIS continues to grow and offer innovative solutions, investment banks may consider partnering with or investing in the company. Conversely, if the banking division is focused more on traditional financial services, it may not have as much relevance to investment banking. Ultimately, the impact of the FIS break-up on investment banking will depend on how the two resulting businesses position themselves in the market and what services they offer."
