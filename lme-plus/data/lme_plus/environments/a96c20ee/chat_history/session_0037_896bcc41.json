      "content": "Tokyo in June is going to be an amazing experience! You're in for a treat, especially when it comes to the food!\n\nNow, let's get to the practicalities. Japan uses Type A power sockets, which are similar to those found in the United States, but with some key differences. Japanese outlets are rated for 100V, 50Hz, which is different from the 120V, 60Hz standard in North America. However, most modern electronic devices like laptops, smartphones, and cameras can handle both voltages, so you won't need a voltage converter.\n\nWhat you will need is a physical adapter to fit your device's plug into the Japanese outlet. You can purchase a Type A power adapter, which is a small, inexpensive device that allows you to plug your device into a Japanese outlet. You can find these adapters at most electronics stores, online marketplaces, or even at airport gift shops.\n\nAs for Tsukiji Fish Market, you're in for a treat! While it's no longer the primary fish market in Tokyo (that distinction now belongs to Toyosu Market), Tsukiji Outer Market still offers an incredible sushi experience. Be prepared for an early start, as the market can get busy quickly, and be sure to try some of the freshest sushi you'll ever have!\n\nEnjoy your trip to Tokyo, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions!"
