Bring plenty of water and electrolyte replacements like Gatorade or Nuun tablets.\n\n2. Wear sunscreen: The sun is intense in the desert, so protect your skin with sunscreen, preferably SPF 50 or higher. Reapply often, especially if you're sweating a lot.\n\n3. Dress appropriately: Wear lightweight, breathable clothes that cover your skin to protect from the sun. Avoid cotton, which traps moisture, and opt for moisture-wicking fabrics. Wear a helmet and gloves for protection.\n\n4. Check the weather: Desert weather can be unpredictable. Check the forecast before you go, and be prepared for sudden changes in temperature, wind, or rain.\n\n5. Stay on designated trails: Desert ecosystems are fragile, so it's important to stay on marked trails to avoid damaging the environment. Plus, wandering off-trail could put you at risk of getting lost.\n\n6. Bring a repair kit: Mountain biking in the desert can be tough on your bike, so bring a repair kit with tools, spare tubes, and a pump. Check your bike before you go, especially if it's been sitting in storage for a while.\n\n7. Know your limits: Mountain biking in the desert can be challenging, with steep climbs, rocky terrain, and loose sand. Be honest with yourself about your fitness level and technical abilities, and don't push yourself too hard.",
