  "content": "Yeah, Screamfest was a Halloween-themed event that took place at Magic Kingdom from October 1st to November 1st. I went with my friends Emma and Ryan on October 15th, and we had a blast. We dressed up as zombies, rode the Haunted Mansion ride multiple times, and watched the Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party parade. Do you think it might have been a special event that wasn't publicly advertised?",
