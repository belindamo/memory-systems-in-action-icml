While there isn't a single platform that can track everything, I'll suggest a few tools and strategies to help you stay organized:\n\n1. **Coupon organizers**: Consider using a physical coupon organizer or a digital tool like Flipp, Checkout 51, or RetailMeNot's coupon organizer to store and track your paper coupons.\n2. **Cashback and rewards apps**: For cashback and rewards, you're already using Fetch Rewards and Amazon Rewards Visa card. You can also consider apps like Ibotta, Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates), or Dosh to earn cashback and rewards.\n3. **Loyalty program trackers**: Use a loyalty program tracker like AwardWallet or TravelBank to monitor your points and miles across various loyalty programs.\n4. **Browser extensions**: Browser extensions like Honey, Coupons at Checkout, or CamelCamelCamel can help you find and apply coupons, discounts, or price drops at checkout.\n5. **Spreadsheets or notes**: Create a spreadsheet or note-taking app like Evernote or OneNote to track your coupons, discounts, and rewards. This can help you keep a centralized record of expiration dates, coupon codes, and rewards balances.\n6. **Digital wallets**: Consider using digital wallets like Apple Wallet, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay to store your loyalty cards, coupons, and rewards cards.\n7. **Calendar reminders**: Set reminders on your calendar for coupon expiration dates, reward redemption deadlines, or loyalty program renewals.\n\nTo simplify your coupon and reward management, try these strategies:\n\n* **Consolidate similar rewards**: Group similar rewards, like cashback apps or loyalty programs, into a single folder or category on your phone or computer.\n* **Prioritize your most-used apps**: Focus on the apps and tools you use most frequently and consider deleting or deactivating others to reduce clutter.\n* **Set up notifications**: Enable notifications for your favorite apps and tools to stay informed about new deals, expiring coupons, or reward opportunities.\n* **Review and update regularly**: Regularly review your coupons, discounts, and rewards to ensure you're using them before they expire.\n\nWhile there isn't a single platform to manage everything, using a combination of these tools and strategies can help you stay organized and maximize your savings.",
