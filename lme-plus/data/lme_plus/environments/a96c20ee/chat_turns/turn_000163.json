While there aren't many bathtubs specifically designed for twins, there are some options that can make bath time easier and more convenient for Emily. Here are a few:\n\n1. **The First Years Twin/Toddler Tub**: A spacious, comfortable, and easy-to-clean bathtub designed for twins or toddlers. It has a built-in seat and support for each baby, and is compact enough to fit in most sinks.\n2. **Baby Trend Twin Nursery Center**: A versatile, 3-in-1 nursery center that includes a twin bathtub, changing station, and storage area. It's a great space-saving solution for Emily's nursery.\n3. **Graco Twin Bathtub**: A large, comfortable bathtub designed for twins, with a built-in seat and support for each baby. It's easy to clean and has a compact design that fits in most sinks.\n\nWhen choosing a twin baby bathtub or sink, consider the following factors:\n\n* Space: Ensure the bathtub or sink has enough room to comfortably accommodate both babies, with enough space to move them around safely.\n* Support: Look for a bathtub or sink with built-in seats or supports for each baby, to help them feel secure and comfortable.\n* Ease of use: Opt for a bathtub or sink that's easy to clean, with a simple and intuitive design that makes bath time less stressful for Emily.\n* Portability: If Emily plans to travel or move the bathtub around, look for a lightweight and compact design.\n\nKeep in mind that twin baby bathtubs or sinks might be larger and more expensive than single baby bathtubs. However, they can make a big difference in making bath time easier and more enjoyable for Emily and her twins.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect twin baby bathtub or sink for Emily's little ones!",
