Since you've moved your desk near the window, you'll want to consider lamps that can provide focused lighting without creating harsh glare or competing with the natural light.\n\n**Task Lamps:**\n\n1. **Adjustable Arm Lamp:** Look for a task lamp with an adjustable arm, allowing you to direct the light exactly where you need it. The **Luxo L-1 LED Task Lamp** is a popular option with a 12W LED bulb (equiv. to 60W incandescent) and a 5-year warranty.\n2. **High-Wattage Task Lamp:** If you prefer a more traditional task lamp design, consider the **Hampton Bay 25W LED Task Lamp**. It features a high-wattage LED bulb and a sturdy base to prevent tipping.\n\n**Floor Lamps:**\n\n1. **Slim Profile Floor Lamp:** The **Adesso Floor Lamp** has a slim profile, making it perfect for smaller offices. It features a 20W LED bulb (equiv. to 100W incandescent) and a adjustable arm for directing the light.\n2. **Torch-Style Floor Lamp:** The **Torchiere Floor Lamp** by Brightech is a stylish option that provides both task and ambient lighting. It has a 20W LED bulb and a slim, modern design.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n* **Color Temperature:** If you prefer a softer, warm light, look for bulbs with a color temperature around 2700K-3000K (soft white). For a brighter, more energizing light, opt for bulbs with a color temperature around 5000K-6500K (daylight).\n* **Lumen Output:** A higher lumen output generally means a brighter light. For a task lamp, 800-1200 lumens should be sufficient. Floor lamps can have a higher lumen output, depending on the size of the room.\n* **Energy Efficiency:** LED bulbs are a great choice for energy efficiency and long lifespan. Look for lamps with LED bulbs or consider replacing traditional bulbs with energy-efficient options like the one you purchased from IKEA.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider the specific needs of your workspace, including the size of your desk, the distance between your desk and the lamp, and your personal lighting preferences.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect lighting solution for your home office!",
