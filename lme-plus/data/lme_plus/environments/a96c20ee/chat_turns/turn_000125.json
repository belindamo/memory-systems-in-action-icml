  "content": "No, dairy products are not the only source of calcium for our bones. In fact, there are many plant-based sources of calcium that can provide us with the daily calcium requirements. Some of the best plant-based sources of calcium include leafy green vegetables like kale, broccoli, and collard greens, legumes such as soybeans, lentils, chickpeas, and black beans, fortified plant milks like soy milk and almond milk, and calcium-set tofu. Additionally, many grains and cereals are fortified with calcium. It's also important to note that research shows that high intake of animal protein, which is found in dairy products, can actually increase the risk of osteoporosis. Thus, a plant-based diet can provide adequate calcium for strong bones.",
