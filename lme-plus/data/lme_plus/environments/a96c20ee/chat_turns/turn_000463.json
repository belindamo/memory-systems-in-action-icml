Some of the museums that offer suggested admission include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). 3. Take a free walking tour of the city, such as a street art tour or a history tour. You can find many options online or through the NYC Tourist Information Center. 4.
