As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or real-time knowledge of specific concerts or events. I can provide general information about bands, artists, and music, but I don't have first-hand information about specific concerts or events.\n\nHowever, I'm thrilled to hear that you enjoyed The Neighbourhood's performance at the Barclays Center! It's always great to experience live music and see bands bring their energy to the stage. If you have any more questions about The Neighbourhood or other bands, feel free to ask!\n\nBy the way, since you mentioned The Neighbourhood, I can recommend some other bands that might be up your alley. Would you like some more suggestions?",
