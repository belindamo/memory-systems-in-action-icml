You have the diamond snare necklace?!\"\n\nMacaque nods, still catching his breath from the fight.\n\nMacaque: \"Yes, I took it from Wukong. I had to do something to stop him.\"\n\nNezha looks at Macaque with a mix of gratitude and respect.\n\nNezha: \"You did well. I'm glad to have you on our side.\"\n\nMacaque nods, still looking slightly shaken.\n\nMacaque: \"I never thought I'd find myself fighting against Wukong. But when he threatened MK, I had to act.\"\n\nNezha looks at MK and smiles.\n\nNezha: \"MK is lucky to have friends like you. I'm grateful for your help today.\"\n\nMK looks at Nezha, realizing that the monkey king and the celestial prince must have a history.\n\nMK: \"Wait, you two know each other?\"\n\nMacaque nods, a small smile on his face.\n\nMacaque: \"We go way back. Nezha has always been a friend to the monkeys.\"\n\nNezha looks at Macaque and nods.\n\nNezha: \"It's true. The monkeys and I have had our disagreements in the past, but we've always found a way to work together when it counts.\"\n\nMK looks from Macaque to Nezha, amazed at the bond between them.\n\nMK: \"I had no idea.\"\n\nMacaque and Nezha exchange a look and smile.\n\nMacaque: \"We have a long history, my friend. You'll learn more about it in time.\"\n\nNezha nods, looking at MK.\n\nNezha: \"And you, MK, have proven yourself a true hero today. You have the gratitude of the heavens.\"\n\nMK blushes at the praise, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment.\n\nMK: \"Thank you. I couldn't have done it without all of you.\"\n\nNezha smiles at MK and Macaque nods in agreement.\n\nMacaque: \"We make a good team. And with that necklace, Wukong won't be causing any trouble for a while.\"\n\nThe three of them stand there, looking at each other with a sense of camaraderie and mutual respect. The battle may be over, but the bond between them has grown stronger.",
