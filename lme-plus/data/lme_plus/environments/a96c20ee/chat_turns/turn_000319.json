It's a fantastic way to dip your toes into the world of smart lighting, test the system, and get comfortable with the technology.\n\nBy starting with a few bulbs, you can:\n\n* **Test the system:** Get familiar with the app, the bulb's features, and how they integrate with your existing lighting setup.\n* **Prioritize:** Focus on the bulbs that are used the most, such as the main ceiling light or table lamps, and add more bulbs over time.\n* **Save costs:** Replacing only a few bulbs can be more budget-friendly, especially if you're not ready to commit to a full smart lighting system.\n\nAnd, as you mentioned, starting with a few bulbs allows you to **gradually upgrade** your lighting system, adding more bulbs as you become more comfortable with the technology.\n\nYou're absolutely right; starting with a few bulbs is a great way to begin your smart lighting journey!\n\nNow, go ahead and get that dimmer switch fixed, and then you can start enjoying your Philips Hue smart bulbs!",
