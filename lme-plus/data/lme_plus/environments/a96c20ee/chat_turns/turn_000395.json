I'm a large language model, I have access to a vast amount of information, but I have to correct you - there is no evidence of a Disney event called \"Screamfest\" at Magic Kingdom.\n\nIt's possible that you and your friends attended Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party (MNSSHP) on October 15th, which is a popular Halloween event at Magic Kingdom. MNSSHP typically takes place on select nights from mid-August to November 1st, and it features a range of activities, including trick-or-treating, character meet-and-greets, and exclusive entertainment like the Mickey's Boo-to-You Halloween Parade.\n\nThe Haunted Mansion ride is a popular attraction at Magic Kingdom, and it's not unusual for it to be a busy spot during MNSSHP. It's great that you and your friends had a blast dressing up as zombies and enjoying the festivities!\n\nIt's possible that you might have misremembered the name of the event or gotten it mixed up with another event or party. If you're still unsure, I can try to help you dig up more information or clarify any details.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help with!",
