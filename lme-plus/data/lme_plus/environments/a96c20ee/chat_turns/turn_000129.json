  "content": "While dairy products may be a convenient source of calcium, there are many convenient plant-based alternatives that are just as easy to prepare, such as fortified plant milks or ready-to-eat cereals. Many plant milk brands offer a wide variety of flavors and varieties that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, making them a quick and easy source of both nutrients. Additionally, there are many plant-based options for cheese, yogurt, and ice cream that are fortified with calcium. If you don't have time to prepare plant-based meals every day, meal prepping and utilizing quick and easy options like snacks or pre-made meals can help you meet your daily calcium needs. Always check food labels to ensure that you are consuming an adequate amount of calcium with your plant-based diet.",
