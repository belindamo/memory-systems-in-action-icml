Safety first, always.\n\nNow, regarding your Philips Hue smart bulbs, it's a great question about replacing all the bulbs in your living room or starting with just a few. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Replace all bulbs:**\n\n* **Consistency:** Having all smart bulbs ensures a consistent lighting experience throughout the room.\n* **Seamless control:** You can control all the lights with a single app or voice command, making it easy to adjust the lighting to your mood or activity.\n* **Full potential:** You'll be able to take full advantage of the smart lighting features, such as automations, scenes, and routines.\n\n**Start with a few:**\n\n* **Cost-effective:** Replacing only a few bulbs can be more budget-friendly, especially if you're not ready to commit to a full smart lighting system.\n* **Gradual upgrade:** You can start with a few bulbs and add more over time, allowing you to test the system and get comfortable with the technology.\n* **Focus on key areas:** You can prioritize the bulbs that are used the most or are most important to you, such as the main lighting fixtures or table lamps.\n\nHere's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Start with the most used bulbs:** Replace the bulbs in the fixtures that are used the most, such as the main ceiling light or table lamps.\n2. **Add bulbs gradually:** As you become more comfortable with the system, you can add more bulbs to other fixtures or areas of the room.\n3. **Consider a mix:** If you have a combination of overhead lighting, table lamps, and floor lamps, start with the most used ones and add the others over time.\n\nRemember, you can always add more bulbs to your system later, so don't feel pressured to replace all the bulbs at once. Start with a few, get comfortable with the technology, and then expand as you see fit.\n\nHow does that sound?",
