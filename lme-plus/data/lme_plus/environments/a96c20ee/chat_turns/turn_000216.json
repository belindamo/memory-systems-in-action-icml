  "content": "What a great idea! Grilled shrimp skewers with spicy mango salsa sound like a perfect match for your Spring Fling cocktail. Here are some other appetizer ideas that would pair well with the Spring Fling and the spring vegetable tart:\n\n**Appetizer Ideas**\n\n1. **Asparagus and Prosciutto Wraps**: Thinly sliced asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and served with a dollop of creamy burrata cheese. The asparagus will echo the flavors in your spring vegetable tart, while the prosciutto will add a salty, savory element.\n2. **Radish and Butter Lettuce Crostini**: Toasted baguette slices topped with a layer of creamy butter, thinly sliced radish, and a sprinkle of butter lettuce. The spicy kick from the radish will be balanced by the cool, creamy butter and lettuce.\n3. **Carrot and Ginger Fritters**: Crispy fritters filled with a mixture of grated carrot, ginger, and spices, served with a side of tangy aioli. The carrot and ginger will complement the spring vegetables in your tart, while the aioli will add a rich, creamy element.\n4. **Spring Pea and Mint Bruschetta**: Toasted baguette slices topped with a mixture of fresh spring peas, mint, and crumbled feta cheese, drizzled with a light vinaigrette. The sweetness of the peas and mint will pair nicely with the freshness of the Spring Fling cocktail.\n5. **Roasted Beet Tapenade**: A rich, earthy tapenade made with roasted beets, served with crudit\u00e9s or toasted bread. The sweetness of the beets will balance the earthiness of the tapenade, and the freshness of the Spring Fling will cut through the richness.\n\nThese appetizers offer a variety of textures and flavors that will complement the Spring Fling cocktail and the spring vegetable tart nicely. You can't go wrong with the grilled shrimp skewers with spicy mango salsa, but these options will add some nice variety to your menu.",
