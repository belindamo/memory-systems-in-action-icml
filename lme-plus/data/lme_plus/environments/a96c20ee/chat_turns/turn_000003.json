Look for keywords like \"non-comedogenic\" (doesn't clog pores), \"hypoallergenic\" (less likely to cause allergic reactions), and \"fragrance-free\" (reduced risk of irritation).\n\nRemember, you don't always need to break the bank to get a good moisturizer. These affordable options are all well-reviewed and can provide great results.\n\nDo you have any specific skin concerns or preferences (e.g., natural ingredients, SPF, etc.) that might help me give you more targeted recommendations?",
