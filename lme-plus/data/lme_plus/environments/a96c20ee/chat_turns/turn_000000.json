  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on budget-friendly toiletries. I've recently started shopping at discount stores and I'm surprised at how much cheaper they are. Speaking of which, I remember I used to use a luxury brand shampoo that costs $10, but I've found a great alternative at a discount store. Do you have any recommendations for other affordable toiletries?",
