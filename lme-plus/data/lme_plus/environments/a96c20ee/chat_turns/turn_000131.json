  "content": "It is a common myth that a plant-based diet is more expensive than a diet that includes dairy products. However, this is not always the case. While some plant-based foods like fresh produce may be more expensive in some regions, many plant-based staples such as beans, lentils, rice, pasta, and frozen fruits and vegetables are actually cheaper than animal products. Additionally, buying in bulk, meal prepping, and utilizing farmers markets and local produce can help save money on a plant-based diet. One can also explore ethnic cuisine options like Indian, Mexican, or Middle Eastern cuisine, which have a lot of plant-based dishes that are both inexpensive and delicious. Ultimately, following a plant-based diet can be as affordable or expensive as you make it, just like any other diet.",
