  "content": "Yes, there are many other plant-based sources of calcium that you can include in your diet if you don't like leafy greens and beans. Some other good sources of calcium include:\n\n- Fortified plant milks (soy milk, almond milk, and others)\n- Fortified orange juice\n- Fortified cereals\n- Calcium-set tofu\n- Sesame seeds and tahini\n- Almonds and almond butter\n- Dried figs\n- Chia seeds\n\nIt is important to note that you do not need to consume all of these sources of calcium in one day, but rather to include a variety of them throughout the week to ensure you are meeting your daily calcium needs. Also, it's important to make sure you're getting enough vitamin D, as it helps with calcium absorption. Vegan sources of vitamin D include fortified plant milks, mushrooms that have been exposed to UV light, and supplements.",
