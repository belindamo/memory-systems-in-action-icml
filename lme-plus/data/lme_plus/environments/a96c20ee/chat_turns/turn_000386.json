I'll also set reminders for my scheduled video calls with friends and family to make sure I don't forget.\n\nI'm also thinking about finding alternative activities to replace social media use. I've been wanting to start a journaling habit, so maybe I'll use that time to write in my journal instead of scrolling through social media. What do you think about journaling as a way to reflect and stay mindful?",
