I think I'll opt for a guided tour for the Golden Circle and South Coast day trips. That way, I can just relax and enjoy the scenery without worrying about navigating the roads.\n\nBy the way, I've been thinking about my Iceland itinerary, and I was wondering if you could help me with that. I was thinking of spending 2-3 days in Reykjavik, and then taking a guided tour to the Golden Circle and South Coast. After that, I'd like to spend a day or two exploring the Blue Lagoon and other geothermal pools. Does that sound like a good plan to you?",
