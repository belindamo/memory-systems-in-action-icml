  "content": "Orange-infused coffee is a fantastic choice to pair with your Cranberry Orange Scones. You can definitely find orange-infused coffee beans or grounds at specialty coffee shops or online. However, I'd be happy to provide you with a simple recipe to make your own orange-infused coffee at home:\n\n**Homemade Orange-Infused Coffee Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup of your favorite coffee beans (medium to light roast works well)\n* 1 orange, zested and sliced\n* 1 tablespoon of orange extract (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Infusion Method:** Place the sliced orange in a glass jar or container with a lid. Add the coffee beans on top of the orange slices. Close the jar and let it infuse for 24-48 hours in a cool, dark place. The longer it infuses, the stronger the orange flavor will be.\n2. **Cold Brew Method:** Brew a cold brew coffee using your favorite method. Once the coffee is brewed, add the orange zest and sliced orange to the coffee. Let it infuse in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.\n3. **Simple Syrup Method:** Make a simple syrup by combining 1 cup of water with 1 cup of sugar and the orange zest in a saucepan. Heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves, then let it cool. Add the orange extract, if using. Once the syrup is cooled, add it to your brewed coffee.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a medium to light roast coffee to allow the orange flavors to shine.\n* Adjust the amount of orange zest and infusion time to your taste. Some people prefer a subtle orange flavor, while others like it more pronounced.\n* You can also add a cinnamon stick or a few cloves to the infusion for added warmth and depth.\n* Experiment with different types of oranges, like blood oranges or navel oranges, for varying flavor profiles.\n\nIf you prefer to buy orange-infused coffee, look for specialty coffee shops or online retailers that offer flavored coffee beans or grounds. Some popular brands include:\n\n* The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf\n* Starbucks Reserve\n* Blue Bottle Coffee\n* Intelligentsia Coffee\n\nWhen shopping for orange-infused coffee, make sure to check the ingredients and flavor profile to ensure it's not too sweet or overpowering. You want to be able to taste the nuances of the coffee and the orange flavors.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for you to try your homemade orange-infused coffee with your Cranberry Orange Scones!",
