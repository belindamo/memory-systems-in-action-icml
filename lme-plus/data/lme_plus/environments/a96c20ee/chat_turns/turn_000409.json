  "content": "The filters in a central AC system should be cleaned or replaced regularly to keep the system running efficiently and improve the air quality in your home. The frequency of filter replacement or cleaning depends on factors such as the type of filter, the overall air quality in your home, and how often you use the system.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, it's a good idea to inspect the filters once a month and replace or clean them as needed. If you have pets or live in an area with high pollution, you may need to replace or clean the filters more frequently.\n\nCleaning filters is typically something that you can do yourself, but it's essential to review the instructions for your specific system. Some filters can be vacuumed or washed with water, while others may need to be replaced entirely. If you're not sure how to clean or replace the filters, you can contact an HVAC professional who can help you ensure it's done correctly.\n\nIn addition to cleaning or replacing the filters, it's also essential to schedule regular maintenance for your central AC system. A professional HVAC technician can inspect and clean the system, check the refrigerant levels, and make sure that everything is running correctly. By scheduling regular maintenance, you can keep your system running efficiently and avoid costly repairs in the future.",
