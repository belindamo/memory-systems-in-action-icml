  "content": "MK watches from Nezha's chariot as the fight turns, the celestial army begins to win and the monkeys start to run. He frantically looks for Macaque and Wukong but can't see them in the chaos.\n\n\"Where did they go?\" MK mutters to himself, feeling a sinking feeling in his stomach.\n\nNezha, who's piloting the chariot, notices MK's distress and tries to reassure him. \"Don't worry, mortal. We'll find them,\" he says.\n\nMK nods but can't shake the worry. \"I hope they're okay,\" he says, his voice shaking.\n\nSuddenly, a figure dashes out from the trees, covered in cuts and bruises. It's Macaque. He jumps up and grabs onto the chariot as it passes by.\n\n\"Get in!\" Nezha calls down to him.\n\nMacaque clambers into the chariot and collapses onto the floor, panting heavily.\n\n\"Wukong got away,\" he says between gasps for air. \"But I have his necklace.\"\n\nMK looks down at Macaque's hand and sees the glittering necklace. \"That's the diamond snare,\" he says in disbelief.\n\nMacaque nods. \"Yes, and it's the only thing that can hold Wukong. We have to keep it safe.\"\n\nNezha nods in agreement. \"We will take it to the Jade Emperor. He will know what to do with it.\"\n\nMK looks at the necklace, wondering what will happen next.",
