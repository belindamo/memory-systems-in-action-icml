Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Laugarvatn Fontana**: A geothermal pool and spa located in the Golden Circle, about an hour from Reykjavik. It's a more laid-back and less touristy alternative to the Blue Lagoon.\n2. **Geothermal Pool at Landmannalaugar**: A natural hot spring located in the Highlands, surrounded by breathtaking landscapes. It's a bit off the beaten path, but worth the detour.\n3. **Myvatn Nature Baths**: A geothermal pool and spa in North Iceland, known for its stunning views of the surrounding landscape and the possibility of spotting the Northern Lights.\n4. **Krauma**: A geothermal pool and spa located near Borgarnes, about an hour from Reykjavik. It's a newer and more luxurious option, offering a unique bathing experience.\n5. **Laugardalslaug**: A large, public pool in Reykjavik that's geothermally heated. It's a great place to relax and mingle with locals.\n\nThese are just a few of the many hot springs and geothermal pools in Iceland.
