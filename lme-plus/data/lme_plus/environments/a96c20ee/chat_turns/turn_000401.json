  "content": "1. Window Air Conditioners: It is a self-contained unit that is mounted in a window or through a hole in an exterior wall. The unit cools the air inside by drawing in warm air, passing it over the evaporator coils, and then pushing the cooled air back out.\n\n2. Split Air Conditioning System: It consists of an outdoor compressor unit and one or more indoor units that distribute the cool air. The outdoor unit cools and compresses refrigerant gas, which then flows inside to the indoor unit. The indoor unit contains a fan and evaporator coils that cool the hot air that passes over them.\n\n3. Central Air Conditioning: It is a system that cools the entire house by distributing cool air through a duct system. The system has a large outdoor unit that contains the compressor, while the indoor unit is connected to the ductwork and contains the evaporator coils and fan.\n\n4. Portable Air Conditioners: It is a self-contained system that can be moved from room to room. The unit draws in warm air, passes it over the coils, and then pushes the cooled air back out through a vent.\n\n5. Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners: It is similar to a split system, but instead of ducts, the system uses multiple indoor air handlers that are mounted on the wall. The outdoor unit cools and compresses refrigerant, which flows to the indoor units, where it cools the air before being circulated back out.",
