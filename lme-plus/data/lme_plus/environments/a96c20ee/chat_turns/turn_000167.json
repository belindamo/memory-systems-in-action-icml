  "content": "Yes, there are several festivals in Lower Saxony that have unique costumes. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Carnival (Karneval): In Lower Saxony, the carnival season (also known as the \"fifth season\") is a major event. During this time, people wear colorful and elaborate costumes featuring masks, feathers, sequins, and other adornments. The costumes generally reflect a playful or satirical theme.\n\n2. Sch\u00fctzenfest: As I mentioned before, during Sch\u00fctzenfest, people wear traditional attire from the 18th and 19th centuries, such as frock coats, top hats, and sashes.\n\n3. Erntefest (Harvest Festival): Erntefest is a celebration of the harvest season, and people often wear costumes featuring fruits, vegetables, and other symbols of the harvest.\n\n4. Krampuslauf: Krampuslauf is a pre-Christmas tradition that originated in Austria but is also celebrated in parts of Lower Saxony. During the event, people dress up as the Krampus, a demonic creature from folklore, and parade through the streets.\n\nThese are just a few examples of festivals in Lower Saxony with unique costumes. Each festival has its own cultural and historical significance, and the costumes worn during these events help to celebrate and preserve these traditions.",
