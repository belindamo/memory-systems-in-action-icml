  "content": "Hydration and brightening are great benefits to look for in a face mask!\n\nCharcoal masks can be beneficial for combination skin, but it's essential to choose one that's formulated for your skin type. Charcoal can be drying if not balanced with hydrating ingredients, so look for a mask that combines charcoal with moisturizing ingredients.\n\nHere are some affordable options that might interest you:\n\n1. **Charcoal Masks:**\n\t* L'Or\u00e9al Paris Pure-Clay Detox & Brighten Face Mask (around $3) - A clay-based mask with charcoal that helps purify and brighten the skin. It's gentle enough for combination skin.\n\t* Garnier Skin Renew Dark Spot Treatment Mask (around $10) - A charcoal-based mask that helps reduce the appearance of dark spots and hyperpigmentation. It's formulated with hydrating ingredients to balance the skin.\n2. **Hydrating Masks:**\n\t* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Mask (around $3) - A hydrating sheet mask that provides long-lasting moisture without feeling greasy.\n\t* Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Mask (around $10) - A rich, anti-aging cream mask that helps plump and firm the skin while providing hydration.\n\nIf you're new to charcoal masks, start with a gentle, hydrating option and patch test to ensure you don't have any sensitivity.\n\n(By the way, I'm glad you found a great alternative shampoo at a discount store! It's always exciting to find affordable options that work just as well as luxury brands.)\n\nDo you have any other questions about face masks or skincare in general?",
