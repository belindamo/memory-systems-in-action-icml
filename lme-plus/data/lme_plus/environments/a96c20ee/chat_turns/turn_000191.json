  "content": "Stacking coupons and discounts can be a great way to maximize your savings!\n\nIn general, the answer to your question depends on the specific store's coupon policy and the terms of the manufacturer's coupon you're trying to stack. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Manufacturer's Coupon + Store Coupon**: Most stores allow you to combine a manufacturer's coupon with a store coupon. For example, if you have a $2 off manufacturer's coupon and a $1 off store coupon, you can use both on the same item.\n2. **Manufacturer's Coupon + Digital Coupon**: Some stores allow you to stack a manufacturer's coupon with a digital coupon loaded to your loyalty card or mobile app. However, this may vary by store, so it's best to check their policy.\n3. **Manufacturer's Coupon + Cashback App**: You can usually stack a manufacturer's coupon with cashback rewards from apps like Ibotta or Fetch Rewards. The cashback will be applied on top of the discounted price after the manufacturer's coupon is applied.\n4. **Manufacturer's Coupon + Subscription Discount**: If you're using a subscription service like Amazon Family, you might be able to stack the manufacturer's coupon with the subscription discount. However, this may depend on the specific terms of your subscription.\n\nWhen in doubt, it's always best to:\n\n* Check the store's coupon policy: Look for their website, mobile app, or in-store signage for specific guidelines on coupon stacking.\n* Verify with customer service: If you're unsure, ask the store's customer service or the manufacturer's customer service to confirm their coupon stacking policy.\n* Read the fine print: Always check the terms and conditions of each coupon or discount to ensure they can be combined.\n\nRemember, it never hurts to ask, and it's always better to be safe than sorry. If the cashier or customer service representative says you can't stack the coupons, you can always ask to speak with a manager or try a different store.\n\nI hope that helps, and happy couponing!",
