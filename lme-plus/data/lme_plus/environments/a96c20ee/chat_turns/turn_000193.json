  "content": "Fantastic job on accumulating those Fetch Rewards points!\n\nIn general, gift cards are treated like cash, so you should be able to use your $5 gift card to buy baby formula and then apply the manufacturer's coupon on top of it. This is because gift cards are considered a form of payment, and most stores allow you to use coupons on top of gift card purchases.\n\nHowever, to confirm, I'd recommend checking the following:\n\n1. **Gift Card Terms**: Review the terms and conditions of your Fetch Rewards gift card to ensure there are no restrictions on using it with manufacturer's coupons. Although unlikely, it's always a good idea to check.\n2. **Store Policy**: Verify the store's policy on using gift cards with manufacturer's coupons. You can check their website, mobile app, or ask a store employee to confirm their policy.\n3. **Manufacturer's Coupon Terms**: Double-check the terms of the manufacturer's coupon you want to use to ensure it doesn't exclude gift card purchases.\n\nIn most cases, you should be able to use your $5 gift card to buy baby formula and then apply the manufacturer's coupon on top of it. This would essentially give you a total discount of $5 (gift card) + $2 (manufacturer's coupon) = $7 off your formula purchase!\n\nIf you're unsure or encounter any issues, you can always ask the store employee or manager to clarify their policy. Happy shopping!",
