Since it's a credit applied to your Amazon account, it's more like a store credit or a digital coupon. \n\nWhen you use the $5 credit towards your baby formula purchase on Amazon, it will be applied as a discount to your total order. Then, you can still apply the manufacturer's coupon on top of that discounted price.\n\nHere's how it might work:\n\n1. Original price of baby formula: $25\n2. $5 credit from Amazon Rewards Visa card: -$5\n3. New subtotal: $20\n4. Manufacturer's coupon: -$2\n5. Final price: $18\n\nIn this scenario, you'd get to enjoy the benefits of both the $5 credit and the manufacturer's coupon, bringing your total savings to $7!\n\nHowever, as always, it's a good idea to review Amazon's policies and the terms of your Amazon Rewards Visa card to ensure there are no restrictions on combining these discounts. But in general, Amazon allows you to stack digital coupons, credits, and manufacturer's coupons, making it a great way to maximize your savings!",
