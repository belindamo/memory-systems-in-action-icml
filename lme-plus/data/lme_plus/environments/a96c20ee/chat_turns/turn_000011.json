Here's a quick guide on how to use it:\n\n**Before You Start:**\n\n* Make sure to wash your face with a gentle cleanser and pat it dry before applying the mask.\n* Remove any makeup, including foundation, concealer, and powder.\n\n**Applying the Mask:**\n\n* Apply a thin, even layer of the mask to your face, avoiding the eye area.\n* You can use a brush or your fingertips to apply the mask. If you have sensitive skin, it's best to use a gentle, patting motion with your fingertips.\n* Make sure to cover all areas of your face, but avoid applying too much product, as it can be drying.\n\n**Leaving it On:**\n\n* Leave the mask on for 10-15 minutes. You can relax and let the mask work its magic!\n* If you have sensitive skin, you can start with 5-7 minutes and gradually increase the time as your skin becomes more tolerant.\n\n**Rinsing Off:**\n\n* Rinse the mask off with warm water, then pat dry with a clean towel.\n* Follow up with your regular skincare routine, including toner, serum, and moisturizer.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* For an extra detoxifying boost, you can mix a teaspoon of the mask with a teaspoon of water to create a paste. Apply the paste to your face and leave it on for 10-15 minutes.\n* If you have dry skin, you can apply a moisturizer after rinsing off the mask to help lock in hydration.\n* You can use the mask 1-2 times a week, depending on your skin concerns and needs.\n\nRemember to patch test the mask on a small area of your skin before using it on your face to ensure you don't have any sensitivity or allergic reactions.\n\nI hope this helps!
