  "content": "Given your sensitive skin and combination skin type, I'd recommend the following fragrance-free and non-comedogenic moisturizers that are lightweight and won't clog pores:\n\n1. **Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream** (around $9): As I mentioned earlier, this is a great option for sensitive skin. It's fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and hypoallergenic, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Although it's a cream, it's not too rich and is suitable for combination skin.\n2. **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel** (around $13): This is a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that provides long-lasting hydration without feeling greasy. It's fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and suitable for combination skin.\n3. **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion** (around $13): This lotion is fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and hypoallergenic, making it an excellent choice for sensitive skin. It's lightweight, non-greasy, and suitable for combination skin.\n4. **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid** (around $15): This is a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that's specifically designed for sensitive skin. It's fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and won't clog pores.\n\nAll of these options are well-reviewed and suitable for combination skin. However, if you're looking for something even lighter, you might want to consider the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel or the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid.\n\nRemember, when trying a new moisturizer, it's essential to do a patch test on a small area of your skin to ensure you don't have any adverse reactions.\n\nDo you have any other questions or would you like more information on any of these products?",
