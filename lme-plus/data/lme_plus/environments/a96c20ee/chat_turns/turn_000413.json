Aerobic exercise: Aerobic exercises, such as walking, biking, or swimming, can help lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week.\n\n2. Resistance training: Resistance training, such as weightlifting or using resistance bands, can help improve insulin sensitivity and increase muscle mass, which can help regulate blood sugar levels. Aim for at least two sessions per week, with a day of rest in between.\n\n3. Yoga: Yoga can help reduce stress, which can help regulate blood sugar levels. It can also improve overall fitness and flexibility. Look for classes specifically designed for people with diabetes.\n\n4. High-intensity interval training (HIIT): HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by periods of rest. It has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\nBefore starting any exercise program, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider to determine what types and amount of exercise are safe for you. Depending on your fitness level, they may recommend starting with moderate-intensity activities such as walking and gradually increasing the intensity and duration over time.",
