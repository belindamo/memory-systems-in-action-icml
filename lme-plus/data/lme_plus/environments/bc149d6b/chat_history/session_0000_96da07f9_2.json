Keep them in the fridge for up to 3-5 days.

When you're ready to eat, simply thaw overnight at room temperature or in the fridge.\n\n**Yogurt Parfait:**\n\n1. **Fridge:** Assemble the parfait layers in a container, but keep the granola or toppings separate to maintain freshness. Store the parfait in the fridge for up to 2-3 days. Add the granola or toppings just before serving.\n2. **Freezer:** Freeze individual components of the parfait, such as the yogurt, fruit, and granola, in separate containers or bags. When you're ready to assemble, thaw the desired components and build your parfait. Frozen yogurt can be stored for up to 2-3 months, while frozen fruit and granola can be stored for up to 6-8 months.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Use airtight containers:** Prevent air from reaching your oats or parfait by using airtight containers or bags to maintain freshness.\n2. **Label and date containers:** Keep track of when you prepared and stored your oats or parfait by labeling and dating the containers.\n3. **Keep it cold:** Ensure your fridge is set between 37\u00b0F and 40\u00b0F (3\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C) to keep your oats and parfait fresh.\n4. **Freeze in portions:** Divide your oats or parfait into individual portions to make it easy to grab and go.\n5. **Reheat safely:** If you're reheating your oats or parfait, make sure to heat them to a safe internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to prevent foodborne illness.\n\nBy following these tips, you can enjoy your overnight oats and yogurt parfaits throughout the week, while saving time and reducing food waste."

      "content": "Using your commute time to review documents or make notes for upcoming meetings is a great way to stay productive and prepared.\n\nRegarding responding to personal emails or messages, it's ultimately up to you to decide how you want to use your commute time. However, here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros of responding to personal emails or messages during commute:**\n\n1. **Convenience:** You can quickly respond to personal messages or emails during your commute, freeing up time later in the day for other tasks.\n2. **Staying connected:** You can stay connected with friends and family, or respond to personal matters that require attention.\n\n**Cons of responding to personal emails or messages during commute:**\n\n1. **Blurred boundaries:** Mixing personal and work-related tasks during your commute might blur the boundaries between your personal and professional life.\n2. **Distraction:** Responding to personal emails or messages might distract you from focusing on work-related tasks, which could impact your productivity and preparedness for meetings.\n3. **Limited attention:** You might not have the same level of focus and attention during your commute, which could lead to mistakes or incomplete responses.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nIf you're trying to stay focused on work-related tasks during your commute, it might be better to prioritize those tasks and save personal emails or messages for breaks or downtime during the day. This can help you maintain a better work-life balance and avoid distractions.\n\nHowever, if you're someone who can effectively manage your time and prioritize tasks, and you need to respond to urgent personal matters, it's not necessarily a bad idea to use some of your commute time for that. Just be mindful of the potential distractions and try to set boundaries to maintain your focus.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to find a routine that works for you and your unique situation. Experiment with different approaches and see what helps you stay productive, focused, and balanced during your commute."
