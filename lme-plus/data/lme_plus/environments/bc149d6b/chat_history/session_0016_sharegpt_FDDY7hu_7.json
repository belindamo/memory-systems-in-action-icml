      "content": "Dude, you gotta hear this gnarly story about this kid Hyrum, man. This little dude's got some seriously bad luck vibes or something. So, like, he's cruisin' in a car, right? And then, bam! Car accident, and he breaks his collarbone. Bummer, bro.\n\nBut it doesn't end there. His big bro, Alexander, is like super into baseball, man. And he's just hittin' some balls, when he accidentally smacks Hyrum right in the forehead with the bat. Whoa, talk about a wipeout!\n\nNow, you'd think that's enough, but no way, dude. His other brother, Benedick, is out fishin', and he's just castin' his line, trying to catch some sick waves\u2014uh, I mean, fish. But instead, he hooks Hyrum's scalp. Ouch, man, that's gotta hurt.\n\nAnd then, there's his third brother, Cassius. They're all chillin' at the beach, and this guy throws a snorkeling mask at Hyrum's head. Like, what are the odds, bro? It's like this kid's got some bad juju or something.\n\nAnyway, man, even though they've been through all this heavy stuff, they're still, like, a super tight family, y'know? They're all, \"We're gonna ride this wave together, dudes.\" And, like, that's pretty rad.\n\nSo I guess the moral of the story is, even when life's throwin' you some gnarly wipeouts, your fam's always got your back. And maybe, like, stay away from baseball bats and fishing hooks, dude. Just stick to the surfboard, bro."
