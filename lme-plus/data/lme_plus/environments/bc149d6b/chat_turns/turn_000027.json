Mushrooms play a crucial role in adding depth to the soup, so choosing the right type is important.\n\n**Mushroom Recommendation:**\n\nFor Tom Yum Soup, you'll want to use a type of mushroom that's meaty, flavorful, and can hold its texture in the spicy broth. Here are some options:\n\n1. **Button Mushrooms**: While not the most exotic choice, button mushrooms are a good option if you can't find other varieties. They'll add a subtle sweetness and texture to the soup.\n2. **Crimini Mushrooms**: Crimini mushrooms have a slightly stronger flavor than button mushrooms and a more earthy tone.
