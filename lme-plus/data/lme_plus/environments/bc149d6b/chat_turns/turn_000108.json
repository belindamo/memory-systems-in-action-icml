  "content": "**Labeling Requirements for Jams and Honey:**\n\nLabeling requirements for jams and honey can vary depending on the type of product, its intended use, and the state or region where you're selling it. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n**Jams:**\n\n* **Nutrition Facts Label:** You are not required to include a Nutrition Facts label on jam products, as they are exempt from federal labeling requirements. However, you may choose to include a nutrition label voluntarily.\n* **Ingredient List:** You must list the ingredients in descending order of predominance (by weight) on the label.\n* **Allergen Warning:** If your jam contains common allergens like nuts, soy, or dairy, you must include an allergen warning statement on the label.\n* **Net Quantity:** You must declare the net quantity of the product (e.g., \"12 oz\" or \"340g\") on the label.\n* **Product Name:** Use a clear and descriptive product name, such as \"Strawberry Jam\" or \"Homemade Apricot Jam.\"\n\n**Honey:**\n\n* **Nutrition Facts Label:** Honey is exempt from Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, as it's considered a single-ingredient food.\n* **Ingredient List:** You don't need to list ingredients, as honey is a single ingredient.\n* **Net Quantity:** Declare the net quantity of the product (e.g., \"12 oz\" or \"340g\") on the label.\n* **Product Name:** Use a clear and descriptive product name, such as \"Pure Raw Honey\" or \"Wildflower Honey.\"\n* **Origin:** You may choose to include information about the honey's origin, such as \"Produced in [State/Region]\" or \"Harvested from [Specific Location].\"\n\n**General Labeling Guidelines for Homemade Products:**\n\n* **Truth-in-Labeling:** Ensure your labels are accurate and truthful. Avoid making false or misleading claims about your products.\n* **Clear and Conspicuous:** Use clear and conspicuous labeling, making it easy for consumers to read and understand the information.\n* **Type Size and Font:** Use a font size and style that's easy to read, typically 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) or larger.\n* **Label Placement:** Place labels on the front or top of the product, making it easily visible to consumers.\n* **Ingredient Disclosure:** Disclose any potential allergens or sensitivities, such as gluten, nuts, or soy.\n\n**State-Specific Labeling Requirements:**\n\nSome states may have additional labeling requirements or specific guidelines for homemade products. For example, California requires a \"Made in California\" statement on certain products, while Oregon has specific labeling requirements for honey.\n\nTo ensure compliance with labeling regulations, it's essential to research your state's specific requirements and guidelines. You can start by visiting your state's department of agriculture or health website, or by contacting your local Cooperative Extension office for guidance.",
