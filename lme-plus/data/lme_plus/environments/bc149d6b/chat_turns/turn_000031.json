Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Fresh galangal:** Store fresh galangal in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cupboard. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent moisture from entering. Fresh galangal can last for up to 2 weeks.\n2. **Refrigerated galangal:** Store galangal in the refrigerator to keep it fresh for a longer period. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place it in a sealed container. Refrigerated galangal can last for up to 6 weeks.\n3. **Frozen galangal:** Freeze galangal to preserve it for a longer period. Peel and chop the galangal, then place it in an airtight container or freezer bag. Frozen galangal can last for up to 6 months.\n4. **Dried galangal:** Dry galangal can be stored for a long period.

Dried galangal can last for up to 12 months.\n\n**Shelf Life of Galangal:**\n\nThe shelf life of galangal depends on the storage method and handling.
