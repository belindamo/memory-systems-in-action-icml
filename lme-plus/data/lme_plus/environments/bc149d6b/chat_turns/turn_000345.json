  "content": "Yes, there have been several instances where the Australian Army has utilized its new technologies and equipment in combat situations.\n\nFor example, in 2015, Australian special forces used drones to gather intelligence and monitor enemy movements during their operations in Iraq. The use of drones allowed soldiers to gather critical information without putting themselves in harm's way.\n\nIn 2016, the Australian Army deployed its M1A1 Abrams tanks in combat for the first time in Iraq. These tanks proved to be highly effective in providing fire support to ground troops, particularly in urban combat situations.\n\nIn 2018, the Australian Army used its new Hawkei protected vehicles during their operations in Afghanistan. These vehicles provided greater mobility and protection to soldiers, particularly during transport and resupply operations.\n\nOverall, the modernization of the Australian Army's capabilities through defence spending has enabled it to better protect its soldiers and achieve its mission goals in combat situations.",
