  "content": "It is indeed amazing that the Great Wall of China was built without modern technology. The construction of the wall involved a great deal of manual labor and engineering techniques. \n\nThe builders used a range of materials including brick, tamped earth, stone, and wood to construct the different parts of the wall. They used simple tools such as shovels, axes, hammers, and chisels. \n\nThe construction process was divided into phases, with each phase involving different steps such as quarrying and transporting materials, digging foundations, laying bricks, and fixing fortifications. Due to the sheer size of the wall, it was built in sections by skilled teams of workers who worked under the supervision of architects and engineers. \n\nThe workers often lived on-site in temporary camps and laborers were conscripted from across China, with farmers and soldiers being the primary labor force used for the construction. Despite being a massive undertaking, the skills and dedication of the workers and the use of innovative building techniques enabled builders to build one of the most significant engineering marvels in history!",
