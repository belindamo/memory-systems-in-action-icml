Here are a few ideas:\n\n**Formal Touches**\n\n1. **Skirt and Tights**: Pair your grey sweater with a fitted, knee-length skirt (black, navy, or dark grey) and a pair of opaque tights. This creates a chic, feminine look that's perfect for a formal brunch or a casual office party.\n2. **Dressy Pants**: Wear your grey sweater with a pair of dressy, dark-washed trousers (black, navy, or dark grey) and a statement belt. This creates a sharp, polished look that's suitable for a formal dinner or a networking event.\n3. **Blazer and Jeans**: Add a tailored blazer (navy, black, or grey) over your grey sweater and pair it with dark-washed, straight-leg jeans. This look is perfect for a more formal casual occasion, like a birthday party or a dinner date.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* To elevate your outfit, consider adding a statement piece of jewelry, like a bold necklace or earrings.\n* Swap out your casual accessories (like a canvas tote) for a more formal option, like a leather handbag or a sleek clutch.\n* Pay attention to the fabric and texture of your sweater. If it's a thicker, cable-knit sweater, it might be better suited for a casual occasion. If it's a thinner, more refined sweater, it might work well for a more formal event.\n* Don't forget to style your boots accordingly. You can add a bit of polish to your outfit by pairing your boots with a pair of dress socks or tights.\n\nRemember, the key to dressing up your outfit is to balance your casual pieces with more formal elements. By adding a skirt, dressy pants, or a blazer, you can easily take your grey sweater and boots from casual to chic!",
