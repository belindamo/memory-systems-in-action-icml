  "content": "Yes, certainly! There are movies or shows that overemphasize supporting character relationships, leading them to take over the main plot. At the same time, there are stories that focus too much on the main character, leading to underdeveloped supporting characters and their relationships.\n\nIn some romantic comedies, for example, the supporting characters' romances can become more compelling and interesting than the main couple's. This can leave the audience feeling more invested in the supporting characters' story than in the main characters, causing the film to lose its focus and coherence.\n\nOn the other hand, some action movies avert their focus entirely on the hero and their actions, resulting in underdeveloped supporting characters. These characters can become little more than plot devices or mere accessories to the hero's journey, which can lead to weak or unsatisfying interactions and relationships.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to maintain a balance and coherence in the narrative and the characters' development. A compelling story should feature a balance between the main character's journey and supporting character arcs. It should allow each character to have distinct personalities while also working cohesively to enhance the story's overarching themes and message.",
