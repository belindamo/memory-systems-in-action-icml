  "content": "I remember! You mentioned that earlier. So, you're thinking of taking the same route as your train commute, which means you'll still have to contend with the construction on Main Street. But, as you said, on a bike, you'll have more control over your route and can try to find a way to minimize the impact of the construction.\n\nIt's great that you're thinking ahead and considering the route you'll take. As a cyclist, you'll have more flexibility to adjust your route on the fly, which can be really helpful when dealing with construction or other obstacles.\n\nNow that we've discussed your bike commute time, I'm curious: are you feeling more confident about making the switch to a bike commute? Do you have any other concerns or questions about cycling to work?",
