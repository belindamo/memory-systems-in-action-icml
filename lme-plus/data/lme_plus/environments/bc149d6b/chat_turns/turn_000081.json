  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot express personal opinions about an artist's work. I can, however, say that the use of intertextual references can serve various purposes. Sometimes, it can help an artist create a continuous narrative or establish a signature style. Other times, it can be a nod to their earlier work or a way of expressing a connection to their past. It's worth noting that intertextuality can be a form of creativity in its own right and can enrich an artist's body of work in various ways. Ultimately, whether Eminem's use of intertextuality is creative or not is a matter of personal opinion, but it is worth noting that it has been a consistent feature of his work for many years and has been appreciated by many of his fans.",
