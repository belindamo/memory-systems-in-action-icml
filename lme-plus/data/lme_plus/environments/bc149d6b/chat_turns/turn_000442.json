Here are some general tips to care for the low-maintenance plants I mentioned earlier:\n\n**Watering:**\n\n* Water your plants when the soil feels dry to the touch, usually once a week in the summer and once every 10-14 days in the winter.\n* Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it feels dry, it's time to water.\n* Water thoroughly, making sure the pot drains well to prevent waterlogged soil.\n\n**Lighting:**\n\n* Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect light, but some can tolerate low light conditions.\n* Placing plants near an east- or west-facing window is ideal, as they receive gentle, indirect light.\n* Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause leaves to become scorched.\n\n**Humidity:**\n\n* Most houseplants prefer a humid environment, typically between 40-60% relative humidity.\n* You can increase humidity around your plants by placing them on a tray filled with water and pebbles or using a humidifier.\n\n**Temperature:**\n\n* Most houseplants prefer temperatures between 65-75\u00b0F (18-24\u00b0C) during the day and no lower than 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) at night.\n* Avoid placing plants near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n\n**Fertilization:**\n\n* Feed your plants with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) once a month.\n* Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning your plants' roots.\n\n**Pruning:**\n\n* Prune your plants regularly to maintain their shape, promote healthy growth, and encourage blooming.\n* Remove dead or dying leaves and stems to prevent the spread of disease.\n\n**Pest control:**\n\n* Check your plants regularly for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, and scale.\n* Isolate infected plants, and treat them with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n\n**Soil:**\n\n* Use a well-draining potting mix to prevent waterlogged soil.\n* Repot your plants every 1-2 years to refresh the soil and provide a larger pot if necessary.\n\n**Other tips:**\n\n* Avoid over-handling your plants, as this can cause stress and lead to disease.\n* Monitor your plants' condition, and adjust their care accordingly.\n* Learn to recognize common plant diseases and pests to take action quickly.\n\nBy following these general care tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a successful plant parent!",
