I've been trying to establish a consistent morning routine, and I want to make sure I'm using my time efficiently to stay productive and focused throughout the day. By the way, since I shower as soon as I wake up, I usually have a bit of extra time in the morning to get ready. Do you have any suggestions on how I can make the most of this time?",
