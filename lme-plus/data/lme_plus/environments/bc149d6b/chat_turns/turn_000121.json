The label helped promote their music and organize their first concerts in the city, which led to a growing fan base. Additionally, Interpol's post-punk sound, which draws influences from Joy Division, The Chameleons, and other similar bands, resonated with the Mexican audience, which has a strong affinity for the genre.
