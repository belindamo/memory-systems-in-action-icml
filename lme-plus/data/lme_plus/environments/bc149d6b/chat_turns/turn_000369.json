The fact that you were able to find great deals for \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" is a great omen for your current project!\n\nSince you have experience, I'll offer a few more advanced tips that might help you find even better deals:\n\n**Estate Sales:**\n\n1. **Look for \"lot\" deals**: Some estate sales offer a \"lot\" deal, where they bundle multiple items together at a discounted price. This can be a great way to score multiple costumes or props at once.\n2. **Check for \"hidden\" items**: Sometimes, estate sales will have items that aren't prominently displayed or are tucked away in boxes or closets. Don't be afraid to ask the sellers if they have any additional items that might not be on display.\n3. **Negotiate for bulk purchases**: If you find multiple items you need, try negotiating a bulk discount. This can be especially effective if you're buying multiple items from the same seller.\n\n**Auctions:**\n\n1. **Research the auctioneer**: Get to know the auctioneer and their style. Some auctioneers may have a reputation for being more aggressive or lenient with bidding, which can affect your strategy.\n2. **Look for \"no reserve\" auctions**: Some auctions will have a \"no reserve\" policy, which means the item will sell to the highest bidder, regardless of the price. This can be a great way to score a deal, but be careful not to get caught up in the excitement of bidding.\n3. **Use the \" Proxy Bid\" strategy**: If you can't attend the auction in person, consider using a proxy bid service. This allows you to set a maximum bid, and the service will bid on your behalf up to that amount.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Stay organized**: Keep a list of the items you need and prioritize them. This will help you stay focused and avoid impulse purchases.\n2. **Bring a measuring tape**: If you're looking for specific sizes or measurements, bring a measuring tape to ensure the item fits your needs.\n3. **Don't get discouraged**: It's not uncommon to leave an estate sale or auction empty-handed. Don't get discouraged, and keep looking \u2013 the perfect item might be just around the corner!\n\nI hope these advanced tips help you find some fantastic deals for \"Chicago\"! Good luck, and have fun hunting for those props and costumes!",
