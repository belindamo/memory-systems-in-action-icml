  "content": "Yes, of course! \"My Name Is\" includes multiple references to Eminem's earlier works. For instance, in the second verse of the song, he raps, \"I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits.\" This line references the character Norman Bates from the movie \"Psycho,\" a character that was also referenced in Eminem's earlier song \"97 Bonnie & Clyde.\" Additionally, in \"My Name Is,\" Eminem mentions \"the Ritalin binge\" and \"the hospital,\" both of which are references to his album \"The Slim Shady LP.\" These intertextual references, along with the song's music video, contributed to Eminem's larger artistic identity as a provocative, boundary-pushing rapper who frequently referenced dark subject matters and pop culture in his work.",
