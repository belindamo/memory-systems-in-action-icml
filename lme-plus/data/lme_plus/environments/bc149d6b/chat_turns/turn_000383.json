Here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. Make sure that you have set the environment variables in your Kubernetes deployment manifest file as described in my previous answer. You can check that the environment variables are set in your container by running the `env` command inside your container.\n2. Double-check that you are using the correct environment variable names in your Deno file. Make sure that the environment variable names in your Deno file match the environment variable names that you have set in your Kubernetes deployment manifest file.\n3. Check if you have added the `--allow-env` flag when running your Deno application. This flag is required to allow access to environment variables in Deno. You can run your application with the following command:\n```css\ndeno run --allow-env your_file.ts\n```\nReplace `your_file.ts` with the name of your Deno file.\n\n4. Make sure that your Deno application is running inside the same Kubernetes cluster as your other application that sets the environment variables.\n\nIf you have tried all of the above and are still experiencing issues, please provide more information about the specific error you are seeing or the behavior that you are observing.",
