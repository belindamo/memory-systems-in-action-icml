  "content": "I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost per pound of your layer feed.\n\nTo do this, you'll need to know the total cost of the 50-pound batch of feed. Once you have that information, you can easily calculate the cost per pound.\n\nHere's the formula:\n\nCost per pound = Total cost of feed \u00f7 Total weight of feed (in pounds)\n\nFor example, let's say the total cost of the 50-pound batch of feed is $25.00.\n\nCost per pound = $25.00 \u00f7 50 pounds = $0.50 per pound\n\nSo, in this example, the cost per pound of the layer feed would be $0.50.\n\nDo you have the total cost of the feed handy? I can help you plug in the numbers and get the exact cost per pound.",
