  "content": "Excellent approach! Reaching out to multiple people can be beneficial, but it's essential to prioritize your efforts and manage the conversations effectively. Here are some suggestions to help you do so:\n\n**Prioritization:**\n\n1. **Identify the most relevant connections**: Based on your goals and needs, identify which connections are most relevant to your marketing strategy. In your case, the product manager from Google might be a high priority due to their experience in marketing and product development.\n2. **Consider the timing**: Think about the timing of your outreach. If you're close to launching your project, you might want to prioritize conversations with people who can provide immediate feedback and guidance.\n3. **Focus on mutually beneficial relationships**: Identify connections where you can offer value in return, such as the freelance writer who might be interested in interviewing you for their book. This can help you build stronger relationships and increase the likelihood of getting valuable feedback.\n\n**Managing conversations:**\n\n1. **Create a conversation tracker**: Use a spreadsheet or tool to track your conversations, including the date, topic, and key takeaways. This will help you keep everything organized and ensure you follow up with each person.\n2. **Prepare a conversation framework**: Develop a framework for your conversations, including the topics you want to discuss and the questions you want to ask. This will help you stay focused and ensure you cover all the important points.\n3. **Take notes and summarize**: Take detailed notes during each conversation, and summarize the key takeaways in your conversation tracker. This will help you identify patterns and themes across multiple conversations.\n4. **Follow up and show appreciation**: After each conversation, send a follow-up email or message to thank the person for their time and reiterate any commitments you made (e.g., sending additional information or following up on a specific topic).\n5. **Synthesize feedback and advice**: Once you've completed your conversations, take the time to synthesize the feedback and advice you received. Identify common themes, areas of agreement, and conflicting opinions. This will help you develop a comprehensive understanding of your marketing strategy and identify areas for improvement.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Be respectful of people's time**: Remember that the people you're reaching out to are busy professionals. Be respectful of their time, and don't expect them to provide extensive feedback or guidance.\n2. **Be open-minded and flexible**: Be open to feedback and advice, even if it challenges your assumptions or ideas. Be flexible in your approach, and willing to adjust your marketing strategy based on the insights you receive.\n3. **Show appreciation and gratitude**: Express gratitude to each person for their time and feedback. This will help build stronger relationships and increase the likelihood of future collaborations or mentorship opportunities.\n\nBy prioritizing your outreach efforts and managing your conversations effectively, you'll be able to gather valuable insights and feedback from multiple people in your network. This will help you develop a more effective marketing strategy and increase the chances of success for your side project.",
