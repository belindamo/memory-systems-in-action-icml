Celebrate milestones: Celebrate your friend's milestones such as days, weeks, or months of sobriety, and offer encouragement when things get tough.\n\n5. Encourage participation in support groups: Encourage your friend to participate in support groups like AA or NA, where they can connect with others who have gone through similar experiences.\n\n6.
