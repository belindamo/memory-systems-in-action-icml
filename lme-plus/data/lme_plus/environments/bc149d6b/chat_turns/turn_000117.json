  "content": "Joy Division is a band that has gained a significant following in Mexico City, especially among the younger generations. One reason for their popularity in Mexico City is likely their post-punk sound, which resonates with Mexican youth who are drawn to the energy and raw emotion of the music.\n\nAnother reason is the lyrics of Joy Division's songs, which often deal with themes of alienation, isolation, and despair. These themes are relatable to many young people in Mexico City, who may be struggling to find their place in a rapidly changing and often uncertain society.\n\nAdditionally, Joy Division has been heavily influenced by Mexican art and culture. Lead singer Ian Curtis was a fan of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, and the band has incorporated Mexican imagery and references into their album covers and music videos. This connection to Mexican culture may have helped to endear the band to audiences in Mexico City.\n\nFinally, Joy Division's tragic history may have contributed to their popularity in Mexico City. Ian Curtis committed suicide in 1980, just as the band was gaining international recognition. This sense of tragedy and loss has made Joy Division's music even more powerful and resonant for many fans, including those in Mexico City.",
