  "content": "The exact number of workers who lost their lives while working on the Great Wall of China is unknown, as accurate records were not kept during construction. However, it is believed that many workers died due to the dangerous working conditions and hazards.\n\nThe construction of the wall was often carried out in remote and treacherous regions, exposing the workers to harsh weather conditions such as extreme heat and cold as well as unsanitary living conditions, with limited access to clean water and adequate food supplies. Workers would often fall from great heights or be crushed under heavy construction materials.\n\nThe workers who were conscripted to work on the wall were often from peasant or prison backgrounds, so their loss of life was regarded as expendable. Many historians have suggested that a significant number of workers may have died while working on the Great Wall, with some estimates suggesting that the number could be in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nAlthough the wall is an impressive feat of human engineering, the construction process was tough and dangerous, with the workers bearing the brunt of the risk and suffering.",
