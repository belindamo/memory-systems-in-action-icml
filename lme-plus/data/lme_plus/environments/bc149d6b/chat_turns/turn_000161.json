Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Multiple perspectives**: You'll get to hear from people with different backgrounds, experiences, and expertise, which can help you identify patterns, trends, or blind spots in your marketing strategy.\n2. **Validation and confirmation**: If multiple people provide similar feedback or suggestions, it can give you confidence in your approach or help you identify areas that need improvement.\n3. **Networking opportunities**: Reaching out to multiple people can help you strengthen your network, build relationships, and potentially open up new opportunities for collaboration or mentorship.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Information overload**: Gathering feedback from multiple people can be overwhelming, especially if you receive conflicting advice or opinions.\n2. **Time-consuming**: Reaching out to multiple people, scheduling calls or meetings, and following up can be time-consuming and take away from other important tasks.\n3. **Diffusion of responsibility**: If you're seeking feedback from multiple people, it can be easy to diffuse responsibility and not take ownership of your marketing strategy.\n\nTo make the most of reaching out to multiple people in your network, consider the following:\n\n1. **Prioritize**: Identify the most relevant and valuable connections in your network and prioritize your outreach efforts accordingly.\n2. **Be clear about what you're asking**: Be specific about what you're asking for and what you hope to achieve from each conversation.\n3. **Take notes and summarize**: Take notes during each conversation and summarize the key takeaways to help you organize your thoughts and identify patterns.\n4. **Synthesize feedback**: Take the feedback and advice you receive and synthesize it into actionable insights and decisions for your marketing strategy.\n\nIn your case, reaching out to the senior engineer from Microsoft, the freelance writer, and the product manager from Google can be a great way to gather diverse perspectives and insights. However, be mindful of their time and expertise, and make sure you're not overwhelming them with requests.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n1. Reach out to each person with a personalized email or message, explaining how you met and what you're looking for (e.g., feedback on your marketing strategy, insights into the industry, or advice on a specific challenge).\n2. Schedule calls or meetings with each person, and prepare thoughtful questions and topics to discuss.\n3. Take notes during each conversation, and summarize the key takeaways to help you organize your thoughts and identify patterns.\n4. Synthesize the feedback and advice you receive into actionable insights and decisions for your marketing strategy.\n\nBy being respectful of their time, prepared, and open to feedback, you can gather valuable insights from multiple people in your network and create a more effective marketing strategy for your side project.",
