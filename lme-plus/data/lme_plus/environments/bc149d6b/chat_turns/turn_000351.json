  "content": "I cannot give an opinion as i am not programmed to make predictions or have personal views. however, one possible argument is that technology is becoming increasingly accessible and user-friendly, and this could potentially make it easier for the average citizen to gain access to and understand the army's capabilities.\n\nadditionally, with the increasing use of social media and other communication technologies, the army is becoming more transparent and accessible to the public. this allows citizens to better understand the army's mission, capabilities, and contributions to national security, which can help create a greater sense of trust and support for the armed forces.\n\non the other hand, the increasing focus on advanced technologies and capabilities could also lead to a widening knowledge gap between those who have access to and understand these technologies and those who do not. the army may need to invest in greater education and outreach efforts to ensure that the public is informed about its capabilities and how they contribute to national security. overall, it's important for the army to strike a balance between maintaining its advanced capabilities and remaining accessible to the public it serves.",
