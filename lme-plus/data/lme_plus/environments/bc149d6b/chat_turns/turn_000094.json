  "content": "With the discount, you'll want to calculate the net cost of the feed before calculating the cost per pound.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nOriginal price = $120\nDiscount = 10% of $120 = $12 (since 10% of $120 is $12)\nNet cost = Original price - Discount = $120 - $12 = $108\n\nNow, you can calculate the cost per pound:\n\nCost per pound = Net cost \u00f7 Total weight of feed (in pounds)\n= $108 \u00f7 50 pounds\n= $2.16 per pound\n\nSo, the cost per pound of the layer feed, after the 10% discount, is $2.16.",
