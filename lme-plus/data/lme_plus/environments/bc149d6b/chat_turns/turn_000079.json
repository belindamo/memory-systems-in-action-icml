  "content": "Yes, Eminem has several other songs with intertextual references to his earlier works. In fact, intertextuality is a recurring motif in his music. For example, parts of the chorus in \"The Real Slim Shady\" is derived from the chorus of his earlier song \"I'm Back,\" where he says \"I'm back, I'm back, that's all right, all right.\" In \"The Real Slim Shady,\" the chorus is \"I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady, all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating.\" \n\nAnother example is his song \"Kill You\" from \"The Marshall Mathers LP,\" where he references \"My Name Is\" by saying, \"I take seven [kids from] Stand up and pee, and put 'em in a line. Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine, a MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine. And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time, 'cause (My Name Is) Marshall Mathers...\". \n\nEminem's consistent use of intertextual references and callbacks to his previous work is one of the reasons his fans love him, as it creates an interconnected web of meaning and a sense of continuity in his music.",
