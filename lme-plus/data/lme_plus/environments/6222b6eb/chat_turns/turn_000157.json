  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot answer questions based on human emotions of characters in fiction. However, it can be observed that the other characters in the film do not actively challenge Lewis's behavior, and instead, they often go along with what he suggests. While they may express some initial reluctance or concern, they ultimately follow Lewis's lead, even when it becomes clear that his actions are putting them in danger. This highlights how toxic masculinity can be perpetuated not just by individuals who actively display it, but also by those who passively enable it by not speaking out against it or challenging it. However, it is worth noting that Ed, the main character, does ultimately stand up to Lewis and confronts him about the dangers of their situation, which shows that it is possible to challenge toxic masculinity and its dangerous consequences.",
