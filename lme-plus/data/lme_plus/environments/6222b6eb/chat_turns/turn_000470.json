  "content": "There are several soil classification systems that are used around the world, each with its own set of criteria for categorizing soil types. One of the most widely used soil classification systems is the USDA soil taxonomy, which is used in the United States. The USDA soil taxonomy is a hierarchical system that divides soils into 12 categories based on their physical, chemical, and biological properties. The categories in the USDA soil taxonomy include:\n\n* Order\n* Suborder\n* Great group\n* Subgroup\n* Family\n* Series\n\nOther soil classification systems that are commonly used include the FAO-UNESCO soil classification system, which is used internationally, and the WRB (World Reference Base) soil classification system, which is used by the International Union of Soil Sciences. Each of these systems has its own set of criteria for categorizing soil types, and they may use different terms and categories to describe soil properties.",
