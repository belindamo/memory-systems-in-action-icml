  "content": "Congratulations on considering a move to a house with more land! Using the equity from your condo sale can be a great way to upgrade to a larger property. When evaluating properties with land, there are several factors to consider beyond the house itself. Here are some key things to look for:\n\n1. **Land size and shape:** Consider the total acreage, but also think about the shape of the property. A long, narrow lot might not be as desirable as a square or rectangular one.\n2. **Zoning and land-use regulations:** Research the local zoning laws to ensure you can use the land as you wish. Check for any restrictions on building, subdividing, or using the land for agricultural purposes.\n3. **Topography and drainage:** Look for properties with gentle slopes or flat areas, which can be more suitable for outdoor activities or building. Be wary of low-lying areas that might flood or have drainage issues.\n4. **Soil quality and stability:** If you plan to garden, farm, or build on the land, it's essential to evaluate the soil quality. Test the soil to determine its pH level, nutrient content, and stability.\n5. **Water availability and rights:** If you're interested in using the land for irrigation, livestock, or other water-intensive activities, investigate the water supply. Check if there's a well, access to a municipal water supply, or water rights.\n6. **Neighboring properties and surroundings:** Research the adjacent properties to ensure they aren't industrial, commercial, or noisy. Also, consider the surroundings, such as nearby highways, airports, or other potential noise sources.\n7. **Environmental concerns:** Be aware of any environmental issues like wetlands, endangered species habitats, or previous contamination. These can impact your ability to use the land as you wish.\n8. **Access and roads:** Evaluate the condition and maintenance of the roads leading to the property. Ensure you have easy access to the land, especially if you plan to use it for farming or other activities.\n9. **Utilities and services:** Confirm the availability of essential services like electricity, internet, and phone connectivity. Also, check if there are any shared utility lines or easements on the property.\n10. **Property boundaries and surveys:** Verify the property boundaries and ensure they're clearly marked. Consider hiring a surveyor to confirm the property lines and identify any potential issues.\n11. **Local ordinances and covenants:** Research any local ordinances, covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) that might impact your use of the land. These can include rules about fencing, outbuildings, or even the color of your house.\n12. **Insurance and taxes:** Calculate the insurance costs and property taxes associated with the new property. These can be significantly higher for larger properties with land.\n\nWhen evaluating properties, consider working with a real estate agent who has experience with land sales. They can help you navigate the process and identify potential issues.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to think about your long-term goals and how the property will meet your needs. Ask yourself:\n\n* What do you want to use the land for (e.g., gardening, farming, livestock, recreation)?\n* Do you need outbuildings like barns, sheds, or stables?\n* Are there any specific features you require, like a pond, stream, or woods?\n* How will you maintain the property, and what are the associated costs?\n\nBy carefully considering these factors, you'll be better equipped to find a property that meets your needs and provides the perfect balance of house and land.",
