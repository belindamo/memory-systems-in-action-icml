Is this an area of strength or an area for improvement? Use the article from Edweek as a frame for your thinking. Additionally, look at the Standards for Cultural Responsiveness checklist and discuss the potential of utilizing the checklist as a tool for curriculum development and revision.\nPrompt reply:\nThornton Township High School in Harvey Illinois currently has population of students that is about 67.5% Black, 29% Latino, 2.5% Asian ( Indians of the Muslim Faith) and less than 1% White. 17.3% of the students are classified as English Language Learners. The teacher representation is vastly different with 53.8% White , 36.3% Black, 6.8% Latino, 1.8% Asian. ( The teacher demographics are district wide for Thornton, Thornridge, and Thornwood.) \nOverall, I would say that the level of cultural responsiveness at my school is relatively low. While the letters and report cards sent home are available in English and Spanish, announcements on the intercome are always only in English, this leaves 17% of the Students out. In my Yearbook class I have 3 students out of about 25 that speak almost only Spanish. I do my best to give directions in English and Spanish so that they can understand the tasks that we are doing. I do this by typing up what I plan to say in Google translate. My current level of Spanish is around the upper beginer level but I am working to increase it due to the changing demographics of my school and I want to reach all my students and families. I believe the school as a whole should increase their efforts to reach the Spanish speaking students to make them feel more welcome. \nCulturally responsive teaching standards: \nStandards for Cultural Responsiveness A CHECKLIST THAT ALL LESSONS SHOULD ALIGN TO \u25cf Are students told specifically what they are expected to know and do? \u25cf Does the lesson use cooperative learning, especially for new material (examples include book clubs, literature circles, role-playing, discussion groups, peer teaching, Jigsaw, Reciprocal Learning)? \u25cf Does the lesson ask students to connect their perspectives and experiences to the topic? \u25cf Do students participate in building knowledge (examples include writing their own definition, peer teaching, Student-Directed Sharing Time)? \u25cf Is self-assessment included? \u25cf Are students required to support their ideas by referencing text, pictures, and reasoning? \u25cf Does the lesson teach students to question/challenge their own beliefs and actions? \u25cf Are alternative viewpoints acknowledged and discussed? \u25cf Do the lesson images and examples reference various cultures? \u25cf Do images represent people as individuals, as stereotypes, or generically? \u25cf Are there male and female protagonists (whether historic actors, subjects of biographies, or main characters), and do they represent varying economic and ethnic backgrounds? Cultural Responsiveness A CHECKLIST FOR IMPROVING LESSONS \u25cf Could a poll be added for students to reflect on their learning style preferences? \u25cf Is there a way for the lesson to incorporate students\u00b4 identities, such as having them write about family traditions or research aspects of their cultural background? \u25cf Could a poll or open-ended question be added that enables students to question/challenge or to review the lesson? \u25cf Is there a way for the lesson to teach about differences between individuals and show how student differences make a better class? \u25cf Does the lesson encourage the use of the student's first language to enhance learning? \u25cf Is there a way for students to choose their own reading material, their own project goals, or their own list of topics for study/research? \u25cf Can the lesson be made inquiry-based/discovery-oriented? \u25cf Is there a way for students to research topics within their community, by interviewing community members, or by inviting community members to speak, do a demonstration, or show an alternative way of approaching a problem in class? \u25cf Is there a way to differ learning modes within the same lesson (examples: students working alone and/or in groups; students submitting work in video and/or written format)? \u25cf Can the lesson include cross-cultural interaction, possibly by leveraging technology?

Well, just like with all things in this complex petri dish called public education, it depends on who you ask. Every learner deserves and has the right to receive a quality and equitable education. However, the delivery of that education must be contingent upon the needs of the students. Needless to say, the academic bar should be raised for all pupils regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic status.\nA large body of literature strongly supports what I have observed throughout my own career: Culturally responsive instruction has a positive impact on the academic outcomes of minority students.\nFor students to become and remain actively engaged in their learning experiences, there must be high-interest material that reflects their lives.\"\nIn the foundational 2000 book Culturally Responsive Teaching: Theory, Research, and Practice, researcher Geneva Gay defined culturally responsive teaching as \u201cusing cultural knowledge, prior experiences, frames of reference, and performance styles of ethnically diverse students to make learning more appropriate and effective.\u201d This approach teaches to and through the strength of the students, thus empowering them to take ownership of their learning.\nIn culturally responsive classrooms, the classroom climate is a safe haven characterized by respect and care. Teachers establish trusting relationships that allow all students to take risks and to challenge the perspectives of others, including the teacher.\nObviously, there is no one-size-fits-all solution that will ensure academic success for any sub-group of students, but persistent disparities in the national graduation rate indicate that the current curricular approaches do not provide an equitable education for all learners.\nTo address these gaps, public, charter, and private schools in America must become culturally proficient learning centers. For students to become and remain actively engaged in their learning experiences, there must be high-interest material that reflects their lives. It is just as important for students in the majority population to be provided with a broader scope of literature and history outside of their experiences.\nWaiting only for a specific month of the year to discuss contributions or sacrifices by Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and African-Americans signals to students that those efforts were second-tier accomplishments. This inadvertently undermines the purpose of celebrating the aforementioned accomplishments.\nAs a middle school teacher in 1989, my colleagues and I first began utilizing what I would later learn to be culturally responsive instruction by infusing high-interest reading material into the district\u2019s regular English/language arts curriculum. We began including prose, essays, and novels by diverse authors in our lesson plans, and required students to write letters to those historical figures. Other teachers I worked with began requiring students to use graphic organizers to compare and contrast their lives with an author, inventor, or scientist of a different race or gender.\nScience, mathematics, and elective teachers can also be instrumental, by embedding historical facts in the curriculum related to minorities who had made major contributions in their respective fields. Those practices allow learners to understand that they had many traits, characteristics, experiences, and goals in common with yesterday\u2019s heroes. More importantly, students begin to internalize that they, too, could be successful if they remain focused, work diligently, and keep their eye on the prize.\nYears later, I saw how culturally relevant instruction could boost achievement on a districtwide scale, while serving as the director for middle schools and later the assistant superintendent for student support services in Tucson Unified School District. After the district introduced culturally relevant courses, graduation rates and standardized test scores measurably improved for some students who took the aforementioned courses.\nSchools of education also have a part to play, by placing a greater emphasis on integrating culturally responsive and relevant coursework in the curricula used to prepare future teachers. It is unfair and almost impossible for educators in K-12 education systems to effectively infuse this pedagogy into their learning communities without appropriate training. Furthermore, most administrators and instructional coaches are not well versed on this curriculum framework, leaving many teachers without a solid foundation of the underpinnings and expected outcomes.\nI submit that K-12 practitioners must receive hands-on experience during their student-teaching internships and participate in personal observations of this best practice while enrolled in college. Local college of education professors should also provide annual districtwide in-service training to all instructional and administrative staff, including the school board and the superintendent to ensure buy-in and commitment at the highest level.\nEmbedding culturally responsive instruction in the comprehensive curriculum yields positive learning outcomes for many minority students. Ultimately, it is imperative that the instructional and school leaders have high expectations for all learners in the building.",
