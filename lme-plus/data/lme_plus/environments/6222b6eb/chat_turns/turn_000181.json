Generally, contact sports like football, hockey, rugby, and boxing are considered more dangerous due to the nature of the sport, which often involves collisions and high-speed impacts. More recently, sports like soccer and basketball have also raised concerns around concussions, as these sports involve a significant amount of head impacts and collisions, especially for female athletes.
