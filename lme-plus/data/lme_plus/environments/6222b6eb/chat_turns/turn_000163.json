  "content": "Yes, education and awareness programs can play a critical role in challenging toxic masculinity and promoting healthy expressions of gender. Schools and workplaces are important spaces where these conversations can take place, and providing education and training can help individuals recognize and address toxic behaviors and attitudes. This can range from providing educational workshops on consent and healthy relationships, to creating policies and programs that promote gender equality and combat discrimination and harassment. By beginning these conversations early, we can help to ensure that future generations are equipped with the knowledge and tools to promote healthy and respectful expressions of masculinity, and build a society that values and promotes gender equality for all.",
