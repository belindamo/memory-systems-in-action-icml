However, I should let you know that I don't have any information about your personal schedule or tasks, including what you do on your \"admin day\". I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your to-do lists, calendar, or work tasks.\n\nBut it's great that you're thinking ahead and making sure you have time for your tasks before dinner with Rachel!
