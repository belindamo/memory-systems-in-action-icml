  "content": "I'm happy to help you plan your meals, but I don't have access to your kitchen or fridge! As a digital AI assistant, I don't have the ability to see what's in your fridge or know what leftovers you may have.\n\nIf you're trying to plan out your meals for the week, I recommend taking a look in your fridge, freezer, and pantry to see what ingredients you already have on hand. You can also think about what meals you cooked last week and whether you have any leftovers that can be reheated or repurposed.\n\nIf you need help with meal planning or recipe ideas, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions! Just let me know what type of cuisine you're in the mood for, any dietary restrictions you have, and how much time you have available to cook.",
