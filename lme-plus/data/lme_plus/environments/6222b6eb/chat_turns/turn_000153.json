  "content": "The film Deliverance explores themes of masculinity and violence through the character of Lewis by portraying him as a hyper-masculine and aggressive individual who believes in the idea of male dominance and superiority. Throughout the film, Lewis is shown as a hunter and adventurer, who takes pride in his strength and toughness. This is evident in the scene where he trains his friends on how to shoot a bow and arrow, emphasizing the need for precision and power.\n\nFurthermore, Lewis is also depicted as being very confrontational and even violent when he feels his masculinity is being threatened. This is apparent when he aggressively confronts the locals at the gas station and when he physically attacks the man who insults him at the end of the film. These actions serve to reinforce the idea that in order to be a \"real man,\" one must display strength, aggression, and dominance over others.\n\nHowever, the film also shows the limitations and dangers of this extreme form of masculinity. Lewis's insistence on taking risks and pushing himself and his friends to the limit ultimately results in tragic consequences, and his violent behavior puts both himself and his friends in danger. This highlights the destructive nature of toxic masculinity and the need for a more balanced and nuanced view of masculinity that values traits such as empathy, kindness, and self-control.",
