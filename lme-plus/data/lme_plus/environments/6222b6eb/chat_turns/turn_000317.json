  "content": "Ensuring that member states take nuclear safety more seriously is crucial in preventing nuclear disasters in the future. Here are some potential ways to achieve this:\n\n1. Strengthen regulations and make them more enforceable: The IAEA could work with member states to develop stronger regulations and ensure that they are enforced.\n\n2. Increase transparency: The IAEA could work to establish a more open and transparent system for reporting and sharing information on nuclear safety. This would give member states more incentive to comply with regulations as they would be under public scrutiny.\n\n3. Provide stronger technical assistance: The IAEA could provide more technical assistance to member states to help them meet nuclear safety requirements.\n\n4. Increase public awareness: The IAEA could work with member states to increase public awareness of nuclear safety issues. This would increase the pressure on governments to take nuclear safety more seriously.\n\n5. Implement a system of penalties: The IAEA could establish a system of penalties for member states that fail to meet nuclear safety standards. For example, member states that violate these standards could face economic sanctions or even expulsion from the organization.\n\nOverall, it is important for the IAEA to work with member states to establish a culture of nuclear safety that encourages compliance with regulations and a shared commitment to the highest levels of security.",
