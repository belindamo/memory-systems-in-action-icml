I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't retain any information about your daily activities or routines.\n\nIf you're trying to remember your gym schedule, you might want to check your calendar, planner, or gym membership information to see when you usually go. Or, you could try setting a reminder on your phone or putting it in your calendar to help you stay on track!",
