However, sports-related concussions differ in severity depending on several factors, including the type of sport, the level of physical contact involved in the game, and the age and gender of the athlete. For instance, sports like football, hockey, and soccer tend to have higher rates of concussions due to the high level of physical contact required in these sports. Athletes participating in such games are more prone to head injuries due to direct contact with other players, accidental falls or collisions, or hits from sports equipment like baseballs or hockey sticks. Additionally, female athletes have been found to have a higher incidence of concussions in sports like soccer and basketball compared to their male counterparts. All in all, sports-related concussions vary in severity based on various factors such as the sport in which they occur, and their individual context.",
