  "content": "Mean reversion is a financial theory that suggests that the price of a financial instrument will eventually move back towards its long-term average or mean. This concept is based on the assumption that market movements are not purely random, but that they are influenced by factors that will eventually cause the price to revert to its mean.\n\nZ-score is a statistical measure that represents the number of standard deviations from the mean of a given dataset. In the context of financial markets, the z-score is often used to measure the deviation of a financial instrument's price from its mean.\n\nThe idea behind using z-score in trading is that when the z-score of a financial instrument moves away from its mean by a certain amount, it is likely to eventually revert back to its mean. By measuring the z-score of a financial instrument over time, traders can identify when the price has moved too far away from its mean and take positions accordingly.\n\nHere is an example of how to compute the z-score of a financial instrument's price using Python:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Collect historical data for a financial instrument\ndata = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Compute the mean and standard deviation of the price over the lookback period\nlookback = 30\nmean = data['Price'].rolling(window=lookback).mean()\nstd = data['Price'].rolling(window=lookback).std()\n\n# Compute the z-score of the price\ndata['Z-Score'] = (data['Price'] - mean) / std\n```\nIn this code, we first collect the historical data for a financial instrument and store it in a Pandas DataFrame. We then define a lookback period of 30 days and compute the rolling mean and standard deviation of the price using the `rolling` method. Finally, we compute the z-score of the price by subtracting the mean from the price and dividing by the standard deviation.\n\nOnce we have computed the z-score, we can use it to identify when the price has moved too far away from its mean and take positions accordingly. For example, if the z-score is above a certain threshold, we may decide to short the financial instrument in anticipation of it reverting back to its mean. Conversely, if the z-score is below a certain threshold, we may decide to go long the financial instrument. The specific thresholds used will depend on the trading strategy and risk tolerance of the trader.",
