  "content": "That's a great approach! By expressing your concerns and focusing on the benefits of therapy, you're showing your parents that you care about your brother's well-being and want to support him in getting the help he needs. By offering to help research therapists and counseling services, you're also demonstrating your commitment to finding a solution that works for him.\n\nRemember to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and try to avoid being judgmental or critical. It's possible that your parents may not have realized the full extent of your brother's struggles, or they may not know where to start in terms of getting him help.\n\nBy working together and having an open and honest conversation, you can help your parents understand the importance of seeking professional help for your brother's anxiety and depression. And by offering to help with the research and logistics, you can make the process feel less overwhelming for them.\n\nRemember to listen to their concerns and respond to their questions and worries. It's okay if they have reservations or doubts - it's a big step to take, and it's natural to have questions. But by being supportive and informative, you can help them feel more comfortable with the idea of therapy and more confident in their ability to help your brother.\n\nGood luck with the conversation, and I hope it leads to a positive outcome for your brother!",
