  "content": "The minimalist movement in the United States during the 1960s and 70s was a response to the serialism and atonality of the European avant-garde in the mid-twentieth century, which many American composers found to be too academic and detached from the broader musical tradition. Additionally, the minimalist movement coincided with the broader social and cultural transformations of the 1960s, including the Civil Rights movement, anti-war protests, and the rise of youth and countercultural movements.\n\nSome of the minimalist composers were influenced by non-Western musical traditions, such as Indian classical music, Indonesian gamelan, and African music. They sought to incorporate aspects of those musical traditions into their work, along with the use of new technology like electronic music and tape loops.\n\nThe minimalist movement was also tied to an interest in simplicity, clarity, and repetition, which influenced not only music but also other artistic and cultural movements of the time, such as minimal art and conceptualism.",
