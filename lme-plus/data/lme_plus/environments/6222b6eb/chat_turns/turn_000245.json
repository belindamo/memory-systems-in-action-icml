  "content": "Minimalist music is characterized by simple harmony, repetitive melodic patterns, and a slow rate of harmonic change. The music often features a steady pulse, and each layer of sound is repeated and developed over time.\n\nThe minimalist movement was developed in the United States during the 1960s and 70s. The following composers are associated with the movement:\n\n1. Steve Reich: Known for his use of phase shifting techniques, in which two identical lines of music are played simultaneously but gradually shift out of phase with each other.\n2. Philip Glass: Known for his use of strict, repetitive rhythmic structures and his use of repeated harmonic progressions.\n3. Terry Riley: Known for his use of tape loops, layered compositions, and improvisation.\n4. La Monte Young: Known for his use of long, sustained tones and his experimentation with just intonation.\n5. John Adams: Known for his incorporation of minimalist musical techniques into more traditional orchestral music.",
