  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot answer what a character's motivation was, as it is subjective and open to interpretation. However, it can be interpreted that Lewis's desire to take risks and push his friends on the trip could stem from a combination of wanting to prove his own masculinity and wanting to prove something to his friends. His hyper-masculine behavior could be a reflection of his beliefs and values about what it means to be a man. But, as the trip goes on, it becomes increasingly clear that he also wants his friends to see him as a leader and someone who is capable of handling any situation, which could be related to the need to prove himself to his friends. Ultimately, Lewis's behavior can be seen as a manifestation of toxic masculinity and the dangers of living up to gendered stereotypes and expectations.",
