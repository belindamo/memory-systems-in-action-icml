  "content": "Thornton Township High School in Harvey, Illinois has a diverse student population, with approximately 67.5% Black, 29% Latino, 2.5% Asian (Indians of the Muslim Faith), and less than 1% White students. Additionally, 17.3% of the students are classified as English Language Learners. However, the teacher representation does not match the student demographics, with 53.8% White, 36.3% Black, 6.8% Latino, and 1.8% Asian teachers. The level of cultural responsiveness at the school is relatively low, as announcements are always only in English, leaving 17% of students who are English Language Learners out. While report cards and letters are available in both English and Spanish, the school should make more efforts to reach Spanish-speaking students to make them feel more welcome.\n\nAccording to the article \"Why a Culturally Responsive Curriculum Works\" by Eugene Butler Jr. (2019), a culturally responsive curriculum is essential in today's diverse school districts to deliver quality and equitable education. Culturally responsive teaching aims to use cultural knowledge, prior experiences, frames of reference, and performance styles of ethnically diverse students. Such teaching methods can have a positive impact on the academic outcomes of minority students.\n\nTo develop culturally responsive curricula, teachers can use the Standards for Cultural Responsiveness checklist. This checklist includes items such as asking students to connect their perspectives and experiences to the topic, incorporating students' identities into the lesson, and acknowledging and discussing alternative viewpoints. Additionally, the checklist recommends using cross-cultural interaction to leverage technology, researching topics within the students' community, and using students' first language to enhance learning.\n\nIn conclusion, Thornton Township High School needs to improve its level of cultural responsiveness, especially with regard to the Spanish-speaking population. Teachers can use the Standards for Cultural Responsiveness checklist to develop culturally responsive curricula that reflect the lives and experiences of ethnically diverse students, leading to positive academic outcomes for minority students.\n\nReferences:\n\nButler, E.
