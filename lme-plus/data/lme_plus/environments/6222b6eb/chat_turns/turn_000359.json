Trying out the amp before buying is always a good idea.\n\nAs I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific music stores or their inventory. However, I can suggest a few options to help you find out if the music store downtown carries the Fender Mustang II:\n\n1. **Call the store directly**: Give the music store a call and ask if they carry the Fender Mustang II. They can let you know if they have it in stock or can order one for you.\n2. **Check the store's website**: Visit the music store's website and check their online inventory. They might have a section for Fender amps or a product catalog that lists the Mustang II.\n3. **Check online retailers**: You can also check online retailers like Guitar Center, Musician's Friend, or Amazon to see if they carry the Mustang II and if they have any locations near you.\n4. **Visit the Fender website**: Fender's website has a \"Dealer Locator\" feature that allows you to find authorized dealers in your area. You can enter your location and find a list of nearby stores that carry Fender products.\n\nRemember to ask the store staff about any promotions, discounts, or bundle deals they might be offering. And don't hesitate to ask questions or request a demo of the amp when you visit the store.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find the perfect amp for your needs!",
