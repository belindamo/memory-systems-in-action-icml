  "content": "Research suggests that female athletes may be at a higher risk of experiencing more severe concussions than male athletes in certain sports due to differences in anatomy and physiology. Specifically, women generally have weaker neck muscles than men, which can cause the head to experience greater acceleration and deceleration during impact, leading to more severe concussions. Additionally, hormonal differences between men and women may also contribute to this increased risk, as hormones like estrogen and progesterone have been found to affect brain function and contribute to greater susceptibility to concussions in women. It is also important to note that these factors are not always consistent across different sports and individual cases, and more research is needed to fully understand the role of gender in concussion severity.",
