  "content": "Both experiences are important, but I would recommend prioritizing someone with experience in working with historic or old structures. Here's why:\n\n1. **Unique challenges:** Historic or old structures often come with unique challenges, such as:\n\t* Non-standard construction methods\n\t* Outdated materials\n\t* Hidden defects or surprises\n\t* Preserving historical integrity\n2. **Specialized knowledge:** A contractor or structural engineer with experience in historic or old structures will have a deeper understanding of:\n\t* How to navigate complex preservation regulations\n\t* How to work with unique materials (e.g., old wood, plaster, etc.)\n\t* How to identify and address hidden defects or surprises\n\t* How to balance preservation with modernization needs\n3. **Preservation of character:** A historic or old structure's character is often its most valuable asset. A contractor or structural engineer with experience in this area will know how to preserve the cabin's original charm while still meeting modern building codes and safety standards.\n4. **Cabin-specific expertise:** While cabin renovations are important, a contractor or structural engineer with experience in historic or old structures will likely have a deeper understanding of cabin-specific challenges, such as:\n\t* Dealing with water damage or rot\n\t* Working with rustic or irregularly shaped structures\n\t* Addressing foundation or settlement issues\n\nThat being said, it's still important to find someone with experience in cabin renovations, as they will understand the unique needs and challenges of a cabin. However, if you had to prioritize, I would suggest looking for someone with experience in historic or old structures.\n\nWhen interviewing contractors or structural engineers, be sure to ask about their experience with:\n\n* Historic or old structures\n* Cabin renovations\n* Working with similar materials (e.g., wood, stone, etc.)\n* Preserving historical integrity while meeting modern building codes\n* Balancing preservation with modernization needs\n\nBy prioritizing experience in historic or old structures, you'll be more likely to find a contractor or structural engineer who can help you preserve your cabin's unique character while ensuring it's safe and functional for years to come.",
