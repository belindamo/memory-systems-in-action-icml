What are your goals for volunteering? Are you looking to gain a broad understanding of homelessness or focus on a specific aspect, like mental health and substance abuse?\n2. What are your skills and interests? Do you have experience or training in mental health or substance abuse services, or do you have skills that could be applied in a more general organization?\n3. What kind of volunteer experience are you looking for? Do you want to work directly with clients, or do you prefer behind-the-scenes support roles?\n4. How much time and emotional energy are you able to commit?\n\nUltimately, both types of organizations can be valuable, and it's essential to choose the one that aligns with your goals, interests, and availability. You might also consider volunteering at both types of organizations to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue and find the approach that resonates with you the most."
