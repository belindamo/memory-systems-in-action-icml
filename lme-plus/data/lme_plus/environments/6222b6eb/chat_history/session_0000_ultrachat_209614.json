Without specifics or context, I am unable to determine which music video you are referring to, and therefore cannot provide a meaningful response to your question. If you could provide more details, I would be happy to try and help."

I understand that you may not have the time or inclination to provide specific details, and I apologize if my previous response was not helpful. Typically, when selecting a location for a music video, some criteria that are commonly considered include:\n\n1. Aesthetics: The location should be visually appealing and complement the song or artist's brand.\n\n2. Accessibility: The location should be easily accessible by the crew and equipment needed for the shoot.\n\n3. Cost: The location should be within budget and affordable to secure.\n\n4. Permits: The location should have the necessary permits required for filming.\n\n5. Safety: The location should be safe for the crew and performers.\n\n6. Logistics: The location should have the necessary infrastructure to support the production, such as power and internet access.\n\nI hope this provides you with some helpful insights."
