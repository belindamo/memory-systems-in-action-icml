  "content": "The client is a company that has been in business for several decades and is considering outsourcing their marketing efforts. Their current marketing team is relatively small and immature, with three people on the team. They have some contractors for website and SEO work, and the team focuses on outbound marketing efforts. Recently, one member of the team is leaving, which has prompted the consideration of outsourcing.\n\nThe client uses Oracle NetSuite as their ERP system and Sharpspring for their CRM. They have done some email campaigns and tested LinkedIn and Google ads, but have not had much success with these efforts. They are looking to focus on the insurance industry in 2022.\n\nThe client is interested in a demand generation strategy and execution to help drive more opportunities and RFPs. However, the founders are skeptical about the effectiveness of demand generation in their industry. They are looking for a team to help develop and execute a strategy that will help them generate more leads and improve their marketing efforts.",
