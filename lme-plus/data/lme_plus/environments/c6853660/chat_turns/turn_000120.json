Location:\n\t* Is the property located in a remote area or an area with limited access?\n\t* Does the property have unique environmental or geographical features?\n2. Size:\n\t* Is the total living area of the property significantly larger or smaller than the average for the area?\n\t* Does the property have multiple structures, separate living spaces, or unusual floor plans?\n3. Age:\n\t* Was the property built before 1940 or after 2020?\n\t* Does the property have unique historical or architectural features?\n4. Condition:\n\t* Does the property require extensive repairs?\n\t* Has the property been significantly altered or does it have unusual construction methods?\n5. Zoning and land use:\n\t* Is the property located in an area with unique zoning requirements or land use restrictions, such as a flood zone or designated conservation area?\n6. Market conditions:\n\t* Is the property located in an area with rapidly appreciating or declining markets?\n\t* Does the property's market have unique economic or demographic characteristics?\n\nThis is just an example of how you could develop a checklist of the characteristics of a complex property. The specific characteristics you include on the checklist will depend on the local market and the types of properties you encounter. The important thing is to create a clear, concise, and easy-to-follow checklist that includes objective criteria that can be consistently applied.",
