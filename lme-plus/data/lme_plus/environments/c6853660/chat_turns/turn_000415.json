She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \n\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it\u2019s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \n\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \n\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution.\n\nCourse 2 - Title: Female value and chastity. \n\nCourse 2 - Concepts:\u2028 \nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women \u2026 to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart \u2026 because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it\u2019s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns.\nCourse 3 - Title: Life begins with the heart. \n\nCourse 3 - Concepts:\n\nLife begins with the heart. The heart is what nourishes life, it pours life force into the body and is the provision behind all manifestation. \n\nTrue wealth is love. The heart produces plasmic etheric substance that nourishes creation. The mind is the architecture of heart\u2019s essence. The higher heart is capable of lighting up the entire body and begin the process of g e ne code-ons regeneration. \n\nThe only way to connect to source is through our own heart. Only innocence is able to pass through dimensional gateways and connect straight to source. When someone is disconnected from their own heart/innocence, they are starving for the life giving substance which is the living light plasma of love. The person becomes parasitic through connecting to other\u2019s hearts and sourcing plasma from them. Unfortunately majority of humans have been heartbroken for generations. Broken heart can become inverted and darkened which causes the mind to become predatory/manipulative in finding an outlet to plug into in order to sustain life. This is known as artificial life. Predator mind is what gaslights, uses mind control mechanisms etc. Artificial life needs \u201clove\u201d but it can not perpetuate love in a free flow between two living hearts, it can only siphon plasmic light. It is not possible to love artificial life into loving itself, it will only consume what it can and move onto the next heart.\u201d\n\nDesign a comprehensive course outline for a 3-week online course on \u2018The primordial feminine and the Heart,\u2019 based on the above ideas in quotes by Zarina, a psychic, author, and activist. The course should explore her key concepts, theories, and principles, as outlined in the above sample. Additionally, include case studies and practical exercises to enrich the learning experience.",
