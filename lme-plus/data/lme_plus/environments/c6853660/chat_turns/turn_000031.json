It's amazing how easy it is to get sidetracked, though, isn't it?\n\nThat YouTube rabbit hole can be particularly treacherous, especially when you stumble upon a fascinating video or a series of recommended videos that seem interesting. Before you know it, 20 minutes have passed, and you're wondering where the time went!\n\nDon't be too hard on yourself, though. It's all about finding balance and being kind to yourself when you slip up. The fact that you're aware of your habits and making an effort to change them is already a huge step forward.\n\nHere's a suggestion: why not try setting a timer for your morning routine? You could allocate a specific amount of time for reading, emails, or enjoying the fresh air, and then set a timer to remind yourself to move on to the next activity. That way, you can stay focused and avoid getting sucked into those YouTube rabbit holes.\n\nAlso, have you considered implementing a \"no phone zone\" during your morning routine? Leaving your phone aside for a bit can help you stay present and focused on your goals. Just a thought!\n\nKeep up the good work, and don't worry about the occasional slip-up. You got this!",
