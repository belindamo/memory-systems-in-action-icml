It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to hiking gear, especially when you're planning a trip to a beautiful but rugged place like the North Cascades.\n\nRemember to also check the weather forecast before your trip and pack accordingly. The North Cascades can be quite rainy and wet, so make sure you have the right gear to keep you dry and comfortable.\n\nIf you do decide to replace your boots, consider getting a pair that's waterproof and has good traction. You might also want to look into getting gaiters and trekking poles to help with stability and balance on the trails.\n\nLastly, don't forget to break in your new boots (if you get a new pair) before your trip to prevent blisters and discomfort.\n\nI hope you have a fantastic trip to the North Cascades, and I'm sure you'll make some amazing memories with your friends! If you have any more questions or need further advice, feel free to ask!",
