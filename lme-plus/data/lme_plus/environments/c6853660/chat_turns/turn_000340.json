  "content": "The client is in the early stages of considering outsourcing their marketing efforts. They have a relatively immature marketing and demand generation team, with three people currently on the team. They have some contractors for website and SEO work, and the team focuses on outbound marketing efforts. Recently, one member of the team is leaving, which has prompted the consideration of outsourcing. The client uses Oracle NetSuite as their ERP system and Sharpspring for their CRM. They have done some email campaigns and tested LinkedIn and Google ads, but have not had success with these efforts. They are looking to focus on the insurance industry in 2022. The client is interested in a demand generation strategy and execution to help drive more opportunities and RFPs. However, the founders are skeptical about the effectiveness of demand generation in their industry.",
