And yeah, I'm really excited to get all my photos organized and be able to easily look back on my travels and memories, like my weekend trip to visit my sister in Chicago on January 15th. Speaking of travel, do you have any recommendations for travel apps or websites that can help me plan and organize my trips better?",
