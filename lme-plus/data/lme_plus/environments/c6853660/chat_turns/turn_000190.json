  "content": "You're a great pet parent, taking care of Max's allergies from the get-go! Washing the dog bed as soon as you brought it home was a great move. It's not uncommon for new products to have chemicals or dyes that can irritate sensitive skin, so it's fantastic that you took proactive steps to ensure Max's comfort.\n\nSince you've already washed the bed, you're off to a great start! Just remember to follow the care instructions on the label, and wash the bed regularly to keep it clean and free of allergens. You may also want to consider using a mild detergent that's specifically designed for washing pet beds or toys, as these are usually gentler on fabrics and easier on pet skin.\n\nIt's also great that you scored the dog bed on sale for $30! Petco often has great deals on pet supplies, and it's awesome that you were able to snag a good bargain.\n\nHow's Max enjoying his new bed so far? Is it his new favorite spot to snooze?",
