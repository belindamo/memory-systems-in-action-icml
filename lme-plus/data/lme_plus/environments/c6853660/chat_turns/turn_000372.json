Can you please share the items you purchased at Target and their corresponding prices (before the coupon discount)? That way, I can help you categorize them into different budget categories, such as:\n\n* Household essentials\n* Personal care\n* Clothing\n* Electronics\n* Home decor\n* Food and beverages\n* Entertainment\n* Miscellaneous\n\nOnce we have the list, we can subtract the $15 discount from the total to get the final amount you paid. This will give you a clear picture of how much you spent in each category.",
