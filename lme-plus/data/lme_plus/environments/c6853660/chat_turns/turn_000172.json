  "content": "Yes, it is unfortunate that there are limited options for hiking with a wheelchair in Bled. However, it is essential to understand that accessibility is a complex issue and is often challenging to achieve in natural environments. It is not always feasible to create accessible options for every activity or natural attraction, depending on the needs of the visitors. Some natural trails may have steep inclines and rough terrain, making it inaccessible. However, the tourism industry in Bled is continually working to improve accessibility, and they have made considerable progress in recent years. Visitors with disabilities are welcomed in Bled, and the local tourist boards and operators are continuously working towards creating a more inclusive environment.",
