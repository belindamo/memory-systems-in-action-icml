And, of course, I'll chime in on your morning coffee limit question too!\n\n**Coffee Maker Recommendations:**\n\nSince you're open to exploring other options, I'll suggest a few popular types of coffee makers:\n\n1. **Drip Coffee Makers:** If you're happy with your current drip coffee maker, you might consider upgrading to a newer model with more features, such as:\n\t* **Bonavita BV1900TS:** A highly-rated, affordable, and compact drip coffee maker with a thermal carafe.\n\t* **Cuisinart DCC-3200:** A feature-rich drip coffee maker with a large 14-cup carafe, programmable timer, and adjustable brew strength.\n2. **Single-Serve Coffee Makers:** Great for convenience and variety:\n\t* **Nespresso Inissia:** A compact, affordable, and stylish single-serve coffee maker with a wide range of coffee capsules available.\n\t* **Keurig K-Elite:** A popular single-serve coffee maker with a large 40-oz water reservoir and compatibility with a variety of K-cup pods.\n3. **French Press Coffee Makers:** Rich, full-bodied coffee with a more manual approach:\n\t* **Bodum Chambord:** A classic, elegant French press coffee maker with a large 8-cup capacity and heat-resistant glass beaker.\n4. **Pour-Over Coffee Makers:** A manual, artisanal brewing method:\n\t* **Chemex Pour-Over:** A popular, iconic pour-over coffee maker with a glass container and paper filters.\n5. **Espresso Machines:** For a more intense coffee experience:\n\t* **Nespresso Expert:** A compact, automatic espresso machine with a built-in milk frother and capsule system.\n\n**Increasing Your Morning Coffee Limit:**\n\nAs for your question about changing your morning coffee limit to two cups, it's ultimately up to you and your personal caffeine sensitivity. The American Heart Association recommends that adults limit their daily coffee consumption to 300-400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine, which is approximately 2-3 cups of brewed coffee per day.\n\nIf you're considering increasing your morning coffee intake, you might want to:\n\n* Start with a smaller increase, such as an extra half cup, to see how your body reacts.\n* Monitor your caffeine sensitivity and adjust your intake accordingly.\n* Be mindful of other sources of caffeine in your diet, such as tea, chocolate, or energy drinks.\n\nRemember, it's essential to listen to your body and adjust your coffee consumption based on how you feel.\n\nI hope this helps you in your coffee maker search and caffeine deliberations!",
