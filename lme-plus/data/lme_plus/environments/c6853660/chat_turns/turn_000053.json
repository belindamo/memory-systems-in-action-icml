Here are some yoga poses that you can incorporate into your morning routine:\n\n**Back-Strengthening Poses:**\n\n1. **Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)**: Lie on your stomach with your hands under your shoulders. Inhale, press your palms into the ground, and lift your chest and head off the mat. Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n2. **Cat-Cow Pose (Marjaryasana-Bitilasana)**: Start on your hands and knees. Inhale, arch your back, and lift your tailbone (cat pose). Exhale, round your back, and tuck your chin to your chest (cow pose). Repeat for 5-10 breaths.\n3. **Sphinx Pose (Salamba Bhujangasana)**: Lie on your stomach with your forearms on the ground and lift your chest and head off the mat. Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n\n**Core-Strengthening Poses:**\n\n1. **Boat Pose (Paripurna Navasana)**: Sit with your legs crossed and engage your core. Lift your chest and balance on your seat bones. Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n2. **Plank Pose (Phalakasana)**: Start in a high push-up position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Engage your core and hold for 5-10 breaths.\n3. **Side Plank Pose (Vasisthasana)**: Lie on your side with your feet stacked and hands under your shoulders. Lift your hips off the ground and balance on your forearm and foot. Hold for 5-10 breaths on each side.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Engage your core**: Activate your core muscles by drawing your navel towards your spine and maintaining a slight pelvic tilt.\n2. **Breathe deeply**: Focus on deep, controlled breathing to help you maintain the poses and engage your muscles.\n3. **Modify or rest**: If you're new to yoga or experiencing discomfort, modify the poses or rest in Child's Pose (Balasana) or Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana).\n4. **Sequence wisely**: Incorporate these poses into your morning yoga routine, perhaps after a gentle warm-up sequence and before moving into more dynamic flows.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and honor its limitations. Happy practicing!",
