  "content": "One example of a player whose experience in the AHL was instrumental to their success in the NHL is Jonathan Marchessault. Marchessault played in the AHL from 2011 to 2016, where he developed his skills and gained valuable experience at the professional level. During his time in the AHL, Marchessault was named to the All-Rookie Team in 2012, and was a three-time AHL All-Star.\n\nMarchessault's success in the AHL led to him being signed by the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2014. He played in 45 games for the Lightning during the 2015-16 season, but it wasn't until he was picked up by the Vegas Golden Knights in the 2017 expansion draft that he really shone. Marchessault scored 75 points in his first season with the Golden Knights and played a key role in the team's unexpected run to the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nMarchessault's time in the AHL not only helped him develop his skills and gain experience at the professional level, but it also gave him the confidence and mindset needed to succeed in the NHL. Without his time in the AHL, it's unclear if Marchessault would have been able to make the impact he did in the NHL.",
