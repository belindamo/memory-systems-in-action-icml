  "content": "Jacob has another dream of the spirits holding a council meeting. This time, there's tension in the air as everyone argues, clearly stressed. Jacob hears the name \"Lorelei\" alongside several others that seem to be other evil spirits. The power in the room is even stronger now as the spirits are anxious and angry. He tries not to lose consciousness and to understand what they're saying. Let's write that whole scene with details and dialogue, and include descriptions of some of the other spirits Jacob sees. (They don't all have to look human.)",
