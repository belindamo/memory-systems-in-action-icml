This could include the ability to automatically deduct leave time from an employee's attendance record.\n2. Customizable reporting: The system should allow for the customization of reports to suit the specific needs of the organization. This could include the ability to generate reports based on different criteria, such as leave type, employee group, or time period.\n3. Multi-language support: If the organization has employees who speak different languages, the system should be able to support multiple languages to ensure that all employees have equal access to leave management tools.\n4. Employee self-service tools: In addition to the self-service portal mentioned earlier, the system should include a range of tools to allow employees to manage their leave independently. This could include the ability to view and update personal leave information, request leave, and track leave balances.\n5. Leave calendar: The system should provide a calendar view of leave requests and approvals to allow for easy scheduling and planning. This calendar should be accessible to both employees and managers.\n6. Leave request approval delegation: The system should allow managers to delegate leave request approval authority to other individuals or groups as needed. This will help to ensure that leave requests are promptly reviewed and approved even if the manager is not available.\n7. Leave accrual caps: The system should allow for the setting of leave accrual caps to ensure that employees do not accrue an excessive amount of leave. This could include the ability to set caps based on leave type or employee group.",
