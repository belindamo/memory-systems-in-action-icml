  "content": "Rearranging the decorations in your 20-gallon community tank sounds like a great idea! Creating an attractive aquascape can enhance the overall aesthetic of your tank and provide a more engaging environment for your fish. Here are some general tips to help you create a visually appealing layout:\n\n1. **Balance and Symmetry**: Aim for balance and symmetry in your aquascape. Imagine dividing your tank into thirds both horizontally and vertically. Place decorations and plants along these lines to create a sense of harmony.\n2. **Create a Focal Point**: Designate a central area of interest, like a statement piece of driftwood or a showy plant, to draw the viewer's attention. This focal point will help guide the viewer's eye around the tank.\n3. **Layering**: Create depth by layering different levels of decorations, plants, and substrate. This will add visual interest and create hiding places for your fish.\n4. **Contrast**: Mix different textures, colors, and shapes to create contrast. For example, pair smooth rocks with rough driftwood or combine bright plants with darker substrate.\n5. **Scale**: Ensure decorations are proportional to the size of your tank and fish. Avoid overwhelming the space with too many large decorations or plants.\n6. **Open Swimming Space**: Leave enough open swimming space for your fish to move around comfortably. A good rule of thumb is to reserve at least 30-40% of the tank's volume for swimming space.\n7. **Hide and Seek**: Incorporate hiding places and visual barriers to create a sense of security for your fish. This will encourage them to explore and interact with their environment.\n8. **Flow and Movement**: Consider the direction of water flow and how it will affect the layout. You can use decorations to create areas of calm water or direct the flow to create movement and visual interest.\n9. **Plant Placement**: Place plants in a way that creates movement and flow. You can create a sense of depth by placing taller plants towards the back and shorter ones towards the front.\n10. **Experiment and Adjust**: Don't be afraid to try out different layouts and make adjustments as needed. Observe how your fish interact with the environment and make changes accordingly.\n\nConsidering your school of neon tetras, you might want to create a layout that incorporates:\n\n* Open swimming spaces for them to dart and school together\n* Plants or decorations with narrow openings for them to swim through\n* A few hiding places, like small caves or plants with dense foliage, to provide a sense of security\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with your aquascape!
