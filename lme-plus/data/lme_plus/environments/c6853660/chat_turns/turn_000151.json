  "content": "I'm glad I have a rough idea of the timeline and costs now. I'm thinking of building a farmhouse that's around 3,500 square feet with 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. Do you think it's possible to build it within a budget of $450,000 to $500,000? And since I've had experience with renting out my old farmhouse, I'm wondering if I should consider building a separate in-law suite or a guest house on the property. What are the pros and cons of having a separate living space on the same property?",
