  "content": "Warming up before a tennis lesson is crucial to prepare your body for physical activity, prevent injuries, and get the most out of your lesson. Here's a general warm-up routine you can follow:\n\n**Warm-up Routine (15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Light Cardio (5 minutes)**: Jog around the court, jumping jacks, or cycling to get your heart rate up and loosen your muscles.\n2. **Dynamic Stretching (5 minutes)**: Move your joints through a range of motions, such as:\n\t* Leg swings (front and back, side to side)\n\t* Arm circles (forward and backward)\n\t* Hip circles (clockwise and counterclockwise)\n\t* Calf raises\n\t* Toe touches\n3. **Tennis-Specific Movements (5 minutes)**: Mimic tennis movements to prepare your muscles for the upcoming lesson:\n\t* Forehand and backhand swings (without a ball)\n\t* Volleys (at the net)\n\t* Lateral shuffling (side to side)\n\t* Short sprints (up to 10-15 feet)\n4. **Ball Bouncing and Catching (5 minutes)**: Bounce a ball on your racket and catch it to improve hand-eye coordination and get comfortable with the ball's bounce.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Arrive at the court at least 15-20 minutes before your lesson to allow time for warm-up.\n* Wear comfortable clothing and shoes, and bring water to stay hydrated.\n* If you have any specific injuries or concerns, adjust your warm-up routine accordingly.\n* Your coach or instructor may also have specific warm-up exercises or routines they prefer, so be sure to ask if they have any recommendations.\n\nRemember to pace yourself during the warm-up and don't exhaust yourself before the lesson. You want to be ready to focus on technique and learning during your lesson!\n\nHope this helps, and have a great tennis lesson!",
