  "content": "Topsail Island is a fantastic choice for a lunch break and a quick beach stroll. The island has a lot to offer, and it's a great way to break up the drive to Tybee Island.\n\nYou're right, the seafood on Topsail Island is amazing, and you'll find plenty of restaurants serving up fresh catches of the day. Some popular spots include The Fish Factory, The Shrimp Haus, and The Beach Shop & Grill. Be sure to try some of the local specialties, like shrimp and grits or fish tacos.\n\nAfter lunch, take a short walk on the beach to stretch your legs and enjoy the ocean views. The beaches on Topsail Island are beautiful and relatively quiet, even during peak season. You might even spot some surfers catching waves or dolphins playing in the surf.\n\nAs you mentioned, Topsail Island is not too far out of the way, so it won't add too much time to your overall trip. From the Outer Banks, it's about a 2-hour drive to Topsail Island, and then another 4-5 hours to Tybee Island from there. So, you'll still have plenty of time to enjoy the rest of your drive and arrive at your destination in the afternoon.\n\nJust a tip: Be sure to check the tide times and plan your beach walk accordingly. The beaches on Topsail Island can get narrow during high tide, so you'll want to time your visit to coincide with low tide for the best experience.\n\nEnjoy your stop on Topsail Island, and I'm sure you'll have a great time stretching your legs and refueling for the rest of your drive to Tybee Island!",
