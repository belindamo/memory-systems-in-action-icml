  "content": "Most yoga apps offer a free trial period to let you experience their content and features before committing to a subscription. The length of the free trial varies from app to app, but here's a general idea of what you can expect:\n\n1. **YogaGlo**: 15-day free trial\n2. **Alo Moves**: 14-day free trial\n3. **Gaia**: 7-day free trial (but they often offer a 30-day free trial promotion, so keep an eye on their website)\n4. **Do You Yoga**: 14-day free trial\n5. **Pocket Yoga**: No free trial, but they offer a one-time free download of their app with limited content. You can try it out and then upgrade to a subscription for full access.\n6. **Cody**: 14-day free trial\n7. **Omstars**: 7-day free trial\n\nDuring the free trial, you'll typically have access to the same features and content as a paid subscriber. This includes:\n\n* Access to the full library of classes and tutorials\n* Ability to create custom playlists and sequences\n* Access to meditation and breathing exercises\n* Progress tracking and analytics\n* Offline access to classes (for most apps)\n\nKeep in mind that some apps might have limitations during the free trial, such as limited access to certain classes or features. Be sure to review the terms and conditions before signing up.\n\nWhen the free trial ends, you'll be prompted to subscribe to continue using the app. If you don't want to continue, simply cancel your subscription before the trial ends, and you won't be charged.\n\nRemember, the free trial is an excellent opportunity to explore the app, try out different classes and instructors, and see if the app fits your yoga style and goals.",
