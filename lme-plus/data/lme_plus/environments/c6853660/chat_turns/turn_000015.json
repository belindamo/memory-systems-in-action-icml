  "content": "If the Sagebrush disappears, it would have a significant impact on the wildlife species that rely on it for survival. For instance, Sage-Grouse depend on Sagebrush as a food source and for cover during winter months, while Pygmy Rabbits use Sagebrush as a primary food source and for cover from predators. Without Sagebrush, these animals would struggle to find adequate food and shelter, and their populations could decline. Additionally, Sagebrush also plays a critical role in maintaining the ecosystem's soil and water quality by reducing erosion and promoting nutrient cycling. Losing Sagebrush would have a domino effect on the entire ecosystem, including its other plant, animal, and insect species.",
