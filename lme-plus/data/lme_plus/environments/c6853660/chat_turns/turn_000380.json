Here are some specific tips to help you save money on your menu:\n\n1. **Buy pasta in bulk**: Since you're making pasta with meat sauce, consider buying a large package of pasta (like 12-16 pounds) which can be used for future meals as well.\n2. **Opt for ground beef or ground turkey**: Instead of using expensive ground beef or steak, consider using ground turkey or a combination of ground beef and turkey. It's a more affordable option and still packs plenty of flavor.\n3. **Roasted vegetables are a great choice**: Roasted vegetables are not only delicious, but they're also affordable. Consider buying carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, and onions in bulk, which are all relatively inexpensive.\n4. **Make your own salad dressing**: Instead of buying expensive salad dressing, make your own vinaigrette using olive oil, vinegar, and spices. You can also use a simple recipe like a classic green salad with just lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers.\n5. **Shop for seasonal produce**: Since you're planning to serve roasted vegetables, try to shop for produce that's in season. This will not only be cheaper but also taste better.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of what you might need for your menu:\n\n* Pasta: 1-2 pounds (depending on serving size) - $1.50-$3.00\n* Ground beef or turkey: 1-2 pounds - $3.00-$6.00\n* Canned tomatoes: 2-3 cans - $2.00-$3.00\n* Roasted vegetables: 2-3 bunches of carrots, 2-3 bell peppers, 2-3 zucchinis - $5.00-$7.00\n* Salad ingredients: 2-3 heads of lettuce, 2-3 tomatoes, 1-2 cucumbers - $3.00-$5.00\n* Salad dressing: Homemade vinaigrette - $0.50-$1.00 (depending on ingredients)\n* Beverages: Soft drinks, water, or iced tea - $5.00-$10.00 (depending on options)\n\nTotal estimated cost: $20.00-$40.00\n\nThis should give you a rough idea of what to expect. Keep in mind that prices may vary depending on your location and the specific stores you shop at.\n\nRemember, the key to saving money is to plan ahead, buy in bulk, and keep your menu simple. You can also consider asking your guests to bring a side dish or dessert to share, which can help reduce your overall cost.\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any other questions or concerns about planning your dinner party?",
