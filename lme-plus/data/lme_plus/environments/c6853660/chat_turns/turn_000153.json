  "content": "I think building a 3,500 sqft farmhouse within my budget is doable, but I need to be mindful of the compromises I'll have to make. Regarding the separate in-law suite or guest house, I like the idea of having a separate living space, but I'm concerned about the additional costs and maintenance. Can you tell me more about the potential rental income I could generate from a separate living space? How much could I realistically expect to earn per month, and what are some popular amenities that tenants look for in a guest house or in-law suite?",
