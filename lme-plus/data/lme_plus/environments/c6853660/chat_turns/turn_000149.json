  "content": "I'm looking to get some advice on building a farmhouse on a 5-acre property I bought a few months ago. I've been working with an architect to finalize the plans, but I'm not sure about the timeline and budget for the project. Can you give me a rough estimate of how long it takes to build a farmhouse and what kind of costs I should expect? By the way, I've had some experience with property management lately, having just rented out my old farmhouse to a family of four about a month ago, so I'm hoping that experience will come in handy with this new project.",
