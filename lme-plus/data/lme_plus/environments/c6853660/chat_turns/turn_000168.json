  "content": "I'm sorry for the confusion. To the best of my knowledge, there are no rental services in Bled that provide off-road wheelchairs for hiking. However, it might be helpful to check with the Pletna Boat company or other local tour operators to ask if they have any recommendations for rental equipment or other activities that might be appropriate for your specific abilities. They may be able to provide suggestions or point you in the direction of resources that can help. Additionally, it might be necessary to bring your own off-road wheelchair or speaking with travel agents familiar with accessible travel to arrange for a local guide with experience in helping to tackle the terrain in the Bled area.",
