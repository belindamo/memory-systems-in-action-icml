  "content": "My living room is pretty modern, with a neutral color scheme. The wall where I'm looking to add decor is a decent size, maybe about 10-12 feet wide. As for the type of art or decor, I'm pretty open to anything, but I think something that complements the TV would be great. Oh, and I had a get-together recently with 10 friends over to watch some football games, and the room felt pretty comfortable even with all of us in there, so something that won't take up too much space would be ideal.",
