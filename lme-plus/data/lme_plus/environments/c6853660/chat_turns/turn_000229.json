Considering you're open to different types of decor, I'll suggest a few ideas that might complement your TV and fit your space constraints:\n\n1. **Geometric Pattern Art**: A geometric pattern art piece can add visual interest to the wall without overwhelming the space. You can choose a piece with a modern, abstract design that resonates with your neutral color scheme. This type of art can create a sense of movement and energy in the room.\n2. **LED Light Installation**: A sleek LED light installation can be a stunning addition to your modern living room. You can choose a design that complements the TV's sleekness, and it won't take up much physical space. Plus, it can add ambiance to the room during movie nights or gatherings.\n3. **Floating Shelves with Decor**: A set of floating shelves can provide a modern, minimalist look while adding some visual interest to the wall. You can display decorative objects, such as vases, sculptures, or even a few favorite books, to add some personality to the space.\n4. **Metal Wall Art**: A metal wall art piece can bring a touch of industrial chic to your modern living room.
