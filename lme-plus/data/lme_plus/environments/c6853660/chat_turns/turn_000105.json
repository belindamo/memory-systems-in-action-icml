  "content": "The Fish Factory is a popular spot for seafood lovers, and their platters are definitely a hit with visitors.\n\nAs for outdoor seating with ocean views, I have some good news and some bad news. The bad news is that The Fish Factory doesn't have outdoor seating with direct ocean views. The restaurant is located on the sound side of the island, so while you won't have ocean views, you'll still be able to enjoy the scenic views of the marshes and the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\nThe good news is that The Fish Factory does have a large outdoor deck area where you can enjoy your meal. The deck is covered, so you'll be protected from the sun or any unexpected rain showers. While you won't have ocean views, the deck area is still a great spot to relax and take in the laid-back atmosphere of the island.\n\nIf you're really set on having ocean views with your lunch, you might consider checking out some other restaurants on the island that have outdoor seating with ocean views. One option could be the Ocean's Edge Restaurant at the Topsail Island Beach Club. They have a large outdoor deck with stunning ocean views, and their menu features a variety of seafood options, including platters and sandwiches.\n\nHowever, if you're still interested in trying The Fish Factory, I'd recommend giving them a call ahead of time to see if they have any outdoor seating available. They might have some tables with partial views of the marshes or the waterway, which could still be a nice spot to enjoy your meal.\n\nHope this helps, and I'm sure you'll find a great spot to enjoy your lunch on Topsail Island!",
