  "content": "That's helpful context! With a new highway being built, the area is likely to see increased development and growth, which can drive up land values. Here are some general observations about land prices in rural areas:\n\n1. **Proximity to infrastructure**: Being near a new highway can significantly increase the value of the land, as it provides easy access to markets, employment opportunities, and amenities.\n2. **Rural land prices**: In general, rural land prices tend to be lower than those in urban areas. However, prices can vary widely depending on factors like the quality of the land, zoning, and local demand.\n3. **Acreage and zoning**: Since you didn't mention the exact size of the plot, I'll assume it's a relatively small parcel (less than 10 acres). In rural areas, smaller plots of land are often more valuable than larger ones, especially if they're zoned for residential or commercial use.\n\nTo get a better sense of the market, I'd like to ask a few more questions:\n\n1. **What's the exact size of the plot**? Is it a specific number of acres or square feet?\n2. **What's the zoning designation** for the land? Is it zoned for single-family residential, commercial, agricultural, or something else?\n3. **Are there any other developments or projects** planned or underway in the surrounding area? This could include new housing developments, commercial projects, or infrastructure improvements.\n4. **What's the local economy like**? Is the area experiencing growth, or is it relatively stable?\n\nWith this information, I can provide more specific guidance on whether the asking price of $120,000 seems reasonable.\n\nKeep in mind that it's always a good idea to research recent land sales in the area to get a sense of the market. You can:\n\n* Check online real estate platforms like Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com for recent land sales in your area.\n* Contact local real estate agents or appraisal companies to ask about recent sales data.\n* Visit your county assessor's office or website to access information on property values and sales data.\n\nBy doing your research and considering the factors mentioned above, you'll be better equipped to negotiate a fair price or decide if the asking price is reasonable.",
