These areas are crucial for overall strength, stability, and posture. Here are some exercises you can add to your routine:\n\n**Back Exercises:**\n\n1. **Bent-Over Rows**: Hold dumbbells with your palms facing towards your body. Bend your knees slightly and lean forward at the hips, keeping your back straight. Let your arms hang straight down from your shoulders, then lift the dumbbells to your sides until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle. Lower and repeat.\n2. **Lat Pullovers**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell over your chest with both hands. Lower the dumbbell behind your head, keeping your arms straight, then lift it back up to the starting position.\n3. **Deadlifts**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Keep your back straight, engage your core, and lift the dumbbells off the ground, keeping them close to your legs. Stand up straight, squeezing your glutes and pushing your hips back. Lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.\n\n**Core Exercises:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Start in a push-up position, with your hands shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core, squeeze your glutes, and hold for 30-60 seconds.\n2. **Russian twists**: Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat. Lean back slightly and lift your feet off the ground. Hold a dumbbell or weight plate with both hands.

Lift your legs off the ground, keeping them straight, and hold for a second. Lower your legs back down to the starting position.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Start with lighter weights**: Begin with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you build strength and endurance.\n2. **Focus on proper form**: Ensure you're performing the exercises correctly to avoid injury and target the correct muscles.\n3. **Incorporate variations**: Mix up your routine by trying different variations of these exercises, such as using different grip positions or angles.\n4. **Don't forget to stretch**: Make sure to stretch your back and core muscles after your workout to prevent soreness and improve flexibility.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust your routine as needed.
