Here are some yoga poses that can help:\n\n**Hamstring Stretching Poses:**\n\n1. **Forward Fold (Uttanasana)**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, then fold forward, reaching for your toes or shins. Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n2. **Seated Forward Fold (Paschimottanasana)**: Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you. Inhale, lengthen your spine, and exhale, fold forward, reaching for your toes or shins. Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n3. **Hamstring Stretch (Prasarita Padottanasana)**: Stand with your feet wide apart, then bend forward, reaching for your ankles or calves. Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n\n**Hip Flexor Stretching Poses:**\n\n1. **Lizard Pose (Utthan Pristhasana)**: Start on your hands and knees. Step your right foot forward and place your left knee on the ground. Lean forward, stretching your left hip flexor. Hold for 5-10 breaths, then switch sides.\n2. **Pigeon Pose (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana)**: Start on your hands and knees. Bring your right knee forward and place your ankle in front of your left knee. Lower your torso, stretching your left hip flexor. Hold for 5-10 breaths, then switch sides.\n3. **Supta Baddha Konasana (Reclined Bound Angle Pose)**: Lie on your back with your legs bent and feet together. Let your knees fall apart, stretching your hip flexors. Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Breathe deeply**: Focus on deep, controlled breathing to help you relax and lengthen your muscles.\n2. **Hold for longer**: Hold each pose for 5-10 breaths to allow your muscles to relax and lengthen.\n3. **Don't bounce**: Avoid bouncing or forcing your way into a stretch, as this can cause injury. Instead, gently ease into the pose and hold.\n4. **Practice regularly**: Consistency is key when it comes to improving flexibility. Try to practice these poses regularly, ideally 2-3 times a week.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and modify or come out of the pose if you experience any discomfort or pain. Happy stretching!",
