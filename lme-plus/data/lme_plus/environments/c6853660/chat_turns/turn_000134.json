And, of course, I'd be happy to help you with sweetener recommendations that dissolve well in coffee.\n\n**Sweetener Options that Dissolve Well in Coffee:**\n\n1. **Stevia:** A popular sugar substitute, stevia is 200-300 times sweeter than sugar, so use it sparingly. Look for a high-quality, pure stevia extract that's specifically designed for coffee.\n2. **Honey:** A natural sweetener with antibacterial properties, honey can add a rich flavor to your coffee. Choose a high-quality, raw honey that's minimally processed.\n3. **Monk Fruit Sweetener:** A natural sweetener made from a type of melon, monk fruit sweetener is 150-200 times sweeter than sugar. It's calorie-free and doesn't raise blood sugar levels.\n4. **Erythritol:** A sugar substitute that's zero-calorie and doesn't raise blood sugar levels, erythritol is a popular choice for low-carb diets. It dissolves well in coffee and has a clean, sweet taste.\n5. **Coconut Sugar:** A lower-glycemic sweetener with a rich, caramel-like flavor, coconut sugar can add depth to your coffee. Use it sparingly, as it's still a sugar.\n6. **Yacon Syrup:** A sweetener made from the root of the yacon plant, yacon syrup is low on the glycemic index and contains prebiotic fibers. It has a rich, molasses-like flavor.\n\n**Tips for Using Sweeteners in Coffee:**\n\n1. **Start with a small amount:** Taste your coffee as you go and adjust the sweetness to your liking.\n2. **Choose a sweetener that complements your coffee:** If you're using a darker roast, a richer sweetener like honey or coconut sugar might work well. For lighter roasts, a cleaner sweetener like stevia or erythritol might be a better fit.\n3. **Experiment with ratios:** Find the perfect balance of sweetener to coffee by adjusting the ratio to your taste.\n4. **Consider the brewing method:** Some sweeteners might not dissolve as well in certain brewing methods. For example, stevia can be tricky to dissolve in cold brew coffee.\n\n**Increasing Your Morning Coffee Limit:**\n\nRemember to monitor your body's response to the increased caffeine intake and adjust your limit accordingly. It's also essential to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\n\nI hope this helps you in your sweetener exploration, and I'm excited to hear about your French press adventures!",
