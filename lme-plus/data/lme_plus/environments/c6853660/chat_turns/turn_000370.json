  "content": "It is true that psychoanalytic theory was historically associated with a certain elite group of people, such as the wealthy and highly educated. However, in recent years, efforts have been made to make psychoanalytic theory more accessible and relevant to a wider range of people. This includes efforts to increase diversity in the field, expand access to psychoanalytic training and education programs, and promote the application of psychoanalytic theory beyond clinical settings. It's important to ensure that psychoanalytic theory remains relevant and accessible to all individuals and communities, regardless of their social or economic status. As the field continues to evolve and expand in new directions, it's important that this accessibility and diversity remain a priority.",
