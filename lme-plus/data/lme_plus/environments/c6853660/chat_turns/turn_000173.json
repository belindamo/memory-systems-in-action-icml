  "content": "I understand that accessibility can be a complex issue, but it's frustrating that more isn't being done for people with disabilities. It's not like accessibility is a new concept, and it's disappointing that people with disabilities still face barriers when it comes to accessing outdoor activities. Can you suggest anything that local authorities or businesses could do to improve accessibility in Bled?",
