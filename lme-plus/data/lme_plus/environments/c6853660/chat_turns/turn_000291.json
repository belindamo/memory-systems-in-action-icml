It's always exciting to see a tank come together, and with the addition of Dwarf Hairgrass, driftwood, and ceramic decorations, your tank is going to look amazing! Your neon tetras will love all the new hiding places and swimming areas.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with your tank design. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance. And don't forget to enjoy the process and observe your fish as they explore their new environment!\n\nGood luck, and happy aquarium-keeping!",
