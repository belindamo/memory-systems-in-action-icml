  "content": "Jacob stood in the vast chamber, surrounded by an innumerable amount of spirits. They were paired up, each one whispering intently to the other, as if they were all part of a grand council. The sound was deafening, a mixture of countless voices, whispers, and murmurs.\n\nJacob tried to focus, to listen to what they were discussing, but the sheer power of the room was almost too much to bear. He could feel it, like a physical force pressing in on him from all sides. He took a deep breath and pushed forward, looking for Eri and Racita among the spirits.\n\nHe searched for what felt like an eternity, scanning the crowd for any sign of his friends. Then, suddenly, he spotted them - Eri and Racita were together, their heads bent low as they whispered to one another.\n\nJacob made his way over to them, struggling against the waves of energy that threatened to push him back. When he finally reached them, he could see the focus and determination in their eyes, and he knew they were working on something important.\n\n\"Eri, Racita,\" he called out, trying to get their attention.\n\nEri looked up, her eyes shining with recognition. \"Jacob,\" she said, \"how did you find us?\"\n\n\"I had a dream,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"I saw all of you here, discussing something. What's going on?\"\n\n\"This is a council meeting,\" Racita said, her voice echoing in the massive room. \"We gather to discuss the state of the universes, to make plans and keep everything in balance.\"\n\n\"It's... it's incredible,\" Jacob said, struggling to find the right words. \"The sheer power in this room, I've never felt anything like it.\"\n\n\"You get used to it,\" Eri said with a small smile. \"But it can be overwhelming, especially if you're not used to it.\"\n\n\"I want to stay,\" Jacob said, looking at the spirits around him. \"I want to learn, to understand.\"\n\n\"You will,\" Racita said, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder. \"In time, you will.\"\n\nAnd with that, Jacob woke up, the dream fading away into the morning light. But the memory of the council meeting stayed with him, a reminder of the incredible power and majesty of the spirits, and the role they played in keeping everything in balance.",
