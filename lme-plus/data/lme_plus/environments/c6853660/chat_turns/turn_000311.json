If you're planning to build a single-family home, you'll need to explore the possibility of obtaining a variance, as you mentioned.\n\nA variance is an exception to the existing zoning ordinance, and it allows you to use the land in a way that's not permitted by the current zoning designation. However, it's not a guarantee, and you'll need to make a strong case to the local authorities to justify the variance.\n\nHere are some factors to consider when pursuing a variance:\n\n1. **Neighborhood compatibility**: Will your proposed use (building a single-family home) be compatible with the surrounding agricultural uses?\n2. **Environmental impact**: Will your project harm the environment or nearby natural resources?\n3. **Traffic and access**: Will your project generate additional traffic, and is the existing infrastructure sufficient to support it?\n4. **Community character**: Will your project alter the character of the neighborhood or community?\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a variance, you may want to:\n\n1. **Consult with local authorities**: Discuss your plans with the local planning department, zoning board, and other relevant authorities to understand their concerns and requirements.\n2. **Hire a professional**: Engage a land-use attorney, planner, or consultant who's familiar with local regulations and can guide you through the process.\n3. **Provide detailed plans**: Submit a comprehensive plan, including architectural designs, environmental impact assessments, and traffic studies, to demonstrate that your project is well-thought-out and responsible.\n4. **Engage with the community**: Attend public hearings, meet with neighbors, and address any concerns they may have to build support for your project.\n\nAssuming you're able to obtain a variance, you should factor in the costs and time associated with the process. This may include:\n\n1. **Application fees**: You'll need to pay fees for submitting your variance application, which can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.\n2. **Professional fees**: You may need to hire experts, such as attorneys, engineers, and consultants, to help with the application process.\n3. **Time and effort**: The variance process can take several months to a year or more, depending on the complexity of your case and the local authorities' workload.\n\nNow, considering the asking price of $120,000, you should factor in the costs and uncertainties associated with obtaining a variance. You may want to negotiate with the seller or consider other properties that are already zoned for residential use.\n\nHow do you plan to approach the variance process, and have you considered alternative options?",
