      "content": "I'm planning a trip to Tokyo, Japan in late November and I'm trying to decide on the best area to stay. I've narrowed it down to Shinjuku, but I'm not sure if it's too busy or noisy. I spent a weekend in New York City about a month ago, and while it was exciting, I'm worried Shinjuku might be similar. Can you tell me more about the neighborhood and what I can expect?"
