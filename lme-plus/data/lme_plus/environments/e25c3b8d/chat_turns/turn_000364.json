Decide on the location and size of your garden. Choose a spot that receives adequate sunlight and has good quality soil.\n\n2. Make a plan for your garden. Determine what kind of plants you want to grow and how much space they will require. Decide on a layout for your garden beds, pathways, and any other features you want to include.\n\n3. Prepare the soil. Remove any weeds, rocks, or other debris from the area. Test the soil pH and nutrient levels and make any necessary adjustments. Till the soil to a depth of 12-18 inches.\n\n4. Add compost and other organic matter to the soil. This will improve soil fertility and help retain moisture.\n\n5. Install any features or structures you want to include, such as raised garden beds or trellises.\n\n6. Plant your seeds or seedlings according to your plan.
