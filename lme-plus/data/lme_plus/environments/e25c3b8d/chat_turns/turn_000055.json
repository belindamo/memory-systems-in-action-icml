  "content": "The seaside cliffs in Ireland were formed by millions of years of erosion, weathering, and tectonic activity. They are mainly made up of sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone and shale, that were deposited over time.\n\nOne of the unique features of the Irish cliffs is their height. For example, the Cliffs of Moher reach up to 214 meters above sea level. This is because the cliffs were formed in areas with high amounts of tectonic activity, which pushed the rock layers upwards.\n\nAnother unique feature is the variety of geological formations present. In some areas, the cliffs are composed of layered rock formations that showcase the different types of sedimentary rocks and the processes that formed them. In other areas, the cliffs are made up of distinct rock types that form easily recognizable features, such as the hexagonal basalt columns at the Giant's Causeway.\n\nFinally, the cliffs in Ireland are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna that have adapted to survive in the harsh coastal environment. Some notable examples include seabirds such as gannets and puffins, as well as plants such as sea thrift and sea campion.",
