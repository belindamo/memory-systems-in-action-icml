And starting your day with a croissant and cheese from a local caf\u00e9 is the perfect way to experience the city like a local.\n\nIf you're looking for a similar experience in another city, I think Vienna would be an excellent choice. Vienna is famous for its coffee culture, and you'll find plenty of cozy cafes serving delicious pastries and coffee throughout the city. You could start your day with a traditional Viennese breakfast, featuring a croissant-like pastry called a \"Kipferl,\" accompanied by a strong coffee and a glass of orange juice.\n\nVienna's hostel scene is also quite developed, with many options available in the city center. You could stay in a hostel in the Innere Stadt (Inner City) district, which is similar to Paris's Latin Quarter in terms of its historic charm and lively atmosphere.\n\nIn terms of exploring the city, Vienna has plenty of famous landmarks to visit, including the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, St. Stephen's Cathedral, and the Hofburg Palace. You could also stroll through the picturesque streets of the Innere Stadt, visit the Naschmarkt food market, or take a walk along the Danube Canal.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Vienna has a slightly more formal atmosphere than Paris, so you may want to dress up a bit more when visiting cafes and restaurants. However, the city is still very welcoming to solo travelers, and you'll find plenty of English speakers to help you navigate.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Vienna, I'd be happy to provide more recommendations for cafes, hostels, and things to do. Just let me know!",
