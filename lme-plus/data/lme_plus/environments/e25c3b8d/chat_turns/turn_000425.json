  "content": "eBird Mobile is an excellent app for tracking sightings and logging notes, but it doesn't have a built-in feature for identifying birds by their calls. eBird's main focus is on tracking bird sightings and contributing to citizen science, rather than bird identification.\n\nHowever, I have some good news! There are a few apps that can help you identify birds by their calls, and some of them integrate with eBird or offer similar tracking features. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Merlin Bird ID**: As I mentioned earlier, Merlin is an excellent app for bird identification, and it includes a feature called \"Sound ID\" that can help you identify birds by their calls. You can record a bird's call or upload an audio file, and Merlin's AI will try to match it to a species. Merlin also integrates with eBird, so you can easily submit your sightings to eBird from within the app.\n2. **iBird Pro**: iBird Pro has an extensive library of bird calls, and you can use the \"Bird Call\" feature to identify birds by their vocalizations. You can listen to calls, compare similar species, and even record your own observations. iBird Pro also allows you to track your sightings and keep a life list.\n3. **Song Sleuth**: Song Sleuth is a unique app that focuses specifically on bird call identification. You can record a bird's call, and the app's AI will try to match it to a species. Song Sleuth also includes a \"Sightings\" feature, where you can log your observations and notes.\n4. **BirdGenie**: BirdGenie is another app that uses AI to identify birds by their calls. You can record a bird's call, and the app will provide a list of possible matches. BirdGenie also includes a \"Sightings\" feature, where you can track your observations and add notes.\n\nAll of these apps are available for both iOS and Android devices. You might want to try out a few to see which one works best for you!\n\nDo you have any other questions or would you like more information on these apps?",
