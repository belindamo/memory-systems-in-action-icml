The ancient Mayan ruins of Tulum are a popular tourist destination on the Caribbean coast of Mexico, known for their stunning beachside location and well-preserved architecture. The site is perched on a cliff overlooking the turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea, making it a breathtakingly beautiful spot.\n\nTulum is a great addition to your itinerary, especially if you're interested in Mayan history and culture. The site is smaller than Chichen Itza, but it's still an impressive archaeological site with several notable structures, including:\n\n1. **El Castillo**: The Temple of the Frescoes, a pyramid-shaped structure with stunning ocean views.\n2. **Templo de los Frescos**: A temple with well-preserved murals and frescoes.\n3. **La Casa del Cenote**: A structure built around a natural sinkhole (cenote).\n\nTulum is also a great spot for swimming, snorkeling, or simply relaxing on the beach. The nearby town of Tulum has a laid-back, bohemian vibe, with plenty of restaurants, shops, and eco-tourism activities to explore.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Tulum, I recommend considering a guided tour to get the most out of your visit. You can also combine your visit with other nearby attractions, such as the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve or the ancient Mayan ruins of Coba.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about planning your trip to Tulum or any other destinations in Mexico!",
