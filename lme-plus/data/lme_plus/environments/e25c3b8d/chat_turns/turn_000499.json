But don't worry, many travelers have successfully explored Europe without speaking the local language, and you can too! Here are some tips to help you get around cities in Europe without speaking Italian or Spanish:\n\n**1. Learn Key Phrases and Words**\n\n* While you might not be able to hold conversations, learning basic phrases like \"hello,\" \"thank you,\" \"excuse me,\" \"where is...,\" and \"how much\" can go a long way in showing respect and getting help.\n* Download a translation app like Google Translate or iTranslate to help with more complex phrases and sentences.\n\n**2.
