  "content": "I am the CEO of Grailzy, an auction site for Watches. It is like ebay, but for watches only. The key benefit is that sellers get instant liquidity and better prices than if they sold to a watch dealer or reseller like WatchBox. I need to develop the website, business model and business process for this. For the business process, we need mechanisms to ensure the watches are authentic and have escrow and other procedures in order to protect both the buyers and sellers to ensure a transaction. Write me a detailed plan of how to build and launch all of this. Also detail a plan to market the website so we can attract both buyers and sellers to the platform. Be as detailed as possible and break down each part of the plan.",
