However, I should let you know that I don't have any information about your personal schedule or tasks, including what you do on your \"admin day\". I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your to-do lists, calendar, or work tasks.\n\nBut it's great that you're thinking ahead and making sure you have time for your tasks before dinner with Rachel! You might want to take a look at your own to-do list, calendar, or planner to make sure you're on track to wrap up your tasks on Friday.\n\nIf you need help with time management or prioritizing your tasks, I'd be happy to provide some general tips and suggestions!",
