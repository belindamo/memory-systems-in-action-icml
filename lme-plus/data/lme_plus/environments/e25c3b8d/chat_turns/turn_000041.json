Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Flowers:** Consider adding some pollinator-friendly flowers like zinnias, sunflowers, or cosmos to attract bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects. These flowers can add color and vibrancy to your garden while supporting local wildlife.\n2. **Vegetables:** You might think about planting some companion vegetables like carrots, radishes, or lettuce to complement your tomatoes and peas. These veggies can help repel pests, improve soil health, and add variety to your harvest.\n3. **Herbs:** Many herbs like basil, mint, and cilantro can add flavor and fragrance to your cooking while also repelling pests and improving soil health. They can be planted alongside your vegetables or in a separate herb garden.\n4. **Companion planting:** Consider planting marigolds with your tomatoes to deter nematodes, or basil with your peas to improve their flavor and repel pests. Research different companion planting combinations to find the best pairings for your garden.\n5. **Crop rotation:** Plan your garden layout to allow for crop rotation, which can help prevent soil depletion, reduce pests and diseases, and promote healthy growth.\n\nRemember to choose plants that are suitable for your climate, soil type, and available sunlight.
