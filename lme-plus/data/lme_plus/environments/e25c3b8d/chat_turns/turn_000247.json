  "content": "I'm looking for some help with my cocktail recipes. I've been experimenting with different mint leaves in my mojito recipe and I've found that a combination of two types works really well. I used to think that there was only one type of mint leaf suitable for my mojito recipe, but I've recently discovered that mixing them gives a more complex flavor profile. Can you give me some tips on how to balance the flavors in a mojito?",
