  "content": "Zone 6b has a moderate climate with cold winters and warm summers, which is perfect for growing a variety of plants, including roses and peas!\n\n**Rose Care in Zone 6b:**\n\n* Plant roses in well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5.\n* Water them regularly, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.\n* Fertilize your roses in early spring with a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10 NPK) and again in mid-summer with a bloom-boosting fertilizer (15-30-15 NPK).\n* Prune your roses in late winter or early spring, removing dead, diseased, or damaged branches.\n* Mulch around the base of your roses to retain moisture and suppress weeds.\n\n**Building a Trellis for Climbing Peas:**\n\nA trellis is a great way to support climbing peas and add a decorative element to your garden. Here's a simple guide to build a trellis:\n\nMaterials:\n\n* 2\" x 2\" wooden stakes (4-6)\n* Twine or wire (coated or uncoated)\n* Wooden or plastic trellis netting (optional)\n* Hammer or mallet\n* Measuring tape\n* Saw or pruning shears\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Plan your trellis:** Decide on the size and shape of your trellis based on the mature size of your pea plants and the space available. A simple A-frame or teepee design works well.\n2. **Prepare the site:** Choose a location with full sun and well-draining soil. Clear the area of any debris and mark out the trellis footprint with stakes and twine.\n3. **Create the frame:** Drive the stakes into the ground at an angle, forming the A-frame or teepee shape. Use twine or wire to tie the stakes together at the top.\n4. **Add the trellis netting:** If using, attach the trellis netting to the frame using twine or wire. This will provide additional support for the pea vines.\n5. **Train the peas:** Plant the peas at the base of the trellis and train the vines to climb up the structure by gently twining them around the stakes or netting.\n6. **Secure the trellis:** As the peas grow, use twine or wire to tie the stems to the trellis to prevent them from toppling over in the wind.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use sturdy stakes to support the weight of the peas and any wind or weather.\n* Space the stakes about 3-4 feet apart to allow for good air circulation and sunlight penetration.\n* Consider adding a roof or canopy to your trellis to provide shade and protection from extreme weather.\n* You can also use other materials like bamboo, metal, or plastic for your trellis, depending on your preference and budget.\n\nI hope this helps!
