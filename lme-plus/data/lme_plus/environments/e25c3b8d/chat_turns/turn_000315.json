  "content": "Maric looks at you with a mixture of fear and guilt in his eyes. He stammers for a moment before speaking. \"I-I'm sorry,\" he says. \"I didn't mean to steal from these people. I've been having these dreams, and in them, Selune tells me to take these things. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true. I've been leaving the symbols as a sign of my devotion to her.\"\n\nHe looks at you pleadingly, \"Please, you have to believe me. I'll return everything I've taken. I just need to find a way to make things right with Selune.\"\n\nYou are now faced with a moral dilemma, Maric is confessing to the thefts but he claims that he is acting under the influence of a deity. You could take him to the guard and let them deal with him or you could try to help him find a way to make amends and clear his name.\n\nWhat would you like to do now?",
