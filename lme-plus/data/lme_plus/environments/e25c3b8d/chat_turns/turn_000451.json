However, as a digital AI assistant, I don't have access to your location or real-time information about studios and classes.\n\nBut don't worry, I can suggest a few ways to find what you're looking for:\n\n1. **Google search:** Type in \"hot yoga near me\" or \"yin yoga near me\" along with your city or zip code to find nearby studios that offer these styles.\n2. **Yoga studio finder websites:** Websites like YogaFinder, Yoga International, or DoYouYoga allow you to search for yoga studios and classes in your area. You can filter by style, location, and level.\n3. **Social media and online directories:** Check out social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram to search for yoga studios in your area. You can also use online directories like Yelp or Google My Business to find studios and read reviews.\n4. **Ask around:** Ask your friends, family, or coworkers if they know of any good hot yoga or yin yoga studios in your area.\n5. **Check with Zen Den:** Since you're already practicing at Zen Den, you can ask your instructors or the studio management if they offer hot yoga or yin yoga classes, or if they can recommend any other studios in the area that do.\n\nRemember to always research the studio, read reviews, and check the schedule and pricing before trying out a new class. It's essential to find a studio and instructor that resonate with you and your practice.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find an amazing hot yoga or yin yoga class that challenges and inspires you!",
