  "content": "There are several things we can do to help mitigate the negative impacts of non-native species on mouse populations:\n\n1. Monitoring: Regular monitoring of mouse populations can help us understand the extent of the impacts of non-native species and other factors affecting their health and diversity. This information can be used to develop effective conservation strategies.\n\n2. Habitat preservation: Preserving the habitats of native mice can help to protect them from non-native species and other threats. This can be done through habitat restoration, protection of remaining habitat, and land management practices that promote native species diversity.\n\n3. Control of non-native species: In some cases, it may be necessary to control non-native species to prevent them from further impacting native mice populations. This can be done through methods such as trapping, baiting, and biological control methods.\n\n4. Education and outreach: Educating the public about the impacts of non-native species on mouse populations and encouraging them to take actions to prevent their introduction can help to reduce their negative impacts.\n\n5. Rehabilitation: In some cases, injured or orphaned mice may need to be rehabilitated before being released back into the wild. Rehabilitators can provide medical care, food, and shelter until the mice are healthy enough to be released.\n\nBy taking these actions, we can help to protect mouse populations and preserve their diversity and health, even in the face of non-native species introductions and other threats.",
