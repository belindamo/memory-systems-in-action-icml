I'm glad to hear that your pea trellis is working out well.\n\nNow, let's talk about your rose bushes. Since you planted them on April 17th, they've had about a month to establish themselves. Here are a few things to keep in mind as they continue to grow:\n\n* **Watering:** Continue to keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Roses need about 1 inch of water per week, either from rain or irrigation.\n* **Fertilization:** You can start fertilizing your roses with a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10 NPK) once a month. This will provide them with the necessary nutrients for healthy growth and blooming.\n* **Pest and disease management:** Keep an eye out for signs of pests or diseases, such as aphids, black spot, or powdery mildew. Research organic or integrated pest management (IPM) methods to address any issues that arise.\n* **Pruning:** You can start pruning your rose bushes in late winter or early spring to promote healthy growth and encourage blooming. This will also help you shape the plant and encourage air circulation.\n\nSince you're in Zone 6b, your rose bushes will likely go dormant during the winter months. Be sure to mulch around the base of the plants to protect the roots from freezing temperatures and prevent soil heaving.\n\nHow are your rose bushes looking so far? Are they showing any signs of growth or budding?",
