  "content": "There is limited available data on the education and skill level of Jhansi's workforce as compared to other cities in India. However, according to the Census of India 2011, the literacy rate in Jhansi was 75.4%, which is slightly lower than the national literacy rate of 73%. \n\nIn terms of industry, Jhansi has a number of small and medium-scale enterprises, and its economy is primarily driven by agriculture, logistics, and transportation. While the city does have a number of technical and vocational training institutes, there may still be a shortage of skilled workers in certain industries. \n\nOverall, the education and skill level of Jhansi's workforce may have some impact on the city's economy, particularly in terms of its ability to attract new industries and investment. However, the availability of low-cost labor and favorable business regulations could also serve as a draw for companies operating in certain sectors.",
