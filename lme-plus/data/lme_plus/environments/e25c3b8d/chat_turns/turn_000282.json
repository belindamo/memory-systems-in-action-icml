You mentioned that earlier, and I'm glad to hear that the new litter box from Petco is working well for Luna! $35 seems like a reasonable price for a good-quality litter box. It's great that you're taking good care of Luna's litter box needs.\n\nBy the way, have you considered upgrading or changing Luna's litter as well? Sometimes, a new litter box can be a good opportunity to try a different type of litter that might be more comfortable or effective for Luna.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need any recommendations on cat litter or other cat-related topics!",
