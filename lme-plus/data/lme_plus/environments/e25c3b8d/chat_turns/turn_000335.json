Some of these organizations include the American Red Cross, All Hands and Hearts, Team Rubicon, and Habitat for Humanity. These organizations often provide training for volunteers before deployment to ensure that they have the necessary skills to help out in disaster relief efforts. The training may cover a range of topics, including disaster response protocols, safety procedures, and basic first aid.
