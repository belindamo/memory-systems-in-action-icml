I'd be happy to help you with some inspiration for additional lighting in your dining room.\n\n**Under-Cabinet Lighting:**\n\n1. **LED Tape Lights**: These are thin, flexible strips of LEDs that can be stuck under your cabinets, providing a warm, subtle glow. They're energy-efficient and easy to install.\n2. **Puck Lights**: Small, round lights that can be recessed into the cabinet or surface-mounted. They're perfect for creating pools of light on the countertop or in display areas.\n3. **Linear LED Lights**: These are long, thin lights that can be placed under cabinets to create a continuous line of light. They're great for illuminating the backsplash area.\n\n**Pendant Lights above the Table:**\n\n1. **Linear Suspension Lights**: A long, linear light fixture that can be suspended above the table, providing even lighting across the entire surface.\n2. **Cluster Pendant**: A group of pendant lights clustered together to create a visually interesting fixture. This can add a touch of drama to the space.\n3. **Globe Pendant**: A classic, spherical pendant light that can be hung above the table, providing soft, diffused light.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider layering your lighting: Use a combination of overhead lighting, under-cabinet lighting, and table lamps to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n* Think about the color temperature of your lighting: Warm white (2700K-3000K) is cozy and relaxing, while cool white (3500K-4100K) is brighter and more energizing.\n* Don't forget about dimmers: Installing dimmers can help you adjust the lighting levels to suit different occasions and moods.\n\nI'm glad to hear you're thinking about lighting in general! A new bedside lamp for your partner's side of the bed is a great idea. Remember to consider the task lighting needs of the space and the style of the lamp to ensure it fits with the overall aesthetic of the room.\n\nDo you have any specific style or design preferences for your dining room lighting?",
