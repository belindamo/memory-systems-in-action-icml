  "content": "Companion planting is a great way to create a harmonious and thriving garden ecosystem. Tomatoes are one of the most popular garden vegetables, and they can benefit from being paired with certain plants that provide support, deter pests, or enhance growth. Here are some excellent companion plants that go well with tomatoes:\n\n1. **Basil**: A classic pairing! Basil repels pests that target tomatoes, such as whiteflies and aphids, and adds flavor to many tomato-based dishes.\n2. **Marigold**: These bright flowers repel nematodes, which can harm tomatoes, and attract beneficial insects that prey on tomato pests.\n3. **Borage**: This flowering herb attracts beneficial insects, improves tomato flavor, and increases tomato yields.\n4. **Chives**: Chives repel aphids and other pests that target tomatoes, and their onion-like scent can improve tomato flavor.\n5. **Oregano**: Oregano repels pests that target tomatoes, such as nematodes and whiteflies, and adds a pungent flavor to tomato dishes.\n6. **Parsley**: Parsley repels carrot flies and other pests that target tomatoes, and its deep taproot can help bring up nutrients for nearby tomatoes.\n7. **Cilantro**: Cilantro repels spider mites, aphids, and other pests that target tomatoes, and its fast growth can help shade the soil, reducing moisture loss.\n8. **Dill**: Dill repels aphids, mites, and other pests that target tomatoes, and its tall growth can provide shade and support for indeterminate tomato varieties.\n9. **Comfrey**: Comfrey's deep taproot can bring up nutrients for nearby tomatoes, and its leaves can act as a fertilizer plant.\n10. **Nasturtium**: Nasturtium repels aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that target tomatoes, and its bright flowers can add a pop of color to your garden.\n\nRemember to plant companion plants according to their growing requirements and space needs. Some plants, like basil and parsley, can be planted close to tomatoes, while others, like marigold and nasturtium, may require more space.\n\nHere are some plants to avoid planting near tomatoes:\n\n* Fennel (inhibits tomato growth)\n* Potatoes (can spread disease to tomatoes)\n* Eggplants (can compete with tomatoes for water and nutrients)\n* Members of the Brassica family (broccoli, cauliflower, kale) (can attract pests that target tomatoes)\n\nHappy gardening!",
