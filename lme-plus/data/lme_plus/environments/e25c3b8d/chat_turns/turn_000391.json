Clean them regularly:** Use a soft-bristled brush or a clean cloth to remove dirt and debris from the shoes. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can damage the materials.\n\n**2. Store them properly:** Keep your running shoes in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Avoid storing them in airtight containers or plastic bags, as this can cause moisture buildup and damage the materials.\n\n**3. Allow them to dry:** If your shoes get wet, allow them to air dry slowly and naturally. Avoid using heat to speed up the drying process, as this can cause the materials to degrade.\n\n**4. Rotate your shoes:** If you have multiple pairs of running shoes, consider rotating them to give each pair a break and allow them to recover. This can help extend the lifespan of your shoes.\n\n**5. Check for wear and tear:** Regularly inspect your shoes for signs of wear and tear, such as worn-out soles, torn uppers, or loose stitching. If you notice any damage, consider replacing the shoes to avoid injuries or discomfort.\n\n**6. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines:** Check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning and maintenance recommendations for your particular running shoes.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help extend the lifespan of your running shoes and keep them performing well.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
