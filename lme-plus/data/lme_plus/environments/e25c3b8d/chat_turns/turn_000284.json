  "content": "The introduction of non-native species due to human activities can have both direct and indirect effects on the diversity and health of mouse populations. \n\nDirect effects: \n\n1. Competition for resources: Non-native species may compete with native mice for food, shelter, and nesting sites, which can lead to a reduction in resources available for native mice. This can result in a decrease in their health and population size.\n\n2. Predation: Non-native species can also be predators of native mice, leading to increased predation pressure on the native population.\n\nIndirect effects:\n\n1. Alteration of habitat: Non-native species introduction can bring changes to the landscape by altering the structure of vegetation, water availability, or soil quality, which can reduce the suitability of the habitat for native mice.\n\n2. Spread of diseases or parasites: Non-native species may carry pathogens or parasites that can infect native mice, leading to increased mortality and decreased reproductive success.\n\nAll these factors can act together to reduce the biodiversity and health of mouse populations. The introduction of non-native species is considered one of the major contributors to the decline of many native mouse species around the world. Therefore, it is essential to prevent the introduction of non-native species into ecosystems where they do not belong, in order to preserve the biodiversity and health of native populations.",
