You never know what hidden gems you might find, and it's always exciting to score a high-end item at a fraction of the original price.\n\nWhen you visit the formal dress section, make sure to take your time and inspect each dress carefully. Check the label, fabric, stitching, and overall quality to ensure it's a genuine designer piece. Don't be afraid to try on dresses, even if they're not exactly what you had in mind. You might be surprised at how a dress looks on you, and the right fit can make all the difference.\n\nAlso, keep an open mind about the dress's original price or season. Just because it's from a past collection or was originally priced higher doesn't mean it's not a great find. Focus on the dress's quality, fit, and how it makes you feel.\n\nRemember, finding a great deal on a formal dress at TK Maxx requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to dig through the racks. But if you're lucky, you might just find a stunning designer dress at a fraction of the original price. Good luck, and I hope you find the perfect dress for your special occasion!",
