  "content": "I think I'll look for a lamp with a minimalist design and a small shade. I like the idea of a metallic accent, maybe something with a chrome or silver base. I'm not sure about the budget yet, but I'd like to keep it around $50-$100. Also, I need to finalize the order for the lamp today, so I'll make sure to check out some online stores and read some reviews before making a purchase.",
