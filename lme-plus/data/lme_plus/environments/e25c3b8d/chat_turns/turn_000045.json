  "content": "I'm happy to help you with that!\n\nThoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition that occurs when the nerves or blood vessels in the thoracic outlet (the area between the neck and shoulder) become compressed or irritated. This can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\n* Pain or numbness in the neck, shoulder, arm, or hand\n* Weakness or fatigue in the arm or hand\n* Tingling or burning sensations in the arm or hand\n* Swelling or discoloration of the arm or hand\n* Headaches or facial pain\n\nThere are three main types of TOS:\n\n1. **Neurogenic TOS**: This is the most common type, accounting for about 90% of cases. It occurs when the nerves in the brachial plexus (a network of nerves that runs from the spine to the arm) become compressed or irritated.\n2. **Vascular TOS**: This type affects the blood vessels, causing compression or blockage of the subclavian vein or artery.\n3. **Mixed TOS**: This type involves both nerve and blood vessel compression.\n\nThe exact cause of TOS is often unclear, but it can be related to:\n\n* Anatomical abnormalities, such as a cervical rib or a scalene triangle (a triangular space formed by the scalene muscles)\n* Muscle imbalances or injuries\n* Poor posture or ergonomics\n* Trauma or injury to the neck or shoulder\n* Pregnancy or childbirth\n\nTreatment for TOS usually involves a combination of:\n\n* Physical therapy to improve posture, strengthen muscles, and reduce compression\n* Exercises to stretch and strengthen the neck, shoulder, and arm\n* Pain management with medication or injections\n* Lifestyle changes, such as improving ergonomics and taking regular breaks\n* In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve compression or repair damaged tissues\n\nIt's great that you're taking proactive steps to learn more about your condition! Be sure to discuss any questions or concerns with your healthcare provider, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance or support.\n\n(And don't forget to double-check that appointment with Dr. Lee on June 1st!)",
