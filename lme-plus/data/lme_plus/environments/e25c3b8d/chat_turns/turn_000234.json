Here are some tips to help you categorize your apps into folders effectively:\n\n1. **Purge unnecessary apps**: Before creating folders, take this opportunity to remove any apps you no longer use or need. This will help declutter your home screen and reduce the number of apps you need to organize.\n2. **Categorize apps into groups**: Think about how you use your apps and group them into categories that make sense to you. Common categories include:\n\t* Social Media\n\t* Productivity\n\t* Entertainment\n\t* Games\n\t* Photography\n\t* Utilities\n\t* Travel\n\t* Finance\n\t* Health and Fitness\n3. **Create folders with clear names**: Use descriptive names for your folders, so you can easily find the apps you need. Avoid using vague names like \"Misc\" or \"Stuff.\"\n4. **Limit the number of folders**: Try to keep the number of folders to a minimum. Too many folders can be overwhelming. Aim for 5-7 main folders.\n5. **Prioritize frequently used apps**: Place your most frequently used apps on the home screen, and consider creating a \"Favorites\" or \"Quick Access\" folder for them.\n6. **Organize folders in a logical order**: Arrange your folders in a logical order, such as:\n\t* Most frequently used apps/folders first\n\t* Alphabetical order\n\t* Categories that are most important to you\n7. **Use subfolders**: If you have a large number of apps within a category, consider creating subfolders. For example, under \"Photography,\" you could have subfolders for \"Editing,\" \"Camera,\" and \"Gallery.\"\n8. **Keep related apps together**: Keep apps that are related to each other in the same folder. For example, if you have multiple social media apps, keep them in the same folder.\n9. **Consider a \"Hidden\" folder**: Create a folder for apps you don't use frequently, but still want to keep on your phone. This can help declutter your main home screen.\n10. **Experiment and adjust**: Don't be afraid to try out different folder arrangements and adjust as needed. You might find that certain categories or folder names don't work for you, and that's okay!\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to create a well-organized home screen with easy-to-find apps. Enjoy your extra storage space, and happy organizing!",
