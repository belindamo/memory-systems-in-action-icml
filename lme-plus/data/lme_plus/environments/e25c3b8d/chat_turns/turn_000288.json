  "content": "Yes, there are several non-native species that have impacted mouse populations. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. The Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus): This species is native to Asia but has been introduced worldwide due to human activities. It is known to prey on native mice and cause competition for resources. 2. The house mouse (Mus musculus): Although this species is native to Asia, it has been introduced to many parts of the world due to human activities, such as shipping and trading. House mice can outcompete native mice for resources and also carry diseases that can infect native populations. 3. The black rat (Rattus rattus): This species is native to Asia but has been introduced worldwide. It is known to prey on native mice and has caused declines in populations of some native species. 4. The stoat (Mustela erminea): This species is native to Eurasia but has been introduced to several countries, including New Zealand. It is a predator of small mammals, including native mouse species. These are just a few examples of non-native species that have impacted mouse populations. The introduction of any non-native species can have negative impacts on native populations, and it is important to prevent their release whenever possible.",
