I'll definitely give those a shot!\n\nBy the way, I was thinking about my schedule for the upcoming week and realized I have a birthday party to attend on Saturday night. I'm looking forward to celebrating with friends and family. Do you have any tips on how to stay energized and focused when attending social events, especially in the evening?\n",
