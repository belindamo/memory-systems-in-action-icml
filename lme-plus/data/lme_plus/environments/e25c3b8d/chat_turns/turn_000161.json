The traditional Viennese coffeehouses, known as \"Kaffeeh\u00e4user,\" are an integral part of the city's social fabric and have been a staple of Viennese life for centuries. Here's what makes them special:\n\n1. **History**: Vienna's coffeehouses date back to the 17th century, when coffee was first introduced to Europe. They quickly became popular gathering places for intellectuals, artists, and writers, who would meet to discuss politics, literature, and philosophy.\n2. **Atmosphere**: Viennese coffeehouses are known for their opulent decor, often featuring grand chandeliers, ornate mirrors, and plush furnishings. They exude a sense of elegance and sophistication, making them a perfect spot to relax and people-watch.\n3. **Coffee**: Viennese coffee is a specialty in itself. The traditional coffee drink is called \"Wiener Melange,\" which consists of a strong coffee topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa powder.
