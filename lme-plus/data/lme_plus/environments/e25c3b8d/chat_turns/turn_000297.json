I noticed that on weekdays, I wake up at 7:00 am and exercise for 30 minutes, but on weekends, I like to sleep in a bit later. Last Saturday, I didn't wake up until 10:30 am, and I think that extra sleep really helped me feel more relaxed and refreshed. Do you think that having a consistent morning routine, even on weekends, would help me feel more energized during the day?",
