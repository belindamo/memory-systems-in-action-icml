  "content": "Maric looks uneasy as he approaches the temple. \"I-I'm not sure,\" he says. \"I've only been here a few times. I usually leave the offerings and then leave. I've never been inside.\"\n\nWith that information, you and your party members decide to proceed with caution and enter the temple to investigate. Inside, you find a small, dimly lit room. In the center of the room, there's an altar and a few candles burning. On the altar, you see a pile of items that match the descriptions of the items that have been reported stolen.\n\nAs you look around the room, you see a figure in the shadows, dressed in dark robes with a crescent moon symbol on the chest. The figure is chanting in a language that you don't understand.\n\nYou realize that this figure might be the one who is behind the thefts, and the one who has been manipulating Maric.\n\nWhat would you like to do now?",
