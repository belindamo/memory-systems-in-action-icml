  "content": "Rose bushes are a wonderful addition to any garden! To provide you with the best care advice, I'll need to know your region or climate zone. Could you please tell me what city or state you're in, or what your USDA Hardiness Zone is? That way, I can give you more tailored guidance.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general tips that apply to most regions:\n\n1. **Watering:** Roses need about 1 inch of water per week, either from rain or irrigation. Water them deeply once or twice a week, depending on weather conditions. Avoid getting water on the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.\n2. **Sunlight:** Roses love full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight) and well-draining soil. Make sure to plant them in a location that receives plenty of sunlight.\n3. **Fertilization:** Feed your roses with a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10 NPK) in early spring, when new growth begins. You can also add a rose-specific fertilizer for extra nutrients.\n4. **Pruning:** Prune your roses in late winter or early spring, removing dead, diseased, or damaged branches. This will promote healthy growth and encourage blooming.\n5. **Mulching:** Mulch around the base of your roses to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Keep the mulch layer thin (about 2-3 inches) and avoid piling it against the plant stem.\n\nSince you planted your roses in mid-April, they should be getting established in their new home. Here are a few additional tips for the first growing season:\n\n* Keep the soil consistently moist during the first few months after planting.\n* Remove any dead or damaged leaves or stems as you notice them.\n* Deadheading (removing spent blooms) can encourage your roses to produce more flowers.\n\nPlease let me know your region, and I'll be happy to provide more specific advice on caring for your roses.",
