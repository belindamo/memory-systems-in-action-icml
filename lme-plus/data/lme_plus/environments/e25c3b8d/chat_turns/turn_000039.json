  "content": "That's great to hear! It sounds like you're doing everything right to give your rose bushes the best chance to thrive. Regular watering, fertilizing, and pest/disease monitoring are all crucial for healthy growth and blooming.\n\nI'm sure you're eager to see those beautiful blooms, and with proper care, they should start appearing soon. Rose bushes usually take around 60 to 90 days to bloom after planting, so you might start seeing buds forming in the next few weeks.\n\nWhen the blooms do arrive, make sure to deadhead them (remove the spent flowers) to encourage your rose bushes to produce more blooms throughout the growing season. This will also help keep your plants looking tidy and promote healthy growth.\n\nRemember to enjoy the process and take pride in your hard work. Gardening is a journey, and it's wonderful that you're taking the time to nurture your plants and watch them grow.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I'll let you get back to enjoying your garden and awaiting those lovely rose blooms!",
