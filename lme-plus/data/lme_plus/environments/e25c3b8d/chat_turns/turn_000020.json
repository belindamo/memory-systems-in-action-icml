My current fitness level is decent, I can run continuously for around 60-70 minutes. I'm available to train 4-5 days a week, with 1-2 hours per day. I prefer a structured plan with pace targets. I'd like to focus on endurance and speed during my training. I don't have any injuries or health concerns. My current longest run distance is 20 miles, and my longest run time is around 3 hours. I'm available to start training immediately.",
