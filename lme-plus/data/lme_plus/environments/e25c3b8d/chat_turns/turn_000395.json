You want to avoid heavy, greasy, or spicy foods that can make you feel sluggish or uncomfortable during your practice. Here are some breakfast options that are perfect for a pre-yoga breakfast:\n\n1. **Banana with Almond Butter**: A classic combo that provides potassium, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Easy to digest and won't sit heavy in your stomach.\n2. **Oatmeal with Honey and Fresh Fruits**: Cooked oatmeal with a drizzle of honey and some fresh fruits like berries, banana, or apple provides sustained energy and fiber.\n3. **Yogurt Parfait**: Layer Greek yogurt with fresh fruits, granola, and a sprinkle of honey for a protein-packed breakfast that's easy to digest.\n4. **Avocado Toast on Whole Grain Bread**: Toasted whole grain bread with mashed avocado and a sprinkle of salt provides healthy fats and complex carbohydrates. Add a sliced egg or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for extra protein and energy.\n5. **Smoothie**: Blend together your favorite fruits, Greek yogurt, and a splash of almond milk for a light and refreshing breakfast drink. Avoid adding too much protein powder or nuts, as they can be heavy on the stomach.\n6. **Chia Seed Pudding**: Mix chia seeds with almond milk and let it sit overnight. Top with fresh fruits and a drizzle of honey for a nutritious and filling breakfast that's easy to digest.\n7. **Green Tea and Toast**: If you're not feeling hungry, a light breakfast of green tea and whole grain toast can provide a gentle energy boost without feeling too full.\n\nRemember to eat your breakfast at least 1-2 hours before your yoga practice to allow for proper digestion. Aim for a light, balanced meal that includes a mix of complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats. Avoid heavy, greasy, or spicy foods, as well as caffeine and sugary drinks.\n\nEnjoy your Saturday morning yoga classes, and I hope these breakfast recommendations help you feel energized and focused throughout your practice!",
