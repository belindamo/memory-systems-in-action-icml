  "content": "Making your own lavender syrup will definitely elevate your cocktails to the next level. English lavender and sweet lavender are both great options to experiment with, and you might find that you prefer one over the other depending on your personal taste.\n\nAs for cocktail blogs and websites, there are many excellent resources out there that can provide inspiration and guidance for home bartenders. Here are a few of my favorites:\n\n1. **The Cocktail Chronicles**: A comprehensive cocktail blog with a vast recipe database, tutorials, and articles on cocktail history and technique.\n2. **Death & Co**: A renowned cocktail bar in New York City that shares their recipes, techniques, and inspiration on their blog.\n3. **Punch**: A website dedicated to cocktails, wine, and spirits, featuring recipes, articles, and stories from industry experts.\n4. **Imbibe Magazine**: A leading cocktail publication that offers recipes, interviews, and articles on the world of mixology.\n5. **The Spruce Eats**: A comprehensive food and drink website that features a vast collection of cocktail recipes, tutorials, and guides.\n6. **Liquor.com**: A website that offers cocktail recipes, spirit reviews, and articles on the world of mixology.\n7. **Jeffrey Morgenthaler**: A well-known bartender and author who shares his recipes, techniques, and industry insights on his blog.\n\nThese resources should provide you with plenty of inspiration and guidance as you start your own cocktail blog. Remember to focus on creating high-quality content, using good photography, and engaging with your audience to build a loyal following.\n\nIf you're interested in starting a cocktail blog, I'd be happy to offer more specific advice and guidance. What kind of content do you envision creating, and what's your target audience?",
