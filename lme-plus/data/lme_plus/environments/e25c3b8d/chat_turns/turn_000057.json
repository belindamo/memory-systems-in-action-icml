  "content": "The Cliffs of Moher took millions of years to form through various geological processes that included the movement of tectonic plates, erosion, and weathering. The cliffs are made up of layers of sandstone, siltstone, and shale, which were deposited over time as sediment at the bottom of an ancient ocean. The movement of tectonic plates caused the layers to be uplifted and eventually exposed above the ocean's surface. Over millions of years, the constant pounding of the sea and the elements carved away at the cliffs, shaping them into the dramatic structures we see today. It is estimated that the Cliffs of Moher took around 300 million years to form.",
