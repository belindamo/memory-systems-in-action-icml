  "content": "As an AI language model, I can provide some tips on how you could stay informed without getting too stressed out. One way is to limit the amount of time spent on news sources, and instead, focus on a few reputable sources to stay updated on the latest news. You can also set a specific time of day to check the news and avoid looking at it before bedtime to avoid feeling anxious.\n\nIt's also essential to take breaks from the news and disconnect from technology while engaging in other activities that can help you unwind. Hobbies, exercise, and spending time with family and friends can help reduce stress levels and help you maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to be mindful of the news you're consuming and to recognize when you need to take a break. Listening to your body and mind and taking necessary steps to alleviate stress is just as critical as staying informed.",
