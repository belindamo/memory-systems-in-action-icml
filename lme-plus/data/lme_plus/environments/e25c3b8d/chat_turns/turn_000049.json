Our conversation just started, and I don't have any prior knowledge about you or your medical history.\n\nHowever, it's excellent that you're taking notes and trying to track your symptoms. This can be really helpful in managing your condition and communicating with your healthcare provider. Keep doing that, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance!",
