  "content": "As an AI language model, I can suggest some strategies that may help calm your mind when you feel overwhelmed about politics. \n\nOne technique is to practice mindfulness or meditation, which involves focusing on your breath and being present in the moment. Taking deep breaths and focusing on the present can help alleviate anxiety and stress.\n\nEngaging in physical exercise or going for a walk in nature is another effective way to relieve stress and clear your mind.\n\nIt's also helpful to remind yourself that you can't control everything and to focus on what you can control instead. Instead of worrying about things you cannot change, try to focus on taking positive actions within your community or supporting organizations that align with your values.\n\nLastly, it's important to engage in activities that bring you joy and make you feel good. Whether it's spending time with loved ones, listening to music, or pursuing a hobby, giving yourself time for self-care and relaxation can help manage political stress.",
