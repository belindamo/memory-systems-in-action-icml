Here's an overview of the plan:\n\n**Training Objectives:**\n\n1. Increase your weekly mileage to 35-40 miles by the end of week 12\n2. Build endurance with regular long runs and tempo runs\n3. Improve your running efficiency and speed with interval workouts and hill repeats\n4. Gradually increase your longest run distance to 22 miles by week 14\n\n**Training Schedule:**\n\nThe plan will consist of 4-5 runs per week, with one or two rest days. Here's a breakdown of the typical weekly structure:\n\n* Monday: Easy run (30-40 minutes, 3-4 miles)\n* Tuesday: Interval workout (45-60 minutes, 5-6 miles)\n* Wednesday: Rest day or active recovery (e.g., easy walk or cross-training)\n* Thursday: Hill repeats or strength training (45-60 minutes, 4-5 miles)\n* Friday: Easy run (30-40 minutes, 3-4 miles)\n* Saturday: Long run (60-90 minutes, 8-12 miles)\n* Sunday: Rest day or active recovery\n\n**Pace Targets:**\n\nTo help you achieve your goal, I've included pace targets for each workout. Please note that these are general guidelines, and you should adjust the paces based on how you feel during the workout.\n\n* Easy runs: 9:30-10:30 min/mile\n* Interval workouts: 8:00-8:30 min/mile (fast intervals), 9:00-9:30 min/mile (recovery intervals)\n* Hill repeats: 8:30-9:00 min/mile\n* Long runs: 9:00-9:30 min/mile (first 60-70 minutes), 9:30-10:00 min/mile (last 30-40 minutes)\n\n**Sample Workouts:**\n\nHere are some sample workouts to give you an idea of what to expect:\n\n* Week 4, Tuesday: 6x800m intervals at 8:15 min/mile, with 400m active recovery\n* Week 8, Thursday: 6x600m hill repeats at 8:45 min/mile, with 200m active recovery\n* Week 12, Saturday: 10-mile long run at 9:15 min/mile\n\n**Progressive Overload:**\n\nTo ensure you're making progress, I've included gradual increases in mileage, intensity, and frequency throughout the plan. This will help your body adapt to the demands of running a marathon.\n\n**Rest and Recovery:**\n\nRemember to prioritize rest and recovery, especially on Sundays and Wednesdays. This will allow your body to adapt to the training stress and reduce the risk of injury.\n\n**Nutrition and Hydration:**\n\nMake sure to fuel your body with a balanced diet, including complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and healthy fats. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, and aim to consume 16-20 ounces of fluids 1-2 hours before each run.\n\n**Get Started:**\n\nYou can start the plan immediately. Make sure to listen to your body and adjust the paces and workouts based on how you feel. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me anytime.\n\nBest of luck with your training!",
