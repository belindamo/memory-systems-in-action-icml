Here are some tips to complement your new handbag:\n\n**Neutral backgrounds:**\n\n* Pair your black leather tote with neutral-colored tops and bottoms, such as white, beige, gray, navy, or olive green. These colors will create a chic, timeless look that lets the bag be the focal point.\n\n**Add a pop of color:**\n\n* Introduce a bold or bright color through a scarf, blouse, or shoes to add visual interest to your outfit. This will create a nice contrast with the neutral-colored bag.\n\n**Dress it up or down:**\n\n* Since your bag is a bit more upscale, you can easily dress it up with a blouse, dress, or a skirt for a more formal occasion.\n* Alternatively, pair it with distressed denim, a graphic tee, or a casual sundress for a more relaxed, everyday look.\n\n**Consider the style:**\n\n* A medium-sized tote is perfect for daily use, so think about your personal style and the activities you'll be using the bag for. If you're a busy bee, pair it with comfortable shoes and a practical outfit. If you're heading out for a night out, opt for heels and a dressier ensemble.\n\n**Some specific outfit ideas:**\n\n* Black leather tote + white button-down shirt + distressed denim jeans + sneakers\n* Black leather tote + olive green sweater + black leggings + ankle boots\n* Black leather tote + flowy sundress + sandals + statement necklace\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and experiment with different outfits to find what works best for you and your personal style!",
