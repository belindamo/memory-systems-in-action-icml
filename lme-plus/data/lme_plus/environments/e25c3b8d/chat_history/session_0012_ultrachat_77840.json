This can help you get a balanced view of the news. - Choose outlets that offer in-depth coverage and analysis of political issues so you can get a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. - Consider podcasts or news sources that provide a mix of analysis, current events, and human interest stories. This approach can help you balance the often-negative nature of political news with more uplifting stories. Some popular news sources and podcasts that people find helpful to stay informed include The New York Times, NPR, The Washington Post, BBC News, and The Economist. It's important to note, however, that political opinions and personal preferences can vary widely. Hence it's ultimately up to you to determine which sources align with your preferences and values."
