      "content": "| Aspect Ratios |\n| --- |\n| The --aspect or --ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3. |\n| A square image has equal width and height, described as a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image could be 1000px \u00d7 1000px, or 1500px \u00d7 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10. The height is 1.6 times longer than the width. So the image could be 1600px \u00d7 1000px, 4000px \u00d7 2000px, 320px x 200px, etc. |\n| The default aspect ratio is 1:1. |\n| --aspect must use whole numbers. Use 239:100 instead of 2.39:1. |\n| The aspect ratio impacts the shape and composition of a generated image. |\n| Some aspect ratios may be slightly changed when upscaling. |\n\n| Max Aspect Ratios |\n| --- |\n| Different Midjourney Version Models have different maximum aspect ratios. |\n| Version 4 |\n| Aspect Ratio |\n| Many aspect ratios not listed above are accepted by earlier model versions but may be slightly modified during image generation. Example: images using --ar 16:9 (1.78) in Midjourney Model V3 render as 7:4 (1.75). |\n\n| Comparison of common Midjourney Aspect Ratios |\n| --- |\n| prompt example: imagine/ prompt vibrant california poppies --ar 5:4 |\n\n| Common Midjourney Aspect Ratios |\n| --- |\n| --aspect 1:1 Default aspect ratio. |\n| --aspect 5:4 Common frame and print ratio. |\n| --aspect 3:2 Common in print photography. |\n| --aspect 7:4 Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens. |\n\n| How to Change the Aspect Ratio |\n| --- |\n| Use Aspect Ratio Parameters |\n| Add --aspect <value>:<value>, or --ar <value>:<value> to the end of your prompt. |\n| Animated Gif showing how the Midjourney version parameter is typed |\n\n| Chaos |\n| --- |\n| The --chaos or --c parameter influences how varied the initial image grids are. High --chaos values will produce more unusual and unexpected results and compositions. Lower --chaos values have more reliable, repeatable results. |\n| --chaos accepts values 0\u2013100. |\n| The default --chaos value is 0. |\n\n| The Influence of Chaos on Jobs |\n| --- |\n| Low --chaos values |\n| Using a low --chaos value, or not specifying a value, will produce initial image grids that are slightly varied each time a Job is run. |\n\n|prompt example: imagine/ prompt watermelon owl hybrid|\n\n|Example of Midjourney job run with the chaos parameter 0|\n|Example of Midjourney job run with the chaos parameter 0|\n|Example of Midjourney job run with the chaos parameter 0|\n|Example of Midjourney job run with the chaos parameter 0|"
