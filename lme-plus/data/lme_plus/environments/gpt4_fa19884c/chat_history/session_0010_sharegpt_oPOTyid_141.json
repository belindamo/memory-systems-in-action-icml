For example, to retrieve all products in the \"clothing\" category that are in stock, you can use the following endpoint:\n```bash\n/wp-json/wc/v3/products?category=clothing&stock_status=instock\n```\nMake sure to include the necessary authentication credentials in your API requests to ensure that only authorized users can access the product data."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To apply the filter for retrieving only items in stock globally without modifying all APIs, you can create a custom function or plugin that hooks into the WooCommerce API request process. This function or plugin can intercept the request and modify the query arguments to include the stock status filter before the API call is made. This way, all API requests will automatically include the filter for retrieving only items in stock without needing to modify each individual API."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, I can help you with that.\n\nHere are the steps you can follow to apply a global filter on your APIs to retrieve only items in stock:\n\n1. Create a custom function in your WordPress theme's `functions.php` file.\n2. The function should first check if the current request is an API request using the `is_rest()` function.\n3. If it's an API request, the function should check if the request is for a product or a variation using the `get_post_type()` function.\n4. If the request is for a product or a variation, the function should add a `meta_query` parameter to the query arguments with a `stock_status` meta query to retrieve only items in stock. Here's an example:\n```php\nfunction add_stock_filter_to_api( $args, $request ) {\n    if ( ! is_rest() ) {\n        return $args;\n    }\n\n    $post_type = $request->get_param( 'type' );\n\n    if ( 'product' === $post_type || 'product_variation' === $post_type ) {\n        $meta_query = $args['meta_query'];\n        $meta_query[] = array(\n            'key' => '_stock_status',\n            'value' => 'instock'\n        );\n\n        $args['meta_query'] = $meta_query;\n    }\n\n    return $args;\n}\nadd_filter( 'woocommerce_rest_products_query', 'add_stock_filter_to_api', 10, 2 );\n```\n5. Finally, hook the function to the `woocommerce_rest_products_query` filter to apply it to all product-related API requests.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to apply a global filter to retrieve only items in stock for all your product-related API requests."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To implement the function on a plugin, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the plugin file that you want to modify.\n2. Locate the function that retrieves the products and modify it to include the new function that filters items in stock. You can use the following code as an example:\n```php\nfunction get_products_in_stock() {\n    $args = array(\n        'post_type' => 'product',\n        'meta_query' => array(\n            array(\n                'key' => '_stock_status',\n                'value' => 'instock'\n            )\n        )\n    );\n    $products = get_posts( $args );\n    return $products;\n}\n```\n3. Save the plugin file and upload it to your WordPress site.\n4. Test the plugin to ensure that it retrieves only items in stock.\n\nNote: Please make sure to backup your plugin file before making any changes to it."
