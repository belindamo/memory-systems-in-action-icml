  "content": "What a great idea to mix it up with some non-Marvel movies! \"Parasite\" is a thought-provoking film that lingers long after the credits roll, and pairing it with other movies that explore similar themes can create a fascinating and nuanced cinematic experience.\n\nFrom my earlier recommendations, I think \"Shoplifters\" (2018) would pair exceptionally well with \"Parasite\". Both films:\n\n1. Explore the struggles of the working class and the marginalized.\n2. Delve into the complexities of family dynamics and relationships.\n3. Use humor and satire to critique societal issues.\n4. Feature outstanding performances and character development.\n\nThe two films share a similar tone and thematic focus, making them a great pairing for a thought-provoking movie marathon. \"Shoplifters\" is a more understated, character-driven film, while \"Parasite\" is more overtly satirical and dramatic, but both will keep your friends engaged and discussing the themes and characters long after the credits roll.\n\nIf you'd like to include another non-Marvel movie, you could consider \"The Florida Project\" (2017) or \"The Square\" (2017), both of which explore themes of social class, inequality, and the human condition. These films might provide an interesting contrast to the more intimate, character-focused \"Parasite\" and \"Shoplifters\".\n\nRemember to leave some time for discussion and reflection between movies, as these films will likely spark interesting conversations and debates among your friends. Enjoy your movie marathon!",
