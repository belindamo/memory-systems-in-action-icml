Sarah's teaching style is very clear and engaging, and her energy is indeed infectious!\n\nImproving your turns is a great focus area, as it's a fundamental skill in salsa dancing. Here are some tips to help you improve your turns:\n\n**1. Master the basics:** Make sure you have a solid foundation in the basic step, including the rhythm, timing, and weight transfer. Practice the basic step regularly to build muscle memory.\n\n**2. Focus on your core and center:** Engage your core muscles to maintain good posture, balance, and control. Keep your center of gravity over your feet, with your weight evenly distributed between both feet.\n\n**3. Use your hips:** Rotate your hips to generate power and momentum for your turns. Practice moving your hips in a circular motion, keeping them relaxed and fluid.\n\n**4. Keep your arms relaxed:** Avoid tensing up your arms, as this can throw off your balance and timing. Instead, keep them relaxed and soft, using them to frame your body and add style to your turns.\n\n**5. Practice with small steps:** Start with small, slow turns and gradually increase your speed and size as you become more comfortable. This will help you build control and confidence.\n\n**6. Work on your spot:** Focus on a fixed point in front of you, keeping your eyes on that spot as you turn. This will help you maintain direction and prevent dizziness.\n\n**7. Turn with your whole body:** Don't just turn your feet; turn your entire body, including your hips, torso, and arms. This will help you maintain balance and generate power.\n\n**8. Practice with music:** Practice your turns to different rhythms and tempos to improve your timing and adaptability.\n\n**9. Get feedback:** Record yourself turning and analyze your technique. Ask a friend or instructor for feedback on your turns, and work on making adjustments.\n\n**10. Be patient:** Turning is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient with yourself, and don't get discouraged if you don't see improvement right away.\n\nAdditional tips for practicing turns in front of a mirror:\n\n* Practice turning in both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise).\n* Focus on your footwork, making sure to execute clean, precise steps.\n* Pay attention to your posture and alignment, keeping your shoulders relaxed and down.\n* Use the mirror to check your timing, making sure you're turning on the correct beat.\n\nBy following these tips and practicing regularly, you'll see improvement in your turns over time. Remember to stay relaxed, have fun, and enjoy the process of learning and growth!",
