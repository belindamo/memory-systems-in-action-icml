  "content": "another content to table: Seeds\n Light\nThe Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.\n--seed accepts whole numbers 0\u20134294967295.\n--seed values only influence the initial image grid.\n--seed values Model Versions 1, 2, 3, test, and testp are non-deterministic and will produce similar, not identical, images.\nUsing the same prompt+seed+parameters in Model Versions 4 and niji will produce identical images.\n\nSeed Parameter\nIf no Seed is specified, Midjourney will use a randomly generated seed number, producing a wide variety of options each time a prompt is used.\nJobs run three times with random seeds:\nprompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher\n\nAn example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed\nAn example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed\nAn example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed\n\nJobs run two times with --seed 123:\nprompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher --seed 123\n\nAn example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed\nAn example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed\nJobs run three times with --seed 123 using Midjourney Model Version 3:\nprompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher --seed 123 --v 3\n\nEven with the same seed number, early Midjourney Model Versions are non-deterministic, so generated images will look different.\n\nAn example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed\nAn example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed\nAn example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed\nAn example of an image grid made in midjourney V4 with a random seed\nSameseed Parameter\n--seed values create a single large random noise field applied across all images in the initial grid. When --sameseed is specified, all images in the initial grid use the same starting noise and will produce very similar generated images.\n\n--sameseed accepts whole numbers 0\u20134294967295.\n--sameseed is only compatible with Model Versions 1, 2, 3, test, and testp.\n\nEarly visual noise from\n--sameseed\nExample image of early noise field used to generate images with Midjourney parameter sameseed\n--sameseed 12345\n\nFinished Job made with\n--sameseed \nExample image images with Midjourney parameter sameseed\n--sameseed 12345\n\nEarly visual noise without\n--sameseed\nExample image of early noise field used to generate images with Midjourney\n--seed 12345\n\nFinished Job made without\n--sameseed \nExample image image made with Midjourney\n--seed 12345\n\nHow to Find a Job's Seed Number\nUse a Discord Emoji Reaction\nFind the seed number of a Job in discord by reacting with an \u2709\ufe0f envelope emoji to a Job.\n\nAnimated Gif showing how to use the Emoji React with an Envelope in Discord to find a Job's seed number\n\nUse The Show Command to Bring Back Old Jobs\nTo get the seed number for a past image, copy the job ID and use the /show  command with that ID to revive the Job. You can then react to the newly regenerated Job with an \u2709\ufe0f envelope emoji.\n\nHow To Change Seed Numbers\nUse the --seed or --sameseedParameter\nAdd --seed  or --sameseed  to the end of your prompt.\n\nAnimated Gif showing how the Midjourney Seed parameter is typed\nPre",
