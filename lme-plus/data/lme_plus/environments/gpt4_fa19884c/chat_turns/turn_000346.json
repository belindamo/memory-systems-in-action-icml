Golf can be such a thrilling sport, especially when you have a favorite player like Tiger Woods competing.\n\nI'm glad you got to experience the excitement of watching live sports, even if it's just on TV. The Masters is one of the most prestigious tournaments in golf, and Augusta National is such an iconic course. Did you have a favorite moment from the tournament, or was there a particular shot or hole that stood out to you?\n\nAlso, I'm curious - are you a longtime golf fan, or did you start watching the sport recently? And what drew you to Tiger Woods as a fan? Is it his incredible skill, his comeback story, or something else entirely?",
