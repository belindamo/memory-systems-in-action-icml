  "content": "Placing a cake in an ice bath to cool it down faster is not recommended, as it can cause the cake to become soggy, and the texture will not be the same.\n\nWhen you put a warm cake in an ice bath, the temperature will decrease rapidly, which can cause the cake to contract and become dense. This can lead to a loss of volume, making the cake heavy and moist. It can also cause the cake to lose some of its delicate flavors.\n\nWaiting for a cake to cool down can be frustrating, but it's an important step to ensure that your cake is moist, tender, and has a good texture. If you're short on time, try some of the methods we've suggested earlier like cutting the cake into smaller pieces or placing it on a cool surface to help it cool down faster.",
