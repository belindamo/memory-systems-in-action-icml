Here's an updated description that includes the information about the non-profits:\n\nAt our revolutionary t-shirt brand, we're not just committed to providing unique and sustainable fashion for men, women, and children - we're also dedicated to giving back to our community.

Your purchase helps to support these efforts and make a difference in the lives of our nation's veterans.\n\nGulisi Community Primary School, located in Dangriga, Belize, is an elementary school that helps students with scholarships to continue their education. By supporting our brand, you're also supporting the education and growth of children in our global community.\n\nWith our commitment to sustainability, style, and social responsibility, our brand is more than just a fashion statement - it's a movement.
