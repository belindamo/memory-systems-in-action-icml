  "content": "It is not recommended to use a hairdryer to cool down a cake faster. Exposing a cake to a sudden blast of hot air can cause the cake to become lopsided, dense, and unevenly cooked. It can also dry out the surface of the cake and cause cracks or break \"the skin\", reducing the overall quality of the cake.\n\nIt's important to remember that baking is a process that requires patience and attention to detail. While waiting for a cake to cool down can be frustrating, there are several tried and tested methods to ensure that your cake remains moist, tender, and has a great texture. It's best to avoid shortcuts that may compromise the quality of your cake.",
