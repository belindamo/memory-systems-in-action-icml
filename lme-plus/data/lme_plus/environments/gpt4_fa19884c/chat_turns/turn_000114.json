  "content": "I'm training for a triathlon in June, so I want to focus on building my endurance and speed. I can dedicate 4-5 days a week to working out. I prefer morning workouts, so let's schedule those between 6:30-8:30 am. I want each workout to last about 45-60 minutes. I need to schedule around my work hours, so I'm free on weekends and weekday mornings. For strength training, I'm doing weightlifting and bodyweight exercises. I've been doing well with my running lately - I just completed a 5K in 27 minutes and 12 seconds, which was a personal best.",
