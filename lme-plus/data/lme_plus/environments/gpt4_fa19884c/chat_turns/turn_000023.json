However, essential oils can be used as natural cleaning agents due to their antimicrobial and antiseptic properties. Some commonly used essential oils for cleaning include lemon, eucalyptus, tea tree, peppermint, and lavender. Here are some ways you can use essential oils for cleaning around the house:\n\n1. Multi-purpose cleaner: Add several drops of your preferred essential oil(s) to a spray bottle filled with water and a small amount of white vinegar or dish soap. Shake well and use it to clean countertops, floors, and other surfaces.\n\n2. Air freshener: Mix your favorite essential oil with water in a spray bottle and use it to freshen up the air in your home. Lavender, lemon, and peppermint oils are especially useful for this purpose.\n\n3. Laundry detergent: Add several drops of tea tree or lemon essential oil to your laundry detergent to help kill bacteria and freshen up your clothes.\n\nRemember to always use high-quality essential oils and dilute them properly before use. To avoid any damage to surfaces, it's a good idea to test the solution on an inconspicuous area first.",
