That's an amazing achievement, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself!\n\nCompleting a 5K in 27 minutes and 12 seconds is a fantastic time, and it's even more impressive considering it was your first event of the year. You've clearly been putting in the hard work and dedication, and it's paying off.\n\nThis personal best will definitely give you a confidence boost as you continue with your triathlon training. Remember to carry that momentum forward and use it to fuel your motivation for the next few weeks.\n\nNow that we have your training plan in place, I want to emphasize the importance of recovery and rest. Make sure to prioritize rest days and active recovery sessions, as they're crucial for your body to adapt to the increased intensity and frequency of your workouts.\n\nStay focused, stay committed, and most importantly, stay consistent. You got this!",
