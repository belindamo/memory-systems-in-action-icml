  "content": "Yes, traditional gender roles still exist in many parts of the world today, where women are expected to be homemakers and men to be the breadwinners. Cultural and religious norms, as well as economic and social factors, shape gender roles and expectations differently in different societies. For example, in many Arab countries, women are seen as caretakers of the home and children, while men are expected to be the providers. Similarly, in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, women are expected to be subservient to men and have limited access to education and economic opportunities.\n\nWhile some societies have made progress towards gender equality, others are still struggling to overcome deeply ingrained traditions and stereotypes. Therefore, it's crucial to continue advancing gender-sensitive policies, empowering women and girls, and challenging harmful gender norms that limit the potential of both men and women.",
