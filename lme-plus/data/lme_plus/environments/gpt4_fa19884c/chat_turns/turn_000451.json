I've also been trying to convince my friends to join me for dance classes, and so far, only my friend Emily has taken the bait. We took a contemporary dance class together last weekend, and it was really fun. We ended up laughing so much because we were both struggling to get the movements right. We're planning to take another class together soon. Do you have any recommendations for contemporary dance classes or videos that can help me improve my technique?",
