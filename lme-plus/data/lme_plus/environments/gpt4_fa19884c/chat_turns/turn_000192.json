  "content": "As an international organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does not have the legal authority to take punitive measures against countries that violate its guidelines and standards for nuclear technology usage. However, the IAEA can report any concerns to the United Nations Security Council, which may impose sanctions or other measures against the violating country. \n\nThe IAEA's legal mandate is to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It relies on the cooperation of member states to comply with its guidelines and standards voluntarily. In cases where non-compliance is suspected, the IAEA may conduct inspections and report its findings to the member state concerned. The IAEA's ultimate goal is to encourage the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and ensure that its member states are in compliance with international nuclear safeguards and security standards.",
