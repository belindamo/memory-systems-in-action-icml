  "content": "I'm excited to dive into these non-fiction books and start improving my productivity and time management skills. I think it's great that you provided a mix of classic and more recent books, so I can get a sense of different approaches and perspectives.\n\nBy the way, I've been thinking about my reading habits and how I can make the most of my commute. I've been listening to audiobooks during my daily commute, which has been great, but I'm considering switching to e-books or physical books for my commute. Do you have any recommendations on how to make the most of my commute for reading, whether it's with audiobooks, e-books, or physical books?",
