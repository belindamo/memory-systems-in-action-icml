  "content": "The second step of the Design Thinking process is \"Define.\" In this step, the goal is to define the problem statement and identify the needs and pain points of the car owner. This step involves empathizing with the car owner and gaining a deeper understanding of their perspective and the impact the car problem is having on their life.\n\nTo define the problem statement, the car owner and the design team need to answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the car problem? This includes identifying the specific symptoms, such as the weird sounds and black smoke, and any other contributing factors.\n2. How is the car problem impacting the car owner's daily life? This includes considering the car owner's needs, pain points, and the consequences of the car problem, such as inconvenience, stress, and potential safety risks.\n3. What is the goal of solving the car problem? This includes understanding what the car owner wants to achieve by addressing the car problem, such as restoring the car to safe and reliable condition, minimizing the cost and time spent on repairs, and reducing stress and inconvenience.\n\nBy answering these questions, the design team can develop a clear problem statement that summarizes the car owner's needs, pain points, and goals. For example, the problem statement might be:\n\n\"Our car owner is experiencing weird sounds and black smoke from their car's engine, which is causing inconvenience and potential safety risks. They need a solution that is cost-effective, timely, and restores their car to safe and reliable condition.\"\n\nDefining the problem statement in this way allows the design team to empathize with the car owner and focus their efforts on developing solutions that meet the car owner's needs and goals. It also provides a clear direction for the rest of the Design Thinking process, as the team begins to ideate, prototype, and test potential solutions to the car problem.",
