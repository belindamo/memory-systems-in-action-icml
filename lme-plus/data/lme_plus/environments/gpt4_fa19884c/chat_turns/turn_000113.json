What are your fitness goals? (e.g., running a certain distance, increasing endurance, building strength)\n2. How many days per week can you dedicate to working out?\n3. What are your preferred workout days and times? (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday mornings; Tuesday, Thursday evenings)\n4. How long do you want each workout to last? (e.g., 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour)\n5. Do you have any rest days or non-negotiable commitments (e.g., work, family time) that you need to schedule around?\n6. What type of strength training do you want to do? (e.g., weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, yoga)\n7. Do you have any specific running or biking goals (e.g., increasing mileage, completing a certain number of workouts per week)?\n8. Would you like to include any cross-training activities (e.g., swimming, hiking, Pilates)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a personalized workout calendar for the next few weeks.\n\nYou can also use a template or a calendar tool like Google Calendar, Microsoft Excel, or a physical planner to create your workout schedule.
