  "content": "A carburetor is a mechanical device that mixes air and fuel for an internal combustion engine. It uses a combination of suction created by the engine's vacuum and a venturi to draw fuel into the airflow, creating a mixture of air and fuel that can be burned in the engine's cylinders. The carburetor also has a throttle valve that regulates the amount of air and fuel entering the engine, allowing the engine to be accelerated or decelerated. The carburetor is adjusted using screws that control the fuel-to-air ratio, idle speed, and other parameters, allowing it to be tuned for specific engine and driving conditions. In modern vehicles, carburetors have been largely replaced by fuel injection systems, which offer improved performance, efficiency, and emission control.",
