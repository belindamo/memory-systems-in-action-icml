Incorporating strength training can help improve your running efficiency, reduce your risk of injury, and enhance your overall performance. Here are some specific exercises that target your core, legs, and glutes, which are essential for half-marathon training:\n\n**Core Exercises:**\n\n1. **Plank:** Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise strengthens your core, improves posture, and reduces the risk of injuries.\n2. **Russian twists:** Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Twist your torso to left and right, touching your hands to the ground each time. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n3. **Leg raises:** Lie on your back with arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n4. **Side plank (each side):** Hold a side plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat on the other side. This exercise targets your obliques and glute medius.\n\n**Leg and Glute Exercises:**\n\n1. **Squats:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and squat down, keeping your back straight and knees behind your toes. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n2. **Lunges:** Perform walking lunges or stationary lunges, keeping your back straight and front knee behind your toes. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps (per leg).\n3. **Deadlifts:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold dumbbells or a barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lift the weight up, keeping your back straight and core engaged, and lower it back down to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 8-12 reps.\n4. **Calf raises:** Stand on a step or platform and raise up onto your toes, then lower back down. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n5. **Glute bridges:** Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lift your hips up towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top, and lower back down. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Incorporate plyometric exercises:** Exercises like jump squats, box jumps, and step-ups can help improve your explosive power and running efficiency.\n* **Focus on functional exercises:** Exercises that mimic running movements, such as step-ups and lunges, can help improve your running form and strength.\n* **Incorporate single-leg exercises:** Exercises like single-leg squats and single-leg deadlifts can help improve your balance, stability, and running efficiency.\n* **Don't forget to stretch and foam roll:** Make sure to stretch and foam roll your muscles after strength training to aid in recovery and reduce muscle soreness.\n\nRemember to start with lower weights and higher reps, and gradually increase the weight and intensity as you build strength. It's also essential to listen to your body and rest when needed. Incorporate these exercises into your routine 1-2 times a week, and make sure to allow for recovery time between strength training sessions.",
