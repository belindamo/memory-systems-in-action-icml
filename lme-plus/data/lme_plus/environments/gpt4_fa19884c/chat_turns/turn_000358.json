  "content": "While it may be tempting to put a cake in the fridge to help the frosting to set faster, it is generally not recommended to apply frosting to a cake before it is completely cool, as the frosting may melt and slide off or become runny.\n\nPutting a warm cake in the fridge with frosting on it can also cause condensation to form on the surface of the frosting, making it look unappetizing and potentially ruining its texture. Additionally, the cake may not taste as good, as the flavors may not have had time to develop properly.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, it's best to let a cake cool completely before frosting it. This will help the frosting to set properly and ensure that your cake looks and tastes its best. If you're in a rush, you can try some of the methods mentioned earlier to cool it down faster.",
