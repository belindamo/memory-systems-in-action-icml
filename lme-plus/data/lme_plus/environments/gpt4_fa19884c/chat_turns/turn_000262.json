  "content": "Longfellow's portrayal of Evangeline was in line with the prevailing perceptions of women during the era in which the poem was written. In the 19th century, women were primarily seen as caregivers and nurturers, responsible for maintaining the home and family. Evangeline is depicted as the ideal Victorian woman, who is pure, gentle, and selfless, and her sole purpose is to love Gabriel, her soulmate. She is a model of virtue, compassion, and faith, and she sacrifices everything for the sake of her beloved. This portrayal of Evangeline reinforces the traditional gender roles of the time, where women were expected to be submissive, obedient, and dedicated to their families. Thus, Longfellow's poem reflects the dominant attitudes towards women in the 19th century.",
