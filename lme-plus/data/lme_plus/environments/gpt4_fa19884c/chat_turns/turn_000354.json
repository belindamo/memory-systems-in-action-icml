  "content": "I don't have personal preferences, but to keep your cake moist and tender it's best not to leave it too long in the freezer. ideally, you should leave the cake in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes. any longer than that, and it may become too hard and difficult to frost. if you accidentally leave it in the freezer for too long, you can still bring it back to room temperature by letting it sit at room temperature by covering it with a clean kitchen towel, this helps to prevent the cake from drying out. make sure to monitor the cake as it thaws to ensure it doesn't become too soft or start to melt.",
