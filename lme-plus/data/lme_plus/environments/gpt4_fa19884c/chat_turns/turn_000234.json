Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Big Hero 6** (2014) - This animated Marvel movie is often overlooked, but it's a heartwarming and action-packed adventure that explores themes of grief, friendship, and redemption.\n2. **Ant-Man** (2015) - While not entirely unknown, Ant-Man is often overshadowed by other Marvel movies. It's a fun, lighthearted heist film with a great cast, including Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Douglas.\n3. **Doctor Strange** (2016) - While it received positive reviews, Doctor Strange might not be as widely discussed as other Marvel movies. It's a visually stunning film that explores the mystical side of the Marvel Universe, with Benedict Cumberbatch shining as the titular character.\n4. **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2** (2017) - The sequel to the beloved Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 is often overlooked in favor of its predecessor. However, it's a beautiful, emotional, and hilarious film that delves deeper into the characters' backstories.\n5. **Black Panther** (2018) - Okay, this one might not be entirely underrated, but it's still an incredible film that deserves more attention. It's a cultural phenomenon that celebrates African culture, features a predominantly black cast, and boasts stunning world-building.\n6. **The Incredible Hulk** (2008) - This Edward Norton-starring film is often forgotten in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) conversation. However, it's a solid, character-driven movie that explores Bruce Banner's struggles and sets the stage for the MCU's future.\n7. **Iron Man 3** (2013) - Shane Black's Iron Man 3 is a darker, more personal take on the Tony Stark character. It's a well-crafted film that explores themes of PTSD, anxiety, and the blurred lines between heroism and obsession.\n\nThese movies offer a mix of action, adventure, humor, and heart, making them perfect additions to your Marvel movie marathon. Enjoy your movie night with your friends!",
