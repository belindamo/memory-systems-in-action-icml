The fuel economy of a Ford F-150 varies depending on the engine, drivetrain, and configuration. Here are some approximate fuel economy estimates for different Ford F-150 models:\n\n* 2.7L EcoBoost V6:\n\t+ 2WD: 20 MPG combined (18 city, 24 highway)\n\t+ 4WD: 19 MPG combined (17 city, 23 highway)\n* 3.5L EcoBoost V6:\n\t+ 2WD: 18 MPG combined (16 city, 22 highway)\n\t+ 4WD: 17 MPG combined (15 city, 21 highway)\n* 5.0L V8:\n\t+ 2WD: 17 MPG combined (15 city, 22 highway)\n\t+ 4WD: 16 MPG combined (14 city, 20 highway)\n\nKeep in mind that these are EPA estimates, and actual fuel economy may vary depending on several factors, such as:\n\n* Driving habits (e.g., aggressive acceleration, idling)\n* Load and towing capacity\n* Road conditions (e.g., hills, mountains)\n* Weather (e.g., extreme temperatures, wind)\n* Tire pressure and condition\n\nTo improve fuel efficiency on your trip:\n\n* Make sure your truck is properly maintained, with regular oil changes, air filter replacements, and proper tire pressure.\n* Drive smoothly and maintain a consistent speed, especially on the highway.\n* Avoid idling for extended periods, and turn off the engine when stopped for more than 30 seconds.\n* Remove any unnecessary weight or accessories that can decrease fuel efficiency.\n* Consider using cruise control on long highway stretches to maintain a constant speed.\n* Plan your route in advance to avoid traffic and construction, which can lower fuel efficiency.\n\nFor your Grand Canyon trip, you can estimate your fuel costs using online tools or apps like GasBuddy or AAA's Fuel Cost Calculator. Be sure to factor in the fuel efficiency of your specific Ford F-150 model and the driving conditions you'll encounter.\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you have a fantastic time at the Grand Canyon!",
