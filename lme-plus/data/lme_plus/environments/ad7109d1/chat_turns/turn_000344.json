This way, you're not limiting the options and allowing users to express their unique opinions.\n\nHere's an updated version of the poll question:\n\n\"Who's your favorite character in the new Marvel movie?\nA) [Main Hero]\nB) [Supporting Hero]\nC) [Villain]\nD) Other (tell us in the comments!)\"\n\nBy including the \"(tell us in the comments!)\" part, you're encouraging users to share their thoughts and opinions in the comments section, which can lead to even more engagement and discussion.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that including an \"Other\" option might split the votes and make it harder to get a clear winner. But, on the other hand, it can also provide valuable insights into the diversity of opinions within your audience.\n\nIf you're concerned about the vote-splitting, you could consider listing 3-4 characters and then including an \"Other\" option. This way, you're still providing some clear options while allowing users to express their unique preferences.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours! \ud83d\ude0a",
