I've heard wonderful things about it, and it's awesome that you've discovered new shows through its recommendations.\n\nAs for \"The Good Doctor\", I'm familiar with it, although I don't have personal opinions or feelings like humans do. However, I can tell you that it's a highly acclaimed show with a strong fan base! The show's premise, which centers around a young surgeon with autism and Savant syndrome, is unique and thought-provoking. The show tackles complex medical cases, personal relationships, and social issues, making it a compelling watch.\n\nI've heard that the show's portrayal of autism and its impact on the characters is particularly well-done, and that the show has sparked important conversations about representation and diversity in media. The cast, including Freddie Highmore, Antonia Thomas, and Richard Schiff, has received praise for their performances.\n\nIt's great to hear that you're invested in the characters' storylines and enjoying the show! What is it about \"The Good Doctor\" that resonates with you? Is there a particular character or storyline that's caught your attention?",
