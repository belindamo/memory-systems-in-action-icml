  "content": "Booking a shuttle service during non-peak hours can help you avoid traffic and ensure you get to the airport on time without any stress. However, the cost of the shuttle service might be a bit higher during non-peak hours compared to standard rates during peak hours.\n\nIt's up to you to decide if the additional cost is worth it. If you prioritize convenience, comfort, and your peace of mind, then booking a shuttle service during non-peak hours is a good option. On the other hand, if the cost is a major concern, and you can handle some traffic delays and potential stress, then booking a shuttle service during standard peak hours might be a better choice.\n\nUltimately, your decision will depend on your personal preferences and priorities, as well as the specific circumstances of your trip.",
