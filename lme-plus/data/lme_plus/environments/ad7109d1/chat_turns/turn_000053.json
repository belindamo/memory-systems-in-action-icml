  "content": "Schooling fish like Lemon Tetras and Zebra Danios are a great addition to a community tank, and they can thrive with your existing fish. Here's how they might interact with your current tankmates:\n\n**Lemon Tetras:**\n\n* Compatibility with Neon Tetras: Lemon Tetras are similar in size and temperament to Neon Tetras, and they can school together peacefully. They might even form a mixed school, which can be a beautiful sight.\n* Compatibility with Golden Honey Gouramis: Lemon Tetras are too fast and agile for Golden Honey Gouramis to catch, and they're not likely to be seen as a threat. However, if the Gouramis are particularly fin-nippy, they might target the Lemon Tetras' long fins.\n* Compatibility with Pleco Catfish: Lemon Tetras are too small to bother the Pleco, and they'll likely ignore each other.\n\n**Zebra Danios:**\n\n* Compatibility with Neon Tetras: Zebra Danios are active, hardy fish that can hold their own against Neon Tetras. They might chase each other playfully, but they're not aggressive and will generally coexist peacefully.\n* Compatibility with Golden Honey Gouramis: Zebra Danios are too fast and active for Golden Honey Gouramis to catch, and they're not likely to be seen as a threat. However, if the Gouramis are particularly fin-nippy, they might target the Danios' fins.\n* Compatibility with Pleco Catfish: Zebra Danios are too small and agile to bother the Pleco, and they'll likely ignore each other.\n\nSome general tips to keep in mind when introducing schooling fish:\n\n* Introduce them in a school of 6-10 or more to reduce stress and territorial behavior.\n* Provide plenty of hiding places and visual barriers to help them feel secure.\n* Ensure your tank is large enough to accommodate the additional biomass and provide ample swimming space.\n* Monitor your water parameters and perform regular water changes to maintain a healthy environment.\n\nBoth Lemon Tetras and Zebra Danios are excellent choices for a community tank, and they can add a lot of visual interest and activity to your aquarium. Just remember to research their specific care requirements and ensure you can provide the best environment for them to thrive.",
