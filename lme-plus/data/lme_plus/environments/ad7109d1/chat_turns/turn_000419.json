However, being part of an online community is an excellent way to network with other freelance writers who might have knowledge of high-paying gig opportunities or connections with clients or companies that match your skill set. In addition, many of these communities offer job boards or regularly updated lists of available freelance writing gigs that you would not otherwise have access to.
