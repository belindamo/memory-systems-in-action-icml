  "content": "I'm thinking of adding some new fish to my Serenity tank, specifically a school of dwarf gouramis. Before I do, I want to make sure they'll get along with my existing neon tetras and corydoras catfish. Can you tell me a bit about the temperament and social requirements of dwarf gouramis? By the way, I did a major water change recently, replacing about 30% of the tank's water with fresh, dechlorinated water, so the tank's water quality is pretty good right now.",
