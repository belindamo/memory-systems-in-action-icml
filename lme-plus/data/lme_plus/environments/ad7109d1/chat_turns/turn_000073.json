While there have been changes and modernization in education systems of East Asian countries, Confucian values and principles continue to play a significant role in shaping educational policy and practice.\n\nIn countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, there is still a strong emphasis on academic achievement, respect for authority, and the cultivation of moral character in education. For example, in China, traditional Confucian values are still taught in schools, and students are encouraged to respect their teachers and elders. In South Korea, parents and teachers place a high value on academic achievement, and there is a strong emphasis on learning and memory retention.\n\nAlthough there are some challenges and criticisms regarding the impact and relevance of Confucianism in modern education systems, many educators and scholars still recognize its value in promoting academic rigor, moral education, and the development of responsible citizens. Confucianism has also played a role in shaping the cultural identity of East Asian societies, and its influence can still be seen in many aspects of daily life, including education.",
