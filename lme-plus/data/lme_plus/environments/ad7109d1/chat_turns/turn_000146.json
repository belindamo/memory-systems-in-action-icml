  "content": "Steroids are a common treatment for sarcoidosis, but they may not be the best option for everyone. The best treatment for sarcoidosis depends on the severity of the disease and the organs that are affected. Some people with sarcoidosis may not have any symptoms and may not need treatment. Others may need medications to help manage their symptoms and prevent complications.\n\nIn addition to steroids, other medications that may be used to treat sarcoidosis include:\n\n* Immunosuppressants: These medications help reduce the activity of the immune system and can be used to treat severe cases of sarcoidosis that do not respond to steroids.\n* Biologics: These are medications that are made from living cells and are used to treat severe cases of sarcoidosis that do not respond to other treatments.\n* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These medications can help reduce inflammation and pain, and may be used in combination with steroids to treat mild to moderate cases of sarcoidosis.\n\nIt is important for a person with sarcoidosis to work with their healthcare team to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for their individual needs. This may involve trying different medications or a combination of medications.",
