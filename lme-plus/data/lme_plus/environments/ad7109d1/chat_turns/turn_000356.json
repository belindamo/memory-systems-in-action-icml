  "content": "Boston is a busy city with heavy traffic, and it's important to account for traffic delays when planning your trip to the airport. During peak hours, traffic congestion can increase significantly, so it's important to plan accordingly. In general, rush hour traffic in Boston is usually from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM in the morning and 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM in the evening. It's advisable to avoid these peak hours if possible and schedule your pickup and drop-off times accordingly. If you have a morning flight, it's recommended to book your shuttle service pickup time at least 2-3 hours before your flight departure time to ensure that you arrive at the airport with plenty of time to spare. Similarly, if you have an evening flight, you might consider scheduling your pickup time well in advance to ensure that you can navigate through rush hour traffic. Additionally, you can also use apps like Google Maps or Waze to check the real-time traffic situation and estimate the travel time to the airport. This can be especially helpful in ensuring a timely arrival at the airport.",
