  "content": "A pacemaker may be recommended for people with sarcoidosis who have abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias that are not well-controlled with medication. A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted in the chest and helps regulate the heart's rhythm. It uses electrical signals to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.\n\nPacemakers are usually recommended for people with arrhythmias that are causing symptoms, such as palpitations, dizziness, or fainting. They may also be recommended for people with arrhythmias that are putting them at risk of serious complications, such as heart failure or stroke.\n\nPacemakers are generally safe and effective, but they do carry some risks, such as infection, bleeding, and damage to blood vessels or nerves. Before deciding whether a pacemaker is appropriate, a healthcare provider will consider a number of factors, including the severity of the arrhythmia, the presence of other medical conditions, and the person's overall health.",
