I'm glad I could help with some recommendations for your Grand Canyon trip.\n\nThe Hoover Dam and Valley of Fire State Park are both fantastic stops, and I'm sure you'll enjoy them. The Hoover Dam is an engineering marvel, and the Valley of Fire is a unique and breathtaking natural wonder. Be sure to take plenty of photos and soak up the scenery.\n\nIt's great that you're taking some time to recover from your Yellowstone trip, but I'm sure you're all excited to get back out on the road and explore more of the American West. The Grand Canyon is definitely a bucket-list destination, and I'm sure you'll have an amazing time with your friends.\n\nDon't forget to stay hydrated, wear sunscreen, and take breaks during the drive. The desert heat can be unforgiving, especially during the summer months. But with some planning and preparation, I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time and make some unforgettable memories.\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you have an amazing time at the Grand Canyon!",
