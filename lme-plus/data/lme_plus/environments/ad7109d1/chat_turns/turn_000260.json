  "content": "Kuru has been largely eliminated, although there are still occasional cases reported in Papua New Guinea. The disease was most prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s among the Fore people of Papua New Guinea, who practiced cannibalism as part of their funerary rites.\n\nKuru is caused by a prion protein, similar to the one that causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or \"mad cow\" disease) in cows. The prion protein is thought to have been transmitted to the Fore people through the consumption of infected human brain tissue during cannibalistic rituals.\n\nThe course of kuru infection is characterized by a long incubation period of several years, followed by progressive neurological symptoms such as tremors, difficulty walking, and dementia. The disease is fatal, and death usually occurs within a year after the onset of symptoms.\n\nThe host animal for kuru is humans themselves, as the disease was transmitted through the consumption of infected human brain tissue during cannibalistic rituals.",
