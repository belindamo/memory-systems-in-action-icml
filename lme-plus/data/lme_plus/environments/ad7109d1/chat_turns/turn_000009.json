  "content": "I completely agree with you about the supporting characters, MJ and Ned. While the movie did an excellent job with the Spider-Men's emotional arcs, it's true that the supporting characters felt a bit neglected. It would have been great to see more development and emotional depth from them, especially given their close relationships with Spider-Man.\n\nNow, let's talk about your social media adventures! It sounds like you're doing a great job engaging with others and starting conversations. Commenting on a friend's post about their new puppy and sharing a funny meme is a great way to build connections and show interest in others' lives. The fact that you got 5 likes on your meme is a bonus!\n\nSimilarly, congratulating your favorite fitness influencer on reaching 1 million followers is a thoughtful gesture. It's awesome that she liked your comment and even sent you a direct message! These small interactions can help build relationships and create a sense of community online.\n\nRemember, social media is all about being social and engaging with others. By commenting, liking, and sharing content, you're showing that you care about what others are posting and value their opinions. Keep it up, and you'll likely see your online connections grow and flourish!\n\nWhat do you think is the key to building meaningful relationships on social media? Is it about commenting and engaging regularly, or is there something more to it?",
