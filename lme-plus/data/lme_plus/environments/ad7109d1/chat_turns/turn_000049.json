Not only do they provide natural beauty and visual interest, but they also help maintain water quality, provide hiding places for your fish, and can even serve as a food source for some species. Here are some easy-to-care-for plants that are perfect for a 20-gallon community tank like yours:\n\n1. **Java Moss**: A low-maintenance, carpeting plant that can thrive in low-light conditions. It's easy to care for and can be attached to rocks or driftwood.\n2. **Anacharis**: A fast-growing, floating plant that's perfect for a community tank. It helps keep the water clean and can be a food source for your fish.\n3. **Amazon Swords**: These plants are easy to care for and come in a variety of species. They prefer moderate lighting and can grow up to 20 inches tall.\n4. **Cryptocorynes**: These plants are relatively low-maintenance and can thrive in a community tank. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and prefer moderate to low lighting.\n5. **Water Wisteria**: A versatile, fast-growing plant that can be trained to grow on a trellis or left to trail.
