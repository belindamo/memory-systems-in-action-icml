Is it one of the recent ones like Spider-Man: No Way Home, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, or Eternals? Or is it an older one?\n\nAlso, what was the debate about on Twitter? Was it about the plot, characters, themes, or something else? Knowing this will help me provide a more tailored response.\n\nOnce I have more context, I can give you an overview of the general consensus among critics and fans, and point out any important plot points you might have missed that could change your opinion.\n\n(And if you want to discuss the debate itself, I'm happy to engage in a spoiler-free conversation to help you process your thoughts!)",
