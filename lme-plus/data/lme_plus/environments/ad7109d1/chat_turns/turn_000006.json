  "content": "I might check out Loki and What If...? on Disney+ since I'm already subscribed. I've heard great things about them, and it's interesting to see how they explore the multiverse concept. I'm also curious to see how the MCU will develop this concept further in future movies and shows. By the way, have you seen any interesting articles or posts about the movie's plot or themes recently? I've been trying to stay engaged with others on social media and discuss movies like this one.",
