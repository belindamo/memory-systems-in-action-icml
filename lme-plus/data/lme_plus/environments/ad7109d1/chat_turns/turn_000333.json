People who are madly in love can fall madly in love with somebody who's married, who lives on the other side of the planet, who comes from a different religion.\n00:14\n And somehow, they'll say to themselves, we'll work it out, we can work this out. Because of all that energy of intense romantic love. Over time, as this whole neurotransmitter thing settles out, what's left? TED FISCHER: We define romantic love as an intense desire for another, with the expectation that it's gonna persist into the future.\n00:45\nAnd that distinguishes it from lust, which is generally fleeting, and also for more companionship love, which doesn't have that intensity of desire, that you want to possess the other in some way. GAIL SALTZ: Studies have looked at activity in the brain when recalling passionate or romantic love, versus say maternal love, and finds that different centers definitely are more active.\n01:19\nAnd they would, say, put people into the functional MRI, and they said, think about your partner, or think about your lover. And certain areas lit up, or they said, think about your mom, and different areas lit up. Which is important, because different areas are responsible for the release of different neurotransmitters. Which then come to affect your future feeling states and future behaviors.\n01:45\nDuring romantic or passionate love, what happens from a neurotransmitter standpoint, those chemicals that are released when you have that particular experience? Dopamine goes up. Dopamine is essentially the neurotransmitter of reward. So it is a neurotransmitter that's released when you have new or novel experience, but particularly experiences that are reinforcing. Like gambling. Or something that is really addictive.\n02:08\nIn fact, literally addictive. It's the neurotransmitter if you snorted cocaine that is most responsible for, wow, that was great, and I totally wanna do it again. So that is a neurotransmitter that definitely goes up when you are in the throes of romantic or passionate love. And what does that mean for you? It means that you're gonna feel the sense of being addicted to your partner. \n02:35\nAnd in fact, it's also the neurotransmitter that goes up for people who have obsessive compulsive disorder. Does that mean you're gonna develop OCD? No. But what it does mean is you're probably going to obsess over your partner. In comes another neurotransmitter, that's called serotonin.\n02:55\nIt is definitely a neurotransmitter that is active for obsessive compulsive disorder. And for depression. Do you become depressed? No, you really don't. But what you do do is a feature of depression called rumination. So you think about your partner over and over and over again in this really obsessive manner.\n03:23\n And, if your partner is separated from you, you're going to have this longing, where you're wanting to be with them, kind of like you'd want to be with a drug if it was taken away from you and you were already addicted to it. There are changes in other neurotransmitters as well. So if you're physically with your partner, the neurotransmitter oxytocin, which is kind of known as the cuddle neurotransmitter, and that makes you feel warm, and snuggly, and intensely bonded to this person. \n03:53\nIt is particularly released following orgasm. So, you know, if you're having sex with your partner, and things go well, you're gonna feel very attached to them, exceedingly intimate with them. Partially because of that neurotransmitter. There are other neurotransmitters that actually also change.\n04:15\nVasopressin, which has to do with stress level. There's this whole release of neurotransmitters that make you feel very obsessed, very addicted, thinking constantly about them, very intimately, cuddly, attached, and stressed. Actually, it is a stressful condition, to some degree, to be really into your partner. HELEN FISHER: One of the problems with early stage intense feelings of romantic love is that it's part of the oldest parts of the brain that become activated.\n04:47\nBrain regions linked with drive, with craving, with obsession, with motivation. And in fact, some cognitive regions up in the prefrontal cortex that have evolved much more recently begin to shut down. Brain regions linked with decision-making, planning ahead. As people who are madly in love can fall madly in love with somebody who's married, who lives on the other side of the planet, who comes from a different religion. \n05:12\nAnd somehow they'll say to themselves, we'll work it out, we can work this out. Because of all that energy of intense romantic love. And also the shutting down of various brain systems linked with decision-making. So one of the things that I say to people is before you decide to marry somebody, spend a good deal of time with them.",
