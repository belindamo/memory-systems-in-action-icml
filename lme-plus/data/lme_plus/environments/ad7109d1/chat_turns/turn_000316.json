  "content": "1. Exploring how the research question can be answered:\n* Once a research question has been identified, the next step is to explore how it can be answered. This may involve identifying the specific methods or techniques that will be used to gather data and information, as well as any potential challenges or limitations of the research.\n\nSample prompt: \"I have identified a research question about the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. How can I explore how this question can be answered?\"\n\n* The language model can assist in this step by suggesting relevant research methods or techniques that may be appropriate for answering the research question. It can also provide recommendations for sources of data or information that may be useful for the research.\n\nSample prompt: \"I am interested in using field observations and experiments to answer my research question about the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Can you suggest any additional research methods or techniques that I should consider, or any sources of data or information that may be useful for the research?\"\n\n* It is also important to consider any potential challenges or limitations of the research. The language model can assist by pointing out any potential pitfalls or issues that may arise during the research process and by providing recommendations for how to address them.\n\nSample prompt: \"I am aware of some potential challenges and limitations of my research on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, such as limited access to certain data sources or difficulties in collecting data in certain locations. Can you suggest any strategies for addressing these challenges and limitations?\"",
