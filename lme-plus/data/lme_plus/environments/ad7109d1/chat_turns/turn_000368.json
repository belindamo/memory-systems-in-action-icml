Nighttime cityscapes can be a fascinating subject for photography, and it's wonderful that you had the opportunity to improve your skills in composition and lighting.\n\nComposition is such a crucial aspect of photography, and nighttime cityscapes offer a unique set of challenges, such as working with artificial light sources, capturing motion, and balancing exposure. I'm sure you must have learned a lot from the workshop.\n\nLighting, in particular, is a critical element in nighttime photography. Did you find that the workshop helped you understand how to work with the available light in the city, such as streetlights, building lights, or even the moon?
