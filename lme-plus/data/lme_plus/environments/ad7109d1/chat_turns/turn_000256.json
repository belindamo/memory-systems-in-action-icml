  "content": "Unfortunately, information on the progression of symptoms experienced by the woman in Australia is limited, and it is not publicly known whether her symptoms were mild for a long time before her death or if they attacked quickly.\n\nRegarding the accuracy of your recounting of the story, the only minor inaccuracy is that the woman did not die \"many months\" after her encounter with the bat. According to the news reports, she died two and a half years after the encounter, which is a much longer timeframe than a few months.\n\nThe discovery of bat lyssavirus in Australia did cause concern among the public, and it led to increased awareness of the risks associated with contact with bats and other wildlife. In response to the discovery of the virus, health authorities in Australia implemented a range of measures to reduce the risk of transmission, including public health campaigns to educate the public about the risks and measures to protect against infection.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the risk of transmission of bat lyssavirus to humans in Australia is relatively low, as only a small percentage of bats carry the virus, and transmission usually requires direct contact with an infected animal's saliva or neural tissue. As such, the virus has not caused significant disruptions to people's lives in Australia, and it is generally not a cause for widespread fear or panic.",
