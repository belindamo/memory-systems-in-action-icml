  "content": "Mizoram's primary industry is agriculture, and it is a significant contributor to the state's economy. However, compared to other industries in Mizoram and the region, such as hydroelectric power, tourism, and handloom and handicrafts, agriculture plays a relatively smaller role. In the country as a whole, agriculture is a major sector, accounting for around 16% of employment and over 13% of GDP.
