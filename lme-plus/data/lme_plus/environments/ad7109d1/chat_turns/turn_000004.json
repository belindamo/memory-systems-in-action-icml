  "content": "I think the themes and emotional resonance were definitely the strongest parts of the movie. I loved the scenes between Tom Holland's Spider-Man and the other Spider-Men, and I felt like the movie really captured the sense of responsibility and duty that comes with being a superhero. However, I still feel like the multiverse concept overshadowed the character development in some ways. Do you think there are any other Marvel movies or shows that handled the concept of the multiverse better?",
