Here are a few examples that might interest you:\n\n1. **Doctor Strange (2016)**: This movie introduced the concept of the multiverse in the MCU, and it did an excellent job of explaining the basics of alternate dimensions and timelines. The film's visuals and action sequences were also praised for bringing the mystic arts to life.\n2. **Loki (Disney+ series, 2021)**: This show delved deeper into the concept of the multiverse, exploring the idea of branching timelines and the consequences of altering reality. It also introduced the TVA (Time Variance Authority), which regulates the multiverse and prevents rogue timelines from forming.\n3. **What If...? (Disney+ series, 2021)**: This animated series is an anthology of alternate scenarios based on events from the MCU movies. It showcases the infinite possibilities of the multiverse, with each episode exploring a different \"what if\" scenario. The show does an excellent job of exploring the consequences of different choices and outcomes.\n4. **Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)**: Although not part of the MCU, this animated movie is a fantastic example of multiverse storytelling. It introduces Miles Morales as Spider-Man and explores the concept of parallel universes, each with their own Spider-People. The film's visuals, style, and storytelling are all highly acclaimed.\n\nThese examples might provide a more satisfying exploration of the multiverse concept for you. Doctor Strange and Loki offer a more grounded, mystical approach, while What If...? and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse showcase the infinite possibilities of the multiverse in a more fantastical way.\n\nDo you think you'll explore any of these options, or are you more interested in seeing how the MCU develops the multiverse concept further in future movies and shows?",
