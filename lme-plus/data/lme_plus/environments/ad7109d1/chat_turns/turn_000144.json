  "content": "Steroids are a type of medication that can be used to reduce inflammation in people with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a disease that occurs when the body's immune system becomes overactive and produces too many granulomas, or clumps of immune cells. These granulomas can cause inflammation and scarring in different organs of the body.\n\nSteroids work by reducing the activity of the immune system. This can help reduce inflammation and prevent the formation of new granulomas. Steroids are usually taken by mouth in the form of tablets, but they can also be given as injections or inhalers.\n\nSteroids are generally effective at reducing inflammation and improving symptoms in people with sarcoidosis. However, they can have side effects, such as weight gain, acne, and mood changes. They may also weaken the immune system, making a person more susceptible to infections.\n\nSteroids are usually used to treat mild to moderate cases of sarcoidosis. Severe cases may require stronger medications or a combination of medications. It is important for a person with sarcoidosis to work with their healthcare team to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for their individual needs.",
