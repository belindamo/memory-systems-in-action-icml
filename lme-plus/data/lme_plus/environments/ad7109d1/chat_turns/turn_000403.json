In addition to talking with others, here are some other strategies that may help:\n\n1. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness involves being present in the moment and focusing on your thoughts and feelings without judgment. By practicing mindfulness, you can cultivate a greater awareness of your emotions and learn to detach from them in a healthy way.\n\n2. Exercise: Exercise has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Even a short walk or jog can help release endorphins, which can boost your mood and reduce stress.\n\n3. Engage in activities you enjoy: Doing things you enjoy can help you feel more positive and energized. Whether it's reading a book, listening to music, or painting, taking the time to engage in activities you enjoy can help you feel better.\n\n4. Seek professional help: If your negative emotions are interfering with your daily life, it may be helpful to seek professional help. A therapist or mental health professional can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies that work for you. \n\nRemember, it may be a long and difficult road to overcome negative emotions like guilt and shame, but with the right support and strategies, it is possible to move forward and live a fulfilling life.",
