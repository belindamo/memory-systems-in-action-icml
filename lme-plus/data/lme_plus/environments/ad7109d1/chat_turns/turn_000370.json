  "content": "It sounds like you had a great instructor in Michael Lee, and he taught you some valuable techniques for capturing stunning nighttime cityscapes.\n\nUsing slower shutter speeds and wider apertures is a great way to let more light into the camera, but it does require a steady hand or a tripod to avoid camera shake and blur. Bracketing and merging photos is also a fantastic technique for capturing a wider dynamic range, especially in high-contrast scenes like nighttime cityscapes.\n\nBracketing involves taking multiple photos of the same scene at different exposure levels, and then merging them later using software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. This technique allows you to capture a much wider range of tones and details in your image, from the brightest highlights to the darkest shadows.\n\nDid you find that the workshop helped you to develop a new appreciation for the technical aspects of photography, such as understanding exposure, aperture, and shutter speed? Or did you focus more on the creative aspects, like composition and visual storytelling?\n\nAlso, have you had a chance to apply the techniques you learned in the workshop to other photography projects or scenes?",
