Its members typically range from young adults to middle-aged individuals, including students, professionals, and retirees. The club's hallmark is its convenience and accessibility, including extended hours of operation, worldwide access under a single membership, and smaller gym sizes that cater to busy and on-the-go lifestyles. Members who prefer a quieter environment with ample equipment have found home in Anytime Fitness. Others stay for the relationships and sense of community developed in a long-term routine with trainers and fellow club/gym-goers. Often, members come to the gym to improve overall health, achieve personal fitness goals, or maintain their existing level of fitness. Still, others seek social connection, group workouts such as the popular Zumba, Bootcamp, and HIIT classes that are taught in most locations. Create a table of those contextual nudges."
