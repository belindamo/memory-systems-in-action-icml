Follow the prescribed rehabilitation program: It is essential to follow the rehabilitation program prescribed by the medical professional for the complete healing of the femur bone. The rehab program may consist of various exercises, movements, and stretches that help in restoring strength, flexibility, and function.\n\n2. Use assistive devices: Assistive devices such as crutches, walkers, or canes can help reduce weight-bearing stress on the fracture site and prevent re-injury.\n\n3. Wear proper footwear: Wearing shoes with slip-resistant soles, proper arch support, and comfortable fit can prevent falls and aid in balance while walking.\n\n4. Gradual return to activity: It is essential to return to physical activity gradually and follow a progressive plan as advised by the medical professional. Overexerting the injured area can result in re-injury or delayed healing.\n\n5. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, adequate hydration, and regular exercise, can support bone health and promote healing.\n\n6. Follow-up appointments: Regular follow-up appointments with the medical professional can help monitor the healing process, assess the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program, and make necessary adjustments or modifications to prevent re-injury."
