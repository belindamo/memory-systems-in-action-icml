When they do finish speaking, try to paraphrase or summarize what they said to show that you understood and to encourage them to continue.\n\nHere is a scenario with dialogue:\n\nSpeaker: \"I've been feeling really overwhelmed with work lately. I have so many deadlines and I'm struggling to keep up.\"\n\nListener: \"I can understand how that would be really stressful. It sounds like you have a lot going on right now.\"\n\nSpeaker: \"Yeah, it's been really tough. I don't know how I'm going to get everything done on time.\"\n\nListener: \"Have you considered asking for help or delegating some tasks to others on your team?\"\n\nBy actively listening, the listener is able to understand the speaker's perspective and offer helpful suggestions. Active listening can help improve communication and build trust in relationships."
