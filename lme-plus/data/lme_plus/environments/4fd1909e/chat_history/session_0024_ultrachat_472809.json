      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, it is true that some of the Studio Ghibli films were not well received in Japan initially. For example, when Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away was released in Japan in 2001, it did not perform as well as expected in its opening weekend. However, later, after positive reviews and word-of-mouth promotions, it became a massive box-office success, both in Japan and worldwide. Similarly, a few other films like Castle in the Sky and My Neighbor Totoro had mediocre performances on their release. \n\nOne reason for these films' initial lack of reception could be attributed to their unusual themes and complex storylines that may have been difficult for mainstream Japanese audiences to appreciate. Some of the films' focus on environmentalism, non-traditional gender roles, and surreal elements may not have resonated with the Japanese audience initially. Furthermore, Studio Ghibli's refusal to rely on common tropes and merchandising, which is common in Japanese animation, could have also contributed to its less than ideal reception. \n\nDespite these initial struggles, Studio Ghibli's commitment to quality animation and unique storytelling eventually resulted in a worldwide fandom for the studio's films, which increased their reach and influence beyond just Japanese audiences."
