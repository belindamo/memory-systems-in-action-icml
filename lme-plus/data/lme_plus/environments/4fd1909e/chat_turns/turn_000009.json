  "content": "Snowfall can occur in Yellowstone National Park at any time of the year, even during the summer months, although it's less likely. However, the first significant snowfall in the park usually starts around late September or early October. As winter progresses, snowfall becomes more frequent and heavier, with the most substantial snow accumulation typically occurring between December and February. Keep in mind that the park's weather can be unpredictable, and snowfall may vary from year to year.",
