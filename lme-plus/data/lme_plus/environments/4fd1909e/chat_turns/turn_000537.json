However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't attend your friend's birthday brunch and didn't see the flowy maxi skirt you wore.\n\nBut don't worry, I can still help you with some general advice and suggestions!\n\nA flowy skirt is a great choice for a dinner party, as it's often comfortable and can add a touch of elegance to your outfit. Here are a few ideas to consider:\n\n1. Pair your flowy skirt with a fitted top: A fitted top can create a flattering contrast with the flowy skirt and create a more polished look. Consider a silk or cotton blouse in a jewel-toned color to add some sophistication.\n2. Add a statement jacket: A tailored jacket can instantly elevate your outfit and add some drama. Look for one in a luxe fabric like velvet or satin to add some glamour.\n3. Accessorize wisely: Keep jewelry simple and understated to let the skirt be the star of the show. A simple necklace or a pair of elegant earrings can add a touch of sophistication.\n4. Consider the occasion: If the dinner party is more formal, you may want to opt for a longer skirt or a more structured silhouette. If it's a more casual affair, you can go for a shorter skirt and a more relaxed top.\n5. Don't forget about shoes: A pair of heeled sandals or pumps can add some glamour to your outfit, while ballet flats or loafers can create a more relaxed look.\n\nSome popular skirt styles that might work well for a dinner party include:\n\n* A flowy maxi skirt in a bold print or bright color\n* A midi skirt in a luxe fabric like silk or velvet\n* A high-low skirt with a fitted top and heels\n\nI hope these suggestions help inspire you to create a stylish and comfortable outfit for your dinner party!",
