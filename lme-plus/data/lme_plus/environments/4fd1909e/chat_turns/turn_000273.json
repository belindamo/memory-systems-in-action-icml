Here is a Linux lab exercise where students can try each command and state its function:\n\n1. pwd - This command stands for \"print working directory\" and it displays the current working directory.\n2. cd - This command stands for \"change directory\" and it allows you to change your current directory.\n3. ls - This command stands for \"list\" and it lists the contents of the current directory.\n4. mkdir - This command stands for \"make directory\" and it creates a new directory.\n5. touch - This command creates a new empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.\n6. rm - This command stands for \"remove\" and it deletes files and directories.\n7. mv - This command stands for \"move\" and it moves or renames files and directories.\n8. cp - This command stands for \"copy\" and it copies files and directories.\n9. echo - This command prints the given text or variable to the standard output.\n10. cat - This command stands for \"concatenate\" and it displays the contents of a file.\n\nLab exercise:\n\n1. Open up the terminal and type \"pwd\". The terminal should display the current working directory.\n2. Type \"cd /home/user/Desktop\" to change to the Desktop directory.\n3. Type \"ls\" to list the contents of the current directory (Desktop).\n4. Type \"mkdir new\\_folder\" to create a new folder called \"new\\_folder\".\n5. Type \"touch new\\_file.txt\" to create a new file called \"new\\_file.txt\".\n6. Type \"rm new\\_file.txt\" to delete the \"new\\_file.txt\" file.\n7. Type \"mv file1.txt /home/user/Documents/folder1\" to move the \"file1.txt\" file to the \"folder1\" directory in \"Documents\".\n8. Type \"cp file1.txt file2.txt /home/user/Documents/folder1\" to copy the \"file1.txt\" and \"file2.txt\" files to the \"folder1\" directory in \"Documents\".\n9. Type \"echo Hello World!\" to print \"Hello World!\" to the standard output.\n10. Type \"cat file1.txt\" to display the contents of the \"file1.txt\" file.\n\nThis lab exercise should help students get familiar with some basic commands in Linux.",
