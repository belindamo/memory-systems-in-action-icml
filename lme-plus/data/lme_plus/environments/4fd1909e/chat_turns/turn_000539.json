  "content": "I think there's been a misunderstanding again! As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't see what you wore to your friend's birthday brunch. I'm starting from scratch with each interaction!\n\nThat being said, a white off-the-shoulder top can be a lovely choice to pair with a flowy skirt! The key is to consider the overall vibe you're going for and the specifics of the skirt and top.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* Is the flowy skirt more formal or casual? If it's a more formal skirt, a white off-the-shoulder top might be a bit too casual. If it's a more casual skirt, the top could work well.\n* What's the neckline of the skirt? If the skirt has a high neckline, an off-the-shoulder top might create a nice contrast. If the skirt already has a low neckline, the off-the-shoulder top might make the overall look feel a bit too revealing.\n* What's the style of the off-the-shoulder top? Is it more bohemian and relaxed, or is it more structured and elegant? This can help you decide if it fits with the overall vibe of the skirt and the dinner party.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide what works best! If you feel confident and comfortable in the white off-the-shoulder top with the flowy skirt, go for it!",
