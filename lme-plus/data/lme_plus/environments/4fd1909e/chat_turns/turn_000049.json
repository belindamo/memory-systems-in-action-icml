  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to the latest real-time statistics. However, according to recent reports, there has been a decline in the number of healthcare workers contracting COVID-19 in New York State.\n\nIn July 2021, Governor Cuomo announced that healthcare workers accounted for less than 1% of the total COVID-19 cases in New York State. This is a significant improvement from earlier in the pandemic, when healthcare workers represented a much larger proportion of cases.\n\nThe decline in healthcare worker infections is likely due to several factors, including the availability and proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), increased awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures, and higher vaccination rates among healthcare workers.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the pandemic is ongoing, and healthcare workers in New York and elsewhere continue to face challenges and risks related to COVID-19. It's crucial that measures remain in place to protect and support those who are on the front lines of the pandemic response.",
