I'd be delighted to help you plan a fun, screen-free party activity for her special day!\n\n**Party Activity Ideas (no screens!)**\n\n1. **Treasure Hunt**: Create a treasure map, hide some small treasures around the party area, and let the kids search for them. You can customize the clues to fit your niece's interests.\n2. **Art Party**: Set up various art stations with paper, paint, markers, glue, and other craft supplies. Let the kids create their own masterpieces, from paintings to collages.\n3. **Outdoor Games**: Organize a backyard obstacle course, play classic games like tag, hide-and-seek, or set up a mini Olympics with events like a water balloon toss, relay races, or a hula hoop contest.\n4. **Cooking or Baking**: Plan a simple recipe that kids can help with, like decorating cupcakes or making their own pizzas. They'll love the hands-on experience and yummy outcome!\n5. **Science Experiments**: Plan some fun, easy experiments, like making slime, creating a volcano, or making homemade lava lamps.\n6. **Dance Party**: Set up a playlist of kid-friendly songs and have a dance party with glow sticks, balloons, or even a bubble machine.\n7. **Nature Scavenger Hunt**: If you have a nearby park or nature reserve, plan a scavenger hunt to explore the outdoors and collect items like leaves, rocks, or specific types of flowers.\n\n**Assembling a Kid's Bike**\n\nThe time it takes to assemble a kid's bike can vary depending on the type of bike and the complexity of the assembly process. On average, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours. Here's a rough breakdown:\n\n* Simple, single-speed bike: 30 minutes to 1 hour\n* Multi-speed bike with fewer components: 1-2 hours\n* More complex bike with multiple gears, suspension, or other features: 2-4 hours or more\n\nMake sure to check the manufacturer's instructions and plan accordingly. If you're not comfortable assembling the bike yourself, consider taking it to a local bike shop for assembly.\n\nRemember to also check the bike's size and adjustability to ensure it fits your niece comfortably.\n\nI hope these ideas help you plan a fun and memorable party for your niece!",
