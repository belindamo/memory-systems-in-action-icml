As I mentioned earlier, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't see what you wore to your friend's birthday brunch last Sunday. I'm just responding based on our conversation.\n\nThat being said, if you liked the combination of the white off-the-shoulder top with the flowy maxi skirt, you can definitely experiment with different tops to recreate the look! Since you mentioned the flowy skirt is from Free People, I can suggest that you try pairing it with a top that has a different neckline, sleeve style, or texture to create a fresh look.\n\nHere are some ideas:\n\n* Try a blouse with a V-neck or a scoop neck to create a different silhouette.\n* Experiment with a top that has bell sleeves or ruffled details to add some visual interest.\n* Pair the skirt with a cropped top or a tunic to create a different proportion.\n* Play with different textures, like pairing the flowy skirt with a lace top or a silk blouse.\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and experiment with different combinations to find what works best for you!",
