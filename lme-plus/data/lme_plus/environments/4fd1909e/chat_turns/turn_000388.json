I'll also make sure to have plenty of snacks and drinks available. By the way, speaking of family, my sister just got engaged last weekend, and we had a big celebration at a restaurant. It was amazing to see everyone so happy and relieved that they're finally taking the next step. My parents are thrilled, and my mom has already started making wedding plans.",
