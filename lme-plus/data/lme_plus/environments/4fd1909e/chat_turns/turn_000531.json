I'm a large language model, I don't have personal interactions or memories, so I didn't know about your silver necklace purchase on Saturday, March 12th.\n\nHowever, I can still help you with your question! A silver necklace with a subtle design can complement your pearl earrings nicely, depending on the design and style of the necklace. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Anchor pendant**: If you liked the anchor pendant on your previous necklace, you might want to look for a similar design or a pendant that resonates with you. A small, delicate anchor pendant can add a touch of whimsy to your outfit.\n* **Subtle design**: A subtle design on the necklace can help it blend with your pearl earrings without overpowering them. Look for a necklace with a simple, understated design that won't compete with your earrings.\n* **Silver tone**: Since your pearl earrings likely have a silver or white gold setting, a silver necklace can be a good match. Make sure the silver tone of the necklace complements the metal of your earrings.\n\nWhen shopping for a necklace, consider the following:\n\n* **Quality**: Look for a necklace made from high-quality materials, such as sterling silver or vermeil (sterling silver with a gold plating).\n* **Design**: Choose a design that resonates with you and complements your pearl earrings. A simple, elegant design can work well with pearl earrings.\n* **Price**: Set a budget and look for necklaces within your price range. You can find affordable options at various price points, depending on the quality and design of the necklace.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a necklace that complements your pearl earrings without overpowering them. You can experiment with different designs and styles to find the perfect match!",
