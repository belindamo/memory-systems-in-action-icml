  "content": "The speaker's reference to \"nonconformity\" in the poem is not entirely clear, but it could be interpreted in a few different ways.\n\nOne possible interpretation is that the speaker is referring to their desire to go against societal norms or expectations in some way. They may be considering choices or actions that are not traditionally accepted or approved of by their community, and are feeling the pressure to conform to these expectations. The line \"I\u2019d skedaddle after / Nonconformity!?\" suggests a fear or uncertainty about this path, as if the speaker is questioning whether it is the right decision.\n\nAlternatively, the reference to nonconformity could be related to the speaker's struggle with their religious beliefs and the changing societal views on abortion. The speaker may feel pressure to conform to traditional religious values that prohibit abortion, but may be considering a different path that goes against these beliefs. The reference to nonconformity could then represent the speaker's desire to make their own choices and decisions, rather than following the expectations of others.\n\nOverall, the meaning of nonconformity in the poem is not entirely clear, but it could represent the speaker's desire to go against the expectations of their community or their struggle to reconcile their own beliefs with changing societal values.",
