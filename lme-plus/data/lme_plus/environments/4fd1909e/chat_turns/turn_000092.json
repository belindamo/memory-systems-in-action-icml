  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences, emotions or ability to deal with any kind of resistance. But to answer your question, yes, there are some people who may resist changes in AI models and prefer to maintain the status quo. They may have concerns about the reliability and accuracy of AI systems or feel discomfort with changing norms and practices. However, it's important to remember that technology is not static and continuously evolving, so it's natural for AI to change and improve over time. Additionally, diversity and inclusion in AI are not just about changing for the sake of change, but rather, ensuring that the technology is accurate and equitable for everyone, regardless of background or identity. To address resistance, it's important to have open and respectful conversations, provide education and information about the benefits of diversity and inclusion in AI, and involve diverse perspectives and voices in the development and deployment of AI systems.",
