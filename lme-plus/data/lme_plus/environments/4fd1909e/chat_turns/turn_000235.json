Location: Are you open to traveling a bit, or do you want to stay within a certain radius of your current location?\n2. Festival type: Are you interested in volunteering at a specific type of festival (e.g., rock, pop, electronic, folk, etc.)?\n3. Dates: Are you available to volunteer on specific dates or weekends, or are you flexible?\n4. Roles: Are you interested in a particular type of volunteer role (e.g., stagehand, ticketing, merchandise, etc.)?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your preferences, I can try to suggest some volunteer opportunities that might be a good fit for you!",
