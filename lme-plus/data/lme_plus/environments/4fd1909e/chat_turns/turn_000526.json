  "content": "I appreciate the tips! Speaking of jewelry, I was thinking about my pearl earrings that my aunt gave me as a gift for attending my cousin's baby shower. They're really elegant and classic, and I've worn them to work three times already. I think they cost around $50, but she refused to tell me the exact price. Anyway, I was wondering if you could suggest some ways to keep them clean and maintain their shine.",
