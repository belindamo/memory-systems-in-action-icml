  "content": "The ending of the poem suggests that the speaker is seeking forgiveness and guidance from God for their past choices and for their future decisions. The final lines, \"Forgive me through / crucifix / for my / past choices then / Lessen the burden / for my future wrongs / Amen,\" indicate that the speaker is reflecting on their mistakes and is seeking a path forward that is guided by their faith.\n\nIt is not entirely clear what specific actions the speaker may take in the future, as the poem leaves many of the speaker's decisions and conflicts unresolved. However, the final lines suggest that the speaker is looking for a way to reconcile their religious beliefs with their personal experiences and the changing world around them. It is possible that the speaker may continue to struggle with these conflicting perspectives, or they may come to a resolution that allows them to move forward with greater clarity and purpose. Ultimately, the poem leaves the outcome open to interpretation and allows the reader to imagine what the speaker's future may hold.",
