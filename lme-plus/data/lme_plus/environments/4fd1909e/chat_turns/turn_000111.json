  "content": "You are correct that the distance between an input vector and the decision boundary can have no upper bound and can go up to infinity. This is where the sigmoid function comes in. The sigmoid function is used to convert the distance between the input vector and the decision boundary, which can have any value, into a probability value between 0 and 1.\n\nThe sigmoid function takes the dot product between the weight vector and the input vector as input and output a value between 0 and 1. This value represents the probability that the input vector belongs to the positive class. This probability value can be used as a measure of confidence in the classification.\n\nFor example, consider a logistic regression model that is trained to classify animals as either dogs or cats. The decision boundary could be a line that separates the dogs from the cats based on their weight and height.\n\n* If a dog that weighs 15 kg and is 40 cm tall is closest to the decision boundary, and the dot product between the weight vector and the input vector is -5. The output of the sigmoid function will be 0.003 which represents a low probability that the input vector belongs to the positive class (dogs)\n* If a cat that weighs 10 kg and is 30 cm tall is even closer to the decision boundary and the dot product between the weight vector and the input vector is -2. The output of the sigmoid function will be 0.119 which represents a low probability that the input vector belongs to the positive class (dogs)\n* If a dog that weighs 20 kg and is 50 cm tall is far from the decision boundary, and the dot product between the weight vector and the input vector is 5. The output of the sigmoid function will be 0.993 which represents a high probability that the input vector belongs to the positive class (dogs)\n\nIn this example, the sigmoid function converts the dot product between the weight vector and the input vector into a probability value between 0 and 1, which can be used as a measure of confidence in the classification.\n\nIn summary, distance has no upper bound and can go up till infinity, but the sigmoid function is used to convert the distance between the input vector and the decision boundary, which can have any value, into a probability value between 0 and 1. This probability value can be used as a measure of confidence in the classification.",
