  "content": "The poem \"Buying Her Dill Pickles\" uses symbolism to explore the speaker's conflicting perspectives on pregnancy, marriage, and abortion, and it does not offer a clear or straightforward answer to what the speaker would say about these issues.\n\nThe symbol of the cucumber being pickled in a jar suggests a transformation or change in the speaker's perspective, as well as a sense of confinement or containment. The line \"Takes too long / To go from / hard to soft\" may represent the speaker's frustration with the time and effort required to go through a pregnancy, and the implication of \"Techniques / No longer adhere / to the PG 13 / King James version\" suggests that the speaker is questioning the traditional religious values that prohibit abortion.\n\nThe symbol of the evergreen tree may represent the speaker's desire for a lasting, committed relationship, while the line \"I don't want / to snippet like her / and go bonsai\" suggests a fear of being limited or constrained in some way. This may be related to the speaker's feelings about marriage, as well as the societal pressures that may be placed on women to conform to certain expectations or roles.\n\nUltimately, the poem does not provide a clear answer to what the speaker would say about pregnancy, marriage, and abortion. Instead, it suggests that the speaker is struggling to reconcile their own beliefs and experiences with the expectations of their community and their faith. The poem allows the reader to imagine what the speaker's perspective may be, but it does not offer a definitive or prescriptive solution to the complex issues it addresses.",
