If you know the exact amount, feel free to update it.\n\nThe Rewards Redeemed column now includes the prescription discounts and the $10 savings from digital coupons. If you can estimate the number of points redeemed for the prescription discounts, we can add that to the description.\n\nHow's that? Do you have any other loyalty programs you'd like to add to the list?",
