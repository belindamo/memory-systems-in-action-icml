  "content": "If you visit a website that does not have SSL encryption, it means that the data you transmit to and from that website is not secure, and potentially, it could be intercepted by an unauthorized third party. As a result, you should be careful when sharing sensitive information on such websites, especially when they ask for personal and confidential details like credit card numbers, social security numbers, or login credentials.\n\nMoreover, modern browsers display a warning message when a user visits a website that doesn't have SSL encryption. The warning message reminds the user that their connection to the website is not secure and that their sensitive data could be compromised. It's recommended that you avoid entering or transmitting your sensitive data on such websites, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks, which can be vulnerable to malicious attacks.\n\nIn short, it's always better to be cautious when visiting a website that doesn't have SSL encryption, and avoid sharing sensitive information on it, as it can expose you to potential risks like data theft, online fraud, and identity theft.",
