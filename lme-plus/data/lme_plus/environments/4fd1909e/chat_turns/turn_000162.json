  "content": "These are my research insights/takeaways\n~21% of Spain's population is older than 65 years old. - INE\n~7% suffer from some kind of disability. (Top 3 Catalonia, Madrid, Andalusia) - INE\n88% of the population has a mobile device, and 94.6% use it as their preferred device instead of a computer.\nSpanish the only available language when others like Catalan, English or other native languages aren't available at all.\nNo real-time, and easy-to-exploit system for others to hijack and resell their appointments on the black market.\nFails to address some of the A11y tests and recommendations.\nUsers don\u2019t have any sense of trust or that this service comes from an authority.\nHard to navigate, due to its overcomplicated user flow and poor IA.\nNot friendly for foreigners despite this being the only available platform, and they have to go through it. As it is just available in Spanish, not even in other Spain languages or English.",
