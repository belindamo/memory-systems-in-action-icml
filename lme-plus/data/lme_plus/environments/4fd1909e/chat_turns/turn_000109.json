  "content": "In logistic regression, the distance between an input vector and the decision boundary can be used to interpret the confidence of the classification. The decision boundary is the hyperplane that separates the positive class from the negative class. The input vectors that are closest to the decision boundary are the ones that are the most uncertain about their classification. As the input vector moves further away from the decision boundary, the classification becomes more confident.\n\nFor example, consider a logistic regression model that is trained to classify animals as either dogs or cats. The decision boundary could be a line that separates the dogs from the cats based on their weight and height.\n\n* A dog that weighs 20 kg and is 50 cm tall will have a high confidence of being classified as a dog because it is far from the decision boundary.\n* A dog that weighs 15 kg and is 40 cm tall will be closer to the decision boundary, and the classification will be less confident\n* A cat that weighs 10 kg and is 30 cm tall will be even closer to the decision boundary and the classification will be even less confident.\n\nIn this example, the input vector's distance from the decision boundary can be used to interpret the confidence of the classification. The input vectors that are closest to the decision boundary are the ones that are the most uncertain about their classification. As the input vector moves further away from the decision boundary, the classification becomes more confident.\n\nIn summary, The distance between an input vector and the decision boundary can be used to interpret the confidence of the classification. The closer the input vector is to the decision boundary, the more uncertain the classification is. As the input vector moves further away from the decision boundary, the classification becomes more confident.",
