Here are some recommendations to get started:\n\n1. Read books and watch movies by marginalized authors and filmmakers: This is a great way to get an understanding of the experiences and struggles of various communities. Some examples include \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness\" by Michelle Alexander or \"Moonlight\" directed by Barry Jenkins.\n\n2. Follow social media accounts of marginalized individuals and organizations: Follow individuals and organizations on social media that support or represent marginalized communities such as Black Lives Matter, GLAAD, or the Native Women's Association of Canada to name a few.\n\n3. Attend workshops and events: Attend workshops and events that focus on diversity and inclusion, and that provide opportunities to learn about various communities from individuals who are a part of them.\n\n4. Listen to podcasts: There are many podcasts that focus on social justice issues and the experiences of marginalized communities, such as \"Code Switch\" from NPR or \"Still Processing\" from The New York Times.\n\n5. Have conversations with people from different backgrounds: Listen to the experiences and stories of people from different backgrounds to gain a better understanding of their perspectives and struggles.\n\nRemember that educating oneself is an ongoing process and that it's important to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to learn.",
