Here are some top recommendations:\n\n1. **Neutrogena Hydrating Facial Moisturizer**: A lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that provides long-lasting hydration without clogging pores.\n2. **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid**: A fragrance-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer that's designed for sensitive, acne-prone skin.\n3. **Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream**: A rich, non-greasy moisturizer that's gentle enough for acne-prone skin and provides long-lasting hydration.\n4. **Dermalogica Daily Moisturizing Cream**: A lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that's formulated with antioxidants to help soothe and calm acne-prone skin.\n5. **EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46**: A lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer that provides broad-spectrum sun protection and won't clog pores.\n\nWhen choosing a moisturizer for acne-prone skin, make sure to:\n\n* Look for products labeled \"non-comedogenic\" or \"oil-free\" to reduce the risk of clogged pores.\n* Avoid heavy, rich moisturizers that can exacerbate acne.\n* Opt for fragrance-free products to minimize irritation.\n* Choose a moisturizer with a lightweight, gel or serum-like texture that won't clog pores.\n* Consider a moisturizer with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, which can help combat acne.\n\nRemember, everyone's skin is different, so it's essential to patch test a new moisturizer on a small area of your skin before using it on your face to ensure you don't have any adverse reactions.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect moisturizer for your acne-prone skin!",
