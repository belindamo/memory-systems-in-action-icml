  "content": "\"The redesign of the Cita Previa website was a challenging but rewarding process that resulted in a more efficient and user-friendly service for all residents and citizens of Spain. By identifying the pain points and frustrations of various user archetypes and conducting market research, we were able to streamline the booking process and improve the overall experience for users.\n\nThrough the implementation of innovative features and a fresh perspective, we were able to reduce the number of screens by 50% and decrease the time of completion by 60%. In addition, we eliminated 20% of redundant input fields to simplify the user journey.\n\nThese efforts not only addressed common pain points, but also had a positive impact on key metrics such as potential higher conversion rates and reduced support costs. Overall, the redesign of the Cita Previa website represents a significant step forward in providing a more efficient and accessible service for all users.\"",
