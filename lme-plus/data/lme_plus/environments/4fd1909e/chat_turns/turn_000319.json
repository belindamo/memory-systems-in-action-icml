  "content": "The larger societal and religious shift mentioned in the poem appears to be related to changing views and values regarding abortion. The lines \"Techniques / No longer adhere / to the PG 13 / King James version\" suggest that the speaker sees a change in how people are approaching the topic of abortion, with traditional religious views no longer holding the same weight. The PG 13 reference suggests a move towards a more permissive and secular perspective.\n\nThis shift is also reflected in the speaker's internal conflict, where they are torn between their Christian beliefs and their own personal experiences. The use of the metaphor of the cucumber turning into a pickle can be interpreted as a metaphor for how the speaker's own innocence or purity may have been lost, and this may be connected to larger societal changes.\n\nThe Roe v. Wade case mentioned in the question was a landmark Supreme Court decision in the United States that legalized abortion nationwide. The poem can be seen as commenting on the ongoing debate surrounding this issue, with the speaker struggling to reconcile their religious beliefs with the changing societal and legal landscape.",
