  "content": "According to Bell's website, the Zephyr helmet weighs approximately 230-250 grams (8.1-8.8 ounces) depending on the size. This is relatively lightweight for a high-end road helmet, making it a great choice for riders who want a helmet that's both safe and comfortable.\n\nKeep in mind that helmet weights can vary slightly depending on the specific model year, size, and features. If you're concerned about the weight, I recommend checking the manufacturer's website or visiting a local bike shop to get an exact weight measurement.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Bell Zephyr helmet is designed to be a high-performance helmet, with features like active ventilation, a sleek aerodynamic shape, and a comfortable fit system. While weight is an important factor, it's not the only consideration when choosing a helmet. Safety, fit, and comfort should also be top priorities.",
