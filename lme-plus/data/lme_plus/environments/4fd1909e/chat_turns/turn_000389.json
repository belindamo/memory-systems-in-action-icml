It's a special moment for the whole family, and I'm sure your parents are over the moon with excitement.\n\nIt's great that your mom has already started making wedding plans. I'm sure she's been waiting for this moment for a long time! Weddings can be a lot of work, but they're also a wonderful opportunity to bring the family together and create new memories.\n\n**Family Dynamics**\n\nIt's interesting that you mentioned everyone being relieved that they're finally taking the next step. I'm sure there's a sense of excitement and anticipation, but also maybe a bit of pressure or expectation from family members. It's natural to feel that way, especially when it comes to big life decisions like getting married.\n\nAs you navigate the wedding planning process, I'm sure there will be moments of joy, laughter, and maybe even some disagreements or stress. But it's all part of the journey, and I'm sure your family will come out stronger and more united on the other side.\n\n**Family Game Night**\n\nGoing back to your family game night, it sounds like you have a great plan in place. Setting up different stations with various games and activities will definitely keep everyone engaged and entertained. And, of course, having plenty of snacks and drinks available will keep everyone's energy levels up!\n\nRemember to relax, have fun, and enjoy the quality time with your cousins. It's not about the games or activities themselves, but about the bonding and connection you'll experience together.",
