  "content": "To actively listen, focus on the speaker and pay attention to what they are saying. Avoid interrupting and try to paraphrase or summarize what they said to show understanding. Active listening can improve communication and build trust in relationships, but it can be challenging to do so when you are in a hurry.\n\nExample:\n\nSpeaker: \"I've been feeling overwhelmed with work. I have so many deadlines and I'm struggling to keep up.\"\n\nListener: \"I can understand how that would be stressful. It's tough to keep up with all those deadlines. Have you considered asking for help or delegating tasks?\"",
