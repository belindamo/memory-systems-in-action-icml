You could also consider:\n\n* \"Pirate's Pizza\" (cheese or pepperoni pizza with a treasure map design)\n* \"Treasure Coins\" (chocolate coins or candy)\n* \"Anchors Aweigh\" fruit kebabs (grapes and pineapple chunks on skewers)\n* \"Jolly Roger Jelly Sandwiches\" (peanut butter and jelly sandwiches cut into fun shapes)\n\n**Treasure Chest Goodies**\n\nA treasure chest filled with goodies is a fantastic idea! Here are some suggestions for the treasure chest contents:\n\n* Gold coins (chocolate coins or candy)\n* Small toys or trinkets, such as:\n\t+ Plastic pirates, swords, or other pirate-themed figures\n\t+ Stickers, temporary tattoos, or colorful pencils\n\t+ Small stuffed animals, like parrots or monkeys\n* Treasure hunt-themed items, like:\n\t+ A small compass or a magnifying glass\n\t+ A treasure map or a pirate's journal\n\t+ A small \"treasure hunter's certificate\" with each child's name\n* Snacks, such as:\n\t+ Small bags of \"pirate's popcorn\" (flavored popcorn)\n\t+ \"Treasure trail mix\" (a mix of nuts, dried fruits, and pretzels)\n\t+ \"Pirate's gold\" (caramel or candy apples)\n\nRemember to tailor the treasure chest contents to the age and interests of the children attending the party.\n\n**Treasure Chest Presentation**\n\nTo add an extra layer of excitement, you could present the treasure chest in a creative way, such as:\n\n* Burying the treasure chest in a sandbox or a designated area, and having the kids dig for it\n* Creating a \"treasure map\" that leads the kids to the treasure chest\n* Hiding the treasure chest in a \"hidden cave\" (a decorated area or a tent) and having the kids search for it\n* Having a \"pirate\" (a costumed adult or a stuffed animal) guard the treasure chest and challenge the kids to answer a riddle or complete a task to gain access to it\n\nI hope these ideas help you create an unforgettable pirate-themed party for your niece!",
