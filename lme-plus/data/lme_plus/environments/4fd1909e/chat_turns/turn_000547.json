A small bag will add a touch of elegance and help to complete the overall look. Since you're dressing up the outfit with black pumps, a simple clutch or a small cross-body bag can help to balance out the overall look and add some polish.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider:\n\n* Opt for a small, sleek clutch in a neutral color like black, beige, or metallic. This will add a touch of sophistication without drawing attention away from the rest of the outfit.\n* If you prefer a cross-body bag, look for a small, delicate style that won't overwhelm the outfit.
