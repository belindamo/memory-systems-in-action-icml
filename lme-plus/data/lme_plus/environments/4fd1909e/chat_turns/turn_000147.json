This will help you focus your practice sessions.\n2. **Schedule theory time**: Allocate a specific time slot each day or week to dedicate to music theory study. Even 15-20 minutes can be beneficial.\n3. **Start with the basics**: Begin with fundamental concepts like chords, scales, and rhythm. Understand the major and minor pentatonic scales, as they're essential for most styles.\n4. **Apply theory to songs**: Choose a song you're familiar with and analyze its chord progression, melody, and structure. Try to identify the scales and modes used, and experiment with improvising over the chord changes.\n5. **Practice scales and arpeggios**: Mastering scales and arpeggios will help you develop finger strength, dexterity, and improve your overall technique.
