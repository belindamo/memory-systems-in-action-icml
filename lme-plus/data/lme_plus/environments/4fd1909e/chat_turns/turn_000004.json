  "content": "To use melonJS with HTML5 canvas, you would first need to include the melonJS library in your HTML file, along with the canvas element.\n```\n<script src=\"js/melonjs.js\"></script>\n<canvas id=\"game\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"></canvas>\n```\nThen, in your JavaScript code, you would initialize the game and create a new game state for the avatar creator.\n```\n// Initialize the game\nvar game = new me.Game(\"game\", 800, 600, {});\n\n// Create a new state for the avatar creator\ngame.state.add(new me.AvatarCreatorState());\n\n// Start the game\ngame.state.change(me.state.AVATAR_CREATOR);\n```\nThe `AvatarCreatorState` would contain the logic for the avatar creator, such as handling user input, displaying the different customization options, and updating the canvas with the player's selected avatar.\n```\nvar AvatarCreatorState = me.ScreenObject.extend({\n  onResetEvent: function() {\n    // handle user input and update the canvas with the player's selected avatar\n  },\n});\n```\nYou could then use the melonJS library's built-in functionality for handling user input, such as keyboard and mouse events, to allow the player to navigate the different customization options and make selections. Additionally, melonJS provides a wide range of 2D and 3D features, like animations and physics engine, that can be used to create a fun and immersive avatar creator experience.\n\nIt's worth noting that MelonJS is not exactly a 2D/Pixel art library, but it's a powerful 2D game development framework that could be used for creating games with 2D/Pixel art style.",
