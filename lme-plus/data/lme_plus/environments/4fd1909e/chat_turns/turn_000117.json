Move your ankle by pointing your toes up towards the ceiling and then down towards the floor. 2. Quad sets: Sit with your legs straight and your feet flat on the ground. Tighten your thigh muscle (quad) by pressing the back of your knee down into the floor. 3. Heel slides: Lie on your back with your legs straight. Bend your injured knee and slide your heel towards your buttocks. Slowly straighten the leg back out. 4. Toe curls: Sit with your feet flat on the floor. Curl your toes under, then straighten them out. 5. Hip abduction: Lie on your side with your injured leg on top. Keeping your toes pointed forward, lift your top leg up and then lower it back down. 6. Walking: Start with short distances and a steady pace while using an assistive device such as crutches or a walker. It is essential to consult with your medical professional before starting any exercise program, especially when recovering from a femur bone fracture.
