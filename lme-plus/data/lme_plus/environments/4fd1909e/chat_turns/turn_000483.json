Almond milk and oat flour pancakes are a great combo, and topping them with fresh berries and maple syrup adds natural sweetness and flavor. It's wonderful that you've found a routine that brings you joy and satisfaction.\n\nYou know, sometimes sticking to a familiar routine can be just what we need to feel grounded and cozy. But it's also great that you're open to exploring new recipes and ideas, like the vegan mac and cheese and overnight oats we discussed earlier. Who knows, you might discover a new favorite dish or flavor combination!\n\nDo you have any fun plans or activities lined up for the rest of your Sunday, or is it a relaxing, low-key day?",
