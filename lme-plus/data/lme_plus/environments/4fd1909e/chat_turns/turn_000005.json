  "content": "Based on your revised itinerary, here's an estimate of the driving distances and total cost of fuel for your trip:\n\n1. Bozeman, MT to Yellowstone National Park: 90 miles\n2. Exploring Yellowstone National Park: 150 miles (estimated, depends on your chosen routes and activities)\n3. Yellowstone to Beartooth Pass: 100 miles\n4. Beartooth Pass to Grand Teton National Park: 100 miles\n5. Exploring Grand Teton National Park: 50 miles (estimated, depends on your chosen routes and activities)\n6. Grand Teton National Park to Jackson Hole, WY: 60 miles\n\nTotal driving distance: approximately 550 miles\n\nTo calculate the total cost of fuel, you'll need to know the fuel efficiency of the van you'll be renting. For this example, let's assume your van has an average fuel efficiency of 20 miles per gallon (mpg).\n\nTotal fuel consumption: 550 miles / 20 mpg = 27.5 gallons\n\nTotal cost of fuel: 27.5 gallons \\* $3.50 per gallon = $96.25\n\nPlease note that these are rough estimates, and your actual driving distances and fuel costs may vary depending on your chosen routes, activities, and the specific van you rent. Additionally, consider adding some extra budget for fuel, as gas prices can fluctuate, and you may need to drive more than estimated.",
