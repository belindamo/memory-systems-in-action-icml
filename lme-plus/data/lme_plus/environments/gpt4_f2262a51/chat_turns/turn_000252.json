  "content": "Creating an interactive 3D property tour can be a complex and multi-step process that involves various tools and technologies. Here is a high-level overview of the process:\n\n1. Create a 3D model of the property using software such as Blender.\n2. Convert the 3D model into a format that can be rendered in a web browser, such as WebGL or Three.js.\n3. Build a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the 3D model and enable user interaction.\n4. Add interactive elements to the interface, such as buttons or hotspots, that allow users to move through the space and view different angles and perspectives.\n5. Integrate the 3D property tour into your real estate website or application.\n\nHere is an example code snippet that shows how to load a 3D model using Three.js and display it on a web page:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>3D Property Tour</title>\n    <style>\n      #canvas {\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"canvas\"></div>\n\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.135.0/build/three.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      // Create a new scene and camera\n      const scene = new THREE.Scene();\n      const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);\n\n      // Create a new renderer and add it to the page\n      const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();\n      renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\n      document.getElementById('canvas').appendChild(renderer.domElement);\n\n      // Load the 3D model\n      const loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();\n      loader.load('model.gltf', function (gltf) {\n        scene.add(gltf.scene);\n      });\n\n      // Position the camera and render the scene\n      camera.position.z = 5;\n      const animate = function () {\n        requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n        renderer.render(scene, camera);\n      };\n      animate();\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\nThis code loads a 3D model in GLTF format using the Three.js GLTFLoader, and adds it to the scene. It then positions the camera and starts a render loop to continuously update the display.\n\nTo add interactivity to this example, you would need to add event listeners to the interface that allow users to control the camera and navigate through the space. You could also add hotspots or clickable elements that trigger actions, such as displaying more information about a room or highlighting a feature of the property.",
