The online retailer aspect can add an extra layer of challenge when it comes to getting immediate help.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to help you navigate this situation:\n\n**1. Take a step back and organize your workspace**: Sometimes, a cluttered workspace can contribute to mistakes. Take some time to organize your parts, instructions, and tools. This will help you stay focused and ensure you're working with the correct components.\n\n**2. Break the project down into smaller tasks**: Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the entire kit, break the project down into smaller, manageable tasks. Focus on one section or sub-assembly at a time. This will help you make progress and build confidence.\n\n**3. Online resources are your friend**: While you can't get immediate help from the store staff, there are many online resources available to you:\n\t* Manufacturer's website: Check the manufacturer's website for tutorials, FAQs, and online manuals.\n\t* YouTube: Search for video tutorials specific to your kit or similar models.\n\t* Online forums: Join online forums or communities dedicated to model building, such as Reddit's r/modelcars or r/modelmaking. You can ask for advice, share your progress, and learn from others who may have experience with the same kit.\n\t* Online tutorials and guides: Websites like YouTube, Pinterest, or specialized modeling websites often have tutorials and guides that can help you with specific techniques or tasks.\n\n**4. Reach out to the online retailer's customer support**: If you're having trouble finding answers online, don't hesitate to contact the online retailer's customer support. They may be able to provide guidance or point you in the right direction.\n\n**5. Don't be too hard on yourself**: Remember, mistakes are an inevitable part of the learning process. It's okay to make mistakes \u2013 even experienced modelers encounter setbacks. The important thing is that you're willing to learn and correct your mistakes.\n\nNow, tell me more about the specific mistake you made with the hull. What happened, and what do you think you need to do to fix it? I'll do my best to offer guidance and help you get back on track!",
