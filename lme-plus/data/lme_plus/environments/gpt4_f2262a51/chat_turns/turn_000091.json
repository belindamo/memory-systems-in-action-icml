The 1920s Art Deco vase on the mantel will add a touch of glamour and sophistication to the room, and the antique clock on a side table will create a beautiful focal point. Here's how you can make it work:\n\n**Mantel Display**\n\n* Place the Art Deco vase on the mantel, centered or slightly off-center, depending on the mantel's design.\n* Consider adding a few decorative items around the vase, such as candles, small vases, or decorative boxes, to create a cohesive look. However, be mindful of the scale and don't overcrowd the mantel.\n* Make sure the vase is the star of the show, and the surrounding items complement its beauty. You can also add some greenery, like eucalyptus or ferns, to add a touch of freshness.\n\n**Side Table Display**\n\n* Choose a side table that complements the style of the antique clock. For example, a ornate, wooden side table would work well with a decorative clock.\n* Place the clock on the side table, and consider adding a small decorative item, like a vase or a small sculpture, to create a sense of balance.\n* Keep the side table relatively simple, as you want the clock to be the main attraction. Avoid cluttering the table with too many items, as it can detract from the clock's beauty.\n\n**Tips to Avoid Overwhelming the Space**\n\n* Make sure the vase and clock are not competing for attention. The mantel and side table should be far enough apart to create a sense of separation.\n* Balance the visual weight of the vase and clock by considering their size, shape, and color. For example, if the vase is large and bold, the clock should be smaller and more understated.\n* Don't over-accessorize the room. Remember, the fine china and the dinner party theme should still be the main focus. The antique pieces should complement the overall ambiance, not overpower it.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll create a beautiful and elegant display that showcases your antique pieces without overwhelming the space. Your guests will appreciate the attention to detail and the thoughtful curation of your antiques.",
