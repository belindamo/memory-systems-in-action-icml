Lightweight and breathable clothing suitable for the weather, such as a rain jacket, fleece jacket, and hiking pants or shorts. 3. A backpack to carry your essentials, such as water bottle, snacks, sunscreen, hat, and a first aid kit. 4. Hiking poles are optional, but they can help you keep your balance and reduce the impact on your knees and joints. 5. A map, compass or GPS device to help you navigate the trail. 6. Insect repellent and a whistle or bell for safety. Most importantly, remember to stay hydrated and bring enough water and snacks for the hike. It's also a good idea to let someone know where you're going and what time you plan to return. Have fun on your hike!",
