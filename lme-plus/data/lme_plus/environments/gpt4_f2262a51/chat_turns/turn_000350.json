  "content": "While the beer trap is specifically designed to attract snails and slugs, it is possible that other insects or pests may also be attracted to the beer. However, the trap is usually more effective at attracting snails and slugs than other pests. In any case, it's a good idea to regularly check the trap and remove any insects that are not snails or slugs. Remember to empty and replace the beer regularly, to prevent the build-up of any other unwanted insects.",
