  "content": "Network Level Authentication (NLA) is a security feature of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that requires authentication to occur before a remote desktop session is established. With NLA, the client (i.e. the system initiating the remote desktop connection) must authenticate with the server (i.e. the system being remotely accessed) before the remote desktop session is established.\n\nHere's how NLA works with RDP:\n\n1. The client initiates the RDP connection to the server.\n2. The server sends a message to the client requesting authentication.\n3. The client responds with its credentials, which are encrypted and sent to the server.\n4. The server verifies the credentials with the domain controller.\n5. If the credentials are valid, the server sends a message to the client indicating that the remote desktop session can be established.\n6. The remote desktop session is established between the client and server.\n\nBy requiring authentication before the remote desktop session is established, NLA helps to prevent unauthorized access to the server, and provides an added layer of security for the remote desktop connection.\n\nIt's worth noting that NLA is a feature of RDP and is not specific to Windows systems. Many other remote desktop protocols, such as VNC or SSH, also have similar security features.",
