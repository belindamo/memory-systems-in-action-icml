  "content": "It is possible for a token bridge to pair a token like Sol with an already existing proxy token on the receiving network, rather than creating a new proxy token. In this case, the token bridge would simply transfer the equivalent value of the already existing proxy token to the user's wallet on the receiving network, rather than creating a new proxy token.\n\nFor example, if there is already an \"Sol-Ethereum\" proxy token being used on the Ethereum network, the token bridge could transfer this proxy token to the user's Ethereum wallet rather than creating a new \"Sol-Ethereum\" token.\n\nWhether or not a token bridge pairs a token with an existing proxy token or creates a new proxy token can depend on a variety of factors, including the specific implementation of the token bridge, the requirements of the networks involved, and the preferences of the users.",
