However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal relationships or interactions, so I didn't know you had a new apartment or commute. But I'm here to assist you with your passport renewal questions!\n\nThe process of renewing a U.S. passport typically takes 6-8 weeks, but expedited service is available for an additional fee, which takes 2-3 weeks. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:\n\n1. **Check if you're eligible for renewal**: You can renew your passport if it's valid for 9 years or less, or if it's been expired for less than 15 years. You'll need to fill out Form DS-82, which is available on the U.S. Department of State's website.\n2. **Gather required documents**:\n\t* Your current passport (valid or expired)\n\t* A completed Form DS-82 (printed and signed)\n\t* A photocopy of both sides of your ID (driver's license, government-issued ID, or current passport)\n\t* One recent, color photograph that meets the Department of State's requirements\n3. **Fill out the application**: Fill out Form DS-82 online and print it, or print a blank form and fill it out by hand using black ink. Do not sign it until instructed to do so by an acceptance agent.\n4. **Get a passport photo**: You'll need one recent, color photograph that meets the Department of State's requirements. You can get a passport photo at a post office, pharmacy, or a passport acceptance facility.\n5. **Visit a passport acceptance facility**: There are over 9,000 passport acceptance facilities located throughout the U.S., including post offices, libraries, and county clerk's offices. Make an appointment if possible. Bring all your documents, the application fee, and the execution fee (varies by facility, but typically $35).\n6. **Submit your application**: The acceptance agent will review your application, witness your signature, and send it to the Department of State for processing.\n7. **Pay the fees**: The application fee for a U.S. passport book is currently $110 for adults (16 and older) and $80 for children (15 and younger). The execution fee varies by facility, but is typically $35. You can pay with a check or money order made out to the U.S. Department of State.\n8. **Track your application**: Once your application is processed, you can track its status online or by calling the National Passport Information Center.\n\n**Expedited service**: If you need your passport quickly, you can expedite the process for an additional $60 fee. This will take 2-3 weeks. You can also expedite the return shipping for an additional $15.45 fee.\n\n**Regional Passport Agency**: If you're in a hurry, you can visit a Regional Passport Agency in person. They offer same-day or next-day processing for an additional fee. Make an appointment and bring all required documents.\n\nRemember to apply for your passport renewal well in advance of your trip to ensure you receive it in time. If you have any questions or issues, you can contact the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 or [npic@state.gov](mailto:npic@state.gov).",
