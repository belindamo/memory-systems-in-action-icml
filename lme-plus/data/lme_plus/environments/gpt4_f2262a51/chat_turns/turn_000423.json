  "content": "I'll track my progress by logging my workouts and noting how I feel after each session. I'll also take progress photos and measurements every 4-6 weeks to visualize my progress. If I notice that I'm plateauing or not feeling challenged, I'll adjust my workout routine by increasing the difficulty, adding new exercises, or changing my rest days. Additionally, I'll continue to listen to my body and rest when needed, as recovery is just as important as the workout itself.\n\nBy the way, since I've been getting 7-8 hours of sleep each night, which is within my target range, I'm hoping that will also help with my exercise performance and recovery.",
