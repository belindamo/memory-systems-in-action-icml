  "content": "That's a valid concern, as some countries and corporations may prioritize profits and short-term interests over the well-being of the planet. However, there is growing recognition that sustainable practices are also good for business and economic growth in the long run. Many corporations are starting to embrace sustainable business practices, and this is being driven by consumer demand, investor pressure, and government regulation.\n\nGovernments also have a role to play in incentivizing sustainable practices and disincentivizing harmful ones. For example, governments can regulate carbon emissions through carbon taxes or cap and trade systems, which can increase the cost of polluting and create an economic incentive to invest in clean technologies.\n\nMoreover, international initiatives such as the Paris Agreement on climate change provide a framework for countries to work together towards a sustainable future. This increased global effort and collaboration can spur innovation and investment in sustainable technologies and practices.\n\nTherefore, while there may be some resistance to change, the increasing awareness of the impacts of climate change and the economic benefits of sustainable practices are likely to drive more investment in these technologies in the future.",
