Here's what I found:\n\n* The Connecticut River Walk and Bikeway is a 3.7-mile path that runs along the Connecticut River, which is not too far from Main St and Elm St. This path is a great option for a scenic and relatively flat ride.\n* The Springfield Bike Lane Network has designated bike lanes on some streets, including Main St, which has a bike lane from State St to Union St. Additionally, there are bike lanes on Union St, Chestnut St, and other streets that might be part of your commute.\n* The Pioneer Valley Bike Trail is a 12-mile trail that connects Springfield to surrounding towns. While it's not directly on your bus route, it's a great option for a longer ride or a weekend adventure.\n\nPlease note that bike infrastructure is subject to change, and new projects are being developed all the time. I recommend checking the City of Springfield's website or the Springfield Bike Lane Network's website for the most up-to-date information on bike lanes, bike paths, and cycling resources.\n\nIt's also a great idea to plan your route in advance using online tools like Google Maps or MapMyRide, which can help you find the most bike-friendly routes and avoid busy streets.\n\nRemember to always follow traffic laws and safety guidelines when biking, and consider wearing safety gear like a helmet and reflective clothing. Happy cycling!",
