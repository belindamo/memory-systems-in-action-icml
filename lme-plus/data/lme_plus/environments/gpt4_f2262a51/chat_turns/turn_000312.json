Too much glue can be a real challenge to deal with, especially when it causes parts to shift out of place.\n\nDon't worry, I've got some tips to help you fix the gap without making it worse:\n\n**1. Stop and assess the situation**: Take a deep breath and assess the gap. Is it a small gap or a large one? Is the glue still wet or has it dried?\n\n**2. Remove excess glue (if possible)**: If the glue is still wet, try to carefully wipe away as much excess glue as possible using a cotton swab or a small brush. Be gentle, as you don't want to spread the glue further or push it deeper into the gap.\n\n**3. Let it dry (if necessary)**: If you can't remove the excess glue, let it dry completely. This will make it easier to work with and less likely to spread further.\n\n**4. Prepare the area**: Once the glue is dry, use a hobby knife or a file to carefully scrape away any excess glue that has squeezed out beyond the gap. This will help create a clean surface for the repair.\n\n**5. Apply a filler material**: You'll need to fill the gap with a material that will bond well with the plastic and provide a strong joint. You can use:\n\t* Plastic cement (like Tamiya or Testors): Apply a small amount of plastic cement to the gap, using a toothpick or a small brush. Hold the parts together gently until the cement sets.\n\t* Epoxy resin: Mix a small amount of epoxy resin and apply it to the gap using a toothpick or a small brush. Hold the parts together gently until the epoxy sets.\n\t* Putty or filler: Apply a small amount of putty or filler to the gap, using a toothpick or a small brush. Let it dry and then sand it down to a smooth finish.\n\n**6. Clamp or hold the parts together**: Use clamps, rubber bands, or masking tape to hold the parts together while the filler material sets. Make sure the parts are aligned properly and the gap is closed.\n\n**7. Sand and smooth**: Once the filler material has set, use a file or sandpaper to smooth out the area. Start with coarse grit (around 120-150) and work your way up to finer grit (220-240) for a smooth finish.\n\n**8. Blend with surrounding area**: Use a small brush to apply a thin layer of paint or primer to the repaired area, blending it with the surrounding surface. This will help the repair blend in and become less noticeable.\n\nRemember to work patiently and carefully when fixing the gap. It may take some time and effort, but with the right approach, you can fix the gap and get your model back on track!\n\nIf you're still unsure or have further questions, feel free to ask.
