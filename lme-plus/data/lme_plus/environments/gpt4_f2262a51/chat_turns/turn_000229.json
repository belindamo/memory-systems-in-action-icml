Prepare the sauce as described above.\n2. Sterilize the jars, lids, and utensils.\n3. Fill the hot, sterilized jars with the pasta sauce, leaving about 1/2 inch headspace.\n4. Remove air bubbles, add the lids and bands, and tighten until just finger-tight.\n5. Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 20 minutes, adjusting for altitude as necessary:\n\t* 0-1,000 ft: 20 minutes\n\t* 1,001-2,000 ft: 25 minutes\n\t* 2,001-3,000 ft: 30 minutes\n\t* 3,001-4,000 ft: 35 minutes\n\t* 4,001-5,000 ft: 40 minutes\n6.
