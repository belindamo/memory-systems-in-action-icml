  "content": "According to Amazon's terms and conditions, there is no minimum purchase required to redeem your $5 cashback reward from Amazon Prime Rewards. You can apply the reward to any eligible purchase, regardless of the amount.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that you need to have a minimum balance of $1 in your Amazon Cashback rewards account to redeem it. Since you have a $5 cashback reward, you're good to go!\n\nJust remember to apply the reward during checkout, and Amazon will deduct the $5 from your purchase total. If your purchase amount is less than $5, you'll get the remaining balance credited back to your Amazon Cashback rewards account.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
