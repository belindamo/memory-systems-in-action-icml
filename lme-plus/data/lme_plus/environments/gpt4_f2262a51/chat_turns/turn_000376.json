  "content": "Coaching for Profit (CFP) in poker is an arrangement between a poker player and a coach, where the player receives training, guidance, and support from the coach to improve their poker skills, with the understanding that the player will share a percentage of their future poker profits with the coach as compensation. This profit-sharing model aligns the interests of both the player and the coach, as the coach's income is directly tied to the player's success.\n\nThe specific terms of a CFP agreement can vary, but generally, it includes:\n\n1. Coaching sessions: The coach provides regular coaching sessions, which can involve hand analysis, strategy discussions, mental game coaching, and other aspects of poker improvement.\n2. Study materials and resources: The coach may provide the player with access to poker training materials, software, or other resources to help them improve their game.\n3. Profit-sharing agreement: The player agrees to share a pre-determined percentage of their profits (usually earned in online or live cash games and tournaments) with the coach for a specific period or until a certain profit target is reached.\n4. Ongoing support and communication: The coach and player maintain regular communication to discuss progress, address questions or concerns, and make adjustments to the coaching plan as needed.\n\nCoaching for Profit can be a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parties, as the player receives expert guidance to help them improve their game, while the coach has a financial incentive to ensure the player's success. However, it's essential for both parties to clearly understand and agree on the terms of the arrangement before entering into a CFP agreement to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes.",
