  "content": "Scheduling criteria are used to evaluate the performance of a scheduling algorithm. The following are some common scheduling criteria:\n\n1. CPU utilization: CPU utilization is the percentage of time the CPU is busy executing a process. A good scheduling algorithm should maximize CPU utilization to ensure efficient use of system resources.\n2. Throughput: Throughput is the number of processes or threads completed per unit of time. A good scheduling algorithm should maximize throughput to ensure that the system can handle a large number of tasks.\n3. Turnaround time: Turnaround time is the amount of time it takes for a process or thread to complete its execution from the time it is submitted. A good scheduling algorithm should minimize turnaround time to ensure that processes or threads are completed in a timely manner.\n4. Waiting time: Waiting time is the amount of time a process or thread spends in the ready queue waiting for the CPU. A good scheduling algorithm should minimize waiting time to ensure that processes or threads can start executing as soon as possible.\n5. Response time: Response time is the time it takes for a process or thread to start responding to a request. A good scheduling algorithm should minimize response time to ensure that the system can provide a good user experience.\n6. Fairness: Fairness is the degree to which the scheduler allocates resources fairly among competing processes or threads. A good scheduling algorithm should ensure that all processes or threads are given an equal opportunity to execute.\n\nThe choice of scheduling criteria depends on the requirements of the system and the characteristics of the workload. For example, a real-time system may prioritize response time and fairness over CPU utilization, while a batch processing system may prioritize throughput and CPU utilization over response time.",
