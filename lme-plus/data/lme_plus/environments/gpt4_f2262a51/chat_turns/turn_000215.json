  "content": "Sure thing! Here are my thoughts on where the zombie types could appear in the different timelines:\n\n* Jugernaut: This one could potentially appear in all 3 timelines, as it's a pretty classic \"big, tough zombie\" type that could be a threat in any apocalypse scenario.\n* Hydra: This one might make the most sense in Path 1, since it seems like it would be a result of the military's experimentation on the parasites.\n* Skullcrawler: This one could potentially appear in any timeline, since it seems like it could be a result of the parasites' mutations.\n* Berserker: This one could potentially appear in any timeline as well, since it seems like it could be a result of the parasites' effects on human behavior.\n* Lasher: This one might make the most sense in Path 3, since it seems like it would be a result of the parasites' mutations in a more uncontrolled, chaotic environment.\n* Hoplite: This one might make the most sense in Path 2, since it seems like it could be a result of the military's experimentation on the parasites.\n* Fissionator: This one could potentially appear in any timeline, since it seems like it could be a result of the parasites' mutations and their interaction with radiation.\n\nOf course, these are just suggestions, and you could mix and match the zombie types however you like in each timeline.",
