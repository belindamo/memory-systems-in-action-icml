  "content": "A domain is a unique name that identifies a website on the internet. It is like the address of a house, but for a website. When you type in a domain name into a web browser, it directs you to that specific website.\n\nTo create an email address for a business, you need a domain name. This is because the email address will have the same domain name as the website. For example, if the website domain name is \"example.com\", then the email address would be something like \"[john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com)\".\n\nHaving a domain name for your business email adds professionalism and credibility. It also makes it easier for customers to remember your email address and find your website. Additionally, having a custom email address with your own domain name can make it easier to manage your email accounts and protect against spam or phishing attacks.",
