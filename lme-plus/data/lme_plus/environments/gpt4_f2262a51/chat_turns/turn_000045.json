  "content": "Compressing your files should help reduce their size and make them uploadable.\n\nRegarding the court approval letter, you don't necessarily need to upload it as part of the USPS change of address application. The court approval letter is proof of your name change, which you've already updated with the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe USPS primarily needs to verify your identity and residency to process your change of address request. Since you've already updated your name with the SSA, you can focus on providing the required documents to prove your identity and residency, such as:\n\n1. Your new Social Security card with your updated name\n2. Proof of residency (utility bill, lease agreement, or bank statement with your new address)\n\nHowever, if you're concerned about providing additional proof of your name change, you can upload the court approval letter as an additional document. This might help ensure that the USPS has all the necessary information to process your application smoothly.\n\nKeep in mind that the USPS may request additional documentation or clarification if they need more information to verify your identity or residency. But in general, the documents I mentioned earlier should be sufficient for a standard change of address application.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can contact the USPS customer service at 1-800-275-8777 to ask about specific requirements or any additional documentation they might need.",
