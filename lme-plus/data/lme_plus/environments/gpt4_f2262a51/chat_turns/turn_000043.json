Here's what might happen:\n\n1. **Upload failure**: When you try to upload a file that's too large, the upload process will fail, and you'll receive an error message. This message might say something like \"File too large\" or \"Upload failed.\"\n2. **Error message**: The error message will usually indicate that the file size exceeds the maximum allowed limit. You might see a message like \"Maximum file size exceeded (2MB)\" or \"File size too large. Please compress or reduce the file size.\"\n3. **Upload blocked**: The USPS website will prevent you from uploading the file to ensure that their system isn't overwhelmed by large files. This is a security measure to protect their servers and ensure a smooth user experience.\n\n**What can you do if your file is too large?**\n\nIf your file is too large, don't worry! You have a few options:\n\n1. **Compress the file**: You can compress the file using software like Adobe Acrobat, WinZip, or online tools like SmallPDF. This will reduce the file size without compromising its quality.\n2. **Resize or crop the image**: If you're uploading an image, you can resize or crop it to reduce the file size. Make sure the image is still clear and legible.\n3. **Split the file**: If you have a large document, you can split it into smaller files, each under 2MB. For example, if you have a 5-page document, you can split it into two files: pages 1-2 and pages 3-5.\n4. **Contact USPS customer service**: If you're unable to reduce the file size, you can contact the USPS customer service at 1-800-275-8777 for assistance. They might be able to provide alternative methods for submitting your documents.\n\nRemember, it's essential to ensure your documents are clear and legible, even if you need to compress or resize them. The USPS needs to be able to read your documents to process your application.",
