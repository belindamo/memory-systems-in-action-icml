The Shawshank Redemption (1994): In this movie, the light is used to represent hope and freedom. The scene where Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) escapes from prison is an excellent example where the light shining through the tunnel represents hope and a new beginning.\n\n2. The Godfather (1972): In this movie, low-key lighting is used to represent the tension and drama. The famous scene where Michael (Al Pacino) kills Sollozzo and McClusky in the restaurant is an excellent example where dim and stark lighting adds to the ominous atmosphere.\n\n3. The Revenant (2015): In this movie, natural light is used to create a realistic and immersive feel. The snowy landscape is beautifully captured with natural light, which makes the audience feel like they are in the cold, harsh wilderness with the characters.\n\n4. The Dark Knight (2008): In this movie, the lighting is used to represent the contrasting tones of heroism and villainy. The use of blue and white light for Batman and red-orange light for the Joker is an excellent example of how lighting is used to symbolize character traits.\n\nIn conclusion, lighting is a key element of filmmaking that can be creatively used to enhance the emotional tone of any movie. It requires both technical skills and artistic vision to create a unique style that captures and conveys the intended tone and atmosphere of the film.",
