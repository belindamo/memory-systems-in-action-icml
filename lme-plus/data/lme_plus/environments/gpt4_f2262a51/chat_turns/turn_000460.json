  "content": "Encountering wildlife is part of the outdoor experience, but if you see a wild animal on the trail while hiking, there are some things you can do to stay safe. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Stay calm and try to make yourself as visible as possible by waving your arms, standing tall, and speaking in a calm voice.\n2. Back away slowly and do not turn your back on the animal. Do not run or make sudden movements, as it may trigger the animal's predatory instincts.\n3. Give the animal plenty of space and try not to get between a mother and her young.\n4. Carry bear spray, a type of pepper spray specifically formulated to repel bears and other large predators. Practice using it before you go to the trail.\n5. If you're in a group, stay together and make noise to deter the animal.\n6. If the animal charges, use your bear spray, climb a tree if possible, or use whatever is at hand as a weapon to protect yourself.\n\nIt's important to remember that wild animal attacks are rare, and most animals are scared of humans and will avoid them if given the chance. Nevertheless, be alert and aware of your surroundings to stay safe in the wilderness.",
