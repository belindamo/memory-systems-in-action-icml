Uploading the court approval letter as an additional document can provide extra assurance that the USPS has all the necessary information to process your application correctly. It's always better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to official documents and identity verification.\n\nBy providing the court approval letter, you're showing the USPS that you've taken the necessary steps to update your name with the relevant authorities, and this can help streamline the process. It's a proactive approach that can reduce the likelihood of any potential issues or delays.\n\nRemember to compress the file if it's too large, and make sure it's clear and legible. Once you've uploaded all the required documents, including the court approval letter, you can submit your application and wait for the USPS to process it.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with your application, and I hope everything goes smoothly!",
