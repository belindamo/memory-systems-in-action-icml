  "content": "I can help you set up a reminder system for your rewards expirations.\n\nSince you don't have any expiration dates listed for your current rewards, I'll assume they don't expire. However, if you have rewards with expiration dates or if you earn new rewards with expiration dates in the future, I can help you track them.\n\nHere's an updated template with an additional column for expiration reminders:\n\n**Loyalty Program Tracker**\n\n**Program Name** | **Program Type** | **Current Points/Balance** | **Rewards Earned** | **Expiration Date** | **Reminder**\n\n1. **BrewCo** | Coffee shop | 150 points | 2 free drinks | None | N/A\n2. **Starbucks Rewards** | Coffee shop | 50 points | None | None | N/A\n3. **ShopRite Price Plus** | Grocery | $15 rewards | None | None | N/A\n4. **Amazon Prime Rewards** | Online shopping | 500 points | $5 cashback | None | N/A\n5. **Ulta Beauty Ultamate Rewards** | Beauty | 200 points | $10 rewards | None | N/A\n6. **FitZone** | Gym | 0 points | None | None | N/A\n\nIf you earn new rewards with expiration dates or want to add expiration dates for existing rewards, let me know. I'll help you set up reminders for:\n\n* 1 week before expiration\n* 1 month before expiration\n* 3 months before expiration (customizable based on your preference)\n\nJust provide me with the expiration date and the reward details, and I'll add it to your tracker with a reminder.\n\nRemember to update me whenever you earn new points, redeem rewards, or need to add expiration dates. I'll help you stay on top of your loyalty programs and rewards!",
