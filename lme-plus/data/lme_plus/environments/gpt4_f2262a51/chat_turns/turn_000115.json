  "content": "Congratulations on your tomato harvest! That's exciting!\n\nCompanion planting is a fascinating topic, and it's great that you're experimenting with it in your garden. Marigolds are indeed known to repel nematodes, which can be a major problem for tomatoes and other plants. Nematodes are microscopic worms that can attack plant roots, causing damage and stunting growth.\n\nMarigolds contain a chemical called alpha-terthienyl, which has been shown to be toxic to nematodes. By planting marigolds near your tomatoes, you're creating a natural barrier that helps to deter these pests. This is just one example of the many benefits of companion planting.\n\nCompanion planting is based on the idea that different plants can benefit from each other's growth, health, and pest resistance. By carefully selecting and placing plants together, you can create a more diverse and resilient garden ecosystem. This approach can:\n\n1. Improve soil health: Some plants, like legumes, fix nitrogen in the soil, while others, like comfrey, act as a fertilizer plant.\n2. Repel pests: As you've experienced, marigolds can repel nematodes, while basil, for example, is said to repel aphids and mites.\n3. Attract beneficial insects: Plants like sunflowers and zinnias attract pollinators and other beneficial insects, which can help with pest control.\n4. Provide shade and support: Taller plants like sunflowers or corn can provide shade for smaller plants, while climbing plants like beans or peas can use other plants as a trellis.\n5. Enhance growth: Some plants, like the \"Three Sisters\" combination of corn, beans, and squash, can benefit from each other's growth habits and nutrient uptake.\n\nSome other popular companion planting combinations include:\n\n* Planting basil with tomatoes to improve flavor and repel pests\n* Planting nasturtiums with cucumbers to repel aphids and whiteflies\n* Planting radishes with cucumbers to repel cucumber beetles\n* Planting borage with strawberries to improve flavor and attract pollinators\n\nRemember, companion planting is not a substitute for good gardening practices like crop rotation, soil care, and integrated pest management. However, it can be a valuable addition to your gardening toolkit, and it's great that you're seeing positive results in your garden!\n\nDo you have any other questions about companion planting or gardening in general?
