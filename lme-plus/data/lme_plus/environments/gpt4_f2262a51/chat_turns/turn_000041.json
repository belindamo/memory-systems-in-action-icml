If your files are larger, you may need to compress them or split them into smaller files.\n4. **Uploading process**: When you reach the \"Upload Documents\" step on the USPS website, you'll see a section with \"Add File\" buttons. Click on each button to upload your documents one by one.\n5. **Select the correct document type**: For each document, select the correct type from the dropdown menu (e.g., \"Proof of Identity\" or \"Proof of Residency\").\n6. **Choose the file**: Click \"Browse\" or \"Choose File\" to select the document from your computer or device.\n7. **Upload the file**: Click \"Upload\" to upload the document to the USPS website.\n8. **Repeat for each document**: Repeat the process for each required document.\n\n**Tips for uploading documents:**\n\n* Make sure your documents are clear and legible.
