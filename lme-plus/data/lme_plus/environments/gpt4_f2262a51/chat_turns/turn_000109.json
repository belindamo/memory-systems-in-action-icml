However, I need to clarify again that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal relationships or interactions with individuals, so I didn't know you had lunch with Rachel or met Mike at a restaurant.\n\nIt's great that you're socializing and making new connections, though! It's always exciting to meet new people and attend parties. Just remember to be respectful of Mike's space and other guests, and don't hesitate to ask if you need any more assistance or advice on what to bring or do at the party.\n\nHave a great time at the party, and I hope your Spinach and Artichoke Dip is a hit!",
