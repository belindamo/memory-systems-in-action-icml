  "content": "Using the 20 gauge copper wire you have on hand is a great way to experiment with filigree work. And yes, shaping the wire into perfect circles and curves is a crucial part of creating a beautiful filigree design. Here are some tips to help you achieve smooth, even curves:\n\n**Mandrel or ring mandrel:** A mandrel or ring mandrel is a must-have tool for shaping wire into perfect circles and curves. You can use a metal or plastic mandrel, or even a wooden dowel rod. The mandrel will help you create consistent, even curves.\n\n**Wrap the wire tightly:** To create a smooth curve, wrap the wire tightly around the mandrel, making sure to keep the wire snug against the mandrel. This will help prevent kinks and unevenness.\n\n**Use the correct wrapping technique:** There are different wrapping techniques you can use to shape the wire, such as the \"wrap and tuck\" or \"wrap and pinch\" method. Experiment with different techniques to find what works best for you.\n\n**Keep the wire straight:** Before wrapping the wire around the mandrel, make sure it's straight and not kinked. This will help you achieve a smooth, even curve.\n\n**Use a consistent tension:** Apply consistent tension while wrapping the wire to maintain an even curve. If you're wrapping a long length of wire, you may need to adjust the tension as you go to prevent sagging.\n\n**Don't over-wrap:** Wrap the wire just until it reaches the desired shape. Over-wrapping can cause the wire to become misshapen or kinked.\n\n**Use a burnishing tool:** A burnishing tool (like a metal or wooden dowel rod) can help you smooth out any wrinkles or kinks in the wire. Simply rub the tool along the wire to smooth out the surface.\n\n**Practice makes perfect:** Shaping wire into perfect circles and curves takes practice, so don't be discouraged if it doesn't come out perfectly at first. Keep practicing, and you'll soon develop the skills you need.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to create beautiful, smooth curves with your 20 gauge copper wire. If you find that the wire is still too thick or difficult to shape, you can always order finer gauge wire online. Good luck, and have fun!",
