They offer a wide range of bikes, including commuter and hybrid models, and their staff is knowledgeable about bike commuting.\n2. **Guru Bicycles** (1365 Liberty St, Springfield): Guru Bicycles is a local, family-owned shop that's been around since 1974. They carry a variety of bikes, including road, mountain, and hybrid models, and offer repair services and bike fittings.\n3. **Springfield Bike Works** (1300 State St, Springfield): This non-profit bike shop focuses on promoting cycling in the community and offers affordable bikes, repairs, and maintenance services. They might have some great options for commuter bikes or be able to help you refurbish a used bike.\n\nBefore visiting any of these shops, you may want to consider a few things:\n\n* What's your budget for a bike?\n* What type of terrain will you be commuting on (e.g., paved roads, bike paths, hills)?\n* Do you have any specific features in mind (e.g., gears, suspension, accessories like fenders or lights)?\n* Are you looking for a new bike or considering a used or refurbished one?\n\nIt's always a good idea to visit a few shops, talk to the staff, and test ride some bikes to find the best fit for your needs.\n\nRemember to also check the City of Springfield's website for information on bike lanes, bike parking, and other cycling resources in the area. Happy cycling!",
