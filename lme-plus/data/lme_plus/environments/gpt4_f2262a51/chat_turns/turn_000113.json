Since Michael had to cancel your previous meeting, it's great that you want to check in and catch up. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Simple text or message**: Send a casual text or message saying, \"Hey Michael, hope you're doing well. Sorry again that we didn't get to catch up last week. When are you free to grab coffee or chat?\"\n2. **Phone call**: If you haven't spoken in a while, a phone call can be a great way to reconnect. Try calling him at a convenient time and say, \"Hey, I wanted to check in and see how you're doing. We didn't get to catch up last week, and I'd love to hear what's new with you.\"\n3. **Social media**: If you're connected on social media, send him a direct message or comment on one of his posts. You could say, \"Hey, sorry we didn't get to catch up last week. Hope everything's going well. Let's plan to grab coffee soon?\"\n4. **Suggest a specific activity**: Instead of just asking to \"catch up,\" suggest a specific activity or outing. For example, \"Hey Michael, I've been wanting to try out that new hiking trail. Would you be up for a hike and coffee soon?\"\n\nRemember to be considerate of Michael's time and schedule. If he had to cancel last week, he might be busy or going through a tough time. Be patient, and try to find a time that works for both of you.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you two catch up soon!",
