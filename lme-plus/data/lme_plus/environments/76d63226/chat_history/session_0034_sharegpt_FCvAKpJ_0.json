Here are the steps you can take to figure out your correct skin tone and how to mix and match the right colors every time:\n5. Determine your undertone: The first step in color matching is to determine your undertone. Undertones are the colors that are present in your skin and can be cool, warm, or neutral. To determine your undertone, look at the veins in your wrist, if they are blue or purple, you most likely have a cool undertone, if they are green, you most likely have a warm undertone, if you can't tell then you have a neutral undertone.\n6. Identify your best colors: Once you have determined your undertone, you can identify the colors that will look best on you. Generally, cool undertones look best in cool colors such as blue, purple, and green, while warm undertones look best in warm colors such as orange, yellow, and red.\n7. Mix and match: Once you have identified your best colors, you can start to mix and match different items in your wardrobe. Try pairing a top in one of your best colors with a bottom in a different shade of the same color, or in a neutral color such as black, white, or beige.\n8. Experiment with different shades and textures: Experiment with different shades and textures of your best colors to find the perfect combination. For example, try pairing a light blue shirt with a darker shade of blue jeans.\n9. Pay attention to the occasion and environment: Keep in mind the occasion and environment, for example, for a formal event, you may want to opt for darker and more muted shades, for a casual event, you may want to opt for brighter and more vibrant shades.\n10. Consider adding a pop of color: To make your outfit stand out, consider adding a pop of color with a colorful accessory such as a scarf, a belt, or a pair of shoes.\n11. Balance your outfit: When putting an outfit together, make sure to balance the colors, for example, if you're wearing a brightly colored top, balance it out with neutral-colored bottoms.\n12. Seek inspiration: Look for inspiration from fashion bloggers, magazines, and social media, and don't be afraid to experiment with different styles and colors.\n\nRemember, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to color matching, and the most important thing is to choose colors that make you feel good and confident."
