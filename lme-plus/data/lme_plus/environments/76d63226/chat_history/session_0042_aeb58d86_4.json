I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to know about specific events or seminars that you attended in person. I can provide general information on climate change and sustainability, but I wouldn't have any information about a specific seminar at your local university.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss the topics that were covered in the seminar or have questions about climate change in general, I'd be happy to help. Alternatively, you could try reaching out to the university or the organizers of the seminar to ask for more information or resources."
