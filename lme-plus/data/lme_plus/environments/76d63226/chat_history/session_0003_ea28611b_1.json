However, if you:\n\n* Primarily take short, domestic trips\n* Have other travel insurance coverage (e.g., through your employer or a separate policy)\n* Don't mind purchasing travel insurance separately for each trip\n\nYou might not need to prioritize travel insurance benefits in your credit card.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to assess your individual travel habits, needs, and priorities when deciding which benefits are most important to you."
