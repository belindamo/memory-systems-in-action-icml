Research the animal-related activity - Before booking an animal-related activity, research the activity and make sure it does not involve any practices that may harm animals, like riding, petting, or hugging. Also, make sure that the animals are not being exploited for humans' entertainment.\n\n2. Check the company's policies - Check the adventure tour company's policies on animal welfare and care. Look for companies that have explicit policies that show they care about the animals' welfare.\n\n3. Look for certifications- Look for adventure tour companies that have certifications and accreditations from reputable organizations that promote ethical animal tourism, such as the Global Sustainable Tourism Council or World Animal Protection.\n\n4. Observe the animals' living conditions - Observe the conditions in which the animals are kept. Ensure that they have enough space to move, access to food and water, and receive proper medical care.\n\n5. Support animal sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers- Consider supporting animal sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers, which focus on the rescue and rehabilitation of animals that cannot be released back into the wild. These centers allow interaction with animals in ways that do not harm them while promoting conservation and education. \n\nBy taking these steps, you can ensure that you do not contribute to animal exploitation and welfare abuses and promote ethical animal tourism.",
