  "content": "Leon Trotsky was a prominent Marxist revolutionary and theorist who played a key role in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet Union. However, after falling out of favor with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, Trotsky was exiled and eventually assassinated in Mexico in 1940.\n\nSince Trotsky's death, many individuals and organizations have continued to identify as Trotskyists, advocating for his political and social theories and promoting his vision of a socialist society. Some famous Trotskyists include:\n\n* Tony Cliff: Founder of the Socialist Workers Party in the United Kingdom and a prominent Marxist theorist.\n* Ernest Mandel: Belgian economist and Marxist theorist who played a key role in the Fourth International, a Trotskyist organization.\n* Max Shachtman: American socialist and Marxist theorist who was a leading figure in the Trotskyist movement in the United States.\n* Michel Pablo: Egyptian Marxist revolutionary and theorist who was a key figure in the Trotskyist movement in the Middle East and Latin America.\n* Joseph Hansen: American Marxist theorist and writer who was a close associate of Trotsky and played a key role in the Fourth International.\n\nToday, there are many Trotskyist organizations and groups around the world, each with their own specific interpretations of Trotsky's theories and strategies for achieving socialist revolution.",
