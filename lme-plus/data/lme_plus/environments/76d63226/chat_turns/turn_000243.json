I want to post at least 5 times a week, and I'm open to posting different types of content like photos, videos, and IGTV. I've been using the hashtag #fitnessmotivation and it's been working well for me - I've gained 25 new followers since I started using it 6 weeks ago. I'd like to focus on themes like workout routines, healthy recipes, and mental wellness.",
