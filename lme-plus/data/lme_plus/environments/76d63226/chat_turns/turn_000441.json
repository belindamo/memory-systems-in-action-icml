I'm a text-based AI, and our conversation just started, so I don't have any information about you or your viewing habits.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to help you find a great show to watch on Netflix! Can you please give me some hints about what you're in the mood for? For example:\n\n1. What genre are you interested in? (e.g., drama, comedy, sci-fi, horror, etc.)\n2. Do you prefer light-hearted and easy-watching or something more complex and thought-provoking?\n3. Are you open to watching a show that's already completed, or do you prefer something that's currently airing?\n4. Is there a particular actor or actress you'd like to see in the show?\n5. How much time do you have to commit to watching a show? Are you looking for something quick to binge or a longer series to follow?\n\nLet me know your preferences, and I'll do my best to recommend a great show for you!",
