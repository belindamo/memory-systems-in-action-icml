Simply blend everything together until smooth, and serve with pita bread, veggies, or crackers.\n\n2. Roasted veggies: Whisk together tahini, olive oil, maple syrup, and a splash of apple cider vinegar to make a creamy, tangy sauce for roasted vegetables (such as broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, or sweet potatoes).\n\n3. Falafel: Add some tahini to falafel mix to make it richer and creamier. Serve the falafel in pita bread with tahini sauce, veggies, and pickles.\n\n4.
