They can assess Max's current condition, diet, and nutritional needs to provide personalized recommendations.\n\nThat being said, here are some general guidelines and popular feed options that are suitable for horses that need to gain weight:\n\n1. **High-calorie feeds:** Look for feeds with a higher caloric density (around 1.2-1.4 Mcal/lb) to help Max gain weight. Some popular brands include:\n\t* Purina Equine Senior Active: A high-calorie feed designed for senior horses or those that need extra energy.\n\t* Triple Crown Nutrition's Senior Formula: A high-calorie feed with added fat and protein for weight gain.\n\t* Nutrena's SafeChoice Perform: A high-calorie feed with a blend of grains and fat sources to support weight gain.\n2. **Grain-based feeds:** Grains like oats, corn, and barley can provide extra calories for Max. Some popular grain-based feeds include:\n\t* Omolene 200: A high-energy feed with a blend of grains and fat sources.\n\t* Tribute Equine Nutrition's Kalm 'N EZ: A grain-based feed with added fat and calcium for weight gain.\n3. **Fat supplements:** Adding a fat supplement to Max's current feed can provide extra calories without changing his entire diet. Some popular options include:\n\t* CoolStance Copra: A high-fat supplement made from coconut oil and other ingredients.\n\t* Empyrean's Equi-Fat: A blend of vegetable oils and other nutrients to support weight gain.\n\nRemember to always transition Max to a new feed gradually (over 7-10 days) to prevent digestive upset. It's also essential to ensure he has access to plenty of fresh water and hay to support his overall health.\n\nPlease consult with a veterinarian to determine the best course of action for Max's specific needs. They can help you create a personalized feeding plan that takes into account his age, breed, weight, and health status.\n\nHow's Max doing otherwise? Has he been experiencing any health issues or changes in his behavior?",
