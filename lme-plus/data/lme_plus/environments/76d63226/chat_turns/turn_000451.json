  "content": "That's great to hear! Congratulations on taking steps to manage your screen time and stay on track! Setting a daily time limit on Netflix is a fantastic way to maintain a healthy balance between watching TV and other activities.\n\nRemoving unused apps from your TV is also a great idea. It's amazing how cluttered our devices can get with apps we never use. By decluttering your TV's app menu, you're making it easier to focus on the apps you actually use and enjoy.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mentioned the Facebook Watch app. I think many of us have apps on our devices that we never use or barely touch. It's a great opportunity to reassess our digital habits and make changes to benefit our well-being.\n\nWhat do you plan to do with the extra time you're saving by watching less TV? Are you exploring new hobbies, reading more, or doing something else to stay engaged and active?",
