Since you've noticed changes in his posture and gait, it's possible that he may be experiencing some discomfort or pain that's contributing to the weight loss.\n\nThe new custom-made saddle is a great investment, and it's wonderful that it's improved his comfort and mobility! A well-fitting saddle can make a huge difference in a horse's overall well-being.\n\nIn addition to the dietary changes we discussed earlier, it might be helpful to have Max's teeth checked by an equine dentist to rule out any dental issues that could be contributing to his weight loss. Regular dental care is essential for horses, and it can have a significant impact on their overall health and well-being.\n\nIt's also a good idea to have Max's joints checked by a veterinarian to assess any potential issues that could be affecting his gait and posture. They can perform a lameness exam and take radiographs (x-rays) to identify any underlying conditions that may need to be addressed.\n\nRemember to keep a close eye on Max's weight and overall health, and don't hesitate to reach out to your veterinarian if you notice any further changes or concerns.\n\nBy the way, how's your backyard flock doing? Are you selling the eggs at a local market or to friends and family?",
