I appreciate it.\n\nI'm glad you're open to receiving information about the equatorial project leaders group. We've actually set up a WhatsApp community where members can share their projects, successes, and collaborate on reaching the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. I'd like to invite you to join the group to help us reverse the negative effects of climate change and make a greater impact together.\n\nHere's the link to join the WhatsApp community group: <https://bit.ly/Earth-Day-Community>\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need assistance. Looking forward to having you in the group!\n\nBest regards,\nJo",
