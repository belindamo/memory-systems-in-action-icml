  "content": "Dry chicken and crunchy bell peppers can definitely bring down the overall dish.\n\n**Dry Chicken:**\n\n* **Overcooking**: It's possible that the chicken was cooked for too long or at too high a heat, causing it to dry out. Make sure to cook the chicken to the recommended internal temperature (165\u00b0F), but avoid overcooking.\n* **Insufficient marination**: If the recipe didn't include a marinade or the chicken wasn't marinated for enough time, it might not have been tender and juicy. Try marinating the chicken for at least 30 minutes to an hour in your favorite seasonings and acids (like lime juice or vinegar).\n* **Not enough oil or moisture**: If the skillet was too dry or the chicken wasn't basted with enough oil or sauce, it can lead to dryness. Make sure to add a sufficient amount of oil to the skillet and baste the chicken regularly while it's cooking.\n\n**Crunchy Bell Peppers:**\n\n* **Undercooking**: Bell peppers need a bit of time to soften and caramelize. Try cooking them for a few minutes longer, stirring occasionally, until they reach your desired level of tenderness.\n* **High heat**: If the heat was too high, the bell peppers might have charred on the outside before cooking through. Try reducing the heat to medium-high or medium to give them a chance to cook more evenly.\n* **Not enough liquid**: Bell peppers release their natural sweetness when cooked with a bit of liquid. Add a splash of oil, broth, or sauce to the skillet to help them cook down and become tender.\n\n**Skillet Tips:**\n\n* **Choose the right skillet**: A cast-iron or stainless steel skillet is ideal for cooking fajitas, as they retain heat well and can achieve a great sear. Avoid using a non-stick skillet, as it can't handle high heat.\n* **Preheat the skillet**: Make sure the skillet is hot before adding the chicken and bell peppers. You can test the heat by flicking a few drops of water onto the skillet \u2013 if they sizzle and evaporate quickly, it's ready to go.\n\nFor your next attempt, try adjusting these factors and see if it makes a difference. Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries to get it just right!\n\nDo you have any questions about marinating, cooking techniques, or skillet care? I'm here to help!",
