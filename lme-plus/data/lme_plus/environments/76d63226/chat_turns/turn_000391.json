  "content": "We can use the formula for the magnetic field at the surface of a wire:\n\nB = \u03bc0I/(2\u03c0r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, I is the current, r is the radius of the wire, and \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 T\u00b7m/A).\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the wire from its diameter:\n\nd = 2r\nr = d/2 = 1.3 mm = 0.0013 m\n\nThen, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 T\u00b7m/A) \u00d7 (50 A) / (2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.0013 m)\nB = 0.039 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the surface of the wire is 0.039 T.",
