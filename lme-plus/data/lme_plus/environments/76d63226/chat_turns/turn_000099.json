The leather is sourced from environmentally responsible suppliers, and Bellroy is committed to using only the highest-quality materials that will stand the test of time.\n\nThe Slim Sleeve Wallet features a single-piece construction, which means that the leather is folded and stitched together to create a strong and durable wallet. The stitching is impeccable, and the edges are carefully finished to prevent fraying.\n\nBellroy's leather is also treated with a water-resistant coating, which helps protect your cards and cash from moisture. However, it's still important to avoid exposing your wallet to excessive water or harsh chemicals.\n\n**RFID-Blocking Material:**\nRFID-blocking material is designed to protect your credit cards from unauthorized scanning and identity theft. It's a good idea to consider a wallet with RFID-blocking material if you're concerned about credit card skimming or identity theft.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that RFID-blocking material is not necessarily a must-have feature for everyone. If you're not carrying sensitive information like passports or ID cards, a standard wallet without RFID-blocking material might be sufficient.\n\nThat being said, if you do want RFID-blocking protection, Bellroy does offer some wallets with this feature. Their RFID-blocking material is integrated into the wallet's lining and is designed to block frequencies of 13.56 MHz, which is the frequency used by most credit cards and passports.\n\nIf you're interested in a Bellroy wallet with RFID-blocking material, you can consider their **Bellroy Slim Sleeve RFID Wallet**. It's essentially the same design as the standard Slim Sleeve Wallet but with the added protection of RFID-blocking material.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nThe Bellroy Slim Sleeve Wallet is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-quality, slim wallet that's both stylish and durable. While RFID-blocking material is a nice feature, it's not essential for everyone. If you're concerned about credit card skimming or identity theft, consider the RFID-blocking version. Otherwise, the standard Slim Sleeve Wallet is a great option.\n\nHope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions!",
