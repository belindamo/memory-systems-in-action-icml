We can do this by applying the chain rule and the quotient rule:\n\ny = \u221a(x\u00b3) - 5/x + (1/2)\u03c0\n\ndy/dx = d/dx [\u221a(x\u00b3)] - d/dx [5/x] + d/dx [(1/2)\u03c0]\n\n= (1/2)(x\u00b3)^(-1/2) \\* 3x\u00b2 - (-5x^(-2)) - 0 (applying the chain rule and quotient rule)\n\n= (3/2)\u221a(x) + 5/x\u00b2 (simplifying the expression)\n\nTherefore, the derivative of y with respect to x is (3/2)\u221a(x) + 5/x\u00b2.",
