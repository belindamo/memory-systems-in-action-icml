You know, it's funny, when I was helping that elderly lady with her bags, I realized that sometimes it's the small acts of kindness that can make a big difference in someone's day. Do you have any tips on how to plan a successful potluck or family gathering, like how to coordinate dishes or make sure there's enough food for everyone?",
