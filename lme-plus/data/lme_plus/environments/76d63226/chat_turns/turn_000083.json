  "content": "I'd be happy to help you find a local vet who specializes in equine care for Max!\n\nTo find a vet, I'll need to know your location. Could you please share your city or zip code with me? That way, I can provide you with a list of local veterinarians who specialize in equine care.\n\nThat's great to hear that you're using the extra income from selling eggs to offset the cost of Max's care! 12 eggs per day is a impressive average, by the way. Do you have a small farm or a backyard flock?\n\nOnce I have your location, I can assist you in finding a vet for Max.",
