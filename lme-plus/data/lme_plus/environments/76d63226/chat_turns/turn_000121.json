  "content": "I feel like this question might seem like a tangent but it connects. if things in our universe and microverse can by infinitely small or large, could it actually be that we are part of a cosmic intelligence, like a tiny piece of the atoms of some neuron the size of many galactic clusters. the same way quarks and other subatomic particles when together in an atom start displaying physical characteristics of that element they make up but from their perspective they would be unique and unaware. is it possible things really are infinitely large and small because if that were true, we \\_really\\_ could be a physical part of something larger",
