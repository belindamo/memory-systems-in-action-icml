  "content": "MK cautiously made his way through the dense jungle foliage, his eyes scanning the ground for any ripe fruit that he could bring back to Macaque. But as he rounded a bend in the path, the sound of shouting reached his ears. He hesitated for a moment, unsure if he should investigate, but his curiosity got the better of him.\n\nAs he approached the clearing, he could see his father, Wukong, towering over a group of dark-haired monkeys. Wukong's royal guards stood around him, weapons drawn and at the ready. The dark-haired monkeys were on their knees, clearly terrified.\n\n\"Where are they?\" Wukong bellowed, his voice filled with anger. \"Where is the demon that calls itself king, and my imbecile son?\"\n\nOne of the dark-haired monkeys trembled as they spoke. \"I-I don't know, my king. We haven't seen them.\"\n\nWukong sneered. \"You expect me to believe that? You all look guilty as sin to me.\"\n\nMK's heart raced as he watched the scene unfold. He knew he had to do something to help, but he didn't know what. He stepped forward, trying to make himself seen.\n\n\"Father,\" he called out, his voice shaking. \"Please, stop this.\"\n\nWukong whirled around to face him, his expression hardening. \"You,\" he spat. \"You're just as guilty as the rest of them. Guards, seize him.\"\n\nThe guards rushed forward, but MK was quick. He turned and ran, darting back into the jungle. He could hear the guards shouting, calling for him to stop, but he didn't look back. He knew he had to get as far away as possible, to keep Macaque and himself safe.\n\nAs he ran, he couldn't shake the sight of the dark-haired monkeys, kneeling and trembling, from his mind. He knew he had to do something to help them, but he didn't know what. He could only hope that he and Macaque would be able to stop Wukong before it was too late.",
