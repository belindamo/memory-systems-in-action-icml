  "content": "Assuming that the current flows in the center of the conductor, we can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field at a distance r from the wire:\n\ndB = \u03bc0/4\u03c0 \\* Idl x r / r^3\n\nwhere \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space, Idl is the current element (equal to the current times the differential length dl), and r is the distance from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the wire and has the same magnitude at every point on a circular path around the wire. Therefore, we can use the formula for the magnetic field of a long straight wire at a distance r:\n\nB = \u03bc0/2\u03c0 \\* I / r\n\nwhere I is the current in the wire and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nPlugging in the values given, we get:\n\nB = \u03bc0/2\u03c0 \\* I / r\n= (4\u03c0x10^-7 Tm/A) / (2\u03c0) \\* 0.002 A / 0.02 m\n= 2x10^-5 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire is 2x10^-5 T.",
