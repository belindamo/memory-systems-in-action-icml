  "content": "The induced emf can be calculated using the formula:\n\nemf = -NAB\u03c9sin\u03b8\n\nwhere N is the number of turns in the antenna, A is the area of the loop formed by the antenna, B is the magnetic field strength, \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the motion, and \u03b8 is the angle between the magnetic field and the direction of motion.\n\nAssuming that the antenna is oriented perpendicular to the direction of motion, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 and sin\u03b8 = 1. Also, the angular frequency \u03c9 can be calculated as \u03c9 = v/r, where v is the velocity of the automobile and r is the radius of the circular path followed by the antenna (since it is perpendicular to the direction of motion).\n\nThe radius of the circular path can be approximated as the length of the antenna, so r = 110 cm = 1.1 m. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n\u03c9 = v/r = (90 km/h) / (1.1 m) = 22.12 rad/s\n\nA = \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0(1.1 m)^2 = 3.801 m^2\n\nN = 1 (assuming a single-turn antenna)\n\nSubstituting all values, we get:\n\nemf = -NAB\u03c9sin\u03b8 = -(1)(3.801 m^2)(55 \u00b5T)(22.12 rad/s)(1) = -4.38\u00d710^-3 V\n\nTherefore, the induced emf is approximately 4.38 millivolts (mV).",
