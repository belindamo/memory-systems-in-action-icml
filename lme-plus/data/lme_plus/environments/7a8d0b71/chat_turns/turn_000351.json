  "content": "Employers can actively recruit individuals with disabilities for their workplace by implementing the following measures,\n\n1. Making a deliberate effort to reach out to disability support groups and communities: Making a point of engaging with disability organizations or job centres who specialize in recruiting potential candidates with disabilities can be a good starting point. Employers can partner with them or create a job vacancy notice that is tailored to meet the accessibility needs of candidates with disabilities.\n\n2. Creating a more inclusive job application process: Employers can advertise job postings on more accessible platforms, provide interview accommodations, and offer technology devices necessary for a successful interview.\n\n3. Enhance the company's career website: Employers can include accessibility options that cater to disabled candidates, such as a section featuring real-life testimonials from current employees with disabilities, and captions or descriptions for videos ensuring they are accessible for candidates who are blind or hearing impaired.\n\n4. Conducting anti-bias training for interviewers and hiring teams: Allowing hiring teams to gain sensitivity and awareness to disabilities and how they can best support interviewing candidates with disabilities, and help employers create a more inclusive environment tailored towards accommodating disabled candidates or employees.\n\n5. Accessing government resources: Many countries offer financial incentives for employers who hire or accommodate employees with disabilities, including funding to cover the costs of hiring or accommodating employees with disabilities.\n\nBy implementing these and other efforts, employers can signal their commitment to creating a more inclusive and diverse workplace that can attract and retain employees with disabilities. By demonstrating proactive and visible activities, Employers can shift from mere compliance with disability-related laws and become more accessible to people with disabilities as potential employees.",
