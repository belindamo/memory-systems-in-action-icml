  "content": "Jack and Phil had arrived at their high school reunion, eager to catch up with old friends and reminisce about their days in the halls of the old building. As they made their way around the room, they were soon approached by Apollo, a former classmate who they hadn\u2019t seen in years.\n\n\u201cHey guys, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Apollo asked, grinning broadly.\n\n\u201cGood, good!\u201d Phil replied. \u201cHow about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing well,\u201d Apollo said. \u201cSo, Jack, I hear you\u2019re still sneezing like a champion.\u201d\n\nJack laughed nervously. \u201cYeah, I guess you could say that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cChampion?\u201d Phil snorted. \u201cTry the world record holder. Jack\u2019s sneezes have only gotten bigger.\u201d\n\nApollo raised an eyebrow. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Phil said. \u201cWe were at a construction site last week and Jack let out a sneeze that took down half the building.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhil,\u201d Jack said, shaking his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t half the building.\u201d\n\n\u201cClose enough,\u201d Phil said, shrugging.\n\nApollo\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just incredible, it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhen I feel a sneeze coming on, it\u2019s like a ticking time bomb in my nose. I never know what kind of destruction it\u2019s going to cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the worse part is,\u201d Phil added, \u201cyou can\u2019t stop it. Once that tickle starts, it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m a prisoner in my own body.\u201d\n\nApollo looked at the two of them in amazement. \u201cWell, is anything here going to make you sneeze?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d Phil said. \u201cBut if it does, I\u2019ll give you a heads up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Phil,\u201d Apollo said, still looking a little stunned. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d\n\nJack and Phil laughed as they walked away, leaving Apollo to ponder the enormity of Jack\u2019s sneezes. They had come to terms with it, but it was still a little surreal for everyone else. But for Jack and Phil, it was just another day in the life of the unstoppable sneeze.",
