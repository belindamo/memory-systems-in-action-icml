  "content": "Apollo stood in front of Jack and Phil, his arms crossed over his chest. \"So, Jack,\" he said, \"I heard you used to have quite the sneeze back in high school.\"\n\nPhil laughed. \"Yeah, Jack's sneezes have only gotten bigger since then. You wouldn't believe it.\"\n\nApollo raised an eyebrow. \"Really? Bigger?\"\n\nPhil nodded. \"Oh yeah. I mean, have you seen the destruction a Jack sneeze can cause? The man could level a building with just one sneeze.\"\n\nApollo shook his head in disbelief. \"I don't think I've ever heard of sneezes being that powerful.\"\n\nPhil chuckled. \"Well, you better believe it. I've seen it with my own two eyes. The man can clear out a room with one sneeze. And don't even get me started on the destruction it causes on a construction site. I'm talking smashed windows, broken pipes, knocked-over walls. The list goes on.\"\n\nApollo looked at Jack, who simply shrugged. \"It's true,\" Jack said. \"I can't control it. I've tried everything.\"\n\nApollo sighed. \"Well, I hope nothing here at the reunion makes you sneeze.\"\n\nPhil grinned. \"Don't worry, I'll give you a heads up if Jack starts to feel a sneeze coming on.\"\n\nThe three of them shared a laugh as they walked away, the magnitude of Jack's sneezes still fresh in their minds.",
