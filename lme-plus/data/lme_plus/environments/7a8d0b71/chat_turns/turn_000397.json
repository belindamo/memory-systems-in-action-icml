Here are some additional multiplayer stealth games you may want to consider:\n\n1) Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands - A tactical shooter game that features both single and multiplayer modes, where players can work together to take down cartel bosses through stealth and coordinated attacks. 2) Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine - A game where players work together to sneak through levels and pull off heists by avoiding guards and security cameras. 3) SpyParty - A game where one player is the spy, and the other player is a sniper tasked with identifying the spy by observing their behavior and movements. 4) The Ship: Murder Party - A multiplayer game where players must hunt down and assassinate their targets while avoiding being killed by their own pursuer. 5) Aragami - A game where players control a ninja assassin with supernatural powers and can play cooperatively to take down enemies without being detected. 6) Styx: Shards of Darkness - A game where players control a goblin thief and can play cooperatively with another player to infiltrate areas and eliminate enemies using stealth tactics. Note that some of the games I mentioned have limited multiplayer modes or are single-player-focused, so it's always best to check each game's official website and community pages for more information about the game and its multiplayer capabilities.",
