  "content": "Jack and Phil were working on a construction site when they heard a mighty explosion of air, like a sonic boom. They looked around, but no one was near enough to have made the noise. Suddenly, they heard it again, another sneeze of monstrous proportions.\n\nPhil looked at Jack, trying to figure out if it was Jack who had sneezed, but Jack shook his head. He could feel the tickle in his own nose, but he knew it wasn't him who had let out that sneeze.\n\n\"Where is that coming from?\" Phil asked, his voice a mixture of curiosity and fear.\n\nThey followed the sound, walking down the street towards the source. They turned a corner and found themselves face-to-face with another young man, who was in the midst of another sneeze.\n\nThis sneeze was even bigger than the first two, causing the windows of nearby buildings to shake and rattle. The young man was holding his nose with both hands, trying to keep himself together.\n\nPhil and Jack approached him cautiously, ready for another sneeze. But the young man only smiled sheepishly at them and apologized.\n\n\"Sorry about that,\" he said. \"I've always had big sneezes, but they've been getting worse lately.\"\n\nJack and Phil exchanged a look of disbelief. They had never met anyone with sneezes like Jack's before. They introduced themselves and found out the young man's name was Ben.\n\nBen explained that he had always struggled with his sneezes, but they had gotten much worse in the last few months. He was worried that his sneezes were going to get him into trouble, or even hurt someone.\n\nJack and Phil listened sympathetically, telling Ben about their own experiences with giant sneezes. They all laughed about the absurdity of it all, but at the same time, they were all aware of the danger that their sneezes posed.\n\nIn the end, Jack, Phil, and Ben agreed to work together, sharing tips and tricks for managing their sneezes. They promised to look out for each other, and to always be there to help if one of them needed it.\n\nAs they walked away, Jack, Phil, and Ben laughed and joked, but they also knew that their lives would never be the same again. They were part of a small, exclusive club, the members of which all had one thing in common: sneezes that were big enough to shake the world.",
