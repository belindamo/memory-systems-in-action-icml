Your sneezes were pretty big back then, but they couldn't compare to what they are now.\"\n\nPhil nodded in agreement. \"Oh yeah, Jack's sneezes have gotten way bigger since then. I remember one time when we were working on a construction site, Jack let out a sneeze that knocked over a whole wall. It was something else, let me tell you.\"\n\nApollo's eyes widened in disbelief. \"You're not serious, are you?\"\n\n\"Dead serious,\" Phil replied. \"And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Jack's sneezes have only gotten bigger and more destructive as time has gone on.\"\n\n\"It's like he's got a ticking time bomb in his nose,\" Jack added with a grin.\n\nApollo looked from Jack to Phil and back again. \"I can hardly believe it. What happens if they keep getting bigger?\"\n\nPhil shrugged. \"That's a good question, Apollo. We just take it one sneeze at a time and hope for the best.\"\n\n\"And hope that nothing gets destroyed in the process,\" Jack added with a laugh.",
