What's the project's objective, and what are you trying to achieve?\n\nSome questions to consider:\n\n* What's the project's goal or deliverable?\n* Who's the target audience or stakeholder?\n* Are there any specific timelines or deadlines?\n* Are there any specific tools, resources, or technologies involved?\n\nFeel free to share as much or as little information as you have at this point. This will help me generate a list of potential tasks to get you started.\n\nOnce we have a list of tasks, we can begin categorizing them into must-haves, should-haves, and nice-to-haves to help you prioritize your work.\n\nType away, and let's get started!",
