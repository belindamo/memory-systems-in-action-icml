Here are some tips to help you optimize your freestyle technique:\n\n1. **Body position**: Maintain a horizontal body position with your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned. This will help you cut through the water with less resistance.\n2. **Streamline**: Keep your body as streamlined as possible by squeezing your shoulders together, engaging your core, and keeping your legs together.\n3. **Arm technique**:\n\t* Enter the water with your fingertips, keeping your elbows high and your hands facing downwards.\n\t* Pull your arms back, keeping your elbows close to the surface, and your hands exiting the water with your palms facing upwards.\n\t* Focus on using your entire arm, not just your hands, to generate power.\n4. **Hand entry**: Aim to enter the water with your hands about 10-12 inches in front of your shoulders, with your fingers spread wide.\n5. **Catch**: Focus on catching the water with your fingertips, rather than slapping the water. This will help you generate more power and reduce drag.\n6. **Pull phase**: Keep your arms relaxed and focus on using your back and shoulder muscles to generate power.\n7. **Recovery phase**: Keep your arms close to the surface, with your elbows high, and your hands recovering quickly to the front of your body.\n8. **Kick**: Use a flutter kick, keeping your legs relaxed and your feet together. Avoid bending your knees or ankles.\n9. **Breathing**: Practice breathing every 2-3 strokes, turning your head to the side and taking a quick breath. Try to breathe out slowly underwater.\n10. **Drills**: Incorporate drills into your swim sessions to focus on specific aspects of your technique, such as arm technique, kick, or body position.\n\nRemember to practice these tips gradually, focusing on one or two aspects of your technique at a time. It may take time to develop muscle memory, but with consistent practice, you'll see improvements in your freestyle technique.\n\nAlso, consider filming yourself swimming or working with a swim coach to get personalized feedback on your technique.\n\nHow do you plan to incorporate these tips into your swim training, and what specific areas of your technique do you think need the most improvement?",
