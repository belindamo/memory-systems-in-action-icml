I'd be happy to help you get started.\n\nTo achieve a modern minimalist look, here are some key principles to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Less is more**: Minimalism is all about simplicity and restraint. Avoid clutter and excessive ornamentation.\n2. **Clean lines and shapes**: Look for furniture with simple, geometric shapes and clean lines.\n3. **Monochromatic color scheme**: Stick to a limited color palette, often featuring a dominant neutral color (e.g., white, gray, beige) and one or two accent colors.\n4. **Natural light**: Make the most of natural light by using sheer curtains, mirrors, and reflective surfaces.\n5. **Functionality**: Choose multi-functional pieces that serve more than one purpose.\n6. **Textured contrasts**: Balance smooth surfaces (e.g., glass, wood) with textured ones (e.g., rugs, throw blankets).\n7. **Edit and curate**: Only display a few, carefully selected decorative items that add visual interest.\n\nTo begin, let's break down your space into areas:\n\n1. **Living room**:\n\t* Start with a neutral-colored sofa and armchair.
