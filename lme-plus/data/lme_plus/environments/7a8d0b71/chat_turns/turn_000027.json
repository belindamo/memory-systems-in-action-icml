Since I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to specific local events. However, I can suggest some ways to find upcoming charity events and auctions in your area:\n\n**Online Event Calendars:**\n\n1. **Eventbrite**: A popular platform for event organizers to list their events. You can search for charity events, auctions, or specific causes (e.g., education, healthcare) in your area.\n2. **Charity Navigator**: A non-profit evaluator that also lists charity events and auctions on their website. You can search by location, cause, or event type.\n3. **Local newspaper or event websites**: Check the entertainment or lifestyle sections of your local newspaper or event websites (e.g., Patch, Localwise) for charity event listings.\n\n**Social Media and Online Platforms:**\n\n1. **Facebook Events**: Follow local charities, non-profits, or community organizations on Facebook to stay updated on their upcoming events.\n2. **Twitter**: Use hashtags related to philanthropy, charity events, or specific causes to discover upcoming events in your area.\n3. **GivingGrid**: A platform that lists charity events, auctions, and fundraising campaigns. You can search by location or cause.\n\n**Networking and Local Connections:**\n\n1. **Reach out to local charities**: Contact charities or non-profits that align with your interests and ask about upcoming events or auctions.\n2. **Rotary Club or other service organizations**: As you've already attended a Rotary Club event, consider reaching out to them or other service organizations (e.g., Lions Club, Kiwanis) for information on upcoming events.\n3. **Friends and colleagues**: Ask friends, family, or colleagues if they know of any charity events or auctions happening in the next few months.\n\n**Specific Charity Events and Auctions:**\n\n1. **Galas and formal events**: Keep an eye out for black-tie galas, charity balls, or formal events that often feature auctions, raffles, or fundraisers.\n2. **Wine and dine events**: Wine tastings, charity cook-offs, or food festivals can be great opportunities to network and support a good cause.\n3. **Online auctions**: Look for online charity auctions, especially during holidays or special awareness months (e.g., Breast Cancer Awareness Month).\n\nRemember to research the charity or organization hosting the event to ensure it aligns with your values and goals. Good luck, and I hope you find some exciting charity events and auctions to attend!",
