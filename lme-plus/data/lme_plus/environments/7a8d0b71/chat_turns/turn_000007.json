I'm happy to help you decide whether a humidifier would be beneficial for him and other plants.\n\n**Do humidifiers work for all types of plants?**\n\nWhile humidifiers can benefit most plants, they're more beneficial for certain types that thrive in humid environments. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Plants that love humidifiers:**\n\n1. **Tropical plants:** Plants native to tropical regions, like ferns, peace lilies, and orchids, thrive in high-humidity environments (50-80% RH).\n2. **Foliage plants:** Plants with large leaves, like snake plants (like Spike!), spider plants, and dracaena, benefit from humidifiers to prevent leaf dryness and curling.\n3. **Succulents and cacti:** While they're adapted to dry conditions, many succulents and cacti still benefit from occasional humidity to prevent over-drying and promote healthy growth.\n4. **Air plants:** Tillandsia and other air plants, which absorb moisture through their leaves, love humidifiers to maintain optimal humidity levels.\n\n**Plants that don't need humidifiers:**\n\n1. **Cacti and succulents in dry environments:** If you live in a dry climate or have a well-ventilated space, cacti and succulents might not need a humidifier.\n2. **Desert plants:** Plants adapted to arid environments, like aloe vera and agave, don't require high humidity.\n3. **Some herbaceous plants:** Plants like basil, mint, and parsley, which are adapted to moderate humidity, might not benefit significantly from a humidifier.\n\n**Considerations for Spike, your snake plant:**\n\nAs a snake plant, Spike is a tropical plant that typically thrives in environments with moderate to high humidity (40-60% RH). If you live in a dry climate or have a well-ventilated space, a humidifier can help maintain a more suitable environment for Spike. However, if you live in a humid climate or have a space with naturally high humidity, a humidifier might not be necessary.\n\n**Before getting a humidifier:**\n\n1. **Check your space's humidity:** Use a hygrometer to determine the current humidity level in your space.\n2. **Assess Spike's needs:** Observe Spike's condition and adjust your care routine accordingly. If he's droopy, it might be due to underwatering, overwatering, or other factors, not just humidity.\n3. **Research specific plant needs:** Learn about the specific humidity requirements of your plants and adjust your care accordingly.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can decide whether a humidifier would be beneficial for Spike and your other plants. Happy planting!",
