  "content": "Finding good deals on accommodations for a large group can be a challenge, but I've got some tips to help you out:\n\n1. **Book early**: The earlier you book, the better your chances of getting a good deal. Many hotels and vacation rentals offer early-bird discounts or promotions for advance bookings.\n2. **Use online travel agencies (OTAs)**: Websites like Expedia, Booking.com, and Hotels.com can help you compare prices and find deals on hotels, resorts, and vacation rentals. They often offer discounts, package deals, or loyalty programs.\n3. **Vacation rental websites**: Platforms like VRBO, Airbnb, and HomeAway specialize in vacation rentals, which can be a cost-effective option for large groups. You can often negotiate with the owners or property managers for better rates.\n4. **Contact hotels and resorts directly**: Sometimes, hotels and resorts offer special group rates or packages that aren't advertised online. Reach out to their group sales or events teams to inquire about customized quotes.\n5. **Look for package deals**: Booking a package that includes accommodations, activities, and other perks can sometimes be cheaper than booking each component separately.\n6. **Consider off-peak seasons**: Prices for accommodations often drop during the off-season or during periods with lower demand. If you have flexibility in your travel dates, take advantage of these deals.\n7. **Negotiate**: If you're booking a large group, don't be afraid to negotiate with the accommodation provider. They may be willing to offer discounts or throw in extras to secure your business.\n8. **Use travel apps**: Apps like Hotel Tonight or Last Minute Travel offer last-minute deals on unsold inventory, which can be a great way to snag a bargain.\n9. **Check for group discounts**: Many hotels and resorts offer discounts for large groups, especially for events like weddings or family reunions. Be sure to ask about these discounts when inquiring about rates.\n10. **Read reviews and check policies**: Always research the accommodation's policies, including cancellation fees, check-in/check-out times, and amenities. This will help you avoid any surprises or unexpected costs.\n\nFor large groups, consider the following accommodation types:\n\n* **Vacation rentals**: These can be a cost-effective option, as you can split the cost among the group. Look for properties with multiple bedrooms, kitchens, and living areas.\n* **Condo-style hotels**: These often offer more space and amenities than traditional hotel rooms, making them suitable for larger groups.\n* **Resorts**: Many resorts have villas or suites that can accommodate large groups. They may also offer packages and amenities tailored to families or groups.\n\nRemember to always carefully review the terms and conditions of any accommodation before booking, especially when it comes to cancellation policies and fees.\n\nI hope these tips help you find the perfect accommodations for your family vacation!",
