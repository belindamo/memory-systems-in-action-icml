  "content": "The dairy component is a crucial aspect of Indian sauces, and each dairy product brings a unique texture and flavor to the table. Let me break down the differences between heavy cream, butter, and yogurt to help you achieve that rich and creamy texture:\n\n**Heavy Cream:**\n\n* Adds a luxurious, velvety texture to the sauce\n* Provides a rich, creamy flavor\n* Can be used in large quantities to create a thick, creamy sauce\n* Can be simmered for a long time without breaking or curdling\n\nHeavy cream is a great choice if you want a super-rich and creamy sauce. However, keep in mind that it can make the sauce quite dense and heavy. If you're looking for a lighter sauce, you may want to use a combination of heavy cream and another dairy product.\n\n**Butter:**\n\n* Adds a rich, nutty flavor to the sauce\n* Can be used to enrich the sauce and add depth\n* Can be used in small quantities to add a subtle creaminess\n* Can be browned to create a nutty, caramel-like flavor (beurre noisette)\n\nButter is a great addition to Indian sauces, especially when browned to create a nutty flavor. However, it can add a lot of calories to the dish, so use it sparingly. Butter can also make the sauce slightly thicker, but it won't provide the same level of creaminess as heavy cream or yogurt.\n\n**Yogurt:**\n\n* Adds a tangy, creamy flavor to the sauce\n* Can be used to thin out the sauce and create a lighter consistency\n* Can be used in large quantities to create a creamy, tangy sauce\n* Can help to balance the richness of the dish\n\nYogurt is a great choice if you want a lighter, more balanced sauce. It adds a tangy flavor and a creamy texture without making the sauce too rich. However, yogurt can curdle if it's heated too quickly or to a high temperature, so be sure to add it towards the end of cooking and stir constantly.\n\n**Combining dairy products:**\n\nTo replicate the rich and creamy texture of your grandmother's chicken tikka masala, you can try combining heavy cream and yogurt or butter and cream. This will give you a balanced sauce with a rich, creamy texture and a subtle tang. For example:\n\n* Use 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup yogurt for a creamy, tangy sauce\n* Use 2 tablespoons butter and 1/4 cup heavy cream for a rich, nutty sauce\n* Use 1/4 cup yogurt and 2 tablespoons butter for a creamy, slightly tangy sauce\n\nRemember, the key to achieving a rich and creamy sauce is to simmer it patiently and stir constantly. This will help to reduce the liquid and intensify the flavors, creating a sauce that's both rich and creamy.\n\nI hope this helps you to create a sauce that's reminiscent of your grandmother's chicken tikka masala!",
