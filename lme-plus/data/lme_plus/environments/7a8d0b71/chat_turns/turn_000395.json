  "content": "Yes, some of the games I mentioned earlier have multiplayer modes. Here are a few examples:\n\n1) Hitman Series - Hitman 2 (2018) has a multiplayer mode where players can compete to complete assassination challenges using stealth tactics. 2) Splinter Cell series - Splinter Cell: Blacklist has a cooperative multiplayer mode where players can complete missions together using stealth tactics while communicating over voice. 3) Assassin's Creed series - Many of the games in the Assassin's Creed series have multiplayer modes that involve sneaking up on other players while using stealth tactics. 4) Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain - The game features a multiplayer mode called Metal Gear Online where players can team up to complete missions and engage in stealthy combat. Do note, however, that some of these games have limited or discontinued multiplayer modes as they may have been released several years ago, and the servers may no longer be active. It's advised to check each game's official website and community pages to see if the multiplayer mode is still active.",
