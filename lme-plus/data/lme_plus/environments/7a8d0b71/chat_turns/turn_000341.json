  "content": "With a 20% down payment, you're in a great position to avoid paying Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).\n\nIn most cases, lenders require PMI when the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is higher than 80%. Since you're putting down 20% of the purchase price ($65,000), your LTV ratio is 80% ($295,000 loan amount \u00f7 $325,000 purchase price). This means you're below the typical PMI threshold.\n\nAs a result, it's highly unlikely that you'll need to pay PMI with a 20% down payment. You can expect to avoid this additional cost, which can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year, depending on the PMI premium rates.\n\nTo confirm, you can review your loan estimate and closing disclosure documents or ask your lender directly about PMI requirements. They can provide you with the most accurate information based on your specific loan terms and circumstances.",
