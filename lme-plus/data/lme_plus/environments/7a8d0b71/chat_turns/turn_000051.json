And scoring a great deal on them at H&M is even better!\n\nHere are some tips to consider when pairing graphic tees with your distressed denim jeans:\n\n1. **Contrast is key**: Balance the boldness of the graphic tee with the distressed denim by choosing a tee with a contrasting color or design. For example, if your jeans have a lot of ripped knees and frayed hems, opt for a tee with a more subtle design or a solid color.\n2. **Play with proportions**: Pair a loose-fitting graphic tee with a slimmer fit jean, or vice versa. This creates a nice balance and visual interest.\n3. **Consider the theme**: If your graphic tee has a bold design or logo, keep the rest of your outfit simple to avoid overwhelming the look. If your tee has a more subtle design, you can add more statement pieces like a bold jacket or accessories.\n4. **Add a layer**: Throw on a denim jacket or a cardigan to add depth and texture to your outfit. This is especially great for cooler days or to dress up your look.\n5. **Shoes matter**: Sneakers, boots, or sandals can all work well with graphic tees and distressed denim. Choose a shoe that complements the overall vibe you're going for.\n\nSome popular graphic tee styles that would look great with distressed denim jeans include:\n\n* Band tees (e.g., music-inspired designs)\n* Cartoon or comic book-inspired tees\n* Humorous or quirky designs (e.g., memes, puns)\n* Simple, bold logo tees (e.g., a small logo on the chest)\n* Retro-inspired tees with fun graphics (e.g., video games, 80s/90s references)\n\nRemember, the key to pulling off a great graphic tee and distressed denim combo is to have fun and experiment with different styles until you find what works best for you!",
