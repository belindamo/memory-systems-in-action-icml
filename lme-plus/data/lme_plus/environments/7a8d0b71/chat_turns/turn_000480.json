Off-the-shoulder is such a cute and feminine touch.\n\nFor casual and comfortable tops, I'd recommend the following:\n\n1. **Soft Blouses**: Look for lightweight, soft blouses in breathable fabrics like cotton, linen, or silk. A relaxed fit with a V-neck or a scoop neckline will create a comfortable and effortless look.\n2. **Casual Knit Tops**: A soft, pastel-colored knit top will add a sweet touch to your outfit. You can opt for a simple crew neck or a slightly oversized fit with a V-neck.\n3. **Tie-Dye or Ombre Tees**: A tie-dye or ombre tee will add a fun, laid-back vibe to your outfit. These tops are perfect for a casual day out or a weekend brunch.\n4. **Chambray-Inspired Tops**: If you like the idea of denim-on-denim, but want a more subtle look, try a chambray-inspired top in a lighter wash. This will add a nice contrast to your black distressed denim.\n5. **Simple White or Black Tanks**: A classic white or black tank top is a wardrobe staple that can be dressed up or down. You can wear it on its own or layer it under a cardigan or jacket for a more polished look.\n\nWhen it comes to brands, you might want to check out:\n\n1. **Everlane**: They offer a range of comfortable, high-quality tops in various fabrics and styles.\n2. **Madewell**: This brand is known for their soft, relaxed-fit tops that are perfect for casual wear.\n3. **H&M**: You can find trendy and affordable tops in a variety of styles and fabrics at H&M.\n4. **Free People**: If you're looking for bohemian-inspired tops with a relaxed fit, Free People is a great option.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different combinations and see what works best for you!",
