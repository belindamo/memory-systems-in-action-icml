  "content": "That's wonderful! It's great that you're interested in learning about your Indian heritage through cooking, and what better way to do it than through a beloved family recipe like chicken tikka masala? Cooking is a great way to connect with your roots and cultural traditions, and it's even more special when you can learn from a family member like your grandmother.\n\nCombining heavy cream and yogurt is a great idea for the sauce. The acidity in the yogurt will help to balance out the richness of the heavy cream, and you'll end up with a sauce that's both creamy and tangy. Just be sure to stir the sauce constantly as you simmer it, and don't be afraid to adjust the seasoning to taste.\n\nIt's also great that you're taking the time to learn about your Indian heritage through cooking. Food is such an important part of many cultures, and it's a great way to connect with your roots and learn about your family's traditions. By cooking and sharing meals together, you can build stronger bonds with your family and create new memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nI'm curious - what was it like learning to make chicken tikka masala from your grandmother? Was there anything that surprised you or stood out to you during the process?",
