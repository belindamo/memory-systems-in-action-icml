  "content": "I think I can use the book club discussion to inspire a scene where my characters debate the themes and messages in a fictional book that's popular in their world. This could be a great way to explore their personalities, relationships, and values. I also like the idea of using the author event to inspire a character who's an author or writer, maybe even one who's struggling to find their voice or dealing with the pressures of fame. Thanks for the suggestions!",
