The most common measures include building sea walls and other coastal defenses to protect against erosion and flooding, as well as improving drainage systems to deal with heavy rainfall.  \nOther measures focus on improving early warning systems for El Ni\u00f1o events, which can help communities prepare for and respond to the impacts. In addition, there are programs that promote sustainable land use practices and ecosystem restoration to help build resilience to future El Ni\u00f1o events. These efforts are typically led by national and local governments, as well as non-governmental organizations that work on coastal conservation and disaster risk management.",
