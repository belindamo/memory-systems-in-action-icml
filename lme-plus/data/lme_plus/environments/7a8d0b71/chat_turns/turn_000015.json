Here are some tips to toast pistachios properly:\n\n1. **Preheat your oven**: Set your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n2. **Spread pistachios evenly**: Place 1/2 cup of pistachios on a baking sheet in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd them.\n3. **Bake for 5-7 minutes**: Toast the pistachios in the preheated oven for 5-7 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned. Stir the pistachios halfway through the toasting time to ensure even browning.\n4. **Watch for aroma**: Keep an eye on the pistachios during the toasting process. When they start to emit a nutty aroma, they're done.\n5. **Let them cool**: Allow the toasted pistachios to cool completely on the baking sheet or a wire rack.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can also toast pistachios in a skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant and lightly browned. This method will give you a more caramelized flavor.\n* Be careful not to overtoast the pistachios, as they can quickly become bitter.\n* Store toasted pistachios in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\n\n**Pistachio Oil Recommendations:**\n\nFor a good quality pistachio oil, look for a brand that uses high-quality pistachios and has a mild, nutty flavor. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **California Olive Ranch Pistachio Oil**: This oil is made from California-grown pistachios and has a light, nutty flavor.\n2. **La Tourangelle Pistachio Oil**: This French brand offers a rich, aromatic pistachio oil with a deep green color.\n3. **Colavita Pistachio Oil**: This Italian brand uses high-quality pistachios to create a mild, nutty oil perfect for cooking and finishing dishes.\n\nWhen choosing a pistachio oil, make sure to read the label and look for:\n\n* Cold-pressing or expeller-pressing methods to ensure the oil is extracted without heat, preserving the delicate flavor and nutrients.\n* A high smoke point (around 420\u00b0F/220\u00b0C) to ensure the oil can handle high heat without breaking down.\n* A mild, nutty flavor profile that won't overpower your dish.\n\nNow that you have these tips, you're ready to make an amazing Spaghetti with Shrimp and Pistachio Pesto!
