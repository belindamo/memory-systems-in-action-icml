I've got some tips to help you approach the situation politely and effectively:\n\n1. **Be direct but polite**: Start with a friendly greeting and express your need for the bag. You can say something like, \"Hey bro, hope you're doing well! I was wondering if I could get my duffel bag back. I need it for my upcoming trip.\"\n2. **Avoid blaming or accusing**: Phrases like \"You've had it for too long\" or \"You're not taking care of it\" can come across as accusatory. Instead, focus on your own needs and circumstances.\n3. **Show appreciation**: Acknowledge that you lent the bag to your brother and express gratitude for his use of it. You might say, \"I appreciate you borrowing my bag last month. I know it came in handy for your trip.\"\n4. **Offer a solution**: Suggest a convenient time or method for your brother to return the bag. You could say, \"Would it be possible to return the bag this weekend or next week? I'd really appreciate it.\"\n5. **Be flexible**: Be open to finding a mutually convenient time or arrangement for the bag's return. You might need to compromise on the timing or method of return.\n\nHere's an example message that incorporates these tips:\n\n\"Hey bro, hope you're doing well! I was wondering if I could get my duffel bag back. I need it for my upcoming trip and I'd really appreciate it if you could return it this weekend or next week. Thanks for borrowing it last month \u2013 I know it came in handy for your trip. Let me know what works best for you.\"\n\nRemember to stay calm, polite, and friendly throughout the conversation. Good luck, and I hope you get your favorite duffel bag back soon!",
