Here are some tips to help you pack lightly:\n\n1. **Check the weather**: Seattle's weather can be quite unpredictable, so be sure to check the forecast before your trip. Pack layers, as the temperature can drop significantly in the evenings, even in summer.\n2. **Plan your activities**: Think about what you want to do and see in Seattle. If you plan to hike, bring hiking boots. If you want to visit museums, you might not need athletic gear.\n3. **Pack multipurpose items**: Choose items that can serve multiple purposes, like a scarf that can be used as a blanket on the plane or a dressy accessory.\n4. **Limit yourself to 3-4 outfits**: You can always do laundry or have clothes washed and dried at your accommodation if needed.\n5. **Toiletries**: Pack travel-sized toiletries to save space and weight. Consider using solid toiletries like shampoo and conditioner bars to avoid liquids.\n6. **Essential documents**: Make sure you have all necessary documents like your passport, driver's license, health insurance card, and travel itinerary.\n7. **Electronics**: Bring a portable charger, a phone case, and a travel adapter if your devices require different voltages.\n8. **Comfortable shoes**: Seattle is a walkable city, so pack comfortable shoes that can handle the miles of walking.\n9. **Snacks and water bottle**: Ah, you've already learned the importance of snacks! Pack some non-perishable snacks and a refillable water bottle to stay hydrated.\n10. **Roll your clothes**: Rolling your clothes can help reduce wrinkles and save space in your luggage.\n\nAs for your snack-related epiphany, you're absolutely right! Having snacks on hand can be a lifesaver during travel delays. Some other items you might consider packing for airport delays are:\n\n* A travel-sized power bank to keep your devices charged\n* A book or magazine to pass the time\n* A portable entertainment device, like a tablet or handheld game console\n* A travel pillow or blanket for comfort\n\nRemember to check with your airline for any specific luggage restrictions or requirements before your trip.\n\nHave a fantastic time in Seattle, and enjoy the coffee!",
