Choosing a good wallet can be a personal preference, but here are some popular options to consider:\n\n1. **Slim wallets**: If you prefer a minimalist approach, slim wallets like the Fossil Grant or the Bellroy Slim Sleeve are great options. They're compact, stylish, and can hold the essentials (cards, cash, and ID).\n2. **Card wallets**: If you have a lot of cards, a card wallet like the Travelambo RFID Wallet or the Nautica Card Wallet might be a good fit. They have multiple card slots and can help keep your cards organized.\n3. **Bifold wallets**: Classic bifold wallets like the Levi's Bifold Wallet or the Tommy Hilfiger Bifold Wallet are timeless choices. They often have a cash compartment and multiple card slots.\n4. **RFID wallets**: If you're concerned about credit card skimming or identity theft, consider an RFID wallet like the RFID Wallet by Ekster or the Travel Wallet by Pacsafe. They offer added security and protection.\n\nWhen choosing a wallet, consider the following factors:\n\n* Material: Leather, nylon, or fabric? Each has its pros and cons.\n* Size: How much space do you need for your cards, cash, and ID?\n* Style: Do you prefer a classic, minimalist, or modern design?\n* Features: Do you need RFID protection, a cash compartment, or a coin pocket?\n* Brand: Are you loyal to a particular brand or willing to try something new?\n\nBefore making a purchase, read reviews, check the warranty or return policy, and consider your budget.\n\nSince you've been using a temporary paper wallet, I'm sure you'll appreciate the upgrade!",
