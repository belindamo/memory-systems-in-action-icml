I've been browsing online marketplaces like Society6 and Etsy, and I've found some really cool pieces that fit my style. I'm thinking of getting a few prints that reflect my love for minimalism and simplicity, as well as some motivational quotes to keep me focused and productive. Do you have any tips on how to choose the right frames and display them in a way that complements the overall aesthetic of my space?",
