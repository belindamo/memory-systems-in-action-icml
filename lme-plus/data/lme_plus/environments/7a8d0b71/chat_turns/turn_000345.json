Here's what you need to know:\n\n**What is a Homestead Exemption?**\n\nA homestead exemption is a tax exemption on a primary residence that reduces the amount of property taxes owed. It's a way for the government to provide tax relief to homeowners who live in their primary residence.\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\nTo be eligible for a homestead exemption, you must:\n\n1. Own and occupy the property as your primary residence.\n2. Be a permanent resident of the state and county where the property is located.\n3. Be a U.S. citizen or a legal resident alien.\n\n**How Does it Work?**\n\nThe homestead exemption reduces the taxable value of your property, which in turn reduces your property taxes. The exemption amount varies by state and county, but in your case, the standard homestead exemption in your county is $50,000.\n\nHere's an example of how it works:\n\n* Assessed value of your property: $260,000 (80% of market value)\n* Homestead exemption: $50,000\n* Taxable value: $210,000 ($260,000 - $50,000)\n\n**Savings:**\n\nBy applying the homestead exemption, you can save around $425 in property taxes per year, based on the 0.85% tax rate in your county.\n\n* Taxes without exemption: $2,762.50 (0.85% of $260,000)\n* Taxes with exemption: $2,337.50 (0.85% of $210,000)\n* Annual savings: $425\n\n**How to Apply:**\n\nTo apply for the homestead exemption, you'll need to:\n\n1. File an application with the county assessor's office by the designated deadline (usually in March or April).\n2. Provide proof of residency, such as a utility bill or driver's license.\n3. Complete the application form, which will require information about your property and your identity.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* The homestead exemption only applies to your primary residence, not to investment properties or vacation homes.\n* You can only claim one homestead exemption per year, so if you own multiple properties, you'll need to choose which one to apply the exemption to.\n* If you sell your property or move, you'll need to notify the county assessor's office to remove the exemption.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the homestead exemption and how it can benefit you. If you have any more questions or need assistance with the application process, feel free to ask!",
