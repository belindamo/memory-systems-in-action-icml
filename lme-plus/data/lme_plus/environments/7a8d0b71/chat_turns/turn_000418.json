  "content": "Jack and Phil heard an ear-splitting sneeze that echoed through the air. They look at each other, both momentarily stunned. They had heard sneezes like that before, but never so powerful. They quickly realized it wasn't Jack who had let loose with such a monstrous sneeze.\n\nThe pair began to make their way towards the source of the sneezes, their curiosity piqued. Another massive sneeze echoed through the air, this one even more powerful than the first. They quicken their pace, eager to find the source of such formidable sneezes.\n\nAs they approached, they saw a young man standing in the center of a small clearing. He was of average height and build, with close-cropped hair. But it was his sneezes that drew the eye. Each one was like a sonic boom, shaking the very earth.\n\nThe young man, Ben, stood there with his eyes closed, his face contorted as another sneeze built up within him. Jack and Phil watched in awe as Ben let loose with a sneeze that was like a small explosion. They felt the ground shake beneath their feet, saw debris thrown into the air. When the dust cleared, Ben was still standing, his eyes closed, his face twisted in the aftermath of his sneeze.\n\nJack and Phil approached him, staring in disbelief. They had never seen anything like this before, and they had seen a lot of sneezes. Ben opened his eyes and looked at them, as if only just realizing they were there.\n\n\"Who are you guys?\" he asked, his voice still shaking from his latest sneeze.\n\n\"We're Jack and Phil,\" Jack said. \"We heard your sneezes and came to see what was going on.\"\n\n\"My sneezes?\" Ben asked, looking at them as if they were crazy.\n\n\"Yeah, your sneezes,\" Phil said. \"They're like nothing we've ever seen before.\"\n\nBen looked at them for a moment, then shrugged. \"I've always had sneezes like this,\" he said. \"I don't know what to do about it.\"\n\nJack and Phil exchanged a look. They knew exactly what Ben was going through. They told him about their own experiences with massive sneezes, and how they had learned to live with them.\n\nAs they spoke, another sneeze began to build within Ben. He closed his eyes, bracing himself. This time, the sneeze was even more powerful than the others. When it was over, Ben looked at them, a look of fear in his eyes.\n\n\"What am I going to do?\" he asked, his voice shaking. \"These sneezes are getting worse and worse.\"\n\nJack and Phil looked at each other, then back at Ben. They knew exactly what he was going through, and they were ready to help.",
