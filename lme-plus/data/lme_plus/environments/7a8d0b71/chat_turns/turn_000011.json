  "content": "The Levoit LV600HH Hybrid Humidifier is a popular and highly-rated option. I think it's a great choice for your plants, especially Spike!\n\nRegarding your question, I would recommend getting a hygrometer to go with your humidifier, even though it has a built-in humidistat. Here's why:\n\n**Why you should consider a hygrometer:**\n\n1. **Accuracy:** While the built-in humidistat is convenient, it may not always provide the most accurate readings. A separate hygrometer can give you a more precise measurement of the humidity level in your space.\n2. **Calibration:** A hygrometer can help you calibrate the built-in humidistat on your humidifier, ensuring that it's maintaining the optimal humidity level for your plants.\n3. **Monitoring:** A hygrometer allows you to monitor the humidity level in your space, even when the humidifier is not in use. This can be helpful in understanding the natural humidity fluctuations in your environment.\n4. **Multiple uses:** A hygrometer can be used to monitor the humidity level in different areas of your home, not just near your plants.\n\n**Types of hygrometers:**\n\n1. **Digital hygrometers:** These are accurate, easy to use, and often come with additional features like temperature readings and data logging.\n2. **Analog hygrometers:** These are simple, low-cost options that provide a basic humidity reading.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer:** A highly-rated, accurate, and affordable digital hygrometer with temperature readings and data logging. (~ $10)\n2. **AcuRite 01083M Digital Hygrometer:** A compact, easy-to-use digital hygrometer with temperature readings and a humidity level indicator. (~ $15)\n3. **Taylor Precision Products Analog Hygrometer:** A simple, low-cost analog hygrometer that provides a basic humidity reading. (~ $5)\n\nIn summary, while the built-in humidistat on your Levoit LV600HH Hybrid Humidifier is convenient, a separate hygrometer can provide more accurate readings, help with calibration, and offer additional monitoring capabilities. I hope this helps!",
