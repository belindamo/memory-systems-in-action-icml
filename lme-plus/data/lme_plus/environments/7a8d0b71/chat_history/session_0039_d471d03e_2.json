Do you have any suggestions? By the way, on Fridays, I take a different route to work and it adds about 10-15 minutes to my commute - I take the bus down 3rd Avenue and walk the rest of the way to the office, which is a nice change of pace."

      "content": "The 22L Osprey Talon's laptop sleeve is designed to fit laptops up to 15 inches, but it's always a good idea to double-check the dimensions to ensure a snug fit.\n\nThe laptop sleeve in the 22L Talon has the following internal dimensions:\n\n* Height: 10.6 inches (27 cm)\n* Width: 14.2 inches (36 cm)\n* Depth: 1.2 inches (3 cm)\n\nIf your 15.6-inch laptop's dimensions are:\n\n* Height: 10.8-11 inches (27-28 cm)\n* Width: 14.9-15.3 inches (38-39 cm)\n* Depth: 0.8-1 inch (2-2.5 cm)\n\nIt's likely that your laptop will fit, but it might be a tight squeeze. The sleeve is designed to be flexible, so it can accommodate slightly larger laptops. However, if your laptop is at the larger end of the 15.6-inch spectrum, it might not fit as snugly as you'd like.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some popular 15.6-inch laptop models and their dimensions:\n\n* Dell XPS 15: 10.9 x 14.1 x 0.7 inches (27.7 x 35.8 x 1.8 cm)\n* HP Envy 15: 11.1 x 14.1 x 0.7 inches (28.2 x 35.8 x 1.8 cm)\n* Lenovo ThinkPad E15: 11.3 x 14.3 x 0.7 inches (28.7 x 36.3 x 1.8 cm)\n\nIf your laptop is similar in size to these models, it should fit the 22L Talon's laptop sleeve. However, if you're still unsure, you can consider the following options:\n\n1. Check the manufacturer's website for exact laptop dimensions.\n2. Measure your laptop to ensure it fits within the sleeve's dimensions.\n3. Contact Osprey's customer support or visit an authorized retailer to ask about the laptop sleeve's flexibility and compatibility with larger laptops.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to laptop protection. If you're still unsure, you might consider a backpack with a larger laptop sleeve or a different model specifically designed for 15.6-inch laptops."
