Take your time, and don't be afraid to ask follow-up questions to clarify any details.\n\nIt's great that you're taking the initiative to preserve your family's culinary heritage. By doing so, you'll not only learn more about your grandmother's recipe but also strengthen your bond with your dad and create new memories together.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck in your conversation, and I hope you'll share your progress and any discoveries you make along the way!\n\nHappy cooking and exploring your family's culinary roots!",
