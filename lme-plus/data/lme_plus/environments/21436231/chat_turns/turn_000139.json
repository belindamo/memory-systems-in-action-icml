  "content": "With a budget of $1,000, you'll have a wide range of options to choose from.\n\nFor classical and jazz, a good piano sound is essential, and weighted keys can definitely enhance the playing experience. However, whether or not you need weighted keys depends on your personal preference and playing style.\n\nHere are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Weighted keys:**\n\nPros:\n\n* More authentic piano feel and response\n* Better dynamic control and expression\n* Can help improve your technique and finger strength\n\nCons:\n\n* Typically heavier and less portable\n* May require more maintenance (e.g., adjusting the action)\n* Can be more expensive\n\nIf you're used to playing acoustic pianos or want a more realistic feel, weighted keys might be a good choice. However, if you're short on space or need a more portable instrument, you might prioritize other features.\n\nIn your budget, here are some keyboards with weighted keys that might interest you:\n\n1. **Korg B1**: A compact, weighted-key digital piano with a focus on piano sound and a natural playing experience. ($699)\n2. **Roland FP-10**: A portable, weighted-key digital piano with a rich, expressive sound and advanced features like Bluetooth audio/MIDI and app connectivity. ($999)\n3. **Yamaha P-255**: A professional-grade, weighted-key digital piano with a wide range of sounds, including Yamaha's renowned CFIII concert grand piano. ($999)\n\nIf you're not set on weighted keys, here are some alternatives:\n\n1. **Korg Grandstage**: A compact, stage piano with a focus on sound quality and a lighter, more portable design. ($699)\n2. **Roland FP-30**: A compact, lightweight digital piano with a rich sound and advanced features like Bluetooth audio/MIDI and app connectivity. ($799)\n3. **Yamaha CP4**: A professional-grade, stage piano with a wide range of sounds and a lightweight, portable design. ($999)\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many other options available. I recommend trying out different keyboards before making a purchase to find the one that feels and sounds right to you.\n\nHow do you feel about trying out some of these options, or would you like more recommendations?",
