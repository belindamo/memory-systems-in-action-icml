  "content": "I can just imagine Max being a bundle of energy, always ready for the next adventure! It's great that he loves spending time with you, too - that cuddlebug side is the best!\n\nAs a 5-year-old, Max is definitely still in his prime, and it's wonderful that you're providing him with plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. Long walks and playtime are essential for his physical and emotional well-being.\n\nSince Max is energetic, I'm sure the Ruffwear Roamer Leash will be a great fit for him. The bungee section will help absorb some of the shock when he pulls, making it more comfortable for both of you.\n\nDo you have a favorite route or activity that Max especially enjoys? For example, does he love hiking, swimming, or playing fetch in a specific park?\n\nAlso, as an energetic pup, Max might appreciate some mental stimulation toys or puzzle toys to keep his mind engaged when he's not running around. Have you explored those options with him?",
