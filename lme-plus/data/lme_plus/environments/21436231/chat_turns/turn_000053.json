  "content": "Identifying the target user group is a crucial step in conducting effective user interviews. The research goals and objectives should guide the selection of participants who fit the desired demographic profile or have relevant experience with the product or service being tested.\n\nFor example, if the research goal is to understand the user experience of a new mobile app, the target user group might be smartphone users between the ages of 18-35 who frequently use apps for social networking, messaging, and productivity. The interview questions should be developed with this target group in mind to ensure that the insights gained from the interview process are relevant and useful in achieving the research goals and objectives.\n\nThe interview questions should be designed to uncover the behaviors, attitudes, motivations, and pain points of the target user group. These questions should be open-ended and non-leading, allowing participants to provide detailed and honest feedback. Additionally, the questions should be organized in a logical and coherent manner, flowing from more general to more specific topics.\n\nFor example, the interview may begin with broad questions about the participant's experience with mobile apps, followed by more specific questions about their use of social networking apps and productivity apps. Finally, the interview may conclude with questions about their overall impressions of the new mobile app being tested.\n\nOverall, using research goals and objectives to identify the target user group and develop interview questions is essential for conducting effective user interviews that generate meaningful insights to inform product development decisions.",
