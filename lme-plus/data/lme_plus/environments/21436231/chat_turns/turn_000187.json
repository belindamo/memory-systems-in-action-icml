  "content": "The classic garlic bread is a timeless favorite.\n\nFor a light and refreshing green salad, I'd recommend the following options to pair perfectly with your spaghetti dinner:\n\n1. **Simple Mixed Greens**: A classic mix of fresh greens like romaine, arugula, and spinach, topped with sliced cherry tomatoes and a light vinaigrette dressing.\n2. **Italian-Style Salad**: Combine mixed greens with sliced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and red onion. Add some crumbled fresh mozzarella cheese and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\n3. **Caprese Salad**: A colorful and flavorful salad featuring sliced fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil and balsamic glaze for a sweet and tangy taste.\n4. **Wilted Spinach Salad**: Quickly saut\u00e9 a handful of fresh spinach with garlic, lemon juice, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Toss with sliced cherry tomatoes and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.\n5. **Herb and Arugula Salad**: Combine peppery arugula with chopped fresh herbs like parsley, basil, and mint. Add some sliced red onion and a light vinaigrette dressing for a refreshing twist.\n\nFor the dressing, you can't go wrong with a simple vinaigrette made from olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Alternatively, try a lighter option like a lemon-tahini dressing or a creamy Italian dressing.\n\nThese salads are all easy to prepare and will provide a delightful contrast to the rich flavors of your spaghetti and garlic bread.
