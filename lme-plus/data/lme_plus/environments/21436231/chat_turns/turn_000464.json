  "content": "I'd be happy to help you keep track of Max's medication schedule!\n\nSince you refilled the flea and tick medication on the 12th of last month, I'll assume it's a monthly medication. Typically, flea and tick medications need to be reapplied every 30 days.\n\nTo determine when you'll need to refill it again, let's count forward 30 days from the 12th of last month.\n\nIf last month was January, the 12th would be January 12th. Adding 30 days would bring us to February 11th. If last month was February, the 12th would be February 12th, and adding 30 days would bring us to March 14th.\n\nPlease let me know which month you refilled the medication, and I can give you an exact date for the next refill.",
