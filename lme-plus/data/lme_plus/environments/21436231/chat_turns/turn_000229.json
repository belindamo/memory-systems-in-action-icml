Now, let's find a home for each of these items:\n\n1. **Running Shoes**:\n\t* Store them in a designated spot in your closet, such as on a shoe rack or in a shoe organizer on the back of the door. This will keep them organized, protected, and easily accessible.\n\t* If you have a mudroom or entryway, consider storing them there, especially if you tend to wear them right out the door.\n2. **Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker**:\n\t* Designate a spot in your living room or entertainment area for the speaker, such as a shelf or a corner table.\n\t* If you plan to use it outdoors, consider storing it in a protective case or bag near the door or in a storage bin with other outdoor gear.\n\t* You might also store it in a closet or cabinet to keep it dust-free and out of the way when not in use.\n3. **Kitchen Knives**:\n\t* Store them in a designated knife block or knife organizer on your kitchen counter. This will keep them organized, easily accessible, and prevent clutter.\n\t* If you prefer to store them in a drawer, use a knife tray or divider to keep them organized and prevent scratching.\n\nSome general tips for storing new items:\n\n* **Assign a Home**: Designate a specific spot for each item, making it easy to find and put back when not in use.\n* **Store Items Near Their Point of Use**: Store items in the area where you'll be using them most often, reducing clutter and making them more accessible.\n* **Protect and Preserve**: Store items in a way that protects them from damage, dust, or moisture, ensuring they remain in good condition.\n* **Keep Frequently Used Items Accessible**: Store frequently used items in easy-to-reach locations, while less frequently used items can be stored in harder-to-reach areas or on higher shelves.\n\nBy assigning a home for each item and storing them thoughtfully, you'll maintain a clutter-free space and make the most of your new purchases!",
