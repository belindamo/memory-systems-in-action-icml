  "content": "Yes, combining strategies can create a more comprehensive approach to addressing affordable housing and homelessness. In fact, many cities are employing multiple approaches to address these issues simultaneously. For example, a city might implement an inclusionary housing policy, increase funding for affordable housing, provide rental assistance to low-income families, and partner with nonprofits to provide support services for homeless individuals.\n\nBy combining strategies, cities can address different aspects of the affordable housing and homelessness challenge and work toward a more holistic solution. For instance, providing immediate housing solutions to homeless individuals through Housing First programs can be combined with inclusionary housing policies aimed at creating more affordable housing units in the long term. Similarly, tenant protection policies can be combined with funding programs that support the construction of new affordable housing units.\n\nOverall, combining strategies can help create a more effective response to the affordable housing and homelessness crisis, as long as these policies are implemented thoughtfully and with adequate resources to support them. Collaboration between different stakeholders, including government agencies, developers, community organizations, and residents, will also be essential to ensure the success of these policies.",
