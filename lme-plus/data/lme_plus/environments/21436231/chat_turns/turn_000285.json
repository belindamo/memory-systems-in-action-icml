However, it is true that many modern-day people object to imperialism and colonialism on the grounds of its impacts on other societies and cultures.\n\nAs for the Athenians, it's important to remember that they were operating under a different set of ethical and social norms than we have today. They may not have seen imperialism in the same way, and may have believed that the benefits - such as cultural and economic development - outweighed the costs. Additionally, finding alternative methods of financing may not have been a viable option for a city that was constantly at risk of invasion and needed to maintain its power and influence in the region.\n\nThat being said, it's certainly valid to criticize the Athenians' treatment of other city-states and the exploitation of their resources. It's important to look critically at historical practices and policies, and use them as lessons to inform our current ethical frameworks and decision-making processes.",
