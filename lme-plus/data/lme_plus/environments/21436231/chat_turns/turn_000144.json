  "content": "I think I'll try out the Fender Acoustic 40 and Fishman Loudbox Mini. Both seem like great options for my Taylor GS Mini. I'll also consider the AER Compact 60, but it's a bit above my budget. By the way, I just got back from Joe's shop. I decided to take my Taylor GS Mini, to the guitar tech for servicing today - the action's been a bit high and it's been causing some discomfort in my left hand. The action is now perfect, and it feels so much more comfortable to play.",
