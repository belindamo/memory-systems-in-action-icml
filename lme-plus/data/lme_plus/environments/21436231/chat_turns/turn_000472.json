It can be easy to get dates and events mixed up.\n\nIt's great that you're keeping track of your pet expenses and looking out for sales. $40 per bag is a great deal, and I hope you're able to catch that sale!\n\nTake your time to check your records and confirm the exact date you purchased the last bag of dog food. You can also consider setting a reminder on your calendar to check for sales or discounts around the time you expect to need a new bag.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to plan ahead and budget for your pet's needs, but it's also important to prioritize their health and well-being. If you're unsure about anything, don't hesitate to reach out to your vet for guidance.",
