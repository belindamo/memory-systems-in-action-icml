  "content": "That's really interesting! I never knew the history of empanadas went back that far. My grandmother's empanadas were definitely a highlight of my childhood. She would always make them from scratch, and the smell of the pastry dough frying in the pan is still one of my favorite memories. I'm not sure what her exact recipe was, but I do remember that she would always add some kind of spice or seasoning that made them taste a little different from others I've had. I'll have to ask my dad if he knows more about her recipe or if he can try to recreate it.",
