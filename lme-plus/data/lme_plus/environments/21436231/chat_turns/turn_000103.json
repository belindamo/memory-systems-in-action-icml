However, \"Blackfish\" is a documentary film that examines the captivity of killer whales, particularly the case of Tilikum, a captive killer whale that was responsible for the deaths of several people. The film received critical acclaim for its investigation into the treatment of marine mammals in captivity and the implications of keeping these animals in parks such as SeaWorld. \"Blackfish\" sparkes a lot of discussion regarding animal welfare, captivity and the ethics around amusement park practices with animals.",
