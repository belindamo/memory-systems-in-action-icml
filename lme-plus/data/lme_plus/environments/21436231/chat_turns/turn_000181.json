And, yes, getting a new saddle with a cutout can also be a game-changer!\n\nA saddle with a cutout or recessed area can help reduce pressure on sensitive areas, which can be a major contributor to discomfort during long rides. The cutout design allows for increased airflow and pressure relief, which can help reduce numbness, tingling, and pain in the perineal area.\n\nWhen choosing a new saddle with a cutout, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Cutout size and shape:** Look for a saddle with a cutout that's designed specifically for your gender and riding style. Some saddles have larger cutouts, while others have smaller, more focused relief areas.\n2. **Saddle width and shape:** Ensure the saddle is the right width and shape for your sit bones. A saddle that's too narrow or too wide can still cause discomfort, even with a cutout.\n3. **Material and padding:** Consider a saddle with a comfortable, breathable material and adequate padding to reduce pressure and vibration.\n4. **Riding style:** If you're a more aggressive rider, you may prefer a saddle with a more pronounced cutout to reduce pressure during intense efforts.\n\nSome popular saddles with cutouts include:\n\n* **Specialized Power Saddle:** Designed for both men and women, this saddle features a large cutout and a comfortable, ergonomic design.\n* **Brooks Cambium Saddle:** This saddle features a smaller, more focused cutout and a durable, comfortable design.\n* **Selle Italia SLR Boost Saddle:** This saddle has a larger cutout and a sleek, aerodynamic design.\n\nRemember, everyone's body is different, so it's essential to try out different saddles and ride styles to find what works best for you.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear how your adjustments and new saddle work out!",
