  "content": "Royal Canin is a well-known and reputable brand.\n\nIt's great that you're keeping track of how long the dog food lasts for Max. To help you plan ahead, I can suggest a rough estimate for your next dog food purchase.\n\nSince a 30-pound bag lasts around 6-7 weeks, let's assume an average duration of 6.5 weeks. To calculate when you'll need to pick up more dog food, you can count forward 6.5 weeks from the date you purchased the last bag.\n\nIf you can recall the date you bought the last bag or when you started using it, I can help you estimate the next purchase date. Alternatively, you can also mark your calendar 6.5 weeks from today to plan ahead.\n\nRemember to check with your vet if Max's dietary needs have changed or if they recommend any adjustments to his food.",
