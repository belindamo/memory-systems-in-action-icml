By the way, I've been trying to avoid buying too much clothing or accessories lately, but I did slip up about a month ago when I bought a pair of distressed denim jeans from an online fashion retailer. They were having a big sale, and I convinced myself that I needed a new pair of jeans for a night out with friends. In hindsight, I probably didn't need them, and I've only worn them once so far. Do you have any tips on how to avoid impulse buys like this in the future?",
