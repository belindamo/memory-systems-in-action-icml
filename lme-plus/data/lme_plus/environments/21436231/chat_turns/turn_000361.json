Desert safari tours allow you to explore the wilderness of the desert, observe wildlife like gazelles, oryxes, and camels, visit historic sites and experience Bedouin culture all while enjoying the unique beauty of the desert landscape. You can choose to go on a guided tour either by foot or in a vehicle, depending on your preferences.",
