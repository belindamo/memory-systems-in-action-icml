Making them from scratch can be a bit tricky, but with some tips and tricks, you'll be a pro in no time! Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Homemade Garlic Knots Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups warm water\n* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n* 3 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 3 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)\n* Parmesan cheese, grated (optional)\n\nTips and Tricks:\n\n1. **Use a high-quality yeast**: Make sure your yeast is fresh and active to ensure the dough rises properly.\n2. **Don't overmix the dough**: Mix the ingredients just until they come together in a shaggy ball. Overmixing can lead to tough garlic knots.\n3. **Let the dough rise**: Allow the dough to rise for at least 1 hour, or until it's doubled in size. This will give the garlic knots a light and airy texture.\n4. **Use a gentle touch**: When shaping the dough into knots, be gentle to avoid developing the gluten in the flour. This will help the garlic knots stay soft and tender.\n5. **Don't overbake**: Garlic knots are best when they're lightly golden brown. Overbaking can make them dry and crispy.\n\nHere's a simple recipe to follow:\n\n1. In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until the yeast is activated.\n2. Add olive oil, salt, garlic, and 2 cups of flour to the bowl. Mix until a shaggy ball forms.\n3. Gradually add the remaining cup of flour, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a sticky ball.\n4. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.\n6. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n7. Punch down the dough and divide it into 8-10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope and tie a knot in the center.\n8. Place the garlic knots on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch of space between each knot.\n9. Brush the tops with beaten egg and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese (if using).\n10. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.\n\nThat's it! Your homemade garlic knots are ready to be devoured. Serve them warm as an appetizer, and enjoy with your spaghetti dinner and Italian-Style Salad. Buon appetito!",
