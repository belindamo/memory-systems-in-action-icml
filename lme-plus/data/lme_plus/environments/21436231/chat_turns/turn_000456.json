Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Added camera protection**: A built-in camera lens protector can help shield your camera lenses from scratches, cracks, and other damage.\n2. **Convenience**: Having a screen protector and camera lens protector in one can be convenient, as you'll only need to apply one protector instead of two separate ones.\n3. **Easy cleaning**: Some screen protectors with built-in camera lens protectors have a smooth, seamless design that makes it easy to clean your camera lenses.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Image quality**: Some users report that built-in camera lens protectors can affect image quality, causing glare, distortion, or a slight decrease in clarity.\n2. **Bulkiness**: Screen protectors with built-in camera lens protectors can be thicker and more bulky than standard screen protectors, which might affect the overall feel of your phone.\n3. **Cost**: These types of screen protectors are often more expensive than standard screen protectors.\n\nIf you're concerned about camera lens protection, you might consider a few alternatives:\n\n1. **Separate camera lens protectors**: You can purchase separate camera lens protectors that are specifically designed for your phone model.

Do you have a favorite photo or memory from that trip that stands out to you?",
