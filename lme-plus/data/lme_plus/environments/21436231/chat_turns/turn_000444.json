  "content": "Yes, you are correct. The path `\\\\lightspeed\\data\\Installers and Drivers` contains spaces, which can cause issues when used in a command line tool such as `robocopy`. To avoid this issue, you can either escape the spaces in the path using quotes:\n```swift\nrobocopy \"\\\\lightspeed\\data\\Installers and Drivers\" \"d:\\serverfolders\\nasbackup\\Installers and Drivers\" /MAXAGE:2023-01-30 /DCOPY:T\n```\nOr, replace the spaces in the folder name with underscores or another character that is not used in the folder name:\n```kotlin\nrobocopy \\\\lightspeed\\data\\Installers_and_Drivers d:\\serverfolders\\nasbackup\\Installers_and_Drivers /MAXAGE:2023-01-30 /DCOPY:T\n```\nBoth of these options will allow you to copy files from the `Installers and Drivers` folder while avoiding issues caused by spaces in the path.",
