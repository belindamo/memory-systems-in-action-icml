  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific information about a particular city. However, here are some general approaches that city governments might use to address affordable housing and homelessness:\n\n1. Funding: City governments often provide funding to support the construction or renovation of affordable housing units. They may also provide funding or grants to organizations that work to address homelessness in the city.\n\n2. Zoning and land use policies: City governments may use zoning and land use policies to promote the development of affordable housing units. For example, they may allow for the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) or increase the density of residential zoning districts.\n\n3. Tenant protections: City governments may enact tenant protections, such as rent control, to help prevent displacement and ensure that affordable housing remains accessible.\n\n4. Services and support: City governments may provide services and support to help homeless individuals find housing, employment, and other resources. This can include things like case management, job training, and mental health services.\n\n5. Collaborations: Often, city governments collaborate with nonprofit organizations and community groups working on issues related to affordable housing and homelessness. By partnering with these groups, the city can expand its reach and leverage the expertise of those who have been working on these issues for years.",
