  "content": "Cacao is commonly used in sweet recipes, such as chocolate cakes, brownies, and cookies. However, it can also be used in savory dishes to add depth and complexity to the flavor profile. \n\nHere are some examples of savory dishes where cacao is used:\n\n1. Mole sauce: Traditional mole sauce from Mexico often includes cacao powder as one of the main ingredients. The cacao adds a rich, earthy flavor that complements the spicy and tangy ingredients in the sauce.\n\n2. Chili con carne: Cacao powder can be added to chili con carne to give it a rich, deep flavor.\n\n3. Rub for meat: A spice rub for meat that includes cacao powder, chili powder, and other spices can add a unique flavor to grilled or roasted meat.\n\n4. Salad dressing: Cacao nibs can be ground and added to a salad dressing, along with other herbs and spices, to add a rich, earthy flavor to salads.\n\n5. Black bean stew: Adding cacao powder or cacao nibs to a black bean stew can give it a rich, earthy flavor.\n\nWhen using cacao in savory dishes, it is important to use it in moderation, and to balance the bitterness with other flavors, such as spices, herbs, or acidic ingredients.",
