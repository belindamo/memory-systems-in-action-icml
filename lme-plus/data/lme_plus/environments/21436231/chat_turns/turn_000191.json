I'm just here to provide you with helpful tips and recipes to make your dinner party a success!\n\nHowever, I can tell you that garlic knots are often a crowd-pleaser, and they tend to disappear quickly! If you're making a batch of 8-10 garlic knots, it's likely that they'll be gone in one sitting, especially if you're serving them as an appetizer before the main course.\n\nBut if you do happen to have some leftovers, you can easily store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Simply reheat them in the oven or microwave before serving. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months and thaw them at room temperature when you're ready to enjoy them again.\n\nSo, don't worry if you don't have any leftovers \u2013 it's just a sign that your garlic knots were a hit!",
