Here are some garlic bread recipes that would pair perfectly with your homemade pasta sauce and spaghetti:\n\n1. **Classic Garlic Bread**: A simple, yet flavorful recipe that's easy to make. Mix 3 cloves of minced garlic with 1/2 cup of softened butter, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt. Spread the mixture on a baguette, and bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.\n2. **Roasted Garlic Bread**: Roasting garlic mellows out its flavor and adds a deep, nutty taste to the bread. Simply slice the top off a whole head of garlic, drizzle with olive oil, and roast at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 30-40 minutes, or until soft and caramelized. Then, mix the roasted garlic with 1/2 cup of softened butter and spread on a baguette.\n3. **Garlic and Herb Bread**: This recipe adds a fresh twist to the classic garlic bread. Mix 3 cloves of minced garlic with 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley, 1/4 cup of chopped fresh basil, and 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Add 1/2 cup of softened butter and a pinch of salt. Spread the mixture on a baguette and bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.\n4. **Cheesy Garlic Bread**: For a more indulgent option, try this recipe. Mix 3 cloves of minced garlic with 1/2 cup of softened butter, 1/2 cup of grated mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Spread the mixture on a baguette, and top with additional mozzarella cheese. Bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly.\n5. **Garlic Focaccia**: If you want to get a bit fancier, try making a garlic focaccia bread. Mix 3 cloves of minced garlic with 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1/4 cup of chopped fresh rosemary, and 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Add 1 1/2 cups of warm water, 2 teaspoons of active dry yeast, and 3 cups of all-purpose flour. Knead the dough for 10 minutes, let it rise for 1 hour, and bake at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.\n\nThese garlic bread recipes will complement your homemade pasta sauce and spaghetti perfectly.
