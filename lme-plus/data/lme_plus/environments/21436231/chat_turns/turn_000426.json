You can use the `/MAXAGE` option to specify the date and only copy files that have been modified after that date. Here's an example of how you could use `robocopy` to copy only changed files from one directory to another:\n```ruby\nrobocopy source_directory destination_directory /MAXAGE:YYYY-MM-DD\n```\nReplace `source_directory` and `destination_directory` with the actual paths of the source and destination directories, and `YYYY-MM-DD` with the date you want to use as the cutoff.",
