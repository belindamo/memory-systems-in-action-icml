However, \"The Act of Killing\" has been widely acclaimed by critics and audiences alike for its unique and thought-provoking approach to exploring a dark period in Indonesian history. The documentary is directed by Joshua Oppenheimer and centers around interviews with the perpetrators of the Indonesian genocide, allowing them to reenact their crimes in a surreal, filmic style. The film has won numerous awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2014.",
