  "content": "Making a few extra garlic knots is always a good idea.\n\nFor a simple and sweet dessert, I've got a few recommendations that pair perfectly with your Italian-themed dinner:\n\n1. **Tiramisu**: A classic Italian dessert made with ladyfingers, mascarpone cheese, and espresso. You can make it from scratch or use a store-bought version.\n2. **Fresh Fruit Salad**: A light and refreshing dessert featuring a mix of seasonal fruits such as strawberries, grapes, and pineapple. You can add a splash of lemon juice and a bit of sugar to taste.\n3. **Panna Cotta**: An Italian cream dessert made with sweetened cream that's set with gelatin. Flavor it with vanilla or other fruits like strawberries or raspberries.\n4. **Cannoli**: These Sicilian pastries are a classic Italian dessert. You can fill them with sweetened ricotta cheese and chocolate chips for a delicious treat.\n5. **Zeppole**: Fried dough balls dusted with powdered sugar and typically filled with a sweet ricotta or cannoli cream filling.\n\nIf you're short on time, you can also consider store-bought options like gelato, Italian ice cream, or even a fruit tart.\n\nRemember, the key is to keep it simple and light, as you want to end the meal on a sweet note without overwhelming your guests. Buon dolce!",
