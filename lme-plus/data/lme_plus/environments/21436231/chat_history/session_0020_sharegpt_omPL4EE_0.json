      "content": "Answer: To find out the number of consecutive zeros at the end of the product 1\u00d72\u00d73\u00d7...\u00d735, we need to count the number of times the factors 2 and 5 appear in the product, since 10 = 2 \u00d7 5. The number of trailing zeros will be equal to the number of times 10 can be formed from these factors, which is the minimum of the count of 2s and 5s.\n\nLet's count the factors of 5 in the product:\n35 \u00f7 5 = 7 (seven numbers between 1 and 35 are divisible by 5)\n\nNow let's count the factors of 25 in the product (since each number divisible by 25 contains two factors of 5):\n35 \u00f7 25 = 1 (one number between 1 and 35 is divisible by 25)\n\nSo, there are a total of 7 + 1 = 8 factors of 5 in the product.\n\nThere are more than enough factors of 2 in the product, so we don't need to count them.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 consecutive zeros at the end of the calculation result of the formula 1\u00d72\u00d73\u00d7...\u00d735."
