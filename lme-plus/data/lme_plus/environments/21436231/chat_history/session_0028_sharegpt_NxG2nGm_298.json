Through the use of design thinking methodologies and market research, we were able to identify the pain points and frustrations of the various user archetypes and create a more efficient and user-friendly service. The implementation of the ecosystem and system maps allowed us to visualize the interconnectedness of the service and its various touchpoints, while the customer journey map helped us understand the overall experience of the users. By analyzing the findings of similar COVID-19 booking digital apps and government websites in other countries, we were able to bring a fresh perspective and innovative features to the Cita Previa website. The result is a digital-first service that streamlines the process of booking appointments for all residents and citizens of Spain, providing a more efficient and accessible experience.\n\nThe redesign not only addresses the common pain points experienced by users, but also looks towards future considerations for further improvement and the potential impact on key metrics such as maintenance costs, distribution of applicants between offices, and the reduction of telephone support costs. Overall, the redesign of the Cita Previa website represents a significant step forward in providing a more efficient and accessible service for all users.\""

It's like they want to make it hard for us to do something as simple as booking an appointment.\"\n\n2. The Overwhelmed: This archetype represents users who may be older or have disabilities, and therefore may find the current system challenging to use. They may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information and screens, and may struggle to complete the process.\n\n\"I'm not very good with technology, and this website is just too much for me. I can't even figure out where to start.\"\n\n3. The Skeptical: This archetype represents users who are skeptical of the service and may have had negative experiences in the past. They may be hesitant to trust the website and may be worried about the security of their personal information.\n\n\"I don't know if I can trust this website with my personal information. There are so many scams out there these days.\""
