      "content": "The traditional way of preparing masa for tamales involves soaking corn husks in water, mixing masa (corn dough) with lard or vegetable shortening, broth or stock, and spices, and then spreading the mixture onto the corn husks. The filling is then added to the center, and the tamale is rolled and tied with a strip of corn husk. The tamales are then steamed until cooked through."

      "content": "Sure, here's a recipe for sweet chocolate tamales:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 1/2 cups masa harina\n- 1/2 cup sugar\n- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 3/4 cup vegetable shortening\n- 1 1/2 cups warm water\n- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\n- 24-30 dried corn husks\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Soak the corn husks in hot water for 30-60 minutes, or until they are soft and pliable.\n\n2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the masa harina, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.\n\n3. Add the vegetable shortening and mix until it is well combined with the dry ingredients.\n\n4. Slowly pour the warm water into the bowl while stirring the mixture.\n\n5. Mix everything well until the dough is smooth and forms a ball. Fold in the chocolate chips at the end.\n\n6. Drain the corn husks and pat them dry with paper towels.\n\n7. Lay out one of the corn husks on a flat surface with the pointed end facing away from you.\n\n8. Spread about 1/4 cup of the chocolate masa mixture onto the husk, leaving a 1-inch border on each side.\n\n9. Fold the long sides of the husk towards the center, so that the edges of the masa meet. Fold the pointed end up towards the center, then tie the tamale closed with a small strip of corn husk.\n\n10. Repeat the above process with the remaining corn husks and masa mixture.\n\n11. Arrange the tamales in a steamer basket or a pot with a steaming rack, and steam them over boiling water for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\n12. When finished, allow them to cool for a few minutes before serving.\n\nEnjoy your delicious sweet chocolate tamales!"
