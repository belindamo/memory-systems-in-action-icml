      "content": "the rangers' dining facility serves four meals a day. Kodian food is based around the diets of real-world grizzly bears, with elements of russian, scandinavian, and arctic circle indigneous food. Yamataian food is strongly reminiscent of real world japanese cuisine, with emphasis on yoshoku dishes, secondarily traditional American food, and a slight bit of scandinavian cuisine. Come up with a 2 week meal plan in the dining facility that is healthy and sustainable that includes both kodian and yamataian food"
