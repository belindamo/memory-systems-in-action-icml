However, it is common for documentary filmmakers to spend a significant amount of time conducting research, fact-checking, and verifying sources to support the accuracy of their film. This may involve conducting interviews with experts, reviewing primary sources such as archives and official documents, and consulting with historians and other subject matter experts. Additionally, filmmakers may work with fact-checkers or journalists to ensure that their information is accurate and fair. Ultimately, the filmmakers' goal is to present a comprehensive, honest, and accurate portrayal of the subject matter in their film."
