      "content": "Sure! Here are some tips to care for a Snake Plant: \n\n1. Watering: Snake Plants do not require much watering- they are very drought tolerant. Water them only when the top 2-3 inches of soil are dry to the touch. Overwatering can cause root rot. 2. Sunlight: Snake Plants can tolerate a wide range of lighting conditions, including low light. However, they will thrive in bright and indirect sunlight. 3. Soil: Snake Plants require well-draining soil, so make sure the pot has drainage holes at the bottom. 4. Temperature: These plants prefer temperatures between 60 - 75\u00b0F (15 - 24\u00b0C). Keep them away from drafty areas and air conditioning vents. 5. Fertilizer: Snake Plants do not require much fertilizer but you can use a balanced houseplant fertilizer once a month during growing season. 6. Pruning: If the leaves of your Snake Plant get too tall and fall over, you can prune them back to keep the plant looking tidy. 7. Repotting: Snake Plants do not need to be repotted very often. You can repot them every 2-3 years, or when they outgrow their current pot."
