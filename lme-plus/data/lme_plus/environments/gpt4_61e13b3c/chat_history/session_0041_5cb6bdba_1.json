You can share them with me in any format you have them - a list, a spreadsheet, or even just a bunch of receipts.\n\nIf you don't have a list, don't worry! We can start from scratch. Just tell me about each purchase you remember making, and I'll help you categorize them.\n\nSome common expense categories include:\n\n* Gifts\n* Shopping (clothing, accessories, etc.)\n* Food (dining out, groceries, etc.)\n* Entertainment (movies, concerts, etc.)\n* Travel\n* Housing (rent, utilities, etc.)\n* Transportation (gas, parking, etc.)\n* Health and wellness (medical expenses, gym memberships, etc.)\n* Miscellaneous (pet expenses, home decor, etc.)\n\nLet's get started, and I'll help you organize your expenses into these categories!"
