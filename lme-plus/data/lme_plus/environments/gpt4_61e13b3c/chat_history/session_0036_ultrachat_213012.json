      "content": "There can be various reasons for the decrease in average household size in Tucum\u00e1n over the past decade. Some of the potential reasons include:\n\n1. Changing Demographics: Tucum\u00e1n's population has been steadily increasing over the past decade, and the city has seen a growth in the number of single-person households due to urbanization and migration. 2. Economic Factors: As Tucum\u00e1n has seen significant economic growth, an increasing number of households are becoming financially independent, leading to a decrease in the number of multi-generational and extended families. 3. Urbanization: As urbanization rates increase, people tend to live in smaller households, whether by choice or due to the availability of smaller housing units. 4. Declining Fertility Rates: As couples have fewer children, it can lead to smaller households over time. Overall, these factors can help explain the decrease in average household size in Tucum\u00e1n over the past decade. However, it is essential to note that this trend may not necessarily continue in the future, and other factors may come into play that can change household sizes."
