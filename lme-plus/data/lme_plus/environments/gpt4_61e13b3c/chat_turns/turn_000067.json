Here's a rundown of what you need to do to prepare for your colonoscopy on April 15th:\n\n**1. Diet Restrictions:**\nAbout 3-4 days before the procedure, start a low-fiber diet to help cleanse your colon. Avoid foods like:\n\t* Beans, peas, and legumes\n\t* Broccoli, cauliflower, and other cruciferous vegetables\n\t* Nuts, seeds, and popcorn\n\t* Whole grains, such as brown rice, whole wheat bread, and cereals\n\t* Raw fruits and vegetables with skins or seeds\n\t* Dairy products with seeds (e.g., strawberry yogurt)\n\nStick to:\n\t* Lean proteins like chicken, fish, and eggs\n\t* Refined grains like white rice, white bread, and plain crackers\n\t* Cooked fruits and vegetables without seeds or skins\n\t* Clear soups like chicken or vegetable broth\n\n**2. Bowel Prep:**\nYour doctor may prescribe a bowel prep medication, such as colonoscopy prep or colon cleanse, to take the day before the procedure. This will help flush out your colon. Follow the instructions carefully, and make sure to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.\n\n**3. Fluids:**\nDrink plenty of clear fluids, such as:\n\t* Water\n\t* Clear broths (e.g., chicken or vegetable broth)\n\t* Electrolyte-rich drinks like sports drinks (e.g., Gatorade)\n\t* Clear juices (e.g., apple, grape, or cranberry)\n\nAvoid:\n\t* Red or purple drinks, as they can interfere with the colonoscopy results\n\t* Carbonated drinks, like soda or sparkling water\n\n**4. Medications:**\nInform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and vitamins you're taking. You may need to stop certain medications or adjust dosages before the procedure.\n\n**5. Fasting:**\nYou'll need to fast for a certain period before the procedure, usually 6-8 hours. This means no food or drinks, including water, during this time.\n\n**6. Transportation:**\nArrange for someone to drive you home after the procedure, as you may be sedated or drowsy.\n\n**7. Confirm with Your Doctor:**\nDouble-check with your doctor or healthcare provider for any specific instructions or requirements tailored to your individual needs.\n\nRemember, it's essential to follow these instructions carefully to ensure a successful and comfortable colonoscopy. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.\n\nYou got this! Take a deep breath, and you'll be done before you know it.",
