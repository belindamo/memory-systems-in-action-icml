  "content": "CITGO operates three refineries in the United States, located in Lake Charles, Louisiana; Lemont, Illinois; and Corpus Christi, Texas. Each refinery has its own set of refining processes, but here are some of the main processes that go on at each facility:\n\n1. Lake Charles Refinery:\n* Atmospheric distillation: This is the first step in the refining process, where crude oil is heated and separated into different fractions based on their boiling points.\n* Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC): This process breaks down heavier fractions of crude oil into lighter, more valuable products such as gasoline and diesel fuel.\n* Alkylation: This process combines smaller molecules to form larger ones, creating high-octane gasoline components.\n* Hydrotreating: This process removes impurities from the gasoline and diesel fractions to improve their quality.\n1. Lemont Refinery:\n* Atmospheric distillation: As with the Lake Charles Refinery, this is the initial step in the refining process.\n* Delayed coking: This process breaks down heavy, residual oils into lighter products such as naphtha, diesel, and petroleum coke.\n* Hydrocracking: This process uses hydrogen and a catalyst to break down heavier fractions of crude oil into lighter, more valuable products.\n* Hydrotreating: This process is used to remove sulfur and other impurities from the gasoline and diesel fractions.\n1. Corpus Christi Refinery:\n* Atmospheric distillation: Again, this is the first step in the refining process.\n* Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC): As with the Lake Charles Refinery, this process is used to break down heavier fractions of crude oil into lighter, more valuable products.\n* Alkylation: This process combines smaller molecules to form larger ones, creating high-octane gasoline components.\n* Hydrocracking: This process is used to break down heavier fractions of crude oil into lighter, more valuable products.\n* Hydrotreating: This process removes impurities from the gasoline and diesel fractions to improve their quality.\n\nIt's worth noting that these are just some of the processes that take place at each refinery, and there may be others as well. Additionally, the specific refining processes used can vary depending on the type of crude oil being processed and the market demand for different petroleum products.",
