  "content": "There are several methods to control walnut webworms without harming beneficial insects:\n\n1. Natural predators: Encourage the presence of natural predators like birds, spiders, and wasps in the garden. These predators will feed on walnut webworms and help to control their population.\n\n2. Biological control: Biological control involves introducing natural enemies of walnut webworms into the garden. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a soil-dwelling bacterium, is a natural insecticide that only affects the larvae of lepidopteran insects, like walnut webworms, and has no harmful effects on beneficial insects.\n\n3. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spray: Bt spray can also be applied on the plants to kill the larvae. It is important to use Bt spray when the larvae are small and before they have created protective cocoons.\n\n4. Physical removal: Handpicking the larvae and cocoons by hand can also be an effective method of control.\n\n5. Cultural practices: Preventative cultural practices such as pruning affected branches and cleaning fallen leaves in the fall can help to reduce the population of walnut webworms.",
