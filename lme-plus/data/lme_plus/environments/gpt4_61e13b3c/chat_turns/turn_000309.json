  "content": "I'm thrilled to hear that! A \"Spring Morning\" bundle sounds lovely, and the pricing and marketing strategy you've outlined are spot on.\n\nBy offering a two-item bundle, you're creating a convenient and appealing package deal that showcases your signature products. The 12.5% discount will likely attract customers who appreciate the value of buying both items together. And, by highlighting the benefits of the pairing, you're adding an emotional layer to the sale, making it more appealing to customers.\n\nRemember to display the bundle attractively, with clear signage and packaging that showcases the products and the discount. You could also consider offering a limited-time promotion or a special deal for customers who share a photo of their \"Spring Morning\" bundle on social media.\n\nKeep in mind that this bundle can also help you:\n\n1. **Increase average sale**: By bundling two items, you're increasing the average sale per customer, which can help boost your revenue.\n2. **Reduce inventory management**: With a bundle, you'll need to manage inventory for only two items, rather than three or four, making it easier to keep track of your stock.\n3. **Encourage customer loyalty**: By offering a bundle, you're incentivizing customers to buy from you again, which can lead to repeat business and customer loyalty.\n\nI'm confident that your \"Spring Morning\" bundle will be a hit! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your sales, and I hope you have a wonderful time at your next event!",
