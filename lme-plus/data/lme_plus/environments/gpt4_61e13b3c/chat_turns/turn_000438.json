Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C).\n2. In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika (if using).\n3. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish and brush the mixture evenly onto both sides of the chicken.\n4. Place the chicken on the grill and cook for 5-7 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n5. Once cooked, let the chicken rest for 2-3 minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to oil the grates before grilling to prevent the chicken from sticking.\n* If you don't have a thermometer, you can check the chicken's doneness by cutting into the thickest part; it should be white and firm.\n* Letting the chicken rest before slicing will help the juices redistribute, making it more tender and juicy.\n* You can also add other seasonings or herbs to the mixture, such as dried thyme, oregano, or lemon zest, to give the chicken more flavor.\n\nThis recipe yields a deliciously moist and flavorful chicken breast that's perfect for sandwiches, salads, or wraps. You can also refrigerate or freeze the cooked chicken for later use.\n\nEnjoy your grilled chicken sandwich with hummus and carrot sticks!",
