  "content": "You're going to love those tacos! The Trailer Park and Democrat are two of the most popular tacos at Torchy's, and for good reason. And at Veracruz, the Migas Tacos and Carne Asada Tacos are both delicious and authentic options.\n\nRemember to arrive early, as both Torchy's and Veracruz can get busy, especially during peak hours. And don't be afraid to ask for recommendations or modifications to your order. The staff at both places are super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nAfter you've finished lunch, take a stroll around South Congress and explore the eclectic shops, galleries, and murals. You might even find some live music or street performers to add to the atmosphere.\n\nIf you have time, consider visiting the Continental Club, a legendary music venue on South Congress that's been hosting live music performances since 1955. Even if you're not catching a show, it's worth popping in to check out the iconic neon sign and soak up the atmosphere.\n\nHave a fantastic lunch and enjoy the rest of your day on South Congress!",
