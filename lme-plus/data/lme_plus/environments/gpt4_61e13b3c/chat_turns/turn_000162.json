ENGLAND FOOTBALL TEAM'S TRAINING GROUND - DAY\n\nGareth Southgate, the England football team manager, is sitting at his desk going through some paperwork when his assistant coach walks in.\n\nASSISTANT COACH: \"Boss, I've got some news for you. We've got a bit of a crisis on our hands.\"\n\nGARETH SOUTHGATE: \"What's happened?\"\n\nASSISTANT COACH: \"We've had a few injuries and illnesses, and we're running out of options for our next match. We need to call up someone who's never played for the national team before.\"\n\nGARETH SOUTHGATE: \"Who do we have?\"\n\nASSISTANT COACH: \"Chuba Akpom. He's been playing well for his club, and he's been on our radar for a while now.\"\n\nGARETH SOUTHGATE: \"I see. Alright, let's give him a call.\"\n\nThe assistant coach nods and heads out of the room to make the call. Gareth Southgate takes a deep breath and mentally prepares himself for the conversation.\n\nA few minutes later, the assistant coach returns with Chuba Akpom on the phone.\n\nGARETH SOUTHGATE: \"Hello, Chuba. This is Gareth Southgate, the manager of the England football team.\"\n\nCHUBA AKPOM: \"Hi, gaffer. It's an honor to speak with you.\"\n\nGARETH SOUTHGATE: \"Likewise, Chuba. I'm calling to let you know that we're in a bit of a crisis at the moment, and we need to call up some fresh blood for our next match.\"\n\nCHUBA AKPOM: \"I understand, gaffer.\"\n\nGARETH SOUTHGATE: \"I'm pleased to tell you that we've selected you to be part of the squad. This will be your first cap for the national team.\"\n\nCHUBA AKPOM: \"Wow, thank you so much, gaffer! I'm absolutely buzzing!\"\n\nGARETH SOUTHGATE: \"We're glad to have you on board, Chuba. I know this is a big moment for you, and you should be proud of yourself. We'll be in touch with more details about the squad and the match soon.\"\n\nCHUBA AKPOM: \"Thanks again, gaffer. I won't let you down.\"\n\nGARETH SOUTHGATE: \"I have no doubt about that. Good luck, Chuba.\"\n\nChuba Akpom hangs up the phone, beaming with excitement. Gareth Southgate leans back in his chair, feeling a sense of relief that the crisis has been averted. The assistant coach gives him a nod of approval, and the two of them get back to work, preparing the squad for their next match.",
