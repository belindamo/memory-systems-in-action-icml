  "content": "Yeah, I really enjoyed the workshop! My favorite part was when we learned the body isolations, specifically the chest and arm movements. It was challenging at first, but once I got the hang of it, I felt like I could really express the music. And, yeah, I'm definitely planning to continue exploring Afro-Cuban rhythms and dance styles. I've already started incorporating some of the moves I learned into my salsa dancing, and I'd love to take more classes or workshops in the future.",
