A pearl-specific cleaning kit with instructions will definitely help her feel more confident and empowered to keep the necklace looking its best.\n\nRemember to also consider including some general tips on pearl care, such as avoiding exposure to harsh chemicals, perfume, and extreme temperatures. And, of course, remind her to store the necklace separately from other jewelry to prevent scratching or tangling.\n\nBy taking these steps, you'll not only be giving your sister a thoughtful gift but also helping her develop good habits for caring for her jewelry. I'm sure she'll appreciate the thought and attention to detail you're putting into this gift.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope your sister enjoys the gift and takes great care of the pearl necklace!",
