  "content": "That's a great idea! A two-item bundle is a more manageable option, and it allows me to focus on a specific combination of products. I think I'll offer a \"Spring Morning\" bundle, which includes a lemon poppyseed muffin and a strawberry scone. I'll price it at $5.25, which is a 12.5% discount compared to buying each item individually. I'll also highlight the benefits of the pairing, such as \"Start your day with a sweet and savory combination\" to make it more appealing to customers. Thanks for the suggestion!",
