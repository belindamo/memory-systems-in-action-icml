  "content": "The Bullpen is a popular spot, especially on concert nights, so I'd highly recommend making a reservation if you can. They do take reservations for their patio area, which is where you'll want to sit to catch up and enjoy the pre-concert atmosphere.\n\nYou can make a reservation on their website or through a reservation platform like OpenTable. If you can't get a reservation, you can also try showing up early and putting your name on the waitlist. They usually have a waitlist system in place for busy nights like concert nights.\n\nKeep in mind that The Bullpen is a popular spot, so even with a reservation, you might have to wait a bit. But it's a fun atmosphere, and you can grab a drink at the bar while you wait.\n\nIf you do decide to show up without a reservation, be prepared for a potential wait, and plan accordingly. You might want to build in some extra time before the concert to account for any delays.\n\nAlso, be sure to let them know that you're planning to head to the concert afterwards, and they might be able to accommodate you with a quicker turnaround or recommend some quick and easy options for food.\n\nI hope that helps, and I'm sure you and Rachel will have a blast at The Bullpen and the Taylor Swift concert!",
