Here are some recommendations to consider:\n\n1. **Scissor-style clippers**: These are the most common type of nail clippers and are suitable for most dogs. They work by cutting the nail with a scissor-like action. Look for clippers with sharp blades and comfortable grips.\n2. **Guillotine-style clippers**: These clippers have a hole in the center that you place the nail in, and then squeeze to cut the nail. They're great for dogs with thicker or harder nails.\n3. **Nail trimmers with a safety stop**: These clippers have a built-in safety stop that prevents you from cutting the nail too short, which can be painful for your dog.\n\nWhen choosing nail clippers, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Size**: Make sure the clippers are suitable for Lola's nail size. Clippers come in various sizes, from small to large.\n* **Material**: Stainless steel or high-carbon steel clippers are durable and resistant to rust.\n* **Ergonomics**: Look for clippers with comfortable grips that fit your hand well, making it easier to trim Lola's nails.\n* **Reviews and ratings**: Check out reviews from other pet owners to get an idea of the clippers' performance and any potential issues.\n\nSome popular nail clipper brands include:\n\n* **Oster**: Known for their high-quality, durable clippers.\n* **Andis**: Offers a wide range of clippers, including scissor-style and guillotine-style.\n* **Furminator**: Yes, the same brand as the deshedding tool! They also offer a range of nail clippers.\n* **Resco**: A popular choice among pet owners, Resco clippers are known for their ease of use and effectiveness.\n\nFor a beginner, I'd recommend starting with a scissor-style clipper. They're easy to use and suitable for most dogs.\n\nRemember to always trim Lola's nails carefully and gradually, taking breaks to avoid causing her stress or discomfort. If you're unsure or uncomfortable trimming her nails yourself, consider consulting a veterinarian or professional groomer for guidance.",
