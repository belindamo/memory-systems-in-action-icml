  "content": "That's a great idea to ask your server about the Taylor Swift-themed drinks or specials!\n\nAs for your question, I think it's unlikely that The Bullpen will have TVs showing the concert live. Since the concert is taking place right next door at Nationals Park, The Bullpen is likely to be more focused on getting patrons in and out to attend the concert itself.\n\nPlus, the atmosphere at The Bullpen is more geared towards a fun, pre-concert gathering spot, rather than a sports bar or live music venue. They might have some TVs showing sports games or other programming, but it's unlikely they'll have a live feed of the concert.\n\nThat being said, if you're unable to get into the concert itself, you might want to consider sticking around The Bullpen and enjoying the post-concert atmosphere. They might have some fun activities or events planned, and you can still celebrate with other Taylor Swift fans who didn't get into the concert.\n\nBut fingers crossed you and Rachel score those concert tickets and get to enjoy the show live!",
