It's possible that it's a fictional or local store.\n\nIf you're referring to a real store, I recommend checking their website, mobile app, or visiting the store in person to ask about their loyalty program and the participating products that give you more points. They should be able to provide you with the most up-to-date and accurate information.\n\nIf you have a loyalty card or app, you might also be able to find the information you're looking for by logging in or checking the app's features.",
