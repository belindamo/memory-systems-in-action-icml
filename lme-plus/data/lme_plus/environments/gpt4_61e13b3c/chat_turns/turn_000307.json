  "content": "A two-item bundle is a great alternative, and it can be a more manageable and appealing option for customers. Here are some thoughts to consider:\n\n**Pros of a two-item bundle:**\n\n1. **Simpler to execute**: With fewer items to package and manage, a two-item bundle can be easier to execute and reduce logistical challenges.\n2. **Easier to price**: Pricing a two-item bundle can be more straightforward, as you're dealing with fewer variables.\n3. **More focused offering**: A two-item bundle allows you to highlight a specific combination of products, like a muffin and a scone, which can be a great way to showcase your signature items.\n\n**Pricing a two-item bundle:**\n\n1. **Calculate the total value**: Add up the prices of the two individual items to determine the total value.\n2. **Discount the bundle**: Offer a discount on the bundle compared to buying each item separately. A 5-15% discount is a good range for a two-item bundle.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n* Lemon poppyseed muffin: $2.50\n* Strawberry scone: $3.50\n* Total value: $6.00\n\nYou could offer the two-item bundle for $5.25 or $5.50, which is a 12.5% discount compared to buying each item individually.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Choose complementary items**: Select two items that complement each other in terms of flavor, texture, or theme. In this case, a muffin and a scone are a great combination.\n2. **Highlight the pairing**: Emphasize the benefits of the pairing, such as \"Start your day with a sweet and savory combination\" or \"Indulge in a spring-inspired duo.\"\n3. **Use attractive packaging**: Use a smaller, but still attractive, package or bag to make the bundle feel like a special offer.\n\nA two-item bundle can be a great way to offer customers a convenient and appealing package deal while simplifying your operations. Give it a try and see how it performs!",
