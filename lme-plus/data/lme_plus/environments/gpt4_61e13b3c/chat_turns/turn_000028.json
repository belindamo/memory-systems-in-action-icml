Her father was accused of being a traitor to the Communist Party and was publicly humiliated before his execution. Ye Wenjie was forced to hold a skeleton umbrella as a symbolic representation of her father's alleged crimes during the execution.\n\nLater in the series, Ye Wenjie is revealed to have used her scientific knowledge and expertise to make contact with an alien civilization, the Trisolarans, and invites them to invade Earth. The spinning skeleton umbrella comes to represent her remorse for her actions and her desire to make amends for the destruction she helped bring about.\"\n\nWhich is it?",
