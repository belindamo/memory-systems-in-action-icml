In fact, that's a great idea!\n\nConsider adding a column to your spreadsheet specifically for tracking expiration dates or deadlines for redeeming rewards. You can also set up reminders or notifications for yourself when rewards are approaching their expiration dates.\n\nSome ideas for columns to add to your spreadsheet:\n\n* Expiration Date: The date by which you need to redeem the reward\n* Reminder Date: A date a few days or weeks before the expiration date to remind you to redeem the reward\n* Reward Status: A column to track whether the reward has been redeemed or not\n* Notes: A column for any additional notes or comments about the reward, such as any restrictions or limitations\n\nBy keeping track of your rewards and their expiration dates, you can make sure you don't miss out on redeeming them and maximize the benefits of your loyalty programs.\n\nRemember, this is your spreadsheet, so feel free to customize it to fit your needs and preferences!",
