Making a reservation will definitely ensure that you and Rachel have a spot to grab a bite and catch up before the concert.\n\nAs for Taylor Swift-themed drinks or specials, I'd say it's highly likely that The Bullpen will have some fun offerings to get concert-goers in the mood! They're known for their creative cocktails and themed specials, and a Taylor Swift concert is the perfect excuse to get creative!\n\nYou might see drinks named after Taylor Swift songs or albums, like a \"Blank Space\" blackberry margarita or a \"Love Story\" sparkling cocktail. They might also offer special concert-themed food items, like \"Swiftie Sliders\" or \"T-Swift Tacos.\"\n\nKeep an eye on The Bullpen's social media accounts or website in the days leading up to the concert to see if they announce any special deals or promotions. They might even offer a \"Concert Package\" that includes a meal, drink, and priority entry to the patio area.\n\nEven if they don't have any specific Taylor Swift-themed drinks or specials, The Bullpen's regular menu is still a lot of fun, and you can always ask your server for a recommendation or a special request.\n\nI'm sure you and Rachel will have a blast at The Bullpen and the Taylor Swift concert!",
