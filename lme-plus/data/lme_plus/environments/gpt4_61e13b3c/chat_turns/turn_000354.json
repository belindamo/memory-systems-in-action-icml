Availability of housing: As urbanization and migration rise, governments and the private sector need to provide affordable housing to ensure a stable population in the city.\n\nJob Market:\n\n1. Skillset demand: Demographic change, such as aging population, could lead to changes in the skills required for workforces in Tucum\u00e1n. \n\n2.
