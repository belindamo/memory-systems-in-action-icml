Most of the places I mentioned have a great spot for grabbing drinks and catching up. Here are some specific recommendations:\n\n1. **The Bullpen**: They have a large outdoor patio area with plenty of seating and a fun atmosphere. It's perfect for grabbing a drink and catching up with your friend before the concert.\n2. **Bluejacket**: They have a spacious bar area with plenty of seating, and it's a great spot to grab a beer or cocktail and chat with your friend. Plus, you can take a peek at their brewery operations while you're there.\n3. **Gordon Biersch**: They have a large outdoor patio area with a fire pit, which is a great spot to relax and catch up with your friend. They also have a smaller bar area inside if you prefer.\n4. **The Salt Line**: They have a stylish bar area with a great selection of craft cocktails. It's a bit more upscale, but still a great spot to grab a drink and chat with your friend.\n\nIf you're looking for a more low-key spot, you could also consider **The Navy Yard's 'The Yards'** complex. They have a large outdoor plaza area with plenty of seating and a few bars and restaurants surrounding it. You could grab a drink at one of the bars and sit down in the plaza to catch up with your friend.\n\nAll of these spots are within walking distance of Nationals Park, so you can easily get to the concert venue after you're done catching up.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you and Rachel will have a blast at the Taylor Swift concert!",
