      "content": "Here is part 2\n\n-----\nWhat I have found is the easiest way to have a great day is by knowing what direction you are headed in and then taking what we call success steps small incremental and measurable steps on a daily basis. \n\nI teach a process called What\u2019s Different designed to maximize your efforts by eliminating external circumstances that block your path to achieving your chief aims\u2026I encourage you to use it on a daily basis\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s how it works\u2026Before you commit to a course of action IDENTIFY with the internal energy you want to mirror in your outer reality\u2026VISUALIZE the outcome that you are seeking\u2026IMAGINE what it will feel like when you realize the outcome\u2026REMEMBER what didn\u2019t work before Commit to a new way of seeing your actions and ANCHOR that memory by creating a new belief. \n\nThe status quo of your life has to change\u2026the habits of expecting how things have to go has to change \u2026your mindset has to change\u2026you have to uncover those old behaviors that have held you back and be willing to create a new possibility paradigm.\n\nWe call this living from momentum mindsets\u2026so that you begin to see what\u2019s possible rather than what\u2019s not.\n\nMomentum Mindsets are mindsets that encourage you to take risks, to discover your passions and to live from your adventurous spirit. It\u2019s a mindset that empowers you to know that you were born with an innate drive to have what you want in life rather than accepting something that is less than your true calling. \n\nYou have to be inspired in what your building towards in your life and this to has happen each day\u2026 in every moment\u2026 it\u2019s never about how busy you can be but rather how not to get ahead\u2026and to stay focused on the moment your in.\n\nBe present to what you to do today not tomorrow so the momentum you build upon will make your task tomorrow that much easier. \n\nI use a simple formula\u2026\nIntention\u2026creates attention\u2026causing momentum\u2026resulting in desired outcomes.\n\nPeople who have achieve great success in life simply think differently and you can think like them. Successful people have a disciplined approach to their day. They know what their next step will be. They are always in a solutions oriented mindset.\n\nI believe there are two kinds of mindsets\u2026\n\nFixed Mindset\u2026fixed resources\u2026fixed outcomes\u2026fixed thinking\nGrowth Mindset\u2026Momentum Mindsets are growth mindsets\n\nIt\u2019s important to have:A daily ritual that you can follow\u2026creating repetition and new mind muscle memory and a plan that will get you there\u2026\n\nDay Sculpting uses the latest innovations in the psychology of being successful, how the brain works to empower you and what it means to have a support system on a daily basis that will enable you to create powerful, productive and successful days.\n\nWhat we know about creating success is how important\u2026.in fact how it is a game changer\u2026 that you live your life one day at a time. When you do you are more present and available to what\u2019s seeking to emerge. You are less likely to get ahead of yourself and more likely to be fully present.\n\nIt is important to set intentions everyday so that you are always in the energy of creating your day the way you want it to play out.\n\nIt is important to understand the concept of Competing Commitments and how you can really learn how to streamline your day by being in the energy of what you want and being able to notice the distractions that have been habitual life stoppers so you can create a success oriented MindState.\n\nAnd how to specifically understand how neuro-chemistry can build new neuro pathways to support you in reaching your chief aims. And just what isThe Master Formula Of Attainment that\u2019s been understood for hundreds of years and how this works in your life.\n\nAn outcome for you when U experience DaySculpting is that you create Momentum Mindsets that inspire, encourage and empower you to take small steps each day to prove you can live the life you truly desire as you create new habits and new possibilities for you.\n\nRather than think you have to do it all at once when you take small manageable success steps that momentum build s momentum that empowers you to keep moving forward\u2026what we call forward momentum\u2026\n\nIn order to connect on a mental and emotional level to what you really want to create in your life you first have to clear out the sabotaging information and thoughts that are competing for your time and energy.\n\nWhen you Quiet The Mind from your Mrnytal MindTrap Chatter\u2026You clear a path for your intuition and inner wisdom to show up and guide you. You become a participant and not a spectator in your life and the flow of your creative energy is freed from old habits and conditioning. \n\nThe next concept we share is called The Law Of Reinforcement. What this means is that the more you do something and get a positive response the more likely you will continue to do that behavior.\n\nWe are always making choices and getting feedback. What if you were able to condition your mind and emotions to consistently choose what supports nurtures and empowers you each day? Wouldn\u2019t you be more likely to continue in those behaviors? \n\nThat\u2019s a key part of Day Sculpting\u2026Repetition, Positive Conditioning, Disciplined Actions and Increased Resiliency puts you in alignment and harmony with your highest purpose and your desired results follow.\n\nStudies have shown that most adult learners tend to give up after 3 tries to learn something new. And it takes a minimum of 10 tries before you believe it\u2019s something you can do. And then it takes 50 tries to get good at it. \nIt\u2019s not about a quick fix it\u2019s about building and sculpting your daily muscle of success and that takes time and work\u2026\n\nHow we relate to our potential future. Most people when they think about a future goal see the challenges, the obstacles, the gap between where they are now and where they would rather be. The mind then projects into that gap a sense of lack, limitation and fear that they might not be able to achieve it.\n\nThe result is that for most people the future is a place of uncertainty but for us the future is the fertile unknown, a place of emerging possibility. Our job is to connect into the pure creative imaginal realm that we were all born into when we came into this world.\n\nPeople who have created great works in the world had a special relationship with the pure imaginal realm. Edison, Einstein, Great Artists and Philosophers, leaders like MLK, Ghandi, and Mother Teresa. They were all bringing through them what was trying to emerge in the world.\n\nIn Day Sculpting we call this Future Pacing.\n\nWe talk about The Positive Feedback Loop\u2026This is a cool concept and vitally important in Day Sculpting. With a Positive Feedback Loop you are always noticing what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not.\n\nWhen something isn\u2019t working that\u2019s feedback that lets you know you need to stop doing it and do something different. When something is working, that\u2019s feedback that lets you know to keep doing more of it.\n\nAs you choose to follow the path the feedback gives you, you are continuously being guided towards your desired destination by forces that support your desire. It\u2019s like the game warmer warmer, hotter hotter.\n\nThe Positive Feedback Loop naturally clears out old habits, feelings of uncertainty, and competing commitments replacing them with a new mindset based around positive, inspired and successful choices that produce what it is you want in life.\n\nThe reason that this concept is so powerful can be understood by what we know about brain science. We know we have 2 very distinct brains inside of us. One is like the ultra rational scientist. It knows what\u2019s best for you and what you should be doing to make your life work. The other brain is like a Neanderthal and its only looking for immediate gratification, comfort and safety.\n\nThe part of your brain that switches between these two is called the Reticular Activating System. I\u2019ll just call it RAS.\nThe RAS is constantly bringing your attention to what\u2019s most important. When a competing commitment shows up the RAS needs to switch you to focus on what you truly desire, not just the distraction of short term gratification that causes you to avoid the greater success that your now ready to enjoy.\n\nThat\u2019s what Day Sculpting does naturally. It trains the Reticular Activating System, so that day by day, week by week, and month by month, you create the life you truly desire to live.\nSOME MORE STUFF FOR U MIKE\u2026\n\nIn our previous videos, we shared with you the principles of the positive feedback loop, the Master Formula of Attainment, Competing Commitments, Law of Reinforcement, the concept of Connecting, Momentum Mindsets in which intention creates attention causing momentum and desired outcomes, the concrete indicators of success, the reticular activating system, growth and fixed mindsets, repetition, positive conditioning, disciplined actions, and increased resiliency, future pacing, and overcoming our built in immunity to change.\n\n---\nwhen done ask me for the final part, part 3"
