You can easily check your chain's condition by inspecting it visually and manually. Look for signs of wear, such as rust, corrosion, or dryness.

If you're unsure, you can always consult your bike's manual or take it to a local bike shop for a professional inspection.\n\nBefore your longer ride this weekend, make sure to give your bike a quick once-over to ensure everything is in good working order. Check your tire pressure, brake pads, and quick releases, and make any necessary adjustments.
