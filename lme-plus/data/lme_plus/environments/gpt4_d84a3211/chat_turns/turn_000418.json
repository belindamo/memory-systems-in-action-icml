  "content": "\"The Haunting of Hill House\" has a total of 2 seasons, and the series has been completed. The show's creator, Mike Flanagan, had always envisioned the story as a self-contained, 2-season narrative, and Netflix agreed to this approach.\n\n**Season 1:**\n\n* Released on October 12, 2018\n* 10 episodes\n* Focuses on the Crain family's experiences in Hill House and the long-term effects it had on their lives\n\n**Season 2:**\n\n* Released on December 24, 2019\n* 9 episodes\n* Titled \"The Haunting of Bly Manor\", it's a new story with a different location and characters, but still explores similar themes of trauma, grief, and the supernatural\n* Based on Henry James' works, particularly \"The Turn of the Screw\"\n\nMike Flanagan has stated that he's proud of the complete story they've told and has no plans to continue the series beyond the two seasons. The show's conclusion is well-received by both critics and audiences, providing a sense of closure for the characters and storylines.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a completed series with a clear beginning, middle, and end, \"The Haunting of Hill House\" is an excellent choice!",
