  "content": "a) BS-2 (Bharat Stage 2) and BS-3 (Bharat Stage 3) are both emission standards set by the Indian government to regulate the amount of pollutants emitted by vehicles. BS-3 engines emit less pollutants than BS-2 engines due to the use of advanced emission control technologies such as improved fuel injection, better combustion and exhaust gas recirculation.\n\nb) White smoke during start-up is usually caused by coolant or water entering the combustion chamber. This can be caused by a head gasket leak or a cracked engine block. To prevent this, the engine should be inspected for any leaks or damage before it is started.\n\nc) DTSI (Digital Twin Spark Ignition) is a technology used in motorbikes that utilizes twin spark plugs to improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions. The twin spark plugs ensure a more complete combustion of the fuel-air mixture, resulting in better fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.\n\nd) A panhard rod, also known as a track bar, is a suspension component used in vehicles to prevent lateral movement of the axle during cornering. It is commonly used in solid axle suspension systems.\n\ne) Calorific value is the amount of energy released per unit of fuel when it is burned. The calorific value of petrol is around 44.4 MJ/kg.\n\nf) Anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a safety feature in vehicles that prevents the wheels from locking up during hard braking, which helps to maintain steering control and prevent skidding.\n\ng) Air-fuel ratio is the ratio of air to fuel in the combustion chamber. If a spark plug deposits black soot, it may indicate a rich air-fuel mixture, meaning there is more fuel than air in the combustion chamber.\n\nh) Firing order is the sequence in which the cylinders of an engine fire. The firing order of an opposed four-cylinder engine is typically 1-4-3-2.\n\ni) The basic purpose of a four-wheel drive system is to provide power to all four wheels of a vehicle, improving traction and stability in low-traction conditions such as snow, mud, and off-road terrain.\n\nj) Automobile tires are black in color due to the addition of carbon black, a reinforcing filler that improves the strength and durability of the tire. The black color also helps to dissipate heat generated by friction between the tire and the road.",
