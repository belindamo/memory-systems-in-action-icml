A bike rack will indeed make it much easier to transport your bike, and you'll be able to explore new trails and roads without worrying about how to get your bike there.\n\nWhen planning your trip, don't forget to research the bike trails and roads in the area to ensure they're suitable for your skill level and bike type. You might also want to check the weather forecast and road conditions beforehand to ensure you're prepared for any conditions you might encounter.\n\nAdditionally, consider packing a basic toolkit, a spare tube, and a pump or CO2 cartridges, so you're prepared for any minor mechanical issues that might arise. And, of course, don't forget to bring your helmet, gloves, and any other safety gear you need.\n\nIt's great that you're planning ahead, and I'm sure you'll have an amazing time on your road trip and bike adventures!",
