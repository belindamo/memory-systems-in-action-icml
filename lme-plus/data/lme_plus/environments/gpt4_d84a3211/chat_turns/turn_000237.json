Investing in a good quality set can make a huge difference in your work. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Look for these key features:**\n\n1. **Natural hair or synthetic fibers**: Natural hair (sable, mongoose, or squirrel) brushes hold a lot of water and pigment, while synthetic fibers mimic the performance of natural hair at a lower price point.\n2. **Variety of brush shapes and sizes**: A good set should include a range of round, flat, and mop brushes in different sizes to cover various techniques and effects.\n3. **Durable construction**: Look for brushes with securely attached ferrules (the metal band that holds the bristles in place) and comfortable, balanced handles.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Winsor & Newton Cotman Watercolors Brush Set**: A popular, affordable option with a range of natural and synthetic fibers. ( around $50-$70)\n2. **Daniel Smith Watercolor Brush Set**: A high-quality set with a focus on natural fibers and a range of unique brush shapes. (around $100-$150)\n3. **Holbein Watercolor Brush Set**: A Japanese brand known for their high-quality, synthetic fiber brushes that mimic natural hair performance. (around $80-$120)\n4. **Schmincke Horadam Watercolor Brush Set**: A German brand offering high-end, natural fiber brushes with a focus on durability and performance. (around $150-$250)\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider investing in a smaller, travel-sized set (e.g., 5-10 brushes) to start, and then expand your collection as needed.\n* Look for sets that include a storage case or container to keep your brushes organized and protected.\n* If you're new to watercolor, consider starting with a more affordable set and upgrading as you become more comfortable with the medium.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect watercolor brush set to inspire your creativity!",
