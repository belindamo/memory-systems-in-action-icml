However, generally, low to moderate-intensity activities, such as walking or light cycling, may be suitable for individuals with respiratory conditions. Yoga and stretching may also help improve lung capacity, increase body awareness and decrease stress levels. However, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider before starting a new exercise program, particularly if you are experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or wheezing. Your provider or a certified fitness professional, such as a personal trainer or physical therapist, may be able to suggest other exercises or modifications that are safe and appropriate for your specific condition. It is crucial to listen to your body and avoid overexertion, particularly if you are experiencing symptoms such as shortness of breath. It is always better to start gradually, listen to your body and stop immediately in case you feel uncomfortable.",
