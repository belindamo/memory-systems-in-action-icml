  "content": "Yes, it's important to wear sunscreen even if you are mostly indoors during the winter. Although the UVB rays that cause sunburn are weaker during the winter months, the UVA rays that cause premature aging and skin damage are still present year-round, even on cloudy days. Additionally, windows can filter out UVB rays, but they still allow UVA rays to penetrate, which means you can still be exposed to harmful rays even if you are inside. Therefore, it's important to wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day, regardless of the season or your activities.",
