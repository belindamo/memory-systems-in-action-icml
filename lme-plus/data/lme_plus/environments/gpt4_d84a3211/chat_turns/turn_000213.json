But I can suggest a few ways to find the nearest coffee shops:\n\n1. **Google Maps**: You can open Google Maps on your phone or computer and type \"coffee shops near me\" or \"coffee near my location.\" Google will show you the nearest coffee shops along with their addresses, ratings, and directions.\n2. **Coffee Shop Chain Websites**: If you have a favorite coffee shop chain, you can visit their website and use their store locator feature. For example, if you're looking for The Daily Grind, you can visit their website and enter your location to find the nearest store.\n3. **Yelp**: Yelp is a great platform to find and discover local businesses, including coffee shops. You can search for \"coffee shops near me\" or \"best coffee shops in [your city]\" and filter the results by rating, distance, and more.\n4. **Ask Siri or Google Assistant**: If you have a smart speaker or virtual assistant, you can ask Siri or Google Assistant to find the nearest coffee shops near your location.\n\nRegarding your rewards card, congrats on getting close to earning a free drink at The Daily Grind! You're just two stamps away from redeeming your reward. Make sure to check the expiration date and any terms and conditions associated with the rewards program.\n\nLet me know if you need any more help or have any other questions!",
