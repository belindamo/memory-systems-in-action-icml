I'd be happy to help you find a good deal on business class flights.\n\nFirstly, $3,300 for a business class ticket on Japan Airlines is a decent price, but it's definitely possible to find cheaper options. Here are a few tips to help you find a better deal:\n\n1. **Be flexible with your travel dates**: Prices can vary greatly depending on the day of the week and time of year. If you have flexibility in your travel plans, you may be able to find cheaper flights on off-peak days.\n2. **Compare prices across airlines**: Japan Airlines is a great option, but other airlines like ANA, Delta, American Airlines, and United also operate business class flights to Tokyo. Compare prices across airlines to find the best deal.\n3. **Use flight comparison tools**: Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Kayak allow you to compare prices across multiple airlines and find the best deals.\n4. **Consider error fares**: Keep an eye out for error fares, which are mistake prices that airlines list for a short period of time. These fares can be significantly cheaper than usual, but be aware that the airline may cancel the ticket if they realize their mistake.\n5. **Look for sales and promotions**: Airlines often offer sales and promotions, especially during off-peak seasons. Follow your preferred airlines on social media or sign up for their email newsletters to stay informed.\n6. **Use your miles**: If you have accumulated miles or points, consider using them to book a business class ticket or upgrade from economy.\n\nHere are a few examples of business class flights to Tokyo that I found:\n\n* ANA: $2,800 - $3,200 (depending on the route and travel dates)\n* Delta: $2,900 - $3,400\n* American Airlines: $3,000 - $3,500\n* United: $2,900 - $3,400\n\nKeep in mind that prices may vary depending on your departure city, travel dates, and availability.\n\nTo give you a better idea of prices, could you please provide me with more information about your travel plans? For example:\n\n* Departure city\n* Travel dates (or a range of dates you're considering)\n* Preferred airlines (if any)\n\nI'd be happy to help you find a better deal on business class flights to Tokyo!",
